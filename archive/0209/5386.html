<p>
(Here's a little document I once sent a venture capitalist of my acquaintance... 
<br>
those of you who've met him probably won't have a hard time guessing who.)
<br>
<p>-- (On an analogy between evolutionary psychology and venture capital:)
<br>
<p>The basis for the analogy is that both evolutionary psychology and venture
<br>
capital are about incremental change - not in the sense that revolutions
<br>
aren't allowed, but in the sense that any given revolution has to be
<br>
achievable in four to six years, maximum, to get venture funding.  Both
<br>
evolutionary psychology and venture capital try to tear their practioners'
<br>
minds away from the beautiful endpoints and make us ask, not whether B is
<br>
more wonderful than A, but whether there exists an incremental path from A
<br>
to B where each step along the path is an immediate improvement.  I think
<br>
that evolutionary psychologists as a group have gotten a bit farther in
<br>
training people to think incrementally than venture capitalists as a group
<br>
(present company excepted), but this may just be because I know more about
<br>
evolutionary psychology than about venture capital.  Anyway, I'm going to
<br>
take the EP way of seeing incremental change and apply it to venture capital
<br>
in one specific instance, and you can tell me whether the analogy breaks
<br>
down.
<br>
<p>One of the really major developments I think we could see in the next few
<br>
years is the convergence of wireless devices, wearable computing and Segway
<br>
Ginger mindreading technology.  The Segway Ginger reads tiny, subtle shifts
<br>
in your balance, reconstructs what your mind is telling your body, and makes
<br>
the Ginger behave like a part of your body.  When you're riding a Ginger, it
<br>
feels like a subjective extension of your body; they reverse-engineered the
<br>
human sense of balance and extended it.  (In my opinion, the Ginger is the
<br>
greatest innovation in user interface design since Xerox PARC created the
<br>
GUI.  We live in a strange world where an invention like Ginger opens up an
<br>
entire new area of design space for human-computer interaction and everyone
<br>
thinks it's a revolution in urban transportation.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, one consequence of a Ginger-wireless-wearable revolution could be a
<br>
world where your personal wearables track your gaze, read tiny muscular
<br>
shifts in your facial muscles, and deduce what you're looking at and what
<br>
you want from it.  For example, if you look at a chair while walking toward
<br>
it, this should provide enough information for a convergent
<br>
Ginger-wearable-wireless world to command the chair to slide out from the
<br>
table and let you sit down.  This is possible in a purely wearable-wireless
<br>
world, but you'd trigger a lot of chairs accidentally, the same way that we
<br>
currently set off automatic doors if we walk too close to them.
<br>
Ginger-wearable-wireless convergence will enable a wide variety of
<br>
applications that are dependent on reading the intentions of the user, maybe
<br>
in ways that approach the total subjective integration of a Ginger.
<br>
<p>Now it seems to me that &quot;Business 2.0&quot; or &quot;Wired&quot; would stop at this point,
<br>
having presented the amazing vision of a world that magically responds to
<br>
our desires (though they'd probably go on for a lot longer about the vision
<br>
as such).  But I think the Ginger-wireless-wearable convergence is not only
<br>
sexy, but actually plausible as a real-world outcome once wearable wireless
<br>
gets going; Ginger-wireless-wearable is not only &quot;adaptive&quot; but
<br>
&quot;evolvable&quot;.  Why?  Well, let me beg your indulgence as I construct an
<br>
extended analogy between evolution and venture capital...
<br>
<p>One of the things I didn't get a chance to discuss explicitly in the current
<br>
draft of &quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot; is the way that
<br>
interdependent subsystems filter themselves out evolutionarily from confused
<br>
mechanisms that try and do everything at once.  For example, &quot;Levels of
<br>
Organization&quot; distinguishes between hardwired sensory modalities and learned
<br>
perceptual concepts.  But how did we evolve the ability to form learned
<br>
perceptual concepts?  For learned concepts to be adaptive, you need to link
<br>
acquired perceptual categories to optimization of behavior, which takes
<br>
reinforcement learning.  But what good is reinforcement learning before the
<br>
system can acquire perceptual categories?  And what good are perceptual
<br>
categories without reinforcement learning?
<br>
<p>One solution is that behavioral reinforcement can be adaptive even in the
<br>
absence of learned perceptual categories - the evolutionary precursor of
<br>
reinforcement could have been a circuit that &quot;tuned&quot; an instinct based on
<br>
environmental input.  This circuit is adaptive if the environmental
<br>
condition is variable over evolutionary time, but more or less persistent
<br>
over the life of organism.  Once a single reinforcement circuit of this type
<br>
existed, it would open up the design space for &quot;tunable instincts&quot; - the
<br>
incremental elaboration of more finely tunable instincts would be both
<br>
possible and adaptive.  Eventually, the process would cross the line into
<br>
the creation of de novo &quot;instincts&quot; - acquired perceptual categories linked
<br>
to optimization of behavior by reinforcement learning.  Once learned
<br>
complexity is systemically distinguished from hardwired complexity, there is
<br>
design pressure to sort out the sensory modaliites that reflect
<br>
environmental invariants from concept-formation brainware that reflects
<br>
classes of environmental regularities.  (If you haven't read &quot;Levels of
<br>
Organization&quot; yet and that all sounded like complete gibberish, I
<br>
apologize.)
<br>
<p>In summary, the first beginnings of neural circuitry probably conflated
<br>
feature structure (sensory modalities), category structure (learned
<br>
concepts), and event structure (goal-oriented behavior), into circuitry that
<br>
served all three functions at once.  Evolution can't create systems that
<br>
aren't incrementally adaptive; each neural circuit has to be *immediately*
<br>
useful to the organism or the circuit won't evolve.  Evolution can't create
<br>
a visual cortex in anticipation of adding visual categories and behavioral
<br>
reinforcement later on.  The first neural circuits must sense, categorize,
<br>
and react all at once.  But, once these first circuits exist, the
<br>
evolutionary elaboration of the circuitry tends to differentiate the
<br>
functionality into modular subsystems.
<br>
<p>Now, what does this have in common with venture capital?  To start with,
<br>
there's a loose analogy between evolution having to come up with an
<br>
adaptation that works *right away*, and a startup having to come up with a
<br>
product that can be manufactured *now* and has an existing market.  As far
<br>
as I can tell, these forms of thinking are both very hard for humans to
<br>
learn because of the innate human tendency to be seduced by the goal instead
<br>
of the pathway.  Unlike venture capital, though, evolutionary psychology has
<br>
a precise population-genetics theory of incremental change, with plenty of
<br>
specific examples, to hammer the student's mind into the shape required; and
<br>
moreover, evolutionary psychology doesn't make you learn the ropes in the
<br>
middle of a marketing frenzy with millions of dollars at stake.  This is why
<br>
it seems to me - from my admittedly loose acquaintance with venture capital
<br>
- that evolutionary psychologists have mastered incremental thinking at a
<br>
higher level of precision than prevails in venture-capital culture today.
<br>
(Present company again excepted.)
<br>
<p>So it's possible that learning evolutionary psychology and neo-Darwinian
<br>
population genetics might help venture capitalists or startup leaders learn
<br>
how to focus on incremental paths and distentangle themselves from seductive
<br>
end-goals - at least in those cases where the venture capitalists or startup
<br>
leaders are techies who can easily learn the science involved, and the
<br>
important point is hammering away at that emotional attachment to end-goal
<br>
thinking.  But I think the analogy runs deeper than this; I think
<br>
evolutionary psychology's way of seeing incremental pathways can be directly
<br>
applied to venture capital.
<br>
<p>Let's go back to the alleged convergence of Ginger mindreading, wireless
<br>
communication, and wearable gadgetry.  Looking at this futuristic scenario
<br>
through the special lens of evolutionary psychology, it seems to me not only
<br>
sexy, but also evolvable.  In the beginning of the wearable revolution,
<br>
manufacturers will build wearable gadgets that combine the functions of
<br>
accepting user input and carrying out some useful behavior.  But the
<br>
wearable revolution is also the wireless revolution.  Once you build a
<br>
gadget M that accepts user input and performs a behavior, someone else can
<br>
build a gadget N which relies on wireless information from M's user input
<br>
and carries out N's special behavior, or someone can build a gadget O that
<br>
provides a different user interface commanding M's behavior.  The next step
<br>
is to dispense with M and buy N and O separately.
<br>
<p>In the beginning of the wearables era, people will need to build gadgets
<br>
that both accept user input and do something useful - but once everyone has
<br>
those combined gadgets, if it's a wearable *wireless* revolution, the
<br>
gadgets will start to sort themselves out into &quot;accepters of user input&quot; and
<br>
&quot;implementers of functions&quot;.  Once you're wearing any gadget, anywhere, that
<br>
accepts a general kind of user input, there's a market for a pure
<br>
function-implementer that relies on an existing gadget for user input.  Once
<br>
you're wearing any gadget, anywhere, that implements a function, there's a
<br>
market for a specialized gadget that takes over the job of getting user
<br>
inputs.  Eventually, the user-input-accepters and function-implementers may
<br>
become completely different gadgets.
<br>
<p>I think the integration of Ginger mindreading functionality into wireless
<br>
wearables will be the incremental result of accumulating more and more
<br>
specialized gadgets that read more and more information from the user.  In
<br>
turn, these mindreading gadgets open up the design space for more and more
<br>
useful functions that depend on mindreading.  There is a fairly precise
<br>
analogy between the way I'm proposing that all-in-one wireless wearables
<br>
will open up the design space for specialized interdependent wireless
<br>
wearables, and the example I gave earlier for how all-in-one neural circuits
<br>
open up the design space for interdependent brain subsytems.  One might even
<br>
argue that the shift to wireless communication in  devices is analogous to
<br>
the shift to nervous systems in body plans, but this doesn't feel to me like
<br>
a strong analogy, although it might be a good marketing point as long as
<br>
you're marketing to evolutionary biologists.
<br>
<p>Okay, so there's an interesting evolutionary analogy for one possible
<br>
scenario in the development of the wireless wearable industry.  Is this
<br>
analogy actually useful to venture capitalists?  Does it help someone build
<br>
a profitable company?  I'm going to try and take the argument a bit farther,
<br>
but at this point, I'm taking leave of my area of expertise completely, so
<br>
feel free to zap me if I say anything really silly.
<br>
<p>One prediction of the evolutionary analogy is that the wireless wearable
<br>
revolution is more likely to actually happen, and that it is more likely to
<br>
be exciting when it happens.  It says that this revolution has more than a
<br>
gloriously sexy vision of the endpoint; it also has an incremental path for
<br>
getting there, where each success by one company will open the door to
<br>
further successes.  I'm not sure we'll ever see a repeat of the dot-com
<br>
frenzy, since I don't think people are going to let valuations get that
<br>
fluffy again, but there could still be a more restrained wireless frenzy in
<br>
a few years.  And if wireless devices begin to interoperate the way I
<br>
expect, it suggests to me that that there will be a lot of acquisitions
<br>
going on in this field.  So if you fund a wireless wearable company today,
<br>
and their gadget does something that could make a nice component in someone
<br>
else's integrated wearable system, then there's a decent chance the startup
<br>
will mature during an industry frenzy and get snapped up by another company
<br>
even if it isn't strong enough to go IPO.
<br>
<p>Of course, evolutionary psychology also teaches us that there can easily be
<br>
an appealing incremental path that just doesn't get taken - I can argue that
<br>
the potential exists for a certain kind of wireless frenzy, but I don't know
<br>
whether the industry will actually go there.  Another thing that the
<br>
evolutionary ecology and the business ecology have in common is that their
<br>
histories are composed of what actually did happen, not what should have
<br>
happened or could have happened (another way of thinking that's hard for
<br>
humans to learn).  As I'm not actually joining a wireless wearables startup,
<br>
I have no reason to get stuck on this particular vision of the future.
<br>
<p>But let's try and extend the analogy even further.  Supposing that the
<br>
wireless frenzy occurs as described above, let's apply incremental thinking
<br>
to ask what past or present industry the wireless wearable industry will
<br>
most resemble.  Someone marketing a wireless startup would undoubtedly make
<br>
suggestive analogies between wireless computing and the meteoric rise of the
<br>
Internet, but is this a strong analogy?  Does building one website make it
<br>
easier for someone else to make another website because of functional
<br>
interdependence?  This happens occasionally, but not very often.  This was
<br>
the big flaw in the &quot;Internet portal&quot; theory - the portal fad was based on a
<br>
fundamental misunderstanding of Internet ontology.  Packaging a lot of
<br>
stores into a mall only makes things easier if you're building a *physical*
<br>
mall and people have to travel to a physical location.  Everything in
<br>
Internet space is exactly one URL away from wherever you are.  In Internet
<br>
space, the inherent pressure isn't toward putting everything in one
<br>
convenient place, but toward differentiation into a lot of specialized sites
<br>
that do one thing very well.  This trend only reverses when there's a rare
<br>
synergy between two sites.  The really big portals like Yahoo! have
<br>
accumulated enough coincidental synergy to keep going, but most portals
<br>
added no value and flopped.  They were built to appeal to venture
<br>
capitalists and stock buyers, not Internet users.  Similarly, giving away
<br>
product to build &quot;market share&quot; again rests on a misunderstanding of
<br>
Internet ontology - &quot;market share&quot; is a kind of inertia, and the Internet
<br>
tends toward inertialessness.  When I want to buy something online, I use
<br>
MySimon or Yahoo! Shopping or NexTag to find the current lowest price; I
<br>
have no reason to shop at the places I've shopped before.
<br>
<p>So what's the ontology of wireless gadgets?  Two other obvious analogies,
<br>
aside from the Internet, would be (a) the consumer software market and (b)
<br>
Apple's failed attempt at OpenDoc applications built from combinatorial
<br>
components.  The reason OpenDoc never took off, IMHO, was that developers
<br>
just found it easier to develop their own software than to use someone
<br>
else's - the &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome combined with the programmatic
<br>
difficulties of reusable components.  The same holds true with the consumer
<br>
software market; there are a few major applications that need to
<br>
communicate, but the overall tendency is to integrate more and more
<br>
functions into the same piece of software, and there's nothing to stop
<br>
developers from doing so.
<br>
<p>The same thing could happen to the wireless wearable industry.  Sharing
<br>
functionality could just be too hard on a software level (a la OpenDoc).
<br>
Manufacturers could find it easier to build everything into one gadget, or
<br>
sell a suite of integrated gadgets that work well together but don't work
<br>
with anything else (a la consumer applications).  These are both ways that
<br>
the wireless revolution could turn out very differently from the picture I
<br>
sketched earlier.  But since the wireless revolution is also the wearable
<br>
revolution, another possibility is that conserving space, conserving weight,
<br>
and conserving the manufacturing cost of physical gadgetry will create a
<br>
strong pressure toward reusing the functionality you're already wearing.
<br>
<p>There's another industry where pressure to reuse existing functionality is
<br>
strong, and it's not the dot-com industry or the consumer software industry;
<br>
it's the enterprise business software industry.  It looks to me like those
<br>
forces which I expect to operate in the wireless industry are the ones
<br>
already operating in the enterprise software industry.  There's the same
<br>
balance between the real need to be interoperable with other players'
<br>
products as a selling point, and the temptation to be interoperable only
<br>
with your own products to force people to buy whole suites.  There are
<br>
standards issues and compatibility issues, but in enterprise software,
<br>
companies sometimes manage to build products that work together despite it
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>So to me this suggests that you could look at the really successful players
<br>
in the enterprise software market, ask how they got that way, then invest in
<br>
wireless companies that look poised to follow a similar path today.
<br>
Unfortunately I have no idea who today's big players in enterprise software
<br>
are, or what they looked like as startups, but that's the result I get when
<br>
I pursue the line of reasoning to its conclusion.  One could also suggest to
<br>
wireless startup leaders that they study up on the past history and present
<br>
rules of the enterprise software market, or better yet, you could look for a
<br>
wireless startup with management experience in marketing enterprise
<br>
software. (And no, I don't know offhand of any wireless startups like that.)
<br>
<p>Of course, the complete analogy is a long line of reasoning involving
<br>
several chained dependencies.  There is a known (and studied) human tendency
<br>
to overestimate conjunctive probabilities; even if each step in a line of
<br>
reasoning is highly probable, the net probability of everything happening as
<br>
described may still be relatively small; humans, even experts, are likely to
<br>
intuitively overestimate the probability in such a case.  A strong argument
<br>
would list more than one possible incremental path to the same end result,
<br>
and would try to demonstrate that the paths are convergent attractors, where
<br>
the industry will settle back into the groove even if perturbed.
<br>
Unfortunately, there's no reason why the future should be that predictable,
<br>
even in retrospect.  If there's a &quot;strong argument&quot; for
<br>
Ginger-wearable-wireless, as opposed to a &quot;plausibility argument&quot;, my
<br>
present knowledge of wireless wearables and venture capital is too meager to
<br>
find it.  Then again, even the entire chain of logic from wireless gadget
<br>
differentiation to the enterprise software analogy still seems less tenuous
<br>
than a lot of arguments I heard during the dot-com era - though of course it
<br>
may be unfair to judge the startup industry by its frothiest moments.
<br>
<p>What I'd really like to do at this point is apply a seed AI perspective and
<br>
figure out some way that venture capital can take larger strides through the
<br>
fitness landscape instead of being limited to incremental steps of four to
<br>
six years.  Unfortunately, the main thing I can think of offhand would be
<br>
some way to move faster from collecting the venture fund to making the
<br>
actual investments, or some way of not collecting the committed funds until
<br>
the investments are ready - freeing up the venture fund's lifespan so that
<br>
more lifespan is available to startups.  But that's all I can think of at
<br>
the moment and it seems likely that venture funds are doing that already, so
<br>
I guess the long-term stuff will go on being handled by individual
<br>
investors.
