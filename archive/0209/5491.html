<em>&gt; Well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree; that is, if you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;scarcity based&quot; / &quot;zero sum&quot; / &quot;selfish&quot; thinking is so deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ingrained in &quot;human nature&quot; that technology is the only way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome it.  I have seen it being transcended in individual cases and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in small circles of people; and I suspect it can even happen to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree in certain subcultures (early hippie movement, rave culture).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I am not at all (yet) convinced it hasn't been transcended (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absent to begin with) in other or past cultures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may turn out to be right, but then again this may be an issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where self-fulfilling-prophecy / placebo effects are significant.

&quot;Technology is the only way to overcome it&quot; would be an overstatement.
<br>

<br>
However, it does seem pretty clear to me that
<br>

<br>
a) technology is on a path of exponential acceleration
<br>

<br>
b) spiritual advancement of humanity is not
<br>

<br>
Could b) undergo some kind of threshold effect that would allow it to
<br>
overtake a) ?
<br>

<br>
Sure, it's not impossible.  But unfortunately, I see no reason to believe
<br>
this, other than wishful thinking.
<br>

<br>
The &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect posited by New Agers for some time, has yet to
<br>
be observed en masse..
<br>

<br>
I agree that it would be BETTER if humanity drastically improved itself
<br>
mentally, emotionally and spiritually before launching the Singularity.  I'm
<br>
just doubting that's how it's gonna go down...
<br>
