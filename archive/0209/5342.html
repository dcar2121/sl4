<p>Given my outlook on the Singularity, it is mostly a numbers game.  
<br>
Because someone has to create the Singularity, some people end up being 
<br>
worth more than your average human because if you killed some or all of 
<br>
them the Singularity wouldn't happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is also the small matter of shaping both the Singularity and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to insure, to the extent we can, the best outcome.  This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply quantifiable.  Nor again, do I believe creating a Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence is sufficient to solve everything.
</em><br>
<p>I still don't think that this will be an issue.  If we have a Friendly 
<br>
Singularity, some Friendly means of transition will be employed.  This, 
<br>
for example, might be the angels in Mike Deering's story.  I don't know 
<br>
what would work best nor what would be most Friendly.  This is something 
<br>
that the first FAI or the Transition Guide that it creates will handle.  
<br>
I'm not shirking responsibility for seeing to it that humans are 
<br>
transitioned to the Singularity, only that I am not going to be able to 
<br>
make the decision of how to transition humans because by that point an 
<br>
SI will be in town.
<br>
<p>Anyway, if we have a safe Singularity where humans get a happy ending 
<br>
then I think that humans will be transitioned in a friendly manner 
<br>
regardless of their current state.  But, you clearly disagree with me 
<br>
squarely on this issue, since you seem to think that a super intelligent 
<br>
Transition Guide will still not be capable of transitioning the average 
<br>
human into the Singularity.  Why do you consider this to be the case?  
<br>
In what ways will the Transition Guide fail when dealing with normative 
<br>
humans?
