<em>&gt; &gt; Saying software tech hasn't progressed because it hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressed in *your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; directions of choice* is like saying hardware tech hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressed because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it hasn't moved substantially toward massively parallel computing...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all and I am surprised at such an empty dismissal from you.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have seen studies that say that a team of good Lisp coders can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get 20 times more done than a comparably good team in Java, C++
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or C# in equal time.  If this is even approximately true then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any savvy project should forget about *popular* languages and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grab such an overwhelming advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who are you kidding about the importance of vidual debuggers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ones for Java and such are just not that good, certainly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as general or powerful as facilities in Smalltalk and Lisp for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite some time.

<p><p>Apparently we disagree on many issues regarding programming languages and
<br>
software.
<br>
<p>Metrics are much fuzzier and vaguer in software than in hardware; there's no
<br>
really clear way to compare two programming l
<br>
languages.
<br>
<p>There are very smart and experienced people who claim that &quot;X is the best
<br>
programming language, by far&quot;, where X=C++, C#, VB.Net, Java, LISP, Haskell,
<br>
Smalltalk, Refal, etc.
<br>
<p>This is not the same for hardware.  There is *some* disagreement, but there
<br>
is reasonably wide agreement regarding which chips are better than which
<br>
other ones.  There's no one claiming that the 386 chip is better than a
<br>
Pentium, for example.
<br>
<p>I don't doubt there are studies &quot;proving&quot; that LISP is the best language in
<br>
various senses.  I'm sure there are also studies &quot;proving&quot; the same things
<br>
about C++, Java and other languages.
<br>
<p>The situation is a bit like politics.  There are really smart Democrats, and
<br>
really smart Republicans, and really smart anarchists, and really smart
<br>
Libertarians, and they don't agree on a lot.  Yet even so I feel we've
<br>
advanced a lot politically in the last century.  But others may disagree,
<br>
some people may think we've gone backwards... there are not clear metrics.
<br>
<p>My own feeling is that the different languages have different strengths and
<br>
weaknesses.  If you're programming a symbolic AI application, then my bet is
<br>
that LISP is the best language.  If you're programming a multi-tier DB
<br>
system where performance is important but performance requirements are not
<br>
extremely rigorous, I'd go with Java (but I don't have experience with C#,
<br>
which might be just as good for this).  If you need to do a multithreaded,
<br>
distributed system with a variety of complex forms of high-volume,
<br>
high-performance-required number-crunching on numbers stored in complex data
<br>
structures (e.g. Novamente), my bet is on C++ ....
<br>
<p>Intuitively, I agree with the sentiment that software has not progressed as
<br>
fast as computer hardware.  However, I still feel that computer software has
<br>
progressed *a lot*.
<br>
<p>If you assume that LISP is the apex of software technology, and observe that
<br>
things have not progressed much in LISP over time, maybe you're right.  If
<br>
you take a broader view, and assume that different programming languages and
<br>
methodologies mostly all have value, then you find there has been a lot of
<br>
progress (in the non-LISP areas of software).
<br>
<p>For example, the tools available to game programmers now are amazing
<br>
compared to what was there 10 years ago.  These tools are motivated by
<br>
advances in hardware, but not directly implied by it.  You can now write a
<br>
complex action game using someone else's game-engine toolkit and have it
<br>
work really well.  This was not the case even 5 years ago.  And it's not the
<br>
case in LISP right now, only in C++ (the language of choice for writing
<br>
games).
<br>
<p>C++ does suck in many ways as a language.  Standard chips also suck in some
<br>
ways, compared to what's possible.  But known shortcomings don't imply lack
<br>
of progress.
