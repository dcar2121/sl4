CS&gt; BG&gt; The &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect posited by New Agers for some

CS&gt; BG&gt; time, has yet to be observed en masse..
<br>
CS&gt;
<br>
CS&gt; I hadn't heard of this, so I have just received some education via
<br>
CS&gt; Google.  Of course in human societies such effects (including,
<br>
CS&gt; e.g., &quot;Rubik's&quot; Cube being close-to-simultaneously invented/
<br>
CS&gt; discovered by various parties) can be explained in a number of
<br>
CS&gt; other ways.
<br>

<br>
ESY&gt; Google harder.  The &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect is a known urban
<br>
ESY&gt; legend that started as a distortion of real research done on the
<br>
ESY&gt; origin and spread of  potato-washing behavior among macaques on
<br>
ESY&gt; the Japanese island of Koshima.  
<br>
ESY&gt;   One genius, a juvenile female, developed the habit of carrying
<br>
ESY&gt; sweet potatos in water to wash off the dirt; from there it spread
<br>
ESY&gt; to other children, who taught it to their parents (shades of the
<br>
ESY&gt; Internet revolution).  The idea that other monkeys on other
<br>
ESY&gt; islands spontaneously picked up the idea is pure fabrication.
<br>

<br>
Right, I caught that.  But one or more of the pages I saw used this
<br>
fabrication as &quot;support&quot; for the idea of some sort of morphogenetic
<br>
idea field type thingamajig (sorry, my vocab is gone, and the concept
<br>
was handwavingly vague) -- and I was making the point that at least in
<br>
the case of human invention, there is no need to invoke such mystical
<br>
explanations.  (And of course, even /if/ monkeys on other islands
<br>
&quot;spontaneously&quot; started using the same method that could simply be due
<br>
to having their own local genius.)
