This will be my last response on this thread.  I feel that it's getting 
<br>
increasingly unproductive.  If anyone wants to talk to me more about it, 
<br>
try the chat room or directly email me.

I agree that we can swing the odds, especially concerning the quality of 
<br>
life leading up to the Singularity, but... by definition the Singularity is 
<br>
an unknown.  There is no way that we can be prepared for the 
<br>
Singularity.  (&quot;preparing the people&quot; is different than &quot;being prepared&quot;.)

I'm not trying to cut off all efforts to uplift human consciousness.  Let's 
<br>
just do it rationally, not through some silly outdated memes.

Point taken.  I should have said &quot;It would seem that the best solution by 
<br>
far is...&quot;
