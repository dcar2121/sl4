<p><em>&gt; That's a subjective opinion. C# is perfectly good for anything anyone

<p>Why does this remind me of statements from yesteryear like that 
<br>
the country only needed 4 computers?  :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, as a professional software architect and system 
<br>
builder for 22 years I can tell you that you are utterly 
<br>
mistaken.  I quite commonly have to build a lot of scaffolding 
<br>
in such languages in order to produce a clean, efficient and 
<br>
maintainable implementation.  I use all available features of 
<br>
every language I have encountered and quite quickly run into 
<br>
limitations that all but a few make it unnecessarily difficult 
<br>
to get around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Time. Modern languages have higher productivity for three main
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons: more precise/useful language constructs, managed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; environments, and better designed libraries.  Both of these languages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; C# and Java, are also hardware agnostic in that they both compile into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; platform independent &quot;bytecode&quot;.  There are now versions of Cobol,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; C++, Eiffel, and Visual Basic that also compile down to platform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; independent &quot;bytecode&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can we write useful, provably correct systems? No.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not? Take a look at distributed.net or any similar project. Real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are getting done in a distributed way, more so than ten years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>They are getting done in very fragile and clumsy ways.  COM, 
<br>
CORBA, RMI, DCOM and so on are all pretty gross when it comes to 
<br>
distributed programming.  A large part of the grossness is a 
<br>
direct result of weakness of the underlying expected language 
<br>
environments and, more importantly, of weak language 
<br>
preconceptions about what is possible and desirable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Can we write secure systems? No. Okay, can we at least write 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gracefully failing systems? No.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can we generate code to specs automatically? No. Can we design massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; parallel systems, where millions of asynchronous objects distributed over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thousands of small processors do meaningful work? No. Do we have any clue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as to how break through the complexity bareer, using nonstochastical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; methods (coder monkeys)? No and no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Progress is being made. From the way you're talking, it seems that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just aren't up to date. Check out such things as the MOSIX project (I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use this at home). Also, check out Microsoft .NET, and C#. Those are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, there isn't.  Perusing comp sci research projects would give 
<br>
a far better idea of what is missing and what can be done about 
<br>
some of it.  The commercial systems including Microsoft .NET are 
<br>
far behind in addressing these issues.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; There's no need to go on. We haven't had any palpable progress in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; decade, arguably two. In fact, the average code quality is decreasing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; though to different reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have anything but your pessamistic curmudgeony old views to back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that up? Ten years ago, there were no standards for applications running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on PCs (I'm talking about MS-DOS). Now, it's possible to create reliable 
</em><br>
<p>False.  There were several environments/language 10 years ago 
<br>
that ran on multiple environments including PCs.  In particular 
<br>
most of the interpreted languages of the period and Lisp come to 
<br>
mind.  I personally created a distributed, persistent 
<br>
programming environment on top of Unix and OS/2 based around 
<br>
extensions to Objective C over 15 years ago.  Yeah, it didn't 
<br>
become a standard (done inside a properietary company) but I 
<br>
certainly was not the only one that thought of the issues.  RPC 
<br>
was well known before the last decade.  Data encoding for use by 
<br>
disparate systems did not only exist after XMl was invented.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; programs that will run on any set of platforms, and interoperate, share 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data, and so on in ways that hadn't been dreamed of ten years ago, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly even five. Code reuse is lightyears ahead of ten years ago. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With .NET's CTS,  whatever you write in one language can be used in any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other with no problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You really should read about systems and languages older than 5 
<br>
or 10 years before you embarass yourself like this.
