</em><br>
<p>The potential donors are interesting; the potential capitalists are not, due to their mundane methods of calculating ROI.  Their
<br>
idea of high-tech stuff is sl&lt;4.  In a way the donors are investors in a higher category, seeming offbeat to the squares who can't
<br>
dance to new school beats, seeming overly speculative to those who can't see what's on the horizon.
<br>
To Ben the Singularity appears to be icing on the cake (what the cake itself is will remain a mystery, though I suspect it is simply
<br>
financial gain).
<br>
The thing is Ben doesn't grok seed AI, which is essential to getting anything transhuman within a timeframe to possibly beat
<br>
nanotech.  His &quot;sort of&quot; interest has a lot to do with this incomprehension.
<br>
He doesn't get Friendship Programming esp. structure, which is also essential.  Certainly he is not going to have more than casual
<br>
interest if he
<br>
doesn't see how a whole dish (complex organization around a top-down, rational principle) approach is necessary, i.e.- an a la carte
<br>
(altering strictly local properties, goals tacked on as almost an afterthought) approach won't work.
<br>
&nbsp;Of course it's plausible that one might get CFAI and Seed AI and why they matter and still have a cursory interest, owing to apathy
<br>
or antipathy deeper than I can address here.  As for me, I'm only interested in the matter of saving the solar system from total
<br>
sterility.
