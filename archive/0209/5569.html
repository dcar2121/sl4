<br>
As I see it, the basic problem is the same for people highly 
<br>
privileged relative to others is to show clearly that their real 
<br>
quality of life will rise further in a world of true abundance 
<br>
than in the world based around scarcity in which their 
<br>
differential status was gained.
<br>

<br>
I think the deeper and more fundamental shift is to a world 
<br>
where the differentiation on the basis of what you personally 
<br>
own or the size of your relative pile of chips becomes less 
<br>
acheivable and has no real ties to fundamental well-being 
<br>
(housing, food, clothing, access to computational resources and 
<br>
information, health care, education and so on).  At some point I 
<br>
think a shift will occur to what you own, what information you 
<br>
have just not being a distinction at all as everyone has access 
<br>
potentially to most physical goods as desired (one of a kind 
<br>
places, art and so on are an exception) and everyone has access 
<br>
to the full information bank. Distinction will have to come in 
<br>
other ways.
