CS&gt; I have quite a bit of faith that reasonably intelligent folks can

CS&gt; be convinced of the possibility of, and their self-interest in,

CS&gt; abundance, but very little such faith when it comes to those
<br>
CS&gt; parties (people and institutions) accustomed to power. 
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; Sure....  The people in power in our society are by and large more
<br>
BG&gt; intelligent than average... BUT they have a big status-drive
<br>
BG&gt; self-interest in NOT moving toward a society of wild abundance,
<br>
BG&gt; because in such a society, the power of themselves and their
<br>
BG&gt; offspring will likely be less...

You missed &quot;but very little&quot; in my statement above.
