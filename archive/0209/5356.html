<p>
This whole discussion about the technical and social dynamics of
<br>
collaborative filtering has been discussed at great lengths on the Slashdot
<br>
forums and the meta section of <a href="http://kuro5hin.org">http://kuro5hin.org</a> . No doubt there are
<br>
other discussion board systems, but to my knowledge these two are the most
<br>
popular that involve peer review of submitted comments. Blogging is supposed
<br>
to be a phenomena now, the next Internet killer app, at least if you believe
<br>
the propaganda that the blogging community writes about themselves.
<br>
<p>The point I'm trying to make is that the discussion so far on collaborative
<br>
filtering, peer review, voting, anonymity, etc. have been discussed,
<br>
implemented and discussed again by at least the Slashcode and Scoop
<br>
developers, and the blogging community. I hardly think this topic is worthy
<br>
of SL4 discussion, unless you are talking about a real Earthweb
<br>
implementation (unfortunately I haven't read that book yet).
<br>
<p>The latest KurzweilAI.net newsletter pointed to a Wired article
<br>
<a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/start.html?pg=2">http://wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/start.html?pg=2</a> titled &quot;Slaves to Our
<br>
Machines&quot;. The goal for most of us is to enable computer-assisted human
<br>
intelligence, not necessarily the current trend of human-assisted computer
<br>
intelligence. My view is of complementary assisted intelligence, especially
<br>
if an artificial system gains some sort of consciousness, why should humans
<br>
have to take on the role of slave or slave-driver? Can't we all just get
<br>
along? There I go with my anthropomorphism again, sorry.
<br>
<p>Back to the collaborative filtering issue, the intelligence of that system
<br>
still lies within the humans. A tool that rearranges it and renders
<br>
different views, no matter how sophisticated, is still a dumb
<br>
(unintelligent) application whose value is only a factor of the intelligence
<br>
of the humans entering the information into it. These tools already exist,
<br>
more or less. What does not exist is an intelligent system that can parse
<br>
human thoughts (encoded in natural language text) and detect ambiguities,
<br>
incorrect reasoning, objective versus subjective statements, thought
<br>
patterns, etc. That would be a super job for a GAI.
<br>
<p>IIRC, WebMind had an application that parsed the stock message boards to
<br>
determine the general consensus on whether people thought a stock was a good
<br>
buy or sell. A system that can detect arbitrary ideas from many human
<br>
sources seems to me like a general pattern recognition problem rather than a
<br>
specific pattern recognition such as &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;sell&quot;.
<br>
<p>cheers,
