<em> &gt; Well, there is a difference between humans &amp; general AI's in this
</em><br>
<em> &gt; context.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; If one has a general AI that does not have the power to protect itself

</em><br>
<em> &gt; different place; having its software copied and replicated elsewhere,

</em><br>
<em> &gt; knowledge, etc.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Brainwashing a kidnapped human is a difficult and sometimes probably

</em><br>

<br>
I remind you that we visualize considerably different orders of complexity 
<br>
for general AI, as well as considerably different self-modification 
<br>
architectures.  I think this may be responsible for our difference of 
<br>
opinion in this respect.
<br>

<br>
I think it would be extremely difficult to modify a nontrivially advanced 
<br>
AI against its will, even if the AI has not deliberately obfuscated in any 
<br>
way, and even if the AI has not deliberately protected itself from 
<br>
unfriendly modification.  For example, as I understand AI, I don't see how 
<br>
you could possibly &quot;force-feed an AI with false knowledge&quot; unless you'd 
<br>
already brainwashed it into operating the belief-formation system under 
<br>
your direction.
<br>

<br>
It seems to me that a seed AI, even without deliberately obfuscating 
<br>
itself in any way that would interfere with Friendly AI, can easily create 
<br>
so many simultaneous dependencies within the system that no human 
<br>
programmer is capable of modifying it without AI assistance.  Moreover, 
<br>
that no human programmer is capable of ripping apart the AI and putting 
<br>
the pieces back together in any kind of working order.  In fact, I would 
<br>
tend to suspect that this would happen naturally and without any 
<br>
deliberate planning being required on the AI's part.  And there's no 
<br>
reason why an AI *couldn't* plan ahead for the contingency of being 
<br>
stolen.  Things that enable an AI to resist unfriendly external 
<br>
modification are not necessarily things that interfere with Friendship 
<br>
programmers seeing inside the AI and *consensually* modifying it.
