<p>
<em>&gt;  &gt; So, getting back to the real world, I think that BOTH
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; a) singularity-oriented R&amp;D
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; b) genuine efforts to raise of the consciousness of human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; are under-resourced in our society, compared to what would be optimal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Which is more under-resourced depends on interpretation of borderline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; cases. (Which research counts as singularity-oriented --- do we count
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; work on faster microprocessors?  Which work counts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; consciousness-raising -- do we count the yoga studio on the corner?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  You can refuse to judge if you like.  I think that we should look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all ongoing efforts, judge the probabilistic payoff to sentient life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joining each one, and join the best.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, your sentence as explicitly worded omits the possibility of creating a
<br>
new sort of effort, but I guess this is just a slip of verbal formulation.
<br>
I guess what you really mean is
<br>
<p>&quot;I think that we should look
<br>
&nbsp;at all ongoing efforts and all newly proposed efforts, judge the
<br>
probabilistic payoff to sentient life of
<br>
&nbsp;joining each one, and join the best. &quot;
<br>
<p>I have done something closely resembling that, and it's evident that my
<br>
choice is pretty close to your own... though we have both newly proposed our
<br>
own projects rather than joined existing ones.
<br>
<p>It's not that I refuse to make my own judgment.  It's that my judgments come
<br>
with multiple truth values, mostly simple a &quot;strength&quot; value and a &quot;weight
<br>
of evidence&quot; value.  If we normalize them both into the intervals [0,1], I'd
<br>
say the statement
<br>
<p>&quot;Real AI work is the most promising direction for sentient life&quot; has
<br>
strength~=.99 and weight_of_evidence ~= .6
<br>
<p>Ordinary language doesn't provide for even this level of multidimensional
<br>
truth-value specification, which causes a lot of confusion.  (Ordinary
<br>
uncertain logic formations don't either, amusingly enough.)
<br>
<p>It's because my weight_of_evidence estimate is not so high, that I am not so
<br>
judgmental about others who have different opinion.  I consider it
<br>
reasonably likely that others might draw conclusions based on evidence sets
<br>
not overlapping with my own; but based on the evidence set I've been able to
<br>
consider, I've drawn the strength conclusion I have.
<br>
<p>You're always talking about BPT.  As you know, I feel that standard
<br>
formulations of prob. inference are flawed because they don't take weight of
<br>
evidence into account.  However, it can be taken into account within the
<br>
probabilistic framework, as in Novamente probabilistic term logic.  I think
<br>
that good human inference does this also, though not in exactly the same way
<br>
as Novamente.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a Categorical Imperative OK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy - it works if &quot;everyone does it&quot; - because you aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically joining the project that seems &quot;best&quot;, but rather joining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the project that combines the greatest degree of promise with the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect you can have on it.
</em><br>
<p>This is a very good formulation of one of the things I was trying to say.
<br>
You worded it better.
<br>
<p>The only slant I was adding to this was that, humans being what they are,
<br>
the project on which one will have the greatest effect is often the project
<br>
for which one has the most passion.
<br>
<p>Samantha has so much obvious passion for advancing human consciousness, this
<br>
leads me to believe she may have a much larger effect in that domain than in
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>Or maybe after a couple years she'll realize current-model humans are
<br>
largely hopeless and join the Novamente team or SIAI's programming group ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one project grows too large and threatens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to suck up all the resources, individuals following this strategy will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to join small struggling projects because they expect to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater impact here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, because the current distribution of efforts is so wildly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbalanced, the issue doesn't really arise; Singularity research is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least funded *and* most promising approach.  I mention the above simply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that this kind of thinking works even if everyone does it.
</em><br>
<p>I understand what you mean about Singularity research being very poorly
<br>
funded.
<br>
<p>However, it's not unreasonable to believe, as Kurzweil and others do, that
<br>
explicit Singularity research is largely irrelevant at this stage, because
<br>
general hi-tech development is what's gonna bring us there.  (He has
<br>
developed this perspective in a lot more detail.)
<br>
<p>I know, though, you think he doesn't really understand the Singularity,
<br>
which brings a different dimension to the discussion.
<br>
<p>My strong feeling is: It's incontrovertible, concrete, observable technology
<br>
results that are going to bring significant funding our way, not conceptual
<br>
explanations.
<br>
<p>Either fabulous narrow-AI results obtained along the way to general AI
<br>
(which I realize is not a strong possibility in your own AI approach), or
<br>
(much nicer) animal-level general inteligence results obtained along the way
<br>
to general AI ... these will bring significant funding to
<br>
Singularity-oriented AGI research.
<br>
<p>Whereas, I believe, no amount of talk about the Singularity will do so.
<br>
Because most people -- including nearly all people controlling funding --
<br>
will look at the same world we're looking at, and listen to our carefully
<br>
constructed trains of logical reasoning, and conclude that we're building
<br>
wishful-thinking-driven inferential card-houses, drawing wildly ambitious
<br>
conclusions based on speculating from scant evidence.
<br>
<p>There's always the possibility of an extremely wealthy or powerful
<br>
&quot;statistical outlier&quot; investor/philanthropist coming along who really sees
<br>
things roughly the way we do.  But I see this as a low-probability
<br>
occurrence.  Incremental engineering results are going to be the key to
<br>
getting the substantial funding needed to accelerate our progress along the
<br>
AGI route to the Singularity.
