September 11: Enough Day
<br>

<br>
Dubya, acting upon a joint resolution of Congress, has declared
<br>
September 11 to be Patriot Day. According to his proclamation, we're
<br>
supposed to &quot;...observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and
<br>
activities...&quot; and to &quot;...display the flag at half-staff from their
<br>
homes and observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. EDT,&quot; this in honor
<br>
of the Americans who died in the terrorist attack.
<br>

<br>
You know, personally I think this just stinks to hell. I have a better
<br>
idea, so I'm making a proclamation of my own, which of course is
<br>
completely unendorsed by any US politicians I'm aware of.
<br>

<br>
I'm declaring September 11 &quot;International Enough Day.&quot; Enough
<br>
flag-waving, enough violence, enough nationalism. Enough already.
<br>
September 11 was not an American tragedy, it was a human tragedy. It was
<br>
a tragedy not just for the people in the US who died, but for every
<br>
innocent person killed as a result of the US reaction to the attacks as
<br>
well. It was a tragedy for the human spirit, regardless of nationality,
<br>
religion, and anything else.
<br>

<br>
On September 11, let's say &quot;Enough.&quot; No more killing. Let's remember not
<br>
only the victims of the hijacked airplanes in the US, but of the embassy
<br>
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Let's remember all the Israelis
<br>
killed by Palestinian bombers and all the Palestinians killed by Israeli
<br>
troops. Let's remember all the innocent people slain by Union Carbide in
<br>
Bhopal, India in 1984. Let's take the day to contemplate the people
<br>
who've been victims of genocidal warfare in Africa, and the ones who've
<br>
starved to death because of political games as well. Let's remember the
<br>
victims of the Holocaust and of the firebombing of Dresden, too. Let's
<br>
not forget those who were slain in the Mai Lai Massacre. Instead of
<br>
waving the flag of one nation and thinking only about our own dead,
<br>
let's make September 11 a day to remember all the people who've died at
<br>
the hands of someone else's political agenda through no fault of their
<br>
own, and let's say enough. We should stand up and disavow this, no
<br>
matter what country we're in, no matter what religion we are, no matter
<br>
our political affiliation or status or race or anything else.
<br>

<br>
If we had a moment of silence marking the time of every atrocity ever
<br>
committed in the name of nationalism, religion... every atrocity
<br>
committed in the name of the artificial borders that try to make us
<br>
forget that we're all human, all in this together, all fragile creatures
<br>
whose lives can be snuffed out in an instant through no fault of our
<br>
own... then we would never speak again.
<br>

<br>
So we here in America should, I think, observe September 11 as the day
<br>
when the nightmares that humans around the world have been living with
<br>
for decades came lumbering ashore on the East Coast of the US. We should
<br>
see it for what it is; the day the US truly experienced the horror that
<br>
rings like a bell around the globe, from South America to the Middle
<br>
East to Micronesia, the day we joined the human race at a most profound
<br>
and fundamental level.
<br>

<br>
There should be no &quot;Patriot Day,&quot; no day to further emphasize that
<br>
we're different. Instead, let's say &quot;Enough.&quot; Enough of putting the
<br>
interests of any one nation above the interests of the human race.
<br>
Enough dwelling on our small differences. Enough killing each other over
<br>
them. Enough hate, enough fear, enough hunger, enough violence, enough
<br>
bombing, enough enough enough ENOUGH.
<br>

<br>
We should each find our own way of expressing this. A moment of
<br>
silence... or perhaps a day of silence. Meditation, art, whatever it is
<br>
that you do... do it. Take the day to celebrate the lives of all of
<br>
us -- wherever we're from and whatever we believe -- who are still here,
<br>
and think on those -- wherever they were, whenever they were and
<br>
whatever they were -- who weren't so lucky. Take the day to remember the
<br>
fragility of human life and all the nightmares wrought by those who
<br>
wanted to impose their will upon the whole of humanity. Commit no act of
<br>
violence, however small. Let go of any hatred and prejudice and thirst
<br>
for revenge and, for one day, see yourself in the other and the other in
<br>
yourself.
<br>

<br>
Do whatever you do, and do it to say ENOUGH.
<br>

<br>
