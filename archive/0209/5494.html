</em><br>

</em><br>

<br>
Well, for me this is a very concrete decision.  What do I spend my time on?
<br>

<br>
I love AI research, but if it were clear to me I could do much more good by
<br>
evangelizing about the future -- trying to convince people to take abundance
<br>
into account into their thinking -- then I would do that.  Kurzweil has
<br>
apparently made that decision -- to evangelize &amp; leave the research to
<br>
others, because he feels there are plenty of other smart researchers out
<br>
there, but few as well positioned as he is to effectively evangelize....
<br>

<br>
My decision to commit so much of my life to AI development is partly a
<br>
consequence of my guess that AI research is more likely to lead to huge
<br>
positive consequences than other things I might do...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; That said, I wouldn't altogether discount the possibility of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural/spiritual revolution, although I don't think it likely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One could argue, for instance, that during the last century in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; West there's been a rapid (exponential?) rise of the number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in what's happening in the world at large and with the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fulfill that interest...
</em><br>

<br>
The argument that there's been an exponential increase in peoples' free time
<br>
in the West seems fairly weak to me.  There has been some increase since the
<br>
era of 12-hour days in the factory, but all in all, people seem remarkably
<br>
apt at filling up their free time with extra work, with soccer games for
<br>
their kids, with anything BUT deep reflection on the nature of themselves
<br>
and the cosmos and the future of intelligence ;&gt;
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I have quite a bit of faith that reasonably intelligent folks can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced of the possibility of, and their self-interest in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abundance, but very little such faith when it comes to those parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (people and institutions) accustomed to power.
</em><br>

<br>
Sure....  The people in power in our society are by and large more
<br>
intelligent than average... BUT they have a big status-drive self-interest
<br>
in NOT moving toward a society of wild abundance, because in such a society,
<br>
the power of themselves and their offspring will likely be less...
