. . . .
<br>
<em>&gt; Understanding charity's origin as a sexual display should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermine its social status.  As Robert Frank argued in _Luxury Fever_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we may have evolved instincts for achieving higher social status through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conspicuous display, but as rational and moral beings we can still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose conspicuous charity over conspicuous consumption.
</em><br>

<br>
Or one can have both conspicuous charity and conspicuous consumption. This
<br>
is how it works in the social circle of the very rich in Palm Beach, FL.
<br>
During &quot;the season&quot; (roughly December through March) there is a seemingly
<br>
endless round of charity balls where the elite meet to greet, eat, drink,
<br>
dance and generally have a good time. These events are held in lavishly
<br>
decorated ballrooms where only the finest food and drink are served. Yet
<br>
what seems like just a party for the very rich will raise millions of
<br>
dollars for genuinely worthy charities, mostly aimed at helping children,
<br>
feeding the hungry, and curing various diseases (from which even the rich
<br>
may suffer).
<br>

<br>
Some may object that even more money could be raised if the cost of staging
<br>
these events was eliminated and all the money simply given to charity. But
<br>
this view, which I would dub &quot;the socialist fallacy,&quot; ignores human
<br>
psychology. If a government attempted to compel the rich to give this money
<br>
via taxation, then the rich would use their lawyers, accountants, ability to
<br>
move money across national frontiers, and their political clout to make sure
<br>
that they did not pay. Instead, as usually happens, the tax-raising would be
<br>
shifted to the less powerful (but in aggregate, more financially vast)
<br>
middle class. The middle class is an easier target because each taxpayer in
<br>
that group will only pay a little more, and does not have as much individual
<br>
influence over policy (or where to put his/her money) as the rich person
<br>
does.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps if we imagined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hundred hungry ghosts haunting every luxury vehicle, runaway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumerism would lose some of its sexual appeal.  While designer labels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advertise only our wealth, the badges of charity advertise both our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth and our kindness.  As it is, the car manufacturers can afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better advertising than the needy children, which is why our instincts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for display have been directed more toward consumerism than toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charity.
</em><br>

<br>
Show me a ghost that exists outside the imagination and I'll grant this
<br>
notion some credibility. But as things stand right now, the tangible luxury
<br>
automobile trumps all invisible ghosts. However, there are advertisements on
<br>
television soliciting contributions to various children's charities by
<br>
showing heartrending images of starving kids. And I'm sure these ads have
<br>
some effect. But let me turn back to what happens in Palm Beach, where
<br>
wealthy matrons visit children in local hospitals and give them gifts. Once
<br>
again, as in the $400 per hour lawyer who volunteers for a soup kitchen,
<br>
it's being there that counts for the donor's self-esteem. (By the way, I
<br>
know Palm Beach because I used to live nearby. I am not rich nor was a
<br>
member of the Palm Beach plutocracy, but I used to date its daughters ;)
<br>

<br>
Question: What does all this say about the potential for getting deep pocket
<br>
donors to support SIAI?
