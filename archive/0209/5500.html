I disagree in that I believe that the odds of getting to a 
<br>
Singularity that is actually beneficial are partially dependent 
<br>
on preparing the people as much as can be done.  I do not 
<br>
believe in an solely apocalyptic model of how we are saved from 
<br>
ourselves.  I don't believe it all will be done for us by the 
<br>
Friendly Sysop or equivalent.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; play the game on the level that the greedy, selfish individuals who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; currently hold power (by appealing to the masses own sense of greed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; create conformity). I believe that &quot;scarcity based&quot; / &quot;zero sum&quot; / 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;selfish&quot; thinking is 90% nurture and 10% nature, here's why:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest you read the Evolutionary Psychology primer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html">http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html</a>).  Nature vs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nurture is sillyness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
Evolutionary Psychology is not immutable uber-explanation that 
<br>
cuts all efforts and the reasonableness of all efforts to uplift 
<br>
human consciousness and institutions apart as utterly worthless. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Using it in such a way is not helpful.
<br>

<br>

<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/globalization/cointel/567.html">http://www.guerrillanews.com/globalization/cointel/567.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; However, the question we should be asking is how long can we continue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on our current trajectory, and does that leave us with enough time to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reach the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are bigger issues than nuclear exchange to worry about, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want to get into them here.  We probably don't have time for a 100 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year take off though.  We may not even have 15 years to wait.  (Nobody 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows of course.)  It would seem that the only solution is to try to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerate a friendly singularity (friendly intentionally not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalized to denote a more general case).
</em><br>

<br>
I don't think that is the only solution.  Only solution 
<br>
scenarios are dangerous when/if the &quot;only solution&quot; fails to 
<br>
work out.
