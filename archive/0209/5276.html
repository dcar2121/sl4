Eliezer says:
<br>
<em>&gt; Ben, there is a difference between working at a full-time job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to (in belief or in fact) benefit the Singularity; and explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning from the Singularity as a starting point and choosing your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions accordingly, before the fact rather than afterward.
</em><br>
<p>I guess there is a clear *psychological* difference there, but not a clear
<br>
*pragmatic* one.
<br>
<p>Consider the case of someone who is working on a project for a while, and
<br>
later realizes that it has the potential to help with the Singularity.
<br>
Suppose they then continue their project with even greater enthusiasm
<br>
because they now see it's broader implications in terms of the Singularity.
<br>
To me, this person is working toward the Singularity just as validly as if
<br>
they had started their project with the Singularity in mind.
<br>
<p>As for myself, I didn't know the Vingean sense of the word &quot;Singularity&quot;
<br>
when I started my AI work in the early 1980's.  But I did explicitly start
<br>
my AI work with a view toward its potential to lead to
<br>
<p>a) the obsolescence of humanity and
<br>
b) the creation of a completely different order of being than the one we're
<br>
familiar with, an order of being &quot;transcendent&quot; compared to ours, just as
<br>
ours is transcendent compared to that of a dog or a pig
<br>
<p>The reason I chose to work on AI instead of time travel, unification of
<br>
fundamental physics, genetics or pure mathematics, is that I felt it had the
<br>
potential to bring about this transcendent order of being faster.
<br>
<p>The reason I chose to devote my life to AI instead of to perfecting my own
<br>
mind thru meditation and other related practices, was the same.  I think
<br>
that the transcendence findable via meditation ain't nuttin' compared to the
<br>
transcendence AI's will help us find via helping us upload and improve our
<br>
minds.
<br>
<p>So I believe that I've been actively working toward the Singularity -- in my
<br>
own sense of that word, which may not be identical to yours, just as yours
<br>
isn't identical to Kurzweil's, etc. -- for my whole adult life and part of
<br>
my teenage years, actually.
<br>
<p>And I'm sure I'm not the only one....
<br>
<p>You may feel that someone who is explicitly working toward the Singularity
<br>
as the *prime supergoal* of all their actions, can be trusted more
<br>
thoroughly to make decisions pertinent toward the Singularity.  But I am not
<br>
so sure of this at all.  The problem is that this kind of extremism in
<br>
devotion to a cause, throughout human history, has often been correlated
<br>
with poor judgment.  This is not to say that I *mistrust* someone
<br>
particularly if they have the Singularity (or anything else) as a prime
<br>
supergoal of their actions, only to say that I don't value their judgment
<br>
particularly because of their extreme single-mindedness.
<br>
<p>Personally, although the Singularity (in my own sense of the term) has been
<br>
the main guiding motivation behind my research work and my whole career, it
<br>
is NOT the entire motivation behind my life.  It is not the supergoal of ALL
<br>
my actions, only of a majority of my actions.  I don't improvise at the
<br>
piano because it is helpful for the Singularity, I do it because I enjoy it.
<br>
I could make a rationalization and say that I need to play piano sometimes
<br>
because it clears my mind and makes me more able to work on AI afterwards,
<br>
but I don't bother to make that rationalization.  I accept that I have a
<br>
goal heterarchy in my mind, not a goal hierarchy, and that working toward
<br>
the Singularity is a very important goal of the human organism that is me,
<br>
but not the *prime supergoal*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I trust that someone is thinking rationally about the Singularity, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to rationalizing, when I see that they are willing to make major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *new* life decisions explicitly on the basis of how it affects the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity.  Going on doing whatever you would be doing anyway may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute greatly to the Singularity - who knows, maybe more than all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI will ever do; it could be a fact - but unless Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerations, considered explicitly as such before the fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daily work, the Singularity is not your day job.
</em><br>
<p>In your definition of whether someone is &quot;working full time on the
<br>
Singularity,&quot; you are judging people based on their psychological
<br>
motivations rather than their actions.  If you like to categorize people in
<br>
this way, you're welcome to.  One problem with this, however, is that your
<br>
own insight into other peoples' psychological motivations is rather limited.
<br>
<p>I prefer to judge whether someone is working toward the Singularity or not
<br>
by looking at *what they're actually doing*.
<br>
<p>And I *certainly* don't think it's reasonable to implicitly assume that only
<br>
people working for SIAI are truly devoted to the Singularity!
<br>
<p>SIAI does not look to me like a generic Singularity-promoting organization.
<br>
By all appearances it is an organization devoted to your particular approach
<br>
to AI and Friendly AI.  Thus, if someone is devoted to the Singularity but
<br>
thinks your approaches to these problems are not correct, they are probably
<br>
not going to join SIAI.  Thus, your implication that only people involved
<br>
with SIAI are truly full-time devoted to the Singularity, sounds a lot like
<br>
an implication that only people who agree with your ideas are truly devoted
<br>
to the Singularity.  I'm sure that's not exactly what you meant to say, but
<br>
it sure comes across that way sometimes.
