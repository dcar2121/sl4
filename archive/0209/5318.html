</em><br>
<p>Okay.  I have no problem with restricting it to the last 10,000 years if 
<br>
it's something that requires writing but hasn't been tried over that time, 
<br>
or the last 500 years if it's something that requires printing but has 
<br>
never been tried, and is significantly different and significantly more 
<br>
powerful than anything that has previously been tried.
<br>
<p>Again, not trying to be difficult; this is a test met by seed AI, as a 
<br>
strategy in the battle against human suffering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, don't get me wrong.  The above is a good question. However, I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not yet prepare to offer an answer I believe goes deep enough to satisfy.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  I'm glad you're not jumping on an answer.  Just remember that there 
<br>
*is* at least one answer which *does* satisfy the above the requirements. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that some of us are moving on it already.  Speed counts, 
<br>
sometimes.  If you want us to do something differently, such as spend X% 
<br>
of our resources on something else, we're going to want concrete answers 
<br>
to certain questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Remember, us AIfolk have to deal with the shadow of fifty years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; failure; everyone wants to know what we're going to do that hasn't been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tried before.  You have to dig yourself out from under the heap of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people's failures; show that your thinking is new enough not to belong in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the trash heap with the things that have been tried before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is a poor way of thinking.  Each effort stands more on its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own merits without being bogged down by everything before. Yes we learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from past failures but we do not have to personally redeem all that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggage.
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  It seems like a good test to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Why is your thinking that new?  Why are your plans that original?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New and original are not necessarily primary criteria.  The situation is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new.  The communication bandwidth is new.  Can something effective be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done with that?  Perhaps.  It is to be designed.
</em><br>
<p>Then just do it.  It's the very first test you're facing.  It is very far 
<br>
from the last.  It's what you have to do right at the beginning in order 
<br>
to get started.  *Meet* the challenge, don't just acknowledge it.  Face it 
<br>
down, accomplish it, get it over with, and go on to the next step on the 
<br>
path.  You are running out of time.  Admiring a problem is a poor 
<br>
substitute for solving it, especially if it's just a first step.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Understand, I am not asking this in order to be difficult.  I can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at least three things you could try, in terms of promoting greater human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enlightenment before the Singularity, that have never been tried 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; before. What I want to know is what *you're* thinking of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please share those things.  They may make a real difference. My thinking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is early and tentative.  I am not fully ready to lay it out.
</em><br>
<p>1:  See whether humans can use feedback from realtime fMRI to help 
<br>
identify internal rationalization, hatred, tribal-based thinking, etc. 
<br>
You may not get all the bugs, but if you can get just some, it may be 
<br>
enough to tip the internal mental balance.  Evolution has no experience 
<br>
puppeteering humans with access to that information.
<br>
<p>2:  Collaborative filtering and/or the Earthweb; a means whereby one good 
<br>
idea can very rapidly spread to billions and be built upon by thousands. 
<br>
Accelerated memetic evolution.
<br>
<p>3:  See whether humans who talk to infrahuman but clear-thinking Friendly 
<br>
AIs learn anything from that about how to think rationally.  In other 
<br>
words, AI-trained humans may be doable pre-Singularity.
<br>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that you have not accomplished anything until 
<br>
you pick one of those strategies or something like it, and get started on 
<br>
implementing it directly.  The Singularity is not a religion, it is a 
<br>
GANTT chart.  You cannot worship it, admire it, believe in it, or accept 
<br>
it into your heart; you have to find one of the open boxes and turn it green.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It doesn't do much good to issue calls to action without a strategy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; promises to work.  Not a strategy that *sounds* good.  Not a strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that blazes like a banner and uplifts your heart.  A strategy which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unlike the stuff that's been previously tried over the last 50,000 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will actually work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is of course still a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial part of reaching enough people.  What do you believe will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actaully work?
</em><br>
<p>Seed AI.
<br>
<p>Or computer-mediated telepathy between 64-node clustered humans whose 
<br>
prefrontal cortices have learned to talk to one another over meganeuron 
<br>
broadband connections.
<br>
<p>Some form of transhumanity which can be achieved as rapidly as possible 
<br>
using our existing technological base; that's a big enough hammer.  I 
<br>
don't believe there's much else that *really would* work, however nice it 
<br>
sounded.
<br>
<p>Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is a crucial part of 
<br>
reaching enough people, but having a workable strategy comes first. 
<br>
Otherwise the cheering doesn't *accomplish* anything.  Humans like 
<br>
cheering and will cheer whether or not anything gets done as a result.  I 
<br>
am deeply suspicious of cheering, and I speak as a cheerleader.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Again:  What are you going to do, and why is it going to work when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everything previous has failed?  To quote Doonesbury, &quot;Let's kick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; butt!&quot; is not a plan unless you know which butts to kick, how far, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in which direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That notion of kicking butt is actually almost diametrically opposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I believe needs to happen.
</em><br>
<p>I know.  Still a good quote.
