<em>&gt; You may not get all the bugs, but if you can get just some, it may be

</em><br>
<p>I would like to see this attempted. It may, however, require far smaller,
<br>
portable equipment in order to capture the brain events in the midst of
<br>
real-life activities. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in this
<br>
way could be similar to the use of biofeedback machines by meditators. Also,
<br>
the work of Dr. Michael Persinger at Laurentian University in applying
<br>
external magnetic field to induce brain changes may give some hints.
<br>
Persinger is especially interested in how transient electrical spikes in the
<br>
temporal lobe are correlated with subjective reports of blissful, unitary
<br>
mystical states. Stimulating different areas can result in hellish, paranoid
<br>
states.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2:  Collaborative filtering and/or the Earthweb; a means whereby one good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea can very rapidly spread to billions and be built upon by thousands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Accelerated memetic evolution.
</em><br>
<p>I think the Net has already shown us that this is a real possibility. In
<br>
order to work effectively though, we probably need ubiquitous computing,
<br>
high-bandwidth wireless, and sufficient security/authentication so that
<br>
people feel comfortable with a high degree of intimate real-time
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3:  See whether humans who talk to infrahuman but clear-thinking Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs learn anything from that about how to think rationally.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, AI-trained humans may be doable pre-Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I think this is very possible. Setting aside for the moment the
<br>
problem of getting that FAI in place, I believe we've already seen evidence
<br>
from the use of certain expert systems that people are quite willing to
<br>
converse with a non-human &quot;intelligence&quot; and even to share intimate
<br>
information with one. Example 1: The surprising success of the old ELIZA
<br>
(spelling?) system that was designed to parody the question&amp;answer pattern
<br>
of a psychiatrist and patient. The patient would type a statement and ELIZA
<br>
would extract certain key words (e.g., mother, father, sex, love, etc.) and
<br>
then build a question around these. Example 2: Some medical doctors have
<br>
installed terminals in their office waiting rooms so patients can begin
<br>
entering data about their complaints. Most people respond very well to this
<br>
innovation. They seem to be more comfortable giving detailed, &quot;embarrassing&quot;
<br>
information about their health condition to a non-human system which
<br>
responded with questions based on their input.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Or computer-mediated telepathy between 64-node clustered humans whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefrontal cortices have learned to talk to one another over meganeuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadband connections.
</em><br>
<p>This is a development I'd like to see, but one which would probably freak
<br>
out a lot of the population, even if they had no interaction with the
<br>
clustered humans. We need to watch our backs for approaching peasants with
<br>
pitchforks when we begin walking down this road. Scare headline: &quot;When SL0's
<br>
Attack!&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Some form of transhumanity which can be achieved as rapidly as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using our existing technological base; that's a big enough hammer.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't believe there's much else that *really would* work, however nice it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is a crucial part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaching enough people, but having a workable strategy comes first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise the cheering doesn't *accomplish* anything.  Humans like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheering and will cheer whether or not anything gets done as a result.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am deeply suspicious of cheering, and I speak as a cheerleader.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that cheering is both necessary and insufficient. In fact, wrongly
<br>
used it can be downright counterproductive. Homo sapiens in large groups can
<br>
be swept up in mass cheering to the point that they abandon reason and go
<br>
with surges of emotion.  There is a reason why the Nazis favored mass
<br>
rallies held at night with torches, marching bands, and emotional speeches
<br>
designed to pluck the heartstrings of nationalism, tribalism, racism, etc.
<br>
Subtract the racism and similar ideas, replace them with salvation through
<br>
faith, change the musical genre, and you're got a Christian fundamentalist
<br>
revival meeting.
