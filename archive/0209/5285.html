<p>
So I was able to make it to Worldcon last Sunday, and I'm glad I went.
<br>
<p>Vernor Vinge gave his customary Singularity presentation followed by a
<br>
'Visions of the Singularity' program, with panelists Vernor Vinge, Charles
<br>
Stross, Walter Jon Williams, and James Patrick Kelly.  Greg Bear was
<br>
scheduled to attend but was disappointingly absent.
<br>
<p>While Vinges presentation was just the same old thing, there was never the
<br>
less a nice turnout for it and the following discussion.  It garnered a
<br>
largish room and had only scattered empty seats.  The audience was a bit
<br>
sleepy though.  Vinge cut his presentation a little short finishing with the
<br>
idea that a slow takeoff, &quot;prolonged for a hundred years perhaps&quot;, might be
<br>
preferred for safety reasons.  He really seemed comfortable with this idea,
<br>
and this particularly needs some testing on our behalf.
<br>
<p>There were routine questions, usually involving anthropomorphic assumptions
<br>
about AI's.  Eventually someone asked about the potential to give an AI some
<br>
human-like emotion, implying that this would reduce the risk of unwanted
<br>
behavior.  Vinge side stepped the assumption and directly addressed the idea
<br>
of making an AI safe.  He responded with something like &quot;Well, of course
<br>
there are some people, like Eliezer Yudkowsky, who think that all we need to
<br>
do is make AI's friendly to humans!&quot; eliciting a sizable chuckle from the
<br>
audience-- as much from his lightheartedly sarcastic tone and dramatic
<br>
hand-waving as anything else.  His body language cued them to laugh.  And it
<br>
felt as though it was a simple social animal urge to win back status by
<br>
pointing out someone else as being more fringe than he.  It strengthens ones
<br>
case, right?
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I failed to get picked from the audience to ask a question.
<br>
I wanted to challenge him on his sorely under developed idea of finding
<br>
safety in a slow take-off.  I wanted to suggest, for the audience's sake,
<br>
that the best hope for humanity may well be to immediately develop and
<br>
implement a &quot;safe architecture&quot; (as he referred to it).  But then of course
<br>
he'd just ask me how this is to be done, whereupon I would have to pull out
<br>
my pocket edition of CFAI, and things would get messy. (But seriously, in
<br>
such a forum how does one convey the notion that the subject of safe
<br>
architectures is a valid one?)
<br>
<p>The panel discussion was decidedly lackluster.  Vinge asked the panelists
<br>
for their ideas of Singularity and various definitions were proposed.  Some
<br>
were characterized by 'slow-takeoff', and Charles Stross suggests that we've
<br>
gone through 5 singularities already.  However, this rubs me wrong.
<br>
Singularities are, to my mind, fairly defined by 'hard-takeoff', this being
<br>
the likely nature of directly self-improving intelligence.  Also, my
<br>
expectations for Singularities are that they are discontinuous to the point
<br>
that, even if you keep pace with the wave front- perhaps no matter where you
<br>
are relative to it, you can look around and point to the moment in history
<br>
where The Big Change happened.  Any Singularity short of that just isn't
<br>
worthy of the name.
<br>
<p>The good thing is that I'm sure I got 150 flyers out to people, many by
<br>
hand, but more from tables of handouts.  One guy asked me for a handful more
<br>
flyers after he saw what it was all about.
<br>
<p>I wasn't sure what to expect, but after this experience I feel that SIAI's
<br>
presence at an affair like this one is an important thing.  And I'm ready to
<br>
try and maintain a presence whenever possible.  I'm aching to get Vinge to
<br>
admit some sympathy for singularitarianism.
<br>
<p>And some of you might be happy to know-- Vinge mentioned that he has signed
<br>
a contract for four new novels, and three books of reprinted material.
