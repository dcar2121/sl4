<em>&gt; Although I remain somewhat mystified by Eliezer's criteria for asking

</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret it as potentially trolling for an evangelical thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (&quot;If there is a Being&quot; [...] &quot;it stands to reason that He *may*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have something to say about this dream of Immortality we have...&quot; --

Remember our thread on spirituality &amp; religion &amp; the Singularity, about two
<br>
months ago?
<br>

<br>
During that conversation, one list member e-mailed me privately and shared
<br>
with me some of his thoughts on the matter.  He is a Christian and said he
<br>
did not feel comfortable sharing his thoughts with the list, because he felt
<br>
that in this group, admitting his Christianity would be uncomfortable for
<br>
him, and would cause his opinions on other things not to be taken
<br>
seriously....  His thoughts were interesting and the list would have
<br>
benefitted from them, I think.  Of course, I can't say who it is because he
<br>
asked me not to mention his name ;)  He is not one of the 20 top posters,
<br>
though.
<br>

<br>
As I have said before, I am not religious and I have a strong personal
<br>
emotional reaction against the superstitious &amp; conformist aspects of
<br>
religions.  However, I have a lot of respect for individual &amp; collective
<br>
spiritual experience, and I feel that individuals who are experienced in
<br>
this way may have a lot to contribute to our thinking about the Singularity.
<br>

<br>
In order to get at this contribution, however, it is necessary to be
<br>
reasonably tolerant of differences in language and style.  Sometimes I find
<br>
myself dismissing a statement made by a religious person, only to find,
<br>
through ongoing discussions, there is a variant of their statement that
<br>
*they* find basically equivalent, but *I* find much more agreeable...
