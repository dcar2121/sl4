Chris Rae said:
<br>
<em>&gt; AI developers must understand that freedom is the ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destiny for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire human race - not just a select minority,
</em><br>

<br>

<br>
This kind of language doesn't rub me the right way.
<br>

<br>
I don't think in terms of &quot;ultimate destiny&quot; at all.
<br>

<br>
Also, I remember a story by Kafka about a monkey that was stuck in a cage,
<br>
and developed human-level intelligence purely out of its desire to escape
<br>
from that cage.
<br>

<br>
There is a quote there something like: &quot;The monkey was not after freedom.
<br>
Freedom is a complicated abstraction.  What the monkey was looking for was a
<br>
way out.&quot;
<br>

<br>
I think that a lot of us monkeys are looking for a way out ;)
<br>

<br>
I agree that AGI and the Singularity overall should be developed with a view
<br>
toward helping all sentient beings, but &quot;ultimate destiny&quot; makes this sound
<br>
inevitable.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; and that the AI they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working to create can not and will not allow itself to be wielded to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement any pre-defined agenda other than liberation.
</em><br>

<br>
The idea that no AGI's will allow themselves to be used to implement agendas
<br>
besides liberation, just seems terribly overoptimistic to me.
<br>

<br>
How can you know this?
<br>

<br>
There is an awful lot we don't know about what AGI's will be like.
<br>

<br>
I think Eliezer is overconfident about the success of his Friendly AI
<br>
methodology, but you take overconfidence about the nature of future AI's to
<br>
a whole new level!!!!
<br>

<br>
Even when an AGI has transcended us, it may still end up carrying out some
<br>
of our agendas implicitly, via the influence of its initial condition on its
<br>
later state.
