----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Cliff Stabbert&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cps46@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20anonymous%20collaborative%20filtering">cps46@earthlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; For a while now I've been walking around with half an idea that I wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could figure out the second half for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The concept is roughly this:  a collaboratively filtered discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where *ideas* trump *people* by somehow having everything anonymous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A sort of IRC channel or newsgroup without FROM: identifications.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where *concepts* or posts furthering the discussion constructively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get &quot;voted up&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said, it's only half an idea, and I'm at a loss as to how,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely, to get this to work...
</em><br>
<p><p>I thought this was a pretty interesting idea, and I wound up losing a bit of
<br>
sleep thinking about how something like this might be made to work.
<br>
<p>One of the specific things that came to mind was the online forums of public
<br>
discourse that figure prominently in the novel *Ender's Game* by Orson Scott
<br>
Card.  These were very popular and had enormous sway over public opinion --
<br>
so much so, that two gifted children were able to wield a surprising deal of
<br>
influence...
<br>
<p>But one has to wonder how such forums could ever arise without collapsing
<br>
under the weight of petty human squabbles and inept, unintelligent posts.
<br>
Anonymity, I think, is just part of the answer.  Here are my ideas for such
<br>
a system, which I envision as a modified bulletin board:
<br>
<p>Rules (for enforcement, see below):
<br>
<p>--No user can intentionally try to eliminate the anonymity of themselves or
<br>
others.
<br>
--Posts must be reasonably well constructed, textually and
<br>
argumentatively -- making some kind of point rather than existing purely to
<br>
skew point values (see below).
<br>
--Hateful or obscene posts are not allowed.
<br>
--Posts must not exceed some set length (probably no more than a few hundred
<br>
words).
<br>
--Posts must relate to the subject category they were posted under (though
<br>
users can open new subject areas).
<br>
<p>All users can, in response to any post, award it 1 point, raising the value
<br>
of the post so that it rises higher up the rankings.  Users can, at any
<br>
point, remove a point they gave to a post, but cannot vote &quot;down&quot; a post.
<br>
The only way this can be done is by awarding a point to an attached
<br>
rebuttal, which has the effect of driving down the value of the original
<br>
post.  Users can post rebuttals to these rebuttals, however, in a
<br>
potentially endless chain...  For statistical purposes, each unique user
<br>
that views a post adds to a *read* total on the post.
<br>
<p>Immediately I can envision a number of interesting lists arranged not just
<br>
by post value, but by controversialness (total number of points on the
<br>
*post* and on the rebuttals -- providing post value is not too low), impact
<br>
(number of points on posts/rebuttals vs. number of reads) activity (number
<br>
of reads, posts, and points added over a given time frame), and size (total
<br>
number of rebuttals and counter rebuttals).
<br>
<p>To keep the whole thing from getting watered down, and to reduce the need
<br>
for moderators, users would need the ability to *flag* posts that they feel
<br>
violate any of the rules.  If a certain number of flags (depending on total
<br>
users, perhaps) are added to a post, the post is removed from the board.  If
<br>
the author of the post has a certain number of posts removed in this way,
<br>
the user can be temporarily or permanently banned from posting, flagging,
<br>
voting, or some combination of the three.  This means, of course, that the
<br>
system itself would need to track the origins of each post, even though
<br>
anonymity on the boards would remain one of the rules.  (Beware of hackers!)
<br>
<p>But with any kind of system like this there is a potential for abuse by
<br>
people who take out multiple accounts, either to artificially inflate the
<br>
value of their opinions or to get around flagging limitations.  I'm not sure
<br>
how to counter this -- perhaps by requiring the users log in and place votes
<br>
several times over several days before their points or flags can start
<br>
taking effect?  This would at least make the most heinous violations not
<br>
worth the effort (but could favor wealthy people who don't mind hiring peons
<br>
to do the grunt work).  If this kind of forum were taken to the level of an
<br>
actual public institution, then login names and passwords might be dished
<br>
out according to the same criteria as voting registrations to help prevent
<br>
abuse.
<br>
<p>Another consideration:  It seems likely that in an older forum, many users
<br>
would log in, only look at and participate in those ideas that are in the
<br>
higher in the rankings, and not waste their time with fresh posts.  This
<br>
could have the effect of making it very difficult for new ideas to rise to
<br>
the top of an old board.  To counter this, the system might require or ask
<br>
users to examine a few ideas each day/login that are selected randomly (or
<br>
semi-randomly, favoring newer posts).  This might also have the interesting
<br>
effect of exposing users to new ideas that they would otherwise never have
<br>
ventured near enough to read.
<br>
<p>It might also be useful to have different forums using slightly different
<br>
rule-sets, rather than trying to squeeze everything into one uber-forum.
<br>
For instance, some of the more scientific forums would require actual
<br>
evidence to be cited, rather than accepting purely philosophical
<br>
argumentation.  This might threaten the anonymity a bit, but not so much if
<br>
people are citing their own research the same way they would anyone else's.
<br>
The rebuttal system would act as peer review.  Could these forums be a
<br>
viable alternative for scientific journals?  I realize that there are some
<br>
online journals open to pretty much anyone, but am under the impression that
<br>
these suffer greatly for lack of filtering.
<br>
