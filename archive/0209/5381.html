Hi,
<br>
<p>I know there are some folks on this list who know the contemporary cognitive
<br>
neuroscience literature better than I do.
<br>
<p>For you guys, I have a question.
<br>
<p>I am interested in the variety of ways in which the brain may store learned
<br>
procedural knowledge (knowledge of how to do things -- these could be motor
<br>
actions, or they could be cognitive actions, etc.).
<br>
<p>How well-demonstrated is it that the brain uses several different types of
<br>
representation for the same procedure?
<br>
<p>Are there known cases in which the brain uses more than one representation
<br>
for the same procedure, because the different representations suit different
<br>
purposes?
<br>
<p>Is it the case that some common procedure-representation-schemes provide
<br>
faster procedure execution than others, and that some provide richer
<br>
integration with other parts of the brain than others?
<br>
<p>Are those procedure-representation-schemes providing richer integration,
<br>
also slower?
<br>
<p>I know there is good evidence for a neural distinction between procedural,
<br>
episodic and declarative memory.  But I haven't seen much of anything on
<br>
distinctions between different kinds of procedural memory.
<br>
<p>I know that knowledge is &quot;routinized&quot;, eg. once you get good at serving a
<br>
tennis ball or walking or whatever, your body handles the process in a
<br>
different way than before when you were learning.  But is it known whether
<br>
the routinized knowledge, as represented in the brain, has fewer connections
<br>
back to the rest of the brain than the pre-routinized knowledge?
<br>
<p>I am asking this stuff because I'm rewriting the section of my in-process
<br>
book on Novamente about procedures.  Novamente has two different
<br>
representations for procedures, one of which provides rich integration with
<br>
other parts of the system, the other of which provides fast execution.  Some
<br>
procedures may be represented the one way, some the other way, and some
<br>
both.
<br>
<p>I'd like to be able to say something, on a general level, about the relation
<br>
between this kind of &quot;dual representation&quot; for procedures, and how
<br>
procedural knowledge is dealt with in the brain.
<br>
<p>If this kind of question is just beyond the scope of contemporary
<br>
neuroscience, that's OK. That's basically what I've said in the current
<br>
rough draft of the book.  I just want to be a little more certain I'm not
<br>
wrong.
<br>
<p>I'm going to run the whole book past a friend who's a prominent
<br>
neuroscientist, before publication, to be sure I haven't made any brain
<br>
science goofs.  But he happens not to be available at the moment....  [And I
<br>
hasten to add, for those who aren't familiar with Novamente as described on
<br>
www.realai.net, that Novamente is NOT based on detailed emulation of the
<br>
human brain, although the human brain has certainly been inspirational for
<br>
the design in many ways.]
