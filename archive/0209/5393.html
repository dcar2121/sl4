Altered states of consciousness are boring.  They're fun to play around 
<br>
with for a while, until you realize that you can do more interesting 
<br>
thinks that getting a new vantage point.  For example, in high school I 
<br>
often slept in Calculus class (mostly due to lack of sleep due to my 
<br>
rigorous schedule and because we never did much beyond two dimensional 
<br>
integration so it wasn't very hard) and noticed that my `altered state 
<br>
of consciousness' of being only 25% awake had the effect of allowing me 
<br>
to see through problems to find the most efficient answer.  Well, yeah, 
<br>
that was neat and all, but there wasn't much that I could do with it 
<br>
other than solve a problem a little faster.
<br>

<br>
There are much more fundamental changes that you can make, though.  Will 
<br>
your `consciousness' be altered?  No, but the stuff that's going on 
<br>
*behind* the consciousness is where things get interesting.  You can 
<br>
learn to think better and more in tune with reality.
<br>

<br>
This is what bothers me about the idea of altering your state of 
<br>
consciousness.  It doesn't accomplish anything.  All it does is distort 
<br>
reality in a different way than your normal state of consciousness 
<br>
does.  Perhaps after a trip or getting high, you will notice that the 
<br>
only reason the altered state of consciousness was neat was because you 
<br>
could notice that it didn't match up with reality, whereas normally you 
<br>
don't notice the mismatch.  Most likely not.
