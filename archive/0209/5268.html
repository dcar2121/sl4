</em><br>
<p>Historically, technology changes were slow enough
<br>
that people could migrate to other careers or simply
<br>
carry on what they were doing until they ended their
<br>
careers.  For example, the transition from
<br>
animal-power
<br>
to tractors for farming occurred over about 2
<br>
generations.  So the transition from having half the
<br>
workforce being farmers to less than 4% today was
<br>
managed partly by people leaving the farms for the
<br>
industrial cities, and partly by farmers (or their
<br>
heirs) selling out to consolidate properties into
<br>
larger units that can be worked by machines.
<br>
<p>We used to have a typing pool and a graphics
<br>
department at Boeing when I started 20 years ago.
<br>
Now we have Word and Powerpoint.  Those people
<br>
now are training coordinators or web page maintainers.
<br>
You train and adapt, or you can end up working
<br>
at WalMart.
<br>
<p>The issues I see are:
<br>
<p>(1) What will happen when large swaths of low-level
<br>
jobs get automated?  I mean the things like stock
<br>
clerks and cashiers, that typically have lower skill
<br>
levels.  If you end up with lots of people who can't
<br>
or won't upgrade their skills, what are they going
<br>
to do with themselves?
<br>
<p>(2) What happens when the pace of change outpaces
<br>
peoples' ability to adapt by learning new skills?
<br>
<p>Whether these issues matter depends on how long they
<br>
will exist before the Singularity hits.  In the short
<br>
term, they can be managed by redistributing the
<br>
fruits of productivity.  This can be done privately
<br>
(the well off get servants again) or publically
<br>
(some form of welfare).
