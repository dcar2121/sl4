TK&gt; I can upload myself:
<br>
TK&gt;
<br>
TK&gt;  - A - with all my memories
<br>
TK&gt;  - B - with some of my memories
<br>
TK&gt;  - C - with no memories at all
<br>
TK&gt;  - D - with the memories of somebody else
<br>
TK&gt;
<br>
TK&gt; In _all_ those cases - I am upladed. Most people think, that A and
<br>
TK&gt; maybe B are only enough. That the continuity of the self is
<br>
TK&gt; preserved (only) this way.  
<br>

<br>
I wonder about case C.  Leaving aside the idea that the &quot;Collective
<br>
Unconscious&quot; might contain racial memories, humans aren't born as a
<br>
blank slate.  Like other animals, we have instincts, we have
<br>
tendencies to develop in certain ways, etc.  Our personal
<br>
consciousness is very bound up in those things.  And our memories of the
<br>
womb play, according to a number of people, a large role in our later
<br>
psychological development (they are the beginning of our psychological
<br>
development).  They might not be story-type memories, and we might not
<br>
be able to access them consciously, but they're there.
<br>

<br>
How many layers do you strip away?  Is the consciousness that is the
<br>
same in me as in you also the same as the consciousness in a dog?  In
<br>
a bat?  In an ant?
