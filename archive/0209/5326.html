</em><br>
<p>I believe this is hookysun's point, except that he skips over the detour.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Instead our situation is more like on in which there are 6 billion
</em><br>
<em> &gt; people in the stables, a small handful of them are working on the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; hollow log strategem, and a small handful of them are spooning out
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; spooning or the log are better is silly, when both are so
</em><br>
<em> &gt; under-resourced compared to what they should be.
</em><br>
<p>No.  A *large* handful, as in millions of people and multi-billion-dollar
<br>
foundations, are spooning out dung, and a *tiny* handful, as in a couple
<br>
of hundred, are working on the hollow log.
<br>
<p>I have absolutely no qualms about saying that the hollow log is enormously
<br>
under-resourced as compared to the spoons.  Now obviously both the
<br>
loggers and the spooners are the Good Guys, together, but it would be
<br>
moral cowardice not to have the guts to say:  &quot;You know, if you're just
<br>
getting into the Good Guy business for the first time, think about logging.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because in actual cold hard solid fact, I think that becoming a logger has 
<br>
an enormously larger effect than being a spooner, mostly because there are 
<br>
so many *more* spooners than loggers.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; So, getting back to the real world, I think that BOTH
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a) singularity-oriented R&amp;D
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; b) genuine efforts to raise of the consciousness of human beings
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; are under-resourced in our society, compared to what would be optimal.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Which is more under-resourced depends on interpretation of borderline
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cases. (Which research counts as singularity-oriented --- do we count
</em><br>
<em> &gt; work on faster microprocessors?  Which work counts as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; consciousness-raising -- do we count the yoga studio on the corner?)
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  You can refuse to judge if you like.  I think that we should look
<br>
at all ongoing efforts, judge the probabilistic payoff to sentient life of
<br>
joining each one, and join the best.  This is a Categorical Imperative OK
<br>
strategy - it works if &quot;everyone does it&quot; - because you aren't
<br>
automatically joining the project that seems &quot;best&quot;, but rather joining
<br>
the project that combines the greatest degree of promise with the greatest
<br>
effect you can have on it.  If one project grows too large and threatens
<br>
to suck up all the resources, individuals following this strategy will
<br>
tend to join small struggling projects because they expect to have a
<br>
greater impact here.
<br>
<p>Of course, because the current distribution of efforts is so wildly
<br>
unbalanced, the issue doesn't really arise; Singularity research is the
<br>
least funded *and* most promising approach.  I mention the above simply to
<br>
argue that this kind of thinking works even if everyone does it.
