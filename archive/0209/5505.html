Gordon,
<br>

<br>
You say
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Rationality is not opposed to many of the things that people have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming that it is opposed to.  Rationality is not opposed to `higher'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or `altered' states of consciousness per se.  Rationality is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to those things which separate you from reality and from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.
</em><br>

<br>
You have talked about rationality a lot on this list, but you haven't
<br>
defined it in such a way that I can really understand what you mean by the
<br>
word.
<br>

<br>
Furthermore, it seemed to me in some previous discussions that you and
<br>
Eliezer meant subtly different things by the term.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Can things be done now to make acceptance of the Singularity easier?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Possibly.  When it actually happens, though, I bet everyone on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will still be shocked to see it actually happening.  Rather than trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prepare people for the Singularity, your time would be better spent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually making the Singularity happen by recruiting, raising money,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coding AI, etc..
</em><br>

<br>
I don't think one can responsibly make a blanket statement like that.  There
<br>
is a lot of uncertainty about the Singularity, and it's quite plausible that
<br>
preparing people mentally and emotionally for the Singularity will help the
<br>
Singularity to go down better.  For example, people who are better-prepared
<br>
for the Singularity are less likely to try to pass laws halting
<br>
Singularity-pertinent research, to try to blow up researchers doing useful
<br>
Singularity-ward work, etc.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Humans are not addicted to Zero-Sum games.
</em><br>

<br>
Some humans certainly are!!!
<br>
