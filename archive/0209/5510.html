<p>
Aaron,
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Anyone who thinks humanity can be prepared for the singularity doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand what singularity means.
</em><br>

<br>
I totally disagree with this statement Aaron. The singularity is NOT about 
<br>
technology, it is about FREEDOM of the human race from suffering. Since my 
<br>
last post, approximately 30,000 children under the age of 5 have died as a 
<br>
result of malnutrition or preventable disease. In case you haven't noticed, 
<br>
outside of the 'free' world, life is defined by hardship, misery and suffering.
<br>

<br>
Lets say -hypothetically of course - I hand you (Aaron) a true AI entity 
<br>
that is able to improve its own processing capability. What exactly are you 
<br>
going to do with it? Sure, it can provide you with everything you ever 
<br>
dreamed of, but what about the other 6 billion people on this planet? What 
<br>
is their fate? Are you going to allow these people to choose their own 
<br>
destiny, or are you going to force your version of what's best on them?
<br>

<br>
For example, when a human rights group used FORCE to stop an ancient ritual 
<br>
that involved the mutilation of female genitalia as a right of passage, it 
<br>
was the women who fought back claiming it was their right and no one had 
<br>
the authority to take that away, even though the human rights group was 
<br>
acting in the best interest of the women.
<br>

<br>
My point is, if/when singularity occurs, it can't be forced on the general 
<br>
population, they must willingly accept the technology. IMO, creating the 
<br>
technology necessary to achieve singularity is only half the battle, the 
<br>
other half is convincing the people it is going to improve their lives. The 
<br>
true goal of the singularity is in fact to improve peoples lives, isn't it?
<br>

<br>

<br>
Chris
<br>

<br>
