<em>&gt; I do not think it's reasonable to call Bayes' Theorem a &quot;force&quot;!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a mathematical theorem, a modeling tool, and an observed pattern 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe on many different scales...
</em><br>

<br>
Rationality is employed in nonaccidently successful processes.  Because 
<br>
of their nonaccidental nature, there must be something guiding them in 
<br>
the right direction.  If you examine enough examples I think you'll find 
<br>
that the BPT exists as that guiding force.  Keep in mind that you may 
<br>
not see the BPT applied explicitly; evolution can be modeled using the 
<br>
BPT, since it is a directed process that ends in nonaccidental success 
<br>
(yes, evolution really did mean to make more Blue Whales).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; required for all nonaccidental successes to occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; work:  any nonaccidental success, where success is defined as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; completion of a process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Let U be the set of all processes in the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Let T be the proper subset of U that is equal to the set of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; processes in U that work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If x is a member of T, then x draws upon rationality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have now created the problem of defining what &quot;work&quot; means, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.  Also of defining &quot;completion.&quot;
</em><br>

<br>
I thought you might object here, so here is a full definition of work:
<br>

<br>
&quot;nonaccidental truthfinding, or nonaccidental correlation of a given 
<br>
representation with an aspect of external reality; plus nonaccidental 
<br>
achievement, defined as the nonaccidental convergence of an aspect of 
<br>
external reality to a given goal pattern&quot; (Eliezer Yudkowsky)
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Any subset of the universe that changes over time may be said to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a &quot;process&quot;.  If the moon crashes into the sun, is this to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational?  It's a process which comes to completion....  So by your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition, it seems that yes, this is rational.  But this doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accord
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my understanding of rationality at all...
</em><br>

<br>
Look at the definition of work I just gave you.  If you still think that 
<br>
this could be rational, why?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As an aside, if you're curious why T is a proper subset of U, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because the Universe is by default arational and, for example, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; formation of stars and planets in no way draws upon rationality; all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; those successes were accidental.  The Universe, as far as we know, did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not set out with the goal of creating Earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making T a proper subset of Universe does not achieve what you seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it does.  After all, the universe minus one molecule is a proper subset 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe...
</em><br>

<br>
I don't think it accomplishes anything.  Just a side discussion of why I 
<br>
said proper subset rather than subset for anyone who might not be able 
<br>
to see it.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; leave the memetic battles to those like Kurzweil who are interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not only SL4 technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as it happens, I *am* interested in many things besides SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology....  For example, pygmies, Russian literature, peculiar piano
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chords, and cactus flesh and pot-bellied pigs.  [And -- well, no I won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even get into that, there may be minors on this list... ;-&gt;]  So what???
</em><br>

<br>
Do you spend time getting excited about the potential of flying cars and 
<br>
spaceships to mars?  Or do you find those things boring because you are 
<br>
actively trying to create things that are much more exciting.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If you want the Singularity to happen you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be doing what you can to work towards it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally AM, but I don't believe this is the optimal path for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone...
</em><br>

<br>
If a person wants to see the Singularity happen and is capable of 
<br>
contributing to it's creation, under what conditions would working 
<br>
towards the Singularity not be an optimal path?
