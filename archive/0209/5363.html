Hi,
<br>
<p>Actually, Webmind Inc. had two different applications analyzing financial
<br>
message boards, for two different purposes.
<br>
<p>The Webmind Market Predictor looked for statistical patterns relating
<br>
<p>-- the words, phrases and concepts expressed in text (daily news,
<br>
messageboard posts, etc.) on days (n-k,...,n-1)
<br>
-- the prices of various financial instruments on days (n-k,...,n-1)
<br>
-- the price of a target financial instrume on day n
<br>
<p>In fact, we did not find messageboard posts to be of significant predictive
<br>
value in the markets on which our system was most successful.  The only text
<br>
source we used consistently was daily news.  That financial prediction
<br>
system is now in use by Advanced Prediction Corp. based in Greenwich
<br>
Connecticut; I have no connection with it at this time.  It seemed to work
<br>
well, but in late 1999 we shifted our business model away from financial
<br>
prediction to Internet information retrieval (an error, in hindsight, but it
<br>
seemed to make sense at the time).
<br>
<p>For those who haven't heard my tale of the end of Webmind Inc. already, see
<br>
www.goertzel.org/webmind.htm or
<br>
<a href="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/WakingUpFromTheEconomyOfDreams.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/WakingUpFromTheEconomyOfDreams.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>The Webmind Classification System, a document categorization engine, was
<br>
used in many different context by different customers.  We were working on a
<br>
deal with Yahoo! Finance to use it to categorize messageboard postings into
<br>
different categories (but our stuff never made it onto the Yahoo! site).  A
<br>
company called Netcurrents was using it to survey messageboards and extract
<br>
information pertinent to particular companies.  For instance, if the CEO of
<br>
HP subscribed to Netcurrents, he'd get a special password-protected Web page
<br>
to log onto, which would contain
<br>
<p>-- pointers to everything said about him and his company on the
<br>
messageboards that day
<br>
-- a summary of the &quot;sentiment&quot; of messages (e.g. pos. or neg. about
<br>
earnings, pos. or neg. about management, etc. etc.)
<br>
<p>Doing automated classification of news articles by topic (as we did for some
<br>
customers, such as Screaming Media in New York) is relatively easy; doing
<br>
automated classification of messageboard rants by sentiment was a lot
<br>
harder, but netcurrents and Yahoo! Finance did not require anywhere near
<br>
100% accuracy.
<br>
<p>In my current AI project, www.realai.net (Novamente), I am not doing any
<br>
text analysis stuff at the moment.  It's a bit of a digression from the path
<br>
to real AI, in the sense that the only &quot;real&quot; way to do text analysis is to
<br>
have a system that truly understanding linguistic terms via their (direct or
<br>
inferential) grounding in its own experience.  On the other hand, from
<br>
building these apps and doing other language and text processing research,
<br>
we gained a lot of understanding of how language understanding and
<br>
production relate to other cognitive functions.
<br>
<p>For example, we worked out a very neat reduction of grammar parsing to
<br>
probabilistic logical unification (building on the work of many others in
<br>
&quot;unification feature structure grammars&quot;), which basically shows that, if
<br>
you've got
<br>
<p>a) probabilistic logical unification
<br>
b) the ability to learn fairly simple schemata for reordering lists
<br>
<p>then you've got full syntactic capability.  This is not mathematically deep,
<br>
but it was useful to work it out in a very detailed way, seeing that it
<br>
works pragmatically on various examples etc.  However, this was R&amp;D stuff
<br>
and neither of the two above-mentioned products used our unification feature
<br>
structure grammar parser, because it was too slow to meet real-world
<br>
response times.  Instead we used simpler methods based on statistical
<br>
analysis, machine learning categorization, context-free grammar parsing, and
<br>
some simple probabilistic inference.
<br>
<p>My work on computational finance in the period 1997-1999 taught me that
<br>
there is a LOT of structure out there in the world -- even the human
<br>
socioeconomic world -- that humans do not perceive.  Of course, this is old
<br>
knowledge in the financial world, which is why such a huge percentage of the
<br>
trading going on out there is program trading.  But it's interesting to get
<br>
a feel for such things at first hand.
<br>
<p>This underlies my intuition that, in the future, an AGI with human-level but
<br>
nonhuman intelligence will be able to clean up on the financial markets.  We
<br>
may see laws emerging banning such activity, at some point.  Though these
<br>
laws may only hold for a short time, if the hard takeoff idea is right and
<br>
human-level intelligence is rapidly followed by dramatically superhuman
<br>
intelligence.

<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IIRC, WebMind had an application that parsed the stock message boards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determine the general consensus on whether people thought a stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; buy or sell. A system that can detect arbitrary ideas from many human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sources seems to me like a general pattern recognition problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specific pattern recognition such as &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;sell&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cheers,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could WebMind identify when stocks were being puffed up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple messages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from dummy accounts being used by single individuals trying to &quot;pump then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dump&quot; a stock? Some teenagers were caught doing this and, because of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age, actually got away with keeping some of their ill-gotten gains and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without doing any jail time.
