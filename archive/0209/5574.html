<br>
SA&gt; As I see it, the basic problem is the same for people highly 
<br>
SA&gt; privileged relative to others is to show clearly that their real 
<br>
SA&gt; quality of life will rise further in a world of true abundance 
<br>
SA&gt; than in the world based around scarcity in which their 
<br>
SA&gt; differential status was gained.
<br>

<br>
To clarify, by &quot;people and organizations in a position of privilege&quot;
<br>
I don't mean the (say) approx. 10% of the world population in a
<br>
relative position of privilege.  I mean the, what, &lt;1% who &quot;have
<br>
power&quot; over the rest, and who I fear are close-to-chronically addicted
<br>
to such power (and its corresponding belief that one is not doing well
<br>
unless others are doing worse, or any other number of metaphors for
<br>
higher/lower status).  My concern rests both on that entrenched if
<br>
incorrect belief and the real-world power such entities have (to e.g.,
<br>
shut down research or mobilize public opinion against it).
<br>

<br>
I agree with you that showing abundance as a win-win in general is
<br>
important and in many cases possible.
