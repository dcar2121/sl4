ESY&gt; Suppose that I did tend to focus more on material poverty if I

ESY&gt; were experiencing it.  That supervention of my wired-in
<br>
ESY&gt; chimpanzee priorities is not necessarily more correct.  I might
<br>
ESY&gt; as well say to some Third Worlder &quot;You might consider material
<br>
ESY&gt; poverty less serious if you lived here.&quot;  For that matter, I
<br>
ESY&gt; could also be tortured until I considered ending the pain to be
<br>
ESY&gt; the most important thing in the universe.  So what?
<br>

<br>
The difference between these two examples, of course, is that vast
<br>
numbers of human beings *are* living in extreme material poverty, many
<br>
to the point of malnourishment, etc.  I agree that there's a bigger
<br>
picture here, i.e. your earlier statement that
<br>

<br>
ESY&gt; the most important forms of poverty are not monetary poverty but
<br>
ESY&gt; intelligence poverty, lifespan poverty, and the lack of other
<br>
ESY&gt; resources which are currently so hard to obtain that people tend
<br>
ESY&gt; not to think of their absence as &quot;poverty&quot; but simply &quot;the human
<br>
ESY&gt; condition&quot;. 
<br>

<br>
...but I don't think *monetary* poverty is what was meant by &quot;material&quot;
<br>
poverty -- rather, the direct, moment-to-moment suffering related to
<br>
lacking the basics of survival.  In that sense, it's not really a
<br>
matter of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; importance but a component (or perhaps
<br>
prerequisite) of the above, at least as long as we're stuck in these
<br>
bodies.
