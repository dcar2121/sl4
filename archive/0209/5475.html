<br>
Well, there is a difference between humans &amp; general AI's in this context.
<br>

<br>
If one has a general AI that does not have the power to protect itself from
<br>
being stolen (having the hardware it's running on moved to a different
<br>
place; having its software copied and replicated elsewhere, etc.), then one
<br>
probably has a general AI that can't protect itself from having its code
<br>
rewritten, its mind force-fed with false knowledge, etc.
<br>

<br>
Brainwashing a kidnapped human is a difficult and sometimes probably
<br>
impossible task. Brainwashing a kidnapped general AI may be much easier if
<br>
the kidnappers are expert programmers and computer/cognitive scientists and
<br>
have some understanding of the AI design.
<br>

<br>
Of course, this risk is most pertinent in the transition period when
<br>
near-human-level AI is there and significantly transhuman AI is not...
