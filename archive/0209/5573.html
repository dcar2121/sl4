Um... a whole bunch.  There are the individual emotional tones that make
<br>
you happy when you help other people; those would be the most obvious 
<br>
ones.  Some of the more subtle, semantic, and structural characteristics 
<br>
that are (if I recall directly) described in CFAI at various points include:
<br>

<br>
Substitution for speaker deixis in moral arguments.  Joe says:  &quot;My 
<br>
philosophy is look out for Joe&quot;; it is interpreted as &quot;Joe advocates the 
<br>
philosophy &quot;Look out for [number one]&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Representation of moral beliefs as being part of the common pool of 
<br>
beliefs and working just like any other beliefs, with support, 
<br>
antisupport, truth or falsity, etc.
<br>

<br>
Rule of derivative validity - if something is moral there must be a valid 
<br>
reason why it is moral, and there must be a valid reason why that reason 
<br>
is valid, etc.  In the same way, if something is true, there must be a 
<br>
valid reason why it is true, and so on; if there's an effect, it must have 
<br>
a cause, and the cause must have a cause, and so on.  (I'm not talking 
<br>
about whether this is how philosophy *should* work; I'm talking about the 
<br>
way we *do* think about it by default, bearing in mind that by default we 
<br>
generally stop examining the chain at some point and just don't think 
<br>
about extending it any further.  This is a little reflex that exists in 
<br>
the mind.  Whether it is logically self-consistent, or can be made so, is 
<br>
a wholly separate issue.)
<br>

<br>
Putting yourself in the other guy's shoes.  I didn't spend enough time on 
<br>
this effect in CFAI.
<br>

<br>
Knowing what at least some of these processes are, specifically, is a big 
<br>
help in Friendly AI; what is *vital* in Friendly AI is knowing how to tell 
<br>
an AI:  &quot;Here's an effect called 'altruism'; your job when you grow up 
<br>
will be to discover all its causes, including the ones your programmers 
<br>
didn't know about.&quot;
