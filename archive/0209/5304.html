<p>This doesn't particularly bother me, actually.  Anyone who hears the
<br>
phrase &quot;Friendly AI&quot; without bothering to look into it in depth is likely 
<br>
to think that it means Asimov Laws.  As misunderstandings go, this one is 
<br>
inevitable and not really all that bad.  It just means that people who 
<br>
already know that Asimov Laws are bad look up Friendly AI and find out 
<br>
it's not Asimov Laws, and people who don't know that Asimov Laws are bad 
<br>
look up Friendly AI and find out Asimov Laws are bad.  I think in this 
<br>
case I'm just glad to have been mentioned, regardless of whether matters 
<br>
were oversimplified.
