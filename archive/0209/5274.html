<p>Ben, there is a difference between working at a full-time job that happens 
<br>
to (in belief or in fact) benefit the Singularity; and explicitly 
<br>
beginning from the Singularity as a starting point and choosing your 
<br>
actions accordingly, before the fact rather than afterward.
<br>
<p>This goes back to what I see as the split between Singularity activism on 
<br>
the one hand - which involves explicit consideration of the Singularity as 
<br>
such, and the taking of strategic actions that are chosen from among the 
<br>
possible alternatives explicitly because those actions are most effective 
<br>
at bringing about the Singularity - and spiritual futurism on the other 
<br>
hand, which sees in the Singularity a philosophical justification for 
<br>
whatever you were doing anyway; showing how your job has a hitherto 
<br>
unsuspected impact that contributes to a good, worthwhile, and genuinely 
<br>
meaningful future of which you were previously completely unaware; which 
<br>
all happens to be absolutely true, but in the absence of activism saves no 
<br>
further lives and makes no additional progress, except for whatever 
<br>
(admittedly justified) emotional comfort may be provided by the perception 
<br>
of work as contributing to the Singularity.
<br>
<p>I trust that someone is thinking rationally about the Singularity, as 
<br>
opposed to rationalizing, when I see that they are willing to make major 
<br>
*new* life decisions explicitly on the basis of how it affects the 
<br>
Singularity.  Going on doing whatever you would be doing anyway may 
<br>
contribute greatly to the Singularity - who knows, maybe more than all 
<br>
SIAI will ever do; it could be a fact - but unless Singularity 
<br>
considerations, considered explicitly as such before the fact, direct your 
<br>
daily work, the Singularity is not your day job.
