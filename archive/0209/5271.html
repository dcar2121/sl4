<p>
Hello everybody,
<br>
<p>Last Wednesday, in #SL4's monthly chat, I've been introduced by Eliezer as the 
<br>
new SIAI's Volunteer Coordinator. So I guess it's about time to make this JOIN 
<br>
post - I have lurked around for two months already, but I'm still a bit 
<br>
impressed by the extremely high quality of some people's posts. Well, I'll do 
<br>
my best.
<br>
<p>You may call me Chris. I'm 30 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm 
<br>
supposed to be an Electronic Engineer - a career where you learn a bit of 
<br>
everything related to science &amp; technology, but you end up knowing nothing. 
<br>
And I never worked for any tech corporation. Instead, I kept on studying: 
<br>
mostly Philosophy - where you better learn nothing, because you should end up 
<br>
*knowing* you know nothing. I always embraced the ascetic ideal: try to keep 
<br>
my life free of unessencial stuff. I don't care about social status or 
<br>
self-image. I do care about doing the right thing - not that I know what *is* 
<br>
the right thing, but I definitely want to find out.
<br>
<p>Since I was in college I've been aware that my life was ruled by this vague 
<br>
compulsion of *maximizing something*. Of course I had not the slightest idea 
<br>
of what that &quot;something&quot; could be, but still. This attitude made me a very 
<br>
eclectic man, a sort of living Montecarlo algorithm. Roughly, I've become an 
<br>
amateur philosopher (a somewhat redundant expression), an amateur computer 
<br>
programmer, and an amateur musician. I also did some graphic design - for 
<br>
money. And I recently had a negative experience as an entrepreneur - dishonest 
<br>
partners.
<br>
<p>Artificial Intelligence, among Philosophy and science-fiction, has been one of 
<br>
my main sources of intellectual pleasure. I was not a serious researcher at 
<br>
all, I just tried to stay in touch with it, occasionally reading books and 
<br>
papers, and playing with Prolog or neural networks. Fortunately, I learned 
<br>
enough as to understand Eliezer's theoretical works, and to notice how 
<br>
radically innovative and promising they are. (I'm curious about the other Real 
<br>
AI approaches; I just couldn't read them yet.)
<br>
<p>I believe the Singularity is near and that I can make a substantial positive 
<br>
contribution to the Singularitarian cause, so I decided to work full-time as a 
<br>
volunteer - for the rest of my human life. My family is willing to support me, 
<br>
since my spending is almost negligible and my work - who knows - might 
<br>
literally make everybody's dreams come true.
<br>
<p><p>-*-
<br>
<p><p>The following is a fairly skippable self-mini-interview that I just did for 
<br>
the SL4 list. If you're short of time, just abort reading. (You have been 
<br>
warned!)
<br>
<p><p>&quot;So, how/when did you know about the Singularity?&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd say it was a combination of curiosity and luck. Four months ago I was very 
<br>
excited about the Semantic Web - IMO, it might allow some kind of world-wide 
<br>
radical social change (but that's another story). Nosing around SW-related 
<br>
stuff, I incidentally bumped into the SIAI's home page... Woah... The world 
<br>
has been upside-up since then.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;And then what?&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, after a week of wild enthusiasm, I began to notice that something went 
<br>
wrong: no matter how much effort and care I put into explaining the 
<br>
Singularity to the people I knew, nobody would really give a damn about it. 
<br>
They would just refuse to look at it!
<br>
<p><p>&quot;I guess we'll have to wait until they see it on TV.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes. It's very sad, actually. There are probably thousands of people who could 
<br>
be *very* useful to the Singularity, if they only had the chance to know what 
<br>
it is. I got to do something about it.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Would you briefly describe your main influences?&quot;
<br>
<p>When I was a kid I was a Jules Verne addict. In my teens, Carl Sagan and Isaac 
<br>
Asimov replaced my Catholic faith with a scientific world-view. I also read a 
<br>
lot of Asimov's science-fiction. Later, Herman Hesse and Jiddu Krishnamurti 
<br>
gave me a kind of spiritualist view of life, centered in self-knowledge and 
<br>
harmony with cosmos. A few years ago, a friend of mine got me into Richard 
<br>
Stallman's Free Software Movement. His pragmatic altruism and hacker ethic 
<br>
made him a role model for me. Michel Houellebecq wrote The Elementary 
<br>
Particles, which beautifully shows how &quot;intelligence is the essence of 
<br>
revolution&quot;. Last year I discovered Evolutionary Psychology and Memetics. And 
<br>
then the Principia Cybernetica web-site and the Global Brain theory. Eliezer 
<br>
Yudkowsky did the rest.
<br>
<p><p>(To the reader) &quot;Thank you for your time and attention.&quot;
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>-- Christian Rovner
