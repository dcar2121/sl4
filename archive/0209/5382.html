<em>&gt;  &gt; There are plenty of  potential donors interested in hi-tech stuff out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; there right now -- people who are &quot;sorta interested&quot; in possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; donating to things like SIAI or Real AI Institute.  It's just a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; too offbeat and a little too speculative... it might not take that much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; of A or B to improve the situation significantly...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, yes, if you're going after the great mass of people who are &quot;sorta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested&quot;.  But there *are* some people in the world who are capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being more than just &quot;sorta interested&quot;.  To be honest, Ben, I often get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the impression that you are &quot;sorta interested&quot; yourself, in which case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's understandable that you'd want to work on this level.  Going beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sorta interested&quot; requires being beyond &quot;sorta interested&quot; yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to be able to communicate that feeling to others.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, whatever success I've had at raising funds myself in the past, has
<br>
been largely because of my obvious enthusiasm for the long-term implications
<br>
of my work.  Whether or not I've always used the term &quot;Singularity&quot; to
<br>
describe these long-term implications.  (let's face it, the term has some
<br>
real baggage associated with it, and is not always socially advisable)
<br>
<p>It has been obvious to everyone who has ever worked with me, or donated or
<br>
invested money in things I've been involved with, that I am more than &quot;sorta
<br>
interested&quot; in AGI and its potential to transcend humanity and reality as we
<br>
know it.
<br>
<p>But I am a bit tired of defending myself against your ongoing statements
<br>
that I'm somehow not as interested or dedicated or Singularity-aware as you
<br>
are.   could argue that I've spent a lot more years devoted to
<br>
Singularity-relevant work than you have, so there is much more proof of my
<br>
own interest and devotion than your own.  But what is the use of this sort
<br>
of yammering? I won't extend this paragraph any further.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I know you don't believe there's an important distinction, Ben.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I may not see the same distinction as you do, but I DO see a
<br>
distinction between
<br>
<p>A) people who are spending the bulk of their lives on pushing toward the
<br>
Singularity, and
<br>
<p>B) those who interested in the Singularity and consider it plausible and
<br>
potentially important, but not to the extent of focusing most of their
<br>
energies on it
<br>
<p>However, I don't think that someone has to be in category A in order to
<br>
donate money to Singularitarian causes.
<br>
<p>And I think this is fortunate, because category B is going to be a lot
<br>
larger for quite a while... probably until the Singularity is truly
<br>
beginning to unfold...
<br>
<p>The distinction between MY distinction and YOUR distinction is
<br>
<p>-- I place both you and myself in category A
<br>
<p>-- You place yourself in your analogue of category A, and me in your
<br>
analogue of category B
<br>
<p>It seems that you're setting up a category something like
<br>
<p>A') Those who have convinced themselves that they are carrying out every
<br>
single one of their actions in the cause of bringing about a positive
<br>
Singularity, because this is the most rational way to carry out their
<br>
altruistic motives.
<br>
<p>To me, category A is a lot more interesting than category A'.  I can tell
<br>
what someone is doing, whereas I can't tell whether their convictions about
<br>
their own motivations are delusional or not.  I judge your
<br>
Singularity-devotedness by what I see you do, not by what you say about your
<br>
motivations.  I try to avoid making inferences about others' motivations,
<br>
because when you get beyond the obvious level, such inferences are of
<br>
necessity highly unconfident.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the benefit of those of us who do see a distinction, it's worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observing that the donors we need may *not* be the great mass of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are potentially sorta interested and will probably not be actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested until after the problem is mostly solved.  The people we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get started are probably the small percentage who are willing to walk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the path of rational altruism - the people who have personalities strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough *not* to need approving friends in order to donate.  That small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage can still be a very large pool in absolute terms.  It's a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet.
</em><br>
<p>I think that is a very, very narrow and idealistic fundraising strategy.  I
<br>
wish you luck with it, though.
<br>
<p>I agree that anyone likely to donate to Singularitarian causes is likely
<br>
going to be someone interested in rational altruism -- *to some extent*.
<br>
<p>But this doesn't mean that all likely donors will fall into my Category A
<br>
above.
<br>
<p>And it definitely doesn't mean that all likely donors will meet your
<br>
criterion (A') for being a true Singularitarian.
