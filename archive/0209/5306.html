</em><br>
<em> &gt; reach Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>What are you going to do that hasn't been tried in the last 50,000 years?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, us AIfolk have to deal with the shadow of fifty years of
<br>
failure; everyone wants to know what we're going to do that hasn't been
<br>
tried before.  You have to dig yourself out from under the heap of other
<br>
people's failures; show that your thinking is new enough not to belong in
<br>
the trash heap with the things that have been tried before.
<br>
<p>Why is your thinking that new?  Why are your plans that original?
<br>
<p>Understand, I am not asking this in order to be difficult.  I can think of
<br>
at least three things you could try, in terms of promoting greater human
<br>
enlightenment before the Singularity, that have never been tried before. 
<br>
What I want to know is what *you're* thinking of.
<br>
<p>It doesn't do much good to issue calls to action without a strategy that
<br>
promises to work.  Not a strategy that *sounds* good.  Not a strategy
<br>
that blazes like a banner and uplifts your heart.  A strategy which,
<br>
unlike the stuff that's been previously tried over the last 50,000 years,
<br>
will actually work.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I am probably expressing this inadequately.  But I believe that we
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sometimes make the mistake of overemphasizing the intellect side of SAI
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  and underemphasizing its &quot;heart&quot; - the deep appreciation, caring for,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  compassion for, nurturing of all.  A god sized being without that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; would be extremely problematic. Our conceptions of SAI are in danger of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; being unbalanced in much the same ways that we ourselves lack balance.
</em><br>
<p>Again:  What are you going to do, and why is it going to work when
<br>
everything previous has failed?  To quote Doonesbury, &quot;Let's kick butt!&quot; 
<br>
is not a plan unless you know which butts to kick, how far, and in which 
<br>
direction.
