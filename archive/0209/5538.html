<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; These assessments are highly subjective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; From the point of view of many people in the world, material poverty is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; a much bigger problem than lifespan poverty or intelligence poverty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Immediately apparent subjective priorities according to hacked-up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimpanzee priority-assignment hardware are not always the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational priorities given the same goals.
</em><br>

<br>
That is true.
<br>

<br>
But it's also true that not everyone in the world shares the same goals.
<br>

<br>
The Singularity, if it goes off well, will satisfy MY goals very nicely (and
<br>
my goals include becoming so smart that most of my current goals seem really
<br>
silly &amp; trivial to my future self)
<br>

<br>
On the other hand, many people on Earth have goals that would not be
<br>
fulfilled by the Singularity (for instance, living happily ever after in
<br>
Heaven above, due to having acted according to God's word...).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Why is it, Ben, that you chide me for failing to appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you seem to have so much trouble accepting that this one person, Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have an outlook that is really seriously different than your own,
</em><br>

<br>
Let's not get into one of *those* squabbles again!!
<br>

<br>
Don't worry, I fully accept that you have an outlook that is very different
<br>
from mine.
<br>

<br>
And each of us has an outlook very different from that of the average
<br>
American!
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  For that matter, I could also be tortured until I considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ending the pain to be the most important thing in the universe.  So what?
</em><br>

<br>
Hmmm.  Are you volunteering?? ;-D
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; While the human condition in itself is profoundly flawed, there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; doubt that some humans live in vastly more flawed conditions than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Vastly&quot;?  I think that word reflects your different perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of us must be wrong) on the total variance within the human cluster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus the variance between the entire human cluster and a posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard of living.  I think that the most you could say is that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans live in very slightly less flawed conditions than others.  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even that.
</em><br>

<br>
Ok, let's compare
<br>

<br>
A) the way some people live: In a Bombay alleyway, with a couple of limbs
<br>
cut off by their parents in their early youth because limbless kids make
<br>
better beggars, eating trash off the street and with a gut full of diseases
<br>

<br>
B) The way I live at the moment -- in a nice house up in the mountains, with
<br>
a great family, doing work I really enjoy, surrounded by fun toys like
<br>
synthesizers, pianos, trampolines, etc.
<br>

<br>
I'm not wealthy by any means, at the moment I'm sorta financially
<br>
struggling, but I still say I'm living a lot better than the folks in case
<br>
A).  I think &quot;vastly better&quot; is a fair description, and I think that the
<br>
folks in case A) would very likely agree if the question were posed to them.
<br>

<br>
To me, cross-species comparisons of &quot;quality of life&quot; or &quot;quality of
<br>
experience&quot; are hard to make meaningfully.
<br>

<br>
I'm confident saying that I live vastly better than the people in case A),
<br>
but NOT saying that I live vastly better than my dog, or even a stray dog,
<br>
or a worm....
<br>

<br>
Similarly, I find it hard to compare my life to that of a posthuman in a
<br>
rank-order sort of way.  There's a big qualitative difference of experience
<br>
there, to be sure, just as between me and a dog or a worm...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; If I am a person of &quot;great material privilege&quot;, by the way, I would very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much like to have my own nanocomputer.  What?  I can't buy that?  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither can Bill Gates?  Guess we're both poor.
</em><br>

<br>
Yes, you are both very poor materially relative to someone 100 years in the
<br>
future, and very rich materially compared to the above-mentioned beggar, who
<br>
has no possessions and must spend essentially all their time literally
<br>
grubbing around for food.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Of course, I agree with you that creating a superhuman AGI can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; great way to end material poverty as well as to overcome the many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; self-defeating characteristics of human nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a way to rewrite almost every aspect of life as we know it.  You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take all the force of that tremendous impact and try to turn it to pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light.  You can even hypothesize that this tremendous impact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pure light, would have effects that include the ending of fleeting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present-day problems like material poverty.  But it is unwise in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme to imagine that the Singularity is a tool which can be channeled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into things like &quot;ending material poverty&quot; because some computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmer wants that specifically.
</em><br>

<br>
Yes, I agree.
<br>

<br>
But I am perplexed that, in your &quot;different morality&quot;, you consider human
<br>
lives very valuable (so that you say a single human death is a terrible
<br>
thing which pains you and is morally unacceptable), yet you trivialize human
<br>
suffering as perceived by actual human beings.  To me, this mix of attitudes
<br>
feels odd.
