<p><em>&gt; But I am perplexed that, in your &quot;different morality&quot;, you consider human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives very valuable (so that you say a single human death is a terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing which pains you and is morally unacceptable), yet you trivialize
</em><br>
human
<br>
<em>&gt; suffering as perceived by actual human beings.  To me, this mix of
</em><br>
attitudes
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Not to me.  These are two different POVs.
<br>
<p>POV One: when judging the value of human life, it is very valuable.
<br>
<p>POV Two: when judging how the Singularity will effect humans overall, the
<br>
specific effect of &quot;ending suffering caused by material poverty&quot; appears
<br>
trivial.
<br>
<p>Today, human suffering is common and extremely unpleasant to look upon.  I
<br>
don't even want to imagine being there, having seen it up close.  All by
<br>
itself &quot;ending suffering caused by material poverty&quot; is a good reason to
<br>
work towards a quick Singularity.  But it is not the only reason, not by
<br>
far.  When viewed from the top of the mountain-of-change that a Singularity
<br>
will produce, this one change may seem small indeed... even if, from the
<br>
point of view of the beggar-child who is fed, clothed and made whole again,
<br>
it might seem like the biggest part.  If that beggar-child-rescue happened
<br>
in the first year (month?) after the creation of
<br>
greater-than-human-intelligence, what would be the same child's opinion an
<br>
additional year onward?  I think it would be safe to say that the suffering
<br>
of the past would seem a distant memory to that transhuman child turning one
<br>
year old.
