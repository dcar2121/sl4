In terms of material abundance (if not &quot;paradisiacality&quot;) Eskimo society is
<br>
clearly not included. Life in the arctic is and always has been extremely
<br>
harsh. Conditions were only a little better further south, where the Native
<br>
American (Amerind) tribes eked out a modest living between episodes of
<br>
warfare against neighboring tribes. (Although only adult males took part in
<br>
these raids, the women back at the tribe's camp were given the privilege of
<br>
torturing any captured enemies.)
<br>

<br>
In the South Pacific, the residents of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) seem to have
<br>
enjoyed material abundance and social peace for the first couple of
<br>
centuries after their Polynesian ancestors settled that remote island. Then:
<br>
&quot;The population of Easter Island reached its peak at perhaps more than
<br>
10,000, far exceeding the capabilities of the small island's ecosystem.
<br>
Resources became scarce, and the once lush palm forests were destroyed -
<br>
cleared for agriculture and moving the massive stone Moai. In this regard,
<br>
Easter Island has become, for many, a metaphor for ecological disaster.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, a thriving and advanced social order began to decline into
<br>
bloody civil war and, evidently, cannibalism. Eventually, all of the Moai
<br>
standing along the coast were torn down by the islanders themselves. All of
<br>
the statues now erected around the island are the result of recent
<br>
archaeological efforts.&quot;

<br>
I have not been able to find enough information about Balinese history
<br>
amidst all the vacation web page &quot;happy talk&quot; (if you'll excuse a reference
<br>
to the old musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;) but I suspect that neither during its
<br>
prehistoric period, nor during its time under Hindu influence, and certainly
<br>
not under the Dutch conquest, did Bali exist in a paradisiacal condition.
<br>
But that's just my guess.
<br>

<br>
As for James DeMeo's paper (available on a website with the Reichian name
<br>
&quot;orgonelab.org&quot;) I detect more than a few hints of weak scholarship. For
<br>
example, I am suspicious of DeMeo's claim that all areas outside those he
<br>
labeled &quot;patrist&quot; (patriarchal) were &quot;matrist&quot; (matriarchal, which is not
<br>
the same as matrilineal, the later meaning that inheritance is through the
<br>
maternal line). Among these supposedly matriarchal, gentle, non-militaristic
<br>
areas would then be the Aztec empire, which was notable for its constant
<br>
warfare and mass human sacrifices. (For a thorough scholarly examination of
<br>
matriarchy/patriarchy issues in anthropology, see &quot;Why Men Rule: A Theory of
<br>
Male Dominance&quot; by Steven Goldberg
<br>
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0812692373/102-7600663-2164946">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0812692373/102-7600663-2164946</a>)
<br>
which is summarized in a book review at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/People/Goldberg/SELIG.html">http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/People/Goldberg/SELIG.html</a>.) If you
<br>
don't have the time to go to these links and/or read the book, here's the
<br>
summary version: There is no anthropological or archeological evidence from
<br>
any primary sources or field work to indicate that any society has ever been
<br>
ruled by women. Men are driven (probably hormonally) to rule. The few women
<br>
rulers have been notable because they are exceptions to an otherwise robust
<br>
statistical rule. And the way men rule is by competing with and defeating
<br>
other men, either civilly by elections and economic competition and
<br>
culturally earned prestige, or violently by warfare.
<br>

<br>
Finally, my Baloney Detector goes into the red zone when DeMeo's cited
<br>
sources of authority include M. Gimbutas, W. Reich and I. Velikovsky. None
<br>
of these pseudo-scholars has a shred of scientific credibility.
<br>

<br>
This brief historical tour serves to underline my point that we are unlikely
<br>
to significantly change human behavior en mass until we can transform
<br>
humanity en mass, which means transhuman transcendence mediated by our
<br>
technology which, I believe, will depend crucially on Friendly AI.
