<em>&gt;&gt; I don't think so.  If you are having trouble keeping yourself alive

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um... no.  I refuse.  Life on Earth just before the Singularity should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be about the Singularity because the Singularity is what matters for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next billion years.  This doesn't change regardless of where you live, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although whether or not you are likely to *know* about the Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have a differential probability that varies strongly with geographic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location. Now it may be that low-level needs place you at subsistence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level and leave very little free energy, but if you know about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, you should still be concerned with it, with whatever free 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy you have. And it may even be that being placed in certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments is enough to disrupt or destroy an altruistic goal system.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in this case I would consider, not quite that &quot;you&quot; have died, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you have been transformed into something whose philosophical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgments you should no longer take into account.
</em><br>

<br>

<br>
Ah.  OK.  I do have a lot of respect for this.  But I will point 
<br>
out that if you substituted &quot;the Kingdom of God&quot; for 
<br>
&quot;Singularity&quot; above you would still have a self-evidently true 
<br>
declaration of dedication modulo your belief in said Kingdom or 
<br>
Singularity as the ultimate end and truly important thing.  But 
<br>
I am not attempting to poke fun in any way.  I very much do 
<br>
understand what you are saying above and admire your dedication 
<br>
and articulation of it.  I would however sound a warning that 
<br>
you may be missing how the Singularity grows out of the present 
<br>
and the people of this world and thus tend to ignore them in 
<br>
favor of it.  Or so it sometimes appears.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dedication isn't a trivial thing, Samantha.  I don't know how strong my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will is.  I don't know what it would take to break my will, whether it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a little or a lot of adversity.  But it doesn't matter.  A broken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, however little or however much it takes to break Eliezer, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not relevant to this discussion.  While my will continues it will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devoted to the Singularity because that is the pretty darned unambiguous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome of rational altruism.  And if I could continue that under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whichever conditions of adversity, I would be personally proud of it - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although obviously Singularity considerations mediate that I should try 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to encounter as little adversity as possible; this isn't about pride.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If Brahma has me burnt, I will spit into the flames.  If he has me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strangled, I will attempt to bite the executioner's hand.  If my throat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is cut, may my blood rust the blade that does it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     -- Sam, in Roger Zelazny, &quot;Lord of Light&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know if I could, but I know that I *should*, remain focused on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity on the way to my execution, and shout out my last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts about Friendly AI to the firing squad to take advantage of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very small but nonetheless real probability that someone will remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them and put them online.  Not out of defiance; because that is, under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those hypothetical conditions, the best remaining pathway to helping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity and humanity's future.  It's not a *good* pathway, but it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's available under those conditions.  And I do not deny the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of that kind of dedication to any of the six billion people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this Earth, regardless of what conditions they live under.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you do humanity a disservice if you suppose that human beings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are capable of altruism only under comfortable conditions.  Maybe it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true of me personally.  If I do my job competently, it will never be put 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the test.  But if I do fail that test, that's a flaw in me, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that changes the correct course of action.
</em><br>

<br>
I don't in fact believe the altruism is only possible in 
<br>
comfortable conditions at all.  But it is a strange sort of 
<br>
altruism, at least at first glance, that seems to stand 
<br>
dispassionate in the face of real human suffering now all over 
<br>
the world.  Yet this too makes a great deal of sense.  It also 
<br>
is reminiscent of various spiritually dedicated people who point 
<br>
out it is not the material circumstances that matter but the 
<br>
internal state and eventual outcome. Dispassion is a necessity 
<br>
of seeing beyond and working beyond the immediate.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is it, Ben, that you chide me for failing to appreciate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity, yet you seem to have so much trouble accepting that this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; one person, Eliezer, could have an outlook that is really seriously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; different than your own, rather than some transient whim?  I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; have any trouble appreciating that others are different from me, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; though I may judge those differences as better or worse.  You, on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; other hand, seem to have difficulty believing that there is any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; difference at all between you and someone you are immediately talking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; to, regardless of what theoretical differences you might claim to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; believe in or respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why is that you are beginning to take this attitude of being above it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all and almost of a different species from the rest of us?  As 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wonderfully bright and dedicated as you are I don't believe that this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is justified, at least not yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not say:  &quot;No matter *how* bright and dedicated you are, or aren't, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that attitude would *never* be justified.&quot;  This helps to avoid debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about side issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
OK.  Hmmm.  I see your point.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Suppose that I did tend to focus more on material poverty if I were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; experiencing it.  That supervention of my wired-in chimpanzee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; priorities is not necessarily more correct.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If it is the difference between life and death, then it is higher 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; priority in that it is prerequisite to the rest of your goals.  There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; must be enough surplus of energy beyond what is needed to survive and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accomplish some basic functionality before higher goals can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; addressed.  Many people in this world do not have that much today.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That is also potentially many brains of good potential that are never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; utilized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  This is yet another problem that can best be fixed via (drum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roll) the Singularity.  That's the most effective, most efficient, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fastest way that I can put any given amount of effort into solving that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem. If I do it some other way, I fail.  If I do it some other way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of a reason other than my anticipation of maximum benefit to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those people, I fail in altruism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
OK.  Thanks for the clarification.  Sometimes the &quot;anticipation 
<br>
of maximum benefit to those people&quot; is not so obvious.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Vastly&quot;?  I think that word reflects your different perspective (at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; least one of us must be wrong) on the total variance within the human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; cluster versus the variance between the entire human cluster and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; posthuman standard of living.  I think that the most you could say is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; that some humans live in very slightly less flawed conditions than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; others.  Maybe not even that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Your perspective includes hypotheticals not currently in existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um... yeah.  And this is a bad thing because...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Only because consideration of these hypotheticals over and 
<br>
beyond unquestionable existing realities can lead to ineffective 
<br>
apprehension and response to those realities. On the other hand, 
<br>
a projection of what the goal or best state is and working 
<br>
vigilantly toward that can be the very deepest response to those 
<br>
obvious problems and difficulties. There is a question of balance.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Given current existential conditons, some humans live in vastly more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; flawed conditions than others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adversity isn't a relative quantity, at least not as I measure things. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether you're doing well or poorly doesn't depend on whether someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else has more or less.  Right now all known sentient beings live under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions of tremendous adversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I very much agree.  However, I don't currently believe that only 
<br>
Singularity is of importance for improving the lot of humankind.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; As a person of great material privilege, you are inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; focus primarily on the limitations and problems we all share.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; As a student of minds-in-general, I define humanity by looking at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; features of human psychology and existence that are panhuman and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; reflect the accumulated deep pool of complex functional adaptation, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than the present surface froth of variations between cultures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hmmm. That froth is where the people live!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, that froth is what the people focus on, because those variances are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones which are adaptively relevant to *differential* reproduction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hence perceptually salient.  If there exists a race which has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved to be six miles tall because height is the most powerful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary advantage, they will, among themselves, focus on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining six inches worth of variance.  Hence the IQ wars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Understood but I was attempting to express concern that much of 
<br>
what human beings are seemed to be dismissed above.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think you are attempting to turn yourself into a FAI disconnected 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from your own humanity.  I am not at all sure this is a good thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1:  What the heck *else* do you think I've been trying to do with my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind for the last six years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2:  If you think that is in any wise, shape, or form a bad thing, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must have an extremely different conception of FAI than I do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3:  You've never met an FAI or you wouldn't say that.  (Neither have I, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course, but I have a good imagination.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4:  If it's good enough for an FAI, it's good enough for me.  The only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is whether *I* can manage it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for being &quot;disconnected from my own humanity&quot;... is this a generic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of saying &quot;different from what you were last week&quot;?  And if not, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconnected from humanity and connected to what, exactly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I understand that also and figured that is the way you see it. 
<br>
However, you are a human being and I believe it is more fruitful 
<br>
to the creation of a FAI and to your own well-being and to 
<br>
enrolling other human beings if you retain your humanity a bit 
<br>
more explicitly.  Now, I also understand that when you are 
<br>
dedicated to such a goal that it very much does change you and 
<br>
make you in many ways different from other people.  Some of that 
<br>
is inevitable but there is also danger there.  I believe that 
<br>
you are aware of it.
<br>

<br>
That it is &quot;good enough for the FAI&quot; does not equate to it being 
<br>
good enough for you.  Yours is a drastically different 
<br>
architecture and situation.
