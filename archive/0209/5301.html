<p>
Good afternoon, everyone:
<br>
<p>I've been &quot;lurking&quot; for a couple of weeks now, so I wanted
<br>
to post a short &quot;Intro&quot; here, and then perhaps a contribution
<br>
from time to time...
<br>
<p>I am not a Scientist, Mathematician, or Pharmacist.  I am
<br>
a Network Engineer / IT Manager type, as well as an amateur
<br>
Philosopher (minor in college).  I have a Master's in
<br>
Information Systems management, and I am generally extremely
<br>
enthusiastic about Technology.
<br>
<p>I discovered this whole talk about &quot;The Singularity&quot; approximately
<br>
a month ago, and my thoughts on Technology have been taken,
<br>
of course, to a profoundly higher level.
<br>
<p>Just so you know, I'm reading everything I can get my hands on.
<br>
I'm reading a book on Nanotechnology, a book called &quot;Our Molecular
<br>
Future&quot;, and others; I've also read a lot of material you people
<br>
yourselves have put out -- Ben, Gordon, Eliezer, others -- and
<br>
I've been to many, many related Web sites.
<br>
<p>I will come at this whole thing from more of a Philosophical angle:
<br>
I am a sincere and educated Christian, a &quot;techie&quot;, and someone who
<br>
sees the metaphysical implications of things.  If you are willing to
<br>
be *open-minded* about input from a Non-scientific type (I respect
<br>
those who are), I'd be glad to contribute.  Otherwise, if you don't
<br>
mind, I'll continue to read the posts....
<br>
<p>Ben, I think I appreciate your approach most of all:  You seem fair,
<br>
open-minded, and a good writer.  Same goes for you, Gordon...  Kurzweil
<br>
is an old hero of mine, since I am also a keyboard player (his name
<br>
is on some of the finest digital music instruments I've ever played)...
<br>
Eliezer, I applaud your work at SIAI, but I think you may be unaware of
<br>
just how much you insert your own World View into a lot of what you write... 
<br>
IMHO...
<br>
<p>Many Thanks.
<br>
<p>Cordially,
<br>
GK
