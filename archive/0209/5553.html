<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; These assessments are highly subjective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; From the point of view of many people in the world, material poverty is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; a much bigger problem than lifespan poverty or intelligence poverty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Immediately apparent subjective priorities according to hacked-up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimpanzee priority-assignment hardware are not always the same as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational priorities given the same goals.
</em><br>

<br>
I don't think so.  If you are having trouble keeping yourself 
<br>
alive because of grossly inadequate nutrition, shelter and very 
<br>
spotty water supplies of poor quality then your low-level 
<br>
survival drives will, quite rightly, swamp your higher level 
<br>
needs for a time.  This would be true of any conceivable 
<br>
sentient that had low-level survival minimal requirements.  So 
<br>
please come down to earth just a bit, if you will.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; And I can't help suspecting that you, Eliezer, might consider material
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; poverty a little more serious if you were experiencing it!  Even given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; your generally nonmaterialistic world-view and personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it, Ben, that you chide me for failing to appreciate diversity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet you seem to have so much trouble accepting that this one person, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, could have an outlook that is really seriously different than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own, rather than some transient whim?  I don't have any trouble 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciating that others are different from me, even though I may judge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those differences as better or worse.  You, on the other hand, seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have difficulty believing that there is any difference at all between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and someone you are immediately talking to, regardless of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical differences you might claim to believe in or respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Why is that you are beginning to take this attitude of being 
<br>
above it all and almost of a different species from the rest of 
<br>
us?  As wonderfully bright and dedicated as you are I don't 
<br>
believe that this is justified, at least not yet.  The above 
<br>
looks from here to be quite defensive and more than a little 
<br>
condescending.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that I did tend to focus more on material poverty if I were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing it.  That supervention of my wired-in chimpanzee priorities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not necessarily more correct.  
</em><br>

<br>
If it is the difference between life and death, then it is 
<br>
higher priority in that it is prerequisite to the rest of your 
<br>
goals.  There must be enough surplus of energy beyond what is 
<br>
needed to survive and accomplish some basic functionality before 
<br>
higher goals can be addressed.  Many people in this world do not 
<br>
have that much today.  That is also potentially many brains of 
<br>
good potential that are never utilized.
<br>

<br>
I might as well say to some Third
<br>
<em>&gt; Worlder &quot;You might consider material poverty less serious if you lived 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.&quot;  For that matter, I could also be tortured until I considered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ending the pain to be the most important thing in the universe.  So 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what?  What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more precise, the Bayesian Probability Theorem? 
</em><br>

<br>
Puh-leze.  Can you manage to address anything directly without 
<br>
dragging out BPT?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; How do any of these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things change the facts?  In what way are they &quot;evidence&quot; about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue at hand?  I run on vulnerable hardware with known flaws, such that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are certain environmental stimuli that would produce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very-high-priority signals capable of disrupting more rational means of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aligning subgoals with supergoals; environmental stimuli may even result 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in negative or positive reinforcement in sufficient amounts to overwrite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current goal system.  Again, so what?  That's just a broken Eliezer, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an enlightened Eliezer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
The so what is that many billions of people live today in just 
<br>
such conditions.  Do you feel some empathy for them?  Is belping 
<br>
them part of what drives your work?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; While the human condition in itself is profoundly flawed, there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; doubt that some humans live in vastly more flawed conditions than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Vastly&quot;?  I think that word reflects your different perspective (at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one of us must be wrong) on the total variance within the human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cluster versus the variance between the entire human cluster and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman standard of living.  I think that the most you could say is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some humans live in very slightly less flawed conditions than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.  Maybe not even that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Your perspective includes hypotheticals not currently in 
<br>
existence.  Given current existential conditons, some humans 
<br>
live in vastly more flawed conditions than others.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; As a person of great material privilege, you are inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; focus primarily on the limitations and problems we all share.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a student of minds-in-general, I define humanity by looking at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features of human psychology and existence that are panhuman and reflect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the accumulated deep pool of complex functional adaptation, rather than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the present surface froth of variations between cultures and individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
Hmmm. That froth is where the people live!
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Of course, I agree with you that creating a superhuman AGI can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; great way to end material poverty as well as to overcome the many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; self-defeating characteristics of human nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a way to rewrite almost every aspect of life as we know it.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can take all the force of that tremendous impact and try to turn it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pure light.  You can even hypothesize that this tremendous impact, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed as pure light, would have effects that include the ending of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fleeting present-day problems like material poverty.  But it is unwise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the extreme to imagine that the Singularity is a tool which can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channeled into things like &quot;ending material poverty&quot; because some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer programmer wants that specifically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I think you are attempting to turn yourself into a FAI 
<br>
disconnected from your own humanity.  I am not at all sure this 
<br>
is a good thing.
