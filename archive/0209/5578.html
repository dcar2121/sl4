<br>
Evolution of Charity.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomenon of &quot;charity work&quot; also reveals how generosity is used
<br>
as an inefficient fitness display rather than an efficient
<br>
resource-transfer device.  If the wealthy really wanted to help people,
<br>
they should make as much money as they can doing what they are trained
<br>
to do, and hand it over to a lower income group who are trained to help
<br>
people.  The division of labor is economically efficient, in charity as
<br>
in business.  Instead, in most modern cities of the world, we can
<br>
observe highly trained lawyers, doctors, and their husbands and wives
<br>
giving up their time to work in soup kitchens for the homeless or to
<br>
deliver meals to the elderly.  Their time may be worth a hundred times
<br>
the standard hourly rates for kitchen workers or delivery drivers.  For
<br>
every hour they spend serving soup, they could have donated an hour's
<br>
salary to pay for somebody else to serve soup for two weeks.  The same
<br>
argument applies not only to lawyers, but to everyone with an
<br>
above-average wage who donates time instead of money.  So why do they
<br>
donate their time?  Here again the handicap principle applies. [Amotz
<br>
Zahavi's principle states that the cost of one's &quot;ornaments&quot; indicate
<br>
one's level of fitness.]  For most working people, their most limited
<br>
resource is time, not money.  By donating time, they help the needy much
<br>
less efficiently, but show their generosity and kindness much more
<br>
credibly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature of human charity is that givers must usually be
<br>
given tokens of appreciation, which they can display publicly.  In the
<br>
United States, donors to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) are
<br>
rewarded with PBS tote bags, PBS umbrellas, and PBS T-shirts.  In
<br>
Britain, charities offer donors red paper poppies for buttonholes, red
<br>
plastic clown noses, or red tomato T-shirts.  Blood drives usually give
<br>
donors buttons saying something like &quot;I gave blood today,&quot; which
<br>
essentially proclaim &quot;I am altruistic, not anemic, and HIV-negative.&quot;
<br>
Major benefactors of universities or hospitals usually expect buildings
<br>
to be named after them.  There is the phenomenon of the &quot;anonymous
<br>
donor,&quot; but we should not take the term at face value.  A London
<br>
socialite once remarked to me that she knew many anonymous donors.  They
<br>
were well known within their social circle--the set of people whose
<br>
opinion matters--even though their names may not have been splashed
<br>
across the newspapers.  I suspect that few male millionaires keep their
<br>
charitable donations secret from their wives and mistresses.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final oddity is that people usually avoid giving to charities that
<br>
nobody else has heard of, however worthy the cause.  The result is
<br>
something approaching a winner-takes-all contest, with the charities
<br>
that grow large and well-known attracting ever larger proportions of
<br>
donations.  Charities must spend a large proportion of revenue on
<br>
&quot;fundraising.&quot;  This sounds like the pragmatic solicitation of
<br>
donations.  But it often turns out to mean the costly creation of a
<br>
strong brand identity for the charity, hiring advertising firms to
<br>
promote the charity in the same way that any other luxury good is
<br>
marketed.  Fundraisers know that when a new charity is launched, it is
<br>
important to attract a few major donors, so their rivals feel obliged to
<br>
top those donations with larger ones.  The charity's goal is to provoke
<br>
a donation arms race between local millionaires.  From the viewpoint of
<br>
efficiently transferring resources from the wealthy to the needy, such
<br>
arms races look pathological.  They result in overfunding a few salient
<br>
diseases in the developed world.  They lead to the neglect of more
<br>
cost-effective programs in the developed, such as drilling for clean
<br>
water wells, anti-malaria programs, pro-breast-feeding campaigns,
<br>
elementary school education, and capital for women's small businesses.
<br>
If charity really resulted from altruistic instincts for solving other
<br>
people's problems, we should expect people to take more time to research
<br>
which charities are most cost-effective and most likely to produce
<br>
immediate, measurable improvements.  This would result in money being
<br>
spread around much more widely, ameliorating more of the world's
<br>
avoidable misery.  Instead, most donors spend less time researching
<br>
their charities then they do picking which video to rent.  This results
<br>
in charity fashion cycles, and over-giving to this season's stylish
<br>
causes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we explain these peculiar features of human charity?  They
<br>
cannot be traced to nepotism or reciprocity.  They do not seem to result
<br>
from socialization for genuine altruism.  Instead, they often look like
<br>
just another form of wasteful, showy display.  If the point of charity
<br>
is to incur the cost of giving rather than to bring real benefits to
<br>
others, we can understand why people do not care much about the
<br>
efficiency of charities, and why they donate time when they should be
<br>
donating money.  If charitable donations must be advertised to be
<br>
effective as signals, we can understand why donors receive little badges
<br>
to indicate their generosity, and why charities spend so much
<br>
fundraising money creating a strong brand identity.  If donations are
<br>
signals subject to the usual demands of recognition and memorability, we
<br>
can understand why people give to famous, oversubscribed causes rather
<br>
than obscure, worthier ones.  Donations as courtship displays would also
<br>
explain the charity fashion cycles, which are especially apparent among
<br>
young, single donors.  For most of us, our charities are cosmetic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that people giving to charity are &quot;trying to get
<br>
more sex.&quot;  They are simply trying to be generous.  That is their
<br>
motivation.  My question is why the motivation evolved.  Their genuine
<br>
instincts for generosity just happen to have many of the showy,
<br>
fashion-conscious features common to other products of sexual selection.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding charity's origin as a sexual display should not
<br>
undermine its social status.  As Robert Frank argued in _Luxury Fever_,
<br>
we may have evolved instincts for achieving higher social status through
<br>
conspicuous display, but as rational and moral beings we can still
<br>
choose conspicuous charity over conspicuous consumption.  Every hundred
<br>
dollars we spend on luxuries could probably have saved a sick child from
<br>
death somewhere in the developing world if we had donated it to the
<br>
appropriate charity.  The ten-thousand-dollar premium that distinguishes
<br>
a sport utility vehicle from an ordinary automobile probably cost India
<br>
a hundred dead children.  We may pretend that it did not, but our
<br>
self-justifications are no comfort to the dead.  Perhaps if we imagined
<br>
a hundred hungry ghosts haunting every luxury vehicle, runaway
<br>
consumerism would lose some of its sexual appeal.  While designer labels
<br>
advertise only our wealth, the badges of charity advertise both our
<br>
wealth and our kindness.  As it is, the car manufacturers can afford
<br>
better advertising than the needy children, which is why our instincts
<br>
for display have been directed more toward consumerism than toward
<br>
charity.
