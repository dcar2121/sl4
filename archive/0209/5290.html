Ben Goertzel wrote:&gt; hi,
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Eliezer says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Well, Ben, this is because there are two groups of people who know damn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;well that SIAI is devoted solely, firstly, and only to the Singularity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and unfortunately you belong to neither.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the *idea* of SIAI is to promote the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the *practice* of SIAI, so far, seems very narrowly tied to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own perspectives on all Singularity-related issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May I ask, what does SIAI plan to do to promote alternatives to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach to AGI?  If it gets a lot of funds, will it split the money among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different AGI projects, or will it put them all into your own AGI project?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does it plan to do to promote alternatives to your own speculative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory on Friendly AI?  (And I think all theories on Friendly AI are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculative at this point, not just yours.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I see the SIAI website posting some of the views on Friendly AI that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly contradict your own, I'll start to feel more like it's a generic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity-promoting organization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I see the SIAI funding people whose views explicitly contradict your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, then I'll really believe SIAI is what you say it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<p>I know this thread is dead, but I wanted to say in my capacity as a member
<br>
of SIAI's board that I do consider us to be &quot;neutral&quot;. However, I think there
<br>
is some confusion in the quotes above. Our bylaws state our organization's
<br>
purpose quite simply, and this does not involve us treating all Singularity
<br>
paths equally (unless the board determined that this was the best way to
<br>
achieve our purpose). The board so far has decided that the best way to
<br>
achieve our purpose is to evaluate all paths, and pick the most promising
<br>
one to pursue. I would note that in the past all three of the board members
<br>
have changed their minds at least once regarding what is the best path, so
<br>
there is historical precedent for the idea that some day we may run across
<br>
something even more promising and switch to that. All you have to do is
<br>
convince at least two of us...
<br>
<p>We attempt to be neutral when it comes to picking the best path, but we are
<br>
not required to fund or promote paths to the Singularity that we consider to
<br>
be less ideal /unless/ they somehow decrease risks and/or accelerate the 
<br>
Singularity without negatively affecting our current main plan of action.
<br>
<p>What you can see is that while our organization's purpose is simply stated,
<br>
it requires a complex set of decisions and tradeoffs in order to maximize our
<br>
progress towards it. What it all comes down to of course is whether or not
<br>
the board is capable of making unbiased and rational decisions and tradeoffs...
<br>
and I can't prove to you that we are. Which is why this thread is dead.
