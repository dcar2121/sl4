<p>Cliff, you are absolutely right that our current social, political and
<br>
business institutions are not well oriented to deal with abundance.  And the
<br>
institutions will rebel against change that endangers them, systemically.
<br>
<p>Just look at the nature of public school systems.  Most people working in
<br>
the public school systems really care about kids, and are &quot;good people&quot; who
<br>
care about good education... but yet the school systems as a whole often
<br>
acts to oppose good education.  For instance, the teachers' union fights
<br>
against charter schools, pays legislators to burden charter school
<br>
legislation with bureaucratic counterproductive nonsense, etc.
<br>
<p>But yet, change does happen.  The charter school movement is happening...
<br>
the banking industry wildly reorganized itself in the late 80's and early to
<br>
mid 90's with the advent of computerization (and this still goes on), etc.
<br>
<p>But I agree that in thinking about society's future adaptation to abundance
<br>
and other pre-Singularity technologies, it's important to take into account
<br>
the dynamics of institutions as well as the psychology of individuals.
