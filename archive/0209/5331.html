Michael, I guess this partly comes down to two of the key principles of
<br>
Buddhism: non-attachment and compassion
<br>
<p>The non-contradictoriness of these two principles has been a big &quot;hump&quot; for
<br>
me to get over in my own &quot;psychospiritual/ethical&quot; development.
<br>
<p>Non-attachment allows us to look at things objectively and rationally,
<br>
rather than getting emotionally caught up in good or bad things that we see.
<br>
<p>Compassion causes us to feel the suffering of others, to care about things
<br>
that in a shallow view don't affect us directly, due to the deeper
<br>
understanding that everything is connected...
<br>
<p>To approach the Singularity appropriately, one clearly needs both of these
<br>
in abundance.
<br>
<p>And I do think that Eliezer has both of these in reasonable quantity.  The
<br>
particular way in which he mixes them is a little different than how they
<br>
are mixed in my own mind, but that's expectable...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering as perceived by actual human beings.  To me, this mix of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to me.  These are two different POVs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POV One: when judging the value of human life, it is very valuable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POV Two: when judging how the Singularity will effect humans overall, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific effect of &quot;ending suffering caused by material poverty&quot; appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, human suffering is common and extremely unpleasant to look upon.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even want to imagine being there, having seen it up close.  All by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself &quot;ending suffering caused by material poverty&quot; is a good reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work towards a quick Singularity.  But it is not the only reason, not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far.  When viewed from the top of the mountain-of-change that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will produce, this one change may seem small indeed... even if, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view of the beggar-child who is fed, clothed and made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might seem like the biggest part.  If that beggar-child-rescue happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the first year (month?) after the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater-than-human-intelligence, what would be the same child's opinion an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional year onward?  I think it would be safe to say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the past would seem a distant memory to that transhuman child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year old.
