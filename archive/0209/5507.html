<br>
We used to define it differently.  Now it's just that I'm not as good at 
<br>
writing the definition because my understanding of rationality is not 
<br>
quite as deep as Eliezer's.  Anyway, here's my latest attempt at 
<br>
defining rationality in a way that I think you'll like, Ben.
<br>

<br>
rationality:  a force in the universe, specifically the BPT, that is 
<br>
required for all nonaccidental successes to occur
<br>
work:  any nonaccidental success, where success is defined as the 
<br>
completion of a process
<br>
Let U be the set of all processes in the Universe
<br>
Let T be the proper subset of U that is equal to the set of all 
<br>
processes in U that work
<br>
If x is a member of T, then x draws upon rationality
<br>

<br>
Rationality, the force, is different from rational thought, the 
<br>
consistent application of rationality in your mind.  All thought draws 
<br>
upon rationality, but irrationality is often introduced into thought in 
<br>
human mind.  Purely rational thought (and no one here claims to be 
<br>
capable of purely rational thought) would mean making all decisions 
<br>
following Bayesian decision theory.
<br>

<br>
As an aside, if you're curious why T is a proper subset of U, it is 
<br>
because the Universe is by default arational and, for example, the 
<br>
formation of stars and planets in no way draws upon rationality; all 
<br>
those successes were accidental.  The Universe, as far as we know, did 
<br>
not set out with the goal of creating Earth.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can things be done now to make acceptance of the Singularity easier?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Possibly.  When it actually happens, though, I bet everyone on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will still be shocked to see it actually happening.  Rather than trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to prepare people for the Singularity, your time would be better spent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; actually making the Singularity happen by recruiting, raising money,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; coding AI, etc..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think one can responsibly make a blanket statement like that.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a lot of uncertainty about the Singularity, and it's quite plausible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparing people mentally and emotionally for the Singularity will help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity to go down better.  For example, people who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better-prepared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the Singularity are less likely to try to pass laws halting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity-pertinent research, to try to blow up researchers doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity-ward work, etc.
</em><br>

<br>
I doubt that since the Singularity isn't a technology like nanotech that 
<br>
has both Earth-shattering and incremental advances.  To be honest, I 
<br>
highly doubt that the impact of swaying public opinion one way or 
<br>
another will make any real impact unless one of, what I consider to be, 
<br>
outside scenarios occur.  One is that everyone suddenly gets the 
<br>
Singularity and they give us lots of money to work on it and everyone 
<br>
lives happily ever after.  Another is that everyone but a few dozen 
<br>
people are strongly opposed to the singularity and the 6 billion people 
<br>
on this planet make quick work of us.  More likely is that we'll face 
<br>
any number of slightly helpful or slightly harmful environments that 
<br>
will either make our lives easy or make us jump through a few hoops.  In 
<br>
sum, though, I think that a person's work saving us from jumping through 
<br>
a few hoops will have far less impact than if that same person spent 
<br>
time working more directly towards the Singularity.  In other words, 
<br>
leave the memetic battles to those like Kurzweil who are interested in 
<br>
not only SL4 technology.  If you want the Singularity to happen you 
<br>
should be doing what you can to work towards it.
<br>
