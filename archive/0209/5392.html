I have had some computer trouble so I missed a message or two in this thread. 
<br>
However, contemplation and meditation are not at all well characterized by 
<br>
&quot;contemplate your own navel&quot;.   It is not passive or unproductive or 
<br>
wasteful.  Consider it a tuning and exploring of the mind from within the 
<br>
mind if you will.  A smarter-than-human intelligence, especially one able to 
<br>
more deeply see its own processes consciously, is likely to be even more 
<br>
involved in and more proficient at such practices.  There is also in 
<br>
meditation that which is beyond any simple notion of self-introspection.  It 
<br>
arises naturally.  I have no reason to believe that it would not also arise 
<br>
in un-human or posthuman or SAI minds as well.  I don't see what the heck 
<br>
reproduction has to do with this one way or another.   Nor do I see where it 
<br>
is anthropomorphic.   That word seems to be used with a bit too much abandon 
<br>
hereabouts.
