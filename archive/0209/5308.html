</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; As I see it, the basic problem is the same for people highly

</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; than in the world based around scarcity in which their

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To clarify, by &quot;people and organizations in a position of privilege&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't mean the (say) approx. 10% of the world population in a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless others are doing worse, or any other number of metaphors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher/lower status).  My concern rests both on that entrenched if
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; shut down research or mobilize public opinion against it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I realize that.  The above I believe applies just as much to 
<br>
them.  I suspect some of them will be among the first to 
<br>
understand the benefits of true abundance and shifting 
<br>
consciousness.  I think you do many of them an injustice when 
<br>
you assume they are only given by addiction to power and are 
<br>
only happy when others are doing worse.
