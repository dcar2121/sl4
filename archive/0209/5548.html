</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, once again, your use of the phrase &quot;one of *those* squabbles&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates a view of morality, and of what issues are important within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality, that differs very strongly from mine (this is an Eliezer code

</em><br>

<br>
Well, what I meant was, let's not get into one of those long e-mail
<br>
arguments in which we both talk past each other at great length without
<br>
really affecting one anothers' understanding significantly...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my view, the phrase &quot;your idea contains a gaping logical flaw&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructive, useful, and helpful, while the phrase &quot;your outlook is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from mine&quot; is useless
</em><br>

<br>
In my view, each of these phrases may be useful in appropriate contexts...
<br>

<br>
I think that tolerance IS a virtue, and that tolerance is especially useful
<br>
in domains where available evidence is weak.
<br>

<br>
I categorize the Singularity as a domain where available evidence is weak.
<br>

<br>
If you think the Singularity is NOT a domain where available evidence is
<br>
weak, then your thinking contains a gaping logical flaw ;-&gt;  Unless you have
<br>
an additional un-admitted source of evidence, e.g. from an alien
<br>
civilization who's been through their own Singularity...
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Don't worry, I fully accept that you have an outlook that is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; different from mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; And each of us has an outlook very different from that of the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; American!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben, you would be a better person if you deleted the word &quot;different&quot; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your vocabulary and spent one month using only &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a different person.  A *better* person.
</em><br>

<br>
OK, fine, if it'll make you happy: You have an outlook that in my opinion is
<br>
worse than mine.  ;)
<br>

<br>
The fact is, I'm a pretty judgmental person, in reality.  It's odd that I
<br>
don't come across that way in e-mail!  But then, this list is an unusual
<br>
social context...
<br>

<br>
I think most people walk around with their heads full of a lot of nonsense
<br>
that society and culture have hammered into their heads, and I'm certainly
<br>
not afraid to tell people so when appropriate....  This is why I was
<br>
expelled from Hebrew school at age 5, due to insistently and obnoxiously
<br>
championing the Big Bang and the theory of evolution by natural selection ;&gt;
<br>

<br>
On THIS LIST, however, almost everyone is pretty smart and pretty
<br>
knowledgeable, and furthermore almost everyone has roughly the same
<br>
world-view as me.  Most of the disagreements on this list happen not to be
<br>
of the sort where I think: &quot;Now that person is totally full of crap!  What
<br>
an idiot!&quot;  On this list, there mostly tend to be disagreements where I
<br>
think the other person's point of view is reasonable given the available
<br>
evidence, even though it's different from mine.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Here, let me rephrase your question as it applies, say, 50,000 years ago:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A) the way some people live: in a tribal savannah, with diseases, wolves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in total ignorance, a life of constant hardship and danger and worst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all politics, with no air conditioning, penicillin, CD players, Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access, or the prospect of actually living through the Singularity, plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't have any good fruit trees;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B) the way some other people live: in a tribal savannah, with diseases,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wolves, in total ignorance, a life of constant hardship and danger and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst of all politics, with no air conditioning, penicillin, CD players,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet access, or the prospect of actually living through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity; *but* they have some good fruit trees nearby, unlike the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saps who live across the river
</em><br>

<br>
I don't know enough about life 50,000 years ago to assess how big the
<br>
differences were.
<br>

<br>
I can guess, however, that some folks had it a LOT better than others due to
<br>
superiority of geographical location.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; If I am a person of &quot;great material privilege&quot;, by the way, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; very much like to have my own nanocomputer.  What?  I can't buy that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; And neither can Bill Gates?  Guess we're both poor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Yes, you are both very poor materially relative to someone 100 years in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the future, and very rich materially compared to the above-mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; beggar, who has no possessions and must spend essentially all their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; time literally grubbing around for food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 100-years-in-the-future perspective is the correct one; it is vastly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more intelligent than our own.  (Note: Perspectives can be &quot;correct&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;incorrect&quot;.)
</em><br>

<br>
It's true that perspectives can involve more or less distortion of reality.
<br>
For instance, viewing women or blacks as generally inferior to while males
<br>
is a badly incorrect perspective that was nonetheless widely held.
<br>

<br>
However, I don't see how either of the two perspectives I proposed are
<br>
either correct or incorrect.  They are simply *different*.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; But I am perplexed that, in your &quot;different morality&quot;, you consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; human lives very valuable (so that you say a single human death is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; terrible thing which pains you and is morally unacceptable), yet you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; trivialize human suffering as perceived by actual human beings.  To me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; this mix of attitudes feels odd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't trivialize human suffering.  But if you mean that I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compunctions about seeking out irrationalities in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemporary view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human suffering, you are absolutely correct.  The human view of orbital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics is wrong.  Why would the human view of human suffering *not* be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong?
</em><br>

<br>
Well, suffering is something we have extremely direct perceptual access to,
<br>
whereas orbital mechanics is something we inferred for centuries based on
<br>
very sketchy evidence.  So the two cases are not all that comparable.
<br>

<br>
I agree that people often misunderstand the reasons for their suffering,
<br>
however.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  This more technical phrase does neatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational diversion of attention to certain particular kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering; they are stimuli that grab brainware because they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestrally relevant.  That's all.
</em><br>

<br>
I do not think it is irrational to pay some attention to things like
<br>
starvation, children getting their limbs hacked off by their beggar parents,
<br>
etc.
<br>

<br>
The timing and nature of the Singularity are not sufficiently certain to
<br>
merit exclusive focus on the Singularity by all able human beings, to the
<br>
exclusion of considering shorter-term means of solving problems and
<br>
alleviating suffering.
<br>

<br>
However, I do think that a lot MORE resources should be focused on
<br>
Singularity-ward efforts, than is currently the case.
