<em>&gt; I can upload myself:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - A - with all my memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - B - with some of my memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - C - with no memories at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - D - with the memories of somebody else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In _all_ those cases - I am upladed. Most people think, that A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe B are only enough. That the continuity of the self is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserved (only) this way.
</em><br>

<br>

<br>
Are you postulating that in cases C and D, your self is still there?
<br>

<br>
The problem is that the mind does not store memories like items in a filing
<br>
cabinet.  Memories are interwoven with habits, cognitive schemata, and
<br>
self-knowledge.  If you subtract memories you will subtract a lot of other
<br>
things as well.
<br>

<br>
But perhaps you mean only subtracting *episodic* memories, and leaving
<br>
memories of things like how to walk, how to play the piano, how to eat, how
<br>
to write papers....  If you leave these procedural memories, then you're
<br>
leaving a lot of the &quot;imprint&quot; of the psychosocial self
<br>

<br>
I think that without any of my episodic memories, I would be only partly
<br>
myself.  Without any of my procedural memories, I'd been even less myself.
<br>

<br>
But of course, I'm using &quot;self&quot; in a common-language sense here, which is
<br>
somewhat of a superposition of the &quot;psychosocial self&quot; and the &quot;inner,
<br>
higher self&quot; ...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I see continuity as an illusion. Not self - as many do see self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an illusion - I see the continuity of the self as an illusion.
</em><br>

<br>
I used the phrase &quot;psychosocial self&quot; intentionally in my previous post, so
<br>
as to distinguish it e.g. from the &quot;higher self&quot; of various spiritual
<br>
traditions.  I am not sure of the sense in which you're using the word
<br>
&quot;self&quot; here.  It's a slippery one!
<br>
