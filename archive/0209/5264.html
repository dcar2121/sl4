<p>I take it into account.  Otherwise I would have spoken up a long time ago, 
<br>
back during SL4's first round of bizarre drug reminescences.
<br>
<p>Then, on the other hand, there's other people who I also respect, who were 
<br>
- as they see it - absolute damn fools to take drugs during their wild and 
<br>
reckless youth, which they now regret ever afterward, not just because of 
<br>
the youthful stupidity but because they're worried it may have permanently 
<br>
taken the edge off their intelligence.
<br>
<p>I take that into account too.
