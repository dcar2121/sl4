<p>I would not count this as evidence. The article is putting too much
<br>
sensationalism in it.
<br>
The researchers were trying to &quot;breed&quot; an oscillator, generating
<br>
random hardware and selecting, breeding and mutating the best performers.
<br>
They were not looking at the product, but only at its output. As usual,
<br>
the evolved programs found some shortcut in the ruleset, and used some
<br>
not-thought-in-advance method of solving the problem (in this case,
<br>
generating a certain wave). They stumbled in some nearby RF transmission.
<br>
For what we know, they could have used some unfiltered interference in
<br>
their power supply, some constant micro-vibration of the room due to the
<br>
building UPS, or something else you would not think as an oscillator.
<br>
<p>Something similar happened in a Sweden when they tried to evolve a flying
<br>
robot bird.
<br>
(<a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=search&amp;StoryID=1329646">http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=search&amp;StoryID=1329646</a><br>
They were checking for the &quot;maximum altitude&quot; variable, or something
<br>
similar. The birds found that standing on their wings they could increase
<br>
the altitude, and with great efficiency too, so the control software
<br>
selected that kind of behaviour...
<br>
<p>In both cases, the problem was the insufficient detail of the selecting
<br>
rules (the oscillator must work in 1,000 different locations and
<br>
temperatures, the birds should actually move when flying, etc.)
<br>
<p>I would take this more as an input for future AI-breeding programs - the
<br>
ones that will have to choose the most intelligent AIs from the new
<br>
release pack. Can we find a definition of &quot;intelligence&quot; good enough to
<br>
discriminate the brights AIs from the cheaters ones in a practical way?
