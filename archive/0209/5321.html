Cliff:
<br>
CS&gt; To clarify, by &quot;people and organizations in a position of
<br>
CS&gt; privilege&quot; I don't mean the (say) approx. 10% of the world
<br>
CS&gt; population in a relative position of privilege.  I mean the,
<br>
CS&gt; what, &lt;1% who &quot;have power&quot; over the rest, and who I fear are
<br>
CS&gt; close-to-chronically addicted to such power (and its
<br>
CS&gt; corresponding belief that one is not doing well unless others are
<br>
CS&gt; doing worse, or any other number of metaphors for higher/lower
<br>
CS&gt; status).  My concern rests both on that entrenched if incorrect
<br>
CS&gt; belief and the real-world power such entities have (to e.g., shut
<br>
CS&gt; down research or mobilize public opinion against it).
<br>
<p>Samantha:
<br>
SA&gt; I realize that.  The above I believe applies just as much to
<br>
SA&gt; them.  I suspect some of them will be among the first to
<br>
SA&gt; understand the benefits of true abundance and shifting
<br>
SA&gt; consciousness.  I think you do many of them an injustice when
<br>
SA&gt; you assume they are only given by addiction to power and are
<br>
SA&gt; only happy when others are doing worse.
<br>
<p>Ben:
<br>
BG&gt; Well, as it happens I've known a handful of very wealthy people
<br>
BG&gt; (by which I mean net-worth $100M - $5B+), and my experience with
<br>
BG&gt; them is, not shockingly, that their psychological makeup is about
<br>
BG&gt; the same as anyone else's.  Some of these have been friends,
<br>
BG&gt; others just brief acquaintances. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>BG&gt; I would say that Samantha is right -- these wealthy biz people
<br>
BG&gt; I've known (who may NOT be a representative sample) are by and
<br>
BG&gt; large MORE tech-savvy than the average American, and are by the
<br>
BG&gt; nature of their business concerns, quite interested in and aware
<br>
BG&gt; of global trends.  Their wealth is certainly not threatened by
<br>
BG&gt; abundance in any direct way. 
<br>
<p>Well, perhaps you're more optimistic than I am.  Of course nobody's
<br>
wealth *is* threatened by abundance -- that's the whole point.  Power,
<br>
in the sense of &quot;over others&quot; however, is.  And regardless of the
<br>
facts, what counts is whether abundance is *perceived* as a threat.
<br>
<p>More to the point, when talking about power I don't see this as being
<br>
&quot;in the hands&quot; of people so much as embedded into various social and
<br>
economic structures and loops.  This is why I mentioned &quot;people and
<br>
institutions&quot;, although I should perhaps have been clearer.  My
<br>
attempt to clarify, although not as solid and clear as I'd like,
<br>
follows.
<br>
<p>Take, for instance, a cigarette company: it may well be that every
<br>
last person working for the company (including the owners) is a fine,
<br>
upstanding moral being in a personal sense; while the actions of that
<br>
company as a whole, or as a system, are immoral. This gets us into
<br>
Prisoner's Dillemma territory -- e.g., even if those people working
<br>
for the company decided that its actions were not morally acceptable,
<br>
and quit, they would soon be replaced by others; realizing this, many
<br>
may choose not to quit but instead stay on and try to behave &quot;as
<br>
morally as possible&quot; in that context.
<br>
<p>But that does not change the context or the overall system: the
<br>
company will still produce and market cigarettes.
<br>
<p>I don't think there's widespread understanding of these types of
<br>
issues -- Prisoner's Dillemma, systemic lock-in -- and I don't think
<br>
it's easy, even *with* such understanding, to change systems.
<br>
I haven't heard or read of strategies to break out of such systems, to
<br>
stop such wheels.
<br>
<p>In the case of cigarettes we have seen and are continuing to see
<br>
slow social change, but I would remind you that the process has been
<br>
drawn-out, difficult and antagonistic (wrt the companies), and
<br>
continues to be.  How much more so when the issues are not so
<br>
clear-cut as cancer vs. profit?  I've read that the same man who
<br>
originally conceived of suing cigarette companies is contemplating the
<br>
same approach to fast food (McDonalds et al).  This has afaik largely
<br>
been &quot;laughed out of the court of public opinion&quot;, and understandably
<br>
so.  Yet &quot;zooming out&quot; and looking at the bigger picture, I
<br>
don't think anybody would claim that McDonalds is engaged in a morally
<br>
sound business.
<br>
<p>To make this a bit more general, look at publicly traded companies
<br>
with their stocks and shareholders.  It's my understanding that if a
<br>
public company fails to fully optimize profits by e.g. failing to take
<br>
advantage of an opportunity (which may be immoral), they (or the
<br>
Board?) can be sued for so failing.  Again, it's a situation similar
<br>
to the Prisoner's Dillemma: once responsibility for decisions has been
<br>
parceled out in this way, everybody can (and does) claim clean hands
<br>
-- the employee is &quot;merely&quot; doing what his boss tells him to, and would
<br>
only be replaced if he quits; the boss &quot;merely&quot; tells him to do these
<br>
things, and would only be sued/replaced if he does not; the
<br>
shareholders &quot;merely&quot; are looking out for their financial interest (or
<br>
to add another layer of abstraction, the fund managers are merely
<br>
looking out for their fund's profitability, and will be defunded if
<br>
they don't).
<br>
<p>A quote from Ambrose Bierce's _Devil's Dictionary_ is appropriate
<br>
here:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporation: An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;without individual responsibility.
<br>
<p>It's a matter of systems, ones that have gotten pretty complex over
<br>
time (the concerns I sketch apply to far more than just
<br>
commercialism). I don't see such systems as being easy to change --
<br>
although I'm reasonably optimistic about changing individuals.  I'm
<br>
not saying it's not possible, but that it's not simple.
<br>
<p>Now, I raise this not to *discourage* preparing society for abundance,
<br>
but to sound a somewhat pessimistic warning note for those working on
<br>
technologies of abundance: be careful.  Anticipate and account for the
<br>
*possibility* that there are powers (impersonal and personal) who will
<br>
perceive such technologies as threatening -- or who may want to
<br>
subvert them to their own goals.  Bluntly put: be prepared to go either
<br>
open source or underground if necessary.
<br>
<p>Call me paranoid, but looking at history does not give me confidence
<br>
that &quot;win-win&quot;, much as that phrase is bandied about, is well
<br>
understood.  We already produce enough food to feed anybody.  We
<br>
already could be polluting far less.  We already could be living far
<br>
more efficiently, and &quot;benefitting everyone to the detriment of noone&quot;
<br>
(relative to our current situation) in Buckminster Fuller's phrasing.
<br>
And we aren't.
