How about Internationa You Don't Distrust Your Government Enough 
<br>
day?  9/11 was and is horrific.  But the questions about what 
<br>
really happened and how are rarely fully asked, much less 
<br>
answered.  Actually I would prefer turning it to International 
<br>
Awareness and Global Abundance and Understanding Day myself.
<br>

<br>
peace,

<em>&gt; *******************************************************
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; September 11: Enough Day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dubya, acting upon a joint resolution of Congress, has declared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; September 11 to be Patriot Day. According to his proclamation, we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to &quot;...observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities...&quot; and to &quot;...display the flag at half-staff from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homes and observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. EDT,&quot; this in honor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Americans who died in the terrorist attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know, personally I think this just stinks to hell. I have a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea, so I'm making a proclamation of my own, which of course is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely unendorsed by any US politicians I'm aware of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm declaring September 11 &quot;International Enough Day.&quot; Enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flag-waving, enough violence, enough nationalism. Enough already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; September 11 was not an American tragedy, it was a human tragedy. It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a tragedy not just for the people in the US who died, but for every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent person killed as a result of the US reaction to the attacks as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well. It was a tragedy for the human spirit, regardless of nationality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion, and anything else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On September 11, let's say &quot;Enough.&quot; No more killing. Let's remember not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the victims of the hijacked airplanes in the US, but of the embassy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Let's remember all the Israelis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed by Palestinian bombers and all the Palestinians killed by Israeli
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops. Let's remember all the innocent people slain by Union Carbide in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bhopal, India in 1984. Let's take the day to contemplate the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who've been victims of genocidal warfare in Africa, and the ones who've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starved to death because of political games as well. Let's remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims of the Holocaust and of the firebombing of Dresden, too. Let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not forget those who were slain in the Mai Lai Massacre. Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waving the flag of one nation and thinking only about our own dead,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's make September 11 a day to remember all the people who've died at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hands of someone else's political agenda through no fault of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, and let's say enough. We should stand up and disavow this, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter what country we're in, no matter what religion we are, no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our political affiliation or status or race or anything else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we had a moment of silence marking the time of every atrocity ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed in the name of nationalism, religion... every atrocity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed in the name of the artificial borders that try to make us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget that we're all human, all in this together, all fragile creatures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose lives can be snuffed out in an instant through no fault of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own... then we would never speak again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we here in America should, I think, observe September 11 as the day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the nightmares that humans around the world have been living with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for decades came lumbering ashore on the East Coast of the US. We should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it for what it is; the day the US truly experienced the horror that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rings like a bell around the globe, from South America to the Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East to Micronesia, the day we joined the human race at a most profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fundamental level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There should be no &quot;Patriot Day,&quot; no day to further emphasize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're different. Instead, let's say &quot;Enough.&quot; Enough of putting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests of any one nation above the interests of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enough dwelling on our small differences. Enough killing each other over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. Enough hate, enough fear, enough hunger, enough violence, enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombing, enough enough enough ENOUGH.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should each find our own way of expressing this. A moment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silence... or perhaps a day of silence. Meditation, art, whatever it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you do... do it. Take the day to celebrate the lives of all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us -- wherever we're from and whatever we believe -- who are still here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and think on those -- wherever they were, whenever they were and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever they were -- who weren't so lucky. Take the day to remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fragility of human life and all the nightmares wrought by those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to impose their will upon the whole of humanity. Commit no act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence, however small. Let go of any hatred and prejudice and thirst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for revenge and, for one day, see yourself in the other and the other in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do whatever you do, and do it to say ENOUGH.
</em><br>
