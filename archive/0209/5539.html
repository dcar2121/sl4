GW&gt; I thought you might object here, so here is a full definition of
<br>
GW&gt; work:
<br>
GW&gt;
<br>
GW&gt; &quot;nonaccidental truthfinding, or nonaccidental correlation of a
<br>
GW&gt; given representation with an aspect of external reality; plus
<br>
GW&gt; nonaccidental achievement, defined as the nonaccidental
<br>
GW&gt; convergence of an aspect of external reality to a given goal
<br>
GW&gt; pattern&quot; (Eliezer Yudkowsky) 
<br>

<br>
I don't think there's anything wrong with that definition of work, but
<br>
would point out that the burden of capturing &quot;rationality&quot; has now
<br>
been shifted to &quot;given goal pattern&quot; (this burden was previously
<br>
carried by &quot;work&quot;, or more specifically &quot;success&quot; in the definition of
<br>
&quot;work&quot;).
<br>

<br>
We may identify &quot;goals&quot; of certain processes, e.g. evolution, but
<br>
I see no evidence that we always can do so, or always do so correctly.
<br>

<br>
In Ben's example of the moon crashing into the sun, who are we to say
<br>
some complex or higher goal (of which that, perhaps, is a sub-goal) is
<br>
not being achieved?
<br>

<br>
It seems to me that judging a process rational or arational is, among
<br>
other things, a matter of perspective.  Thus a rainy season may be
<br>
rational because it's a necessary part of the process of plant life --
<br>
while the people of the village that gets flooded when the river
<br>
overruns its banks due to that rain may feel otherwise.  Then again,
<br>
we can look at the village/villagers as a system that learns that the
<br>
river overruns its banks at around the same time every year -- so that
<br>
would be Rational, too...
<br>

<br>
Don't get me wrong, I admire you trying to capture Some Essence with
<br>
these definitions -- I just don't think it can be done.  IMO, at some
<br>
point, identifying a process as Rational requires an intuitive and
<br>
fallible judgment ;)
