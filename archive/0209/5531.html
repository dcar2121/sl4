<br>
I have been thinking about this issue some more.
<br>

<br>
The advancement of software seems to be oddly spotty, actually.
<br>

<br>
Some software types, like word processors and general-purpose programming
<br>
languages, do seem to advance slowly.  Some technologies generally seem to
<br>
plateau -- and word processors seem to have plateaued in the same sense
<br>
that, say, chairs and tables have.  Yeah, there are new chairs, better
<br>
ergonomic chairs, etc. -- but no amazing new advances in chairdom for quite
<br>
some time....
<br>

<br>
On the other hand, I've been working with Maple a fair bit lately, and
<br>
there's no doubt in my mind that mathematical software has advanced
<br>
exponentially.  I remember using tools like Derive back in the 80's -- they
<br>
could graph simple 1-D function and do some very simple equation-solving.
<br>
Comparatively, modern tools like Maple, Mathematica and MATLAB are just
<br>
incredible.
<br>

<br>
The same could be said for graphic software such as Photoshop &amp; Flash ...
<br>
that stuff has come a LONG way..
<br>

<br>
I imagine that if one analyzed the progress of software in detail, one would
<br>
find that, as with hardware, some subdomains have exponentially advanced and
<br>
some have stagnated.  Comparing &quot;software progress&quot; generally with &quot;computer
<br>
hardware progress&quot; is not a great comparison, because software is a huge
<br>
diverse universe, whereas computer hardware is a narrower set of
<br>
technologies, within the larger domain of all hardware (some aspects of
<br>
which have advanced rapidly, others not).
