Eliezer,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due (considerable) respect, if you haven't been there, 
<br>
you have no freaking idea what you are talking about.  I know it 
<br>
sounds really really dumb to you.  But there is a bit more to 
<br>
such things than you might imagine.  A teensy bit of assumption 
<br>
that we weren't simply being utterly nuts, based on dealings 
<br>
with us since, would be nice.
<br>
<p>peace.
<br>
<p>- samantha

<p><em>&gt; You know, by golly, I used to whack my computer with a sledgehammer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every morning, and it would sometimes give really creative results for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word processing and spreadsheet programs.  Of course the hard drive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught fire and the mouse ran away and you could actually hear the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitors screaming just before they exploded; but it's better than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boring old *normal* operation, isn't it?  Besides I once had a friend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose mother's uncle's cousin's daughter's roommate's IRS auditor said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that his computer worked better if he whacked it with a sledgehammer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just trying to provide some perspective on what all this boasting about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;past experiences I have had burning out my own neurons&quot; sounds like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from over in this corner of room.  If you haven't done it yourself, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bizarre tone of defiant pride in others' reports sounds *really really* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odd, given the subject matter.  &quot;Oh, yeah, when I was a kid, I used to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go down to the nuclear waste facility and snort radioactive cobalt up my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nose, and I think it was really a valuable experience, though of course 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't do it now.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
