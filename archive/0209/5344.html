<em>&gt; Given my outlook on the Singularity, it is mostly a numbers game.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because someone has to create the Singularity, some people end up being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth more than your average human because if you killed some or all of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them the Singularity wouldn't happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The last is singularly unfortunate language.  The Singularity is 
<br>
a subgoal not the Supergoal to me.  The super goal is the 
<br>
evolution and transformation of humanity including what various 
<br>
paths call &quot;liberation&quot; and the continued growth and well-being 
<br>
of all sentients.  I see the Singularity as very helpful (to say 
<br>
the least) or as a stage in this process.  It is not the end 
<br>
goal to me.  My primary goal does not grant a view that some 
<br>
sentients &quot;are worth more&quot; than other sentients.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; There is also the small matter of shaping both the Singularity and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people to insure, to the extent we can, the best outcome.  This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simply quantifiable.  Nor again, do I believe creating a Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence is sufficient to solve everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still don't think that this will be an issue.  If we have a Friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, some Friendly means of transition will be employed.  
</em><br>
<p>Transition is a process already occuring now.  Everything from 
<br>
here on out to Singularity is part of it.  All of that will 
<br>
determine whether we even arrive at Singularity, how soon, how 
<br>
many of us arrive there, and to some extent, how Friendly that 
<br>
stage is and how friendly all the stages before were.  We can't 
<br>
just shrug off everything till the sweet by and by of Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, might be the angels in Mike Deering's story.  I don't know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would work best nor what would be most Friendly.  This is something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the first FAI or the Transition Guide that it creates will handle.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not shirking responsibility for seeing to it that humans are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transitioned to the Singularity, only that I am not going to be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the decision of how to transition humans because by that point an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI will be in town.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But by that point, if it comes at all, it will be much too late 
<br>
for many millions if not billions of sentients.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyway, if we have a safe Singularity where humans get a happy ending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I think that humans will be transitioned in a friendly manner 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of their current state.  But, you clearly disagree with me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squarely on this issue, since you seem to think that a super intelligent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transition Guide will still not be capable of transitioning the average 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human into the Singularity.  Why do you consider this to be the case?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what ways will the Transition Guide fail when dealing with normative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the transition guide is the problem.  What may be 
<br>
*if* we get to Singularity and *if* it is Friendly is not what I 
<br>
am most concerned about today or in the immediate future.
