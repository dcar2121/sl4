<em>&gt;&gt; Anyone who thinks humanity can be prepared for the singularity doesn't 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I totally disagree with this statement Aaron. The singularity is NOT 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about technology, it is about FREEDOM of the human race from suffering. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since my last post, approximately 30,000 children under the age of 5

<em>&gt; have died as a result of malnutrition or preventable disease. In case 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you haven't noticed, outside of the 'free' world, life is defined by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardship, misery and suffering.
</em><br>

<br>
Some good questions there.  But life is not defined by hardship, 
<br>
misery and suffering.  It is self-defining as life.  It is a 
<br>
great deal harder than it needs to be for the vast majority of 
<br>
earth's inhabitants, even now, years before Singularity.  If we 
<br>
are indeed motivated by caring for all this suffering humanity 
<br>
then why not also act now to improve the lot of as many as 
<br>
possible?   Ah, because all energy is needed to create the one 
<br>
Great Fix for all.  Well, that *would* be nice.  But it is 
<br>
difficult to not do what can be done in the meantime.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lets say -hypothetically of course - I hand you (Aaron) a true AI entity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is able to improve its own processing capability. What exactly are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you going to do with it? Sure, it can provide you with everything you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever dreamed of, but what about the other 6 billion people on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet? What is their fate? Are you going to allow these people to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose their own destiny, or are you going to force your version of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's best on them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Good question.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; For example, when a human rights group used FORCE to stop an ancient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ritual that involved the mutilation of female genitalia as a right of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage, it was the women who fought back claiming it was their right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no one had the authority to take that away, even though the human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights group was acting in the best interest of the women.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
Horrible example.  This rite of passage has been forced in order 
<br>
to prevent women from fully being able to enjoy sex to 
<br>
supposedly protect their purity but actually to protect their 
<br>
husbands from any thought of straying for better sex partners. 
<br>
In strictly human terms the practice is barbaric and deplorable 
<br>
in the extreme.  Stopping it is not an unreasonable use of 
<br>
force.  Using force to stop the use of of forceo on unwilling or 
<br>
unwitting victims is not a clear wrong.   It might have been 
<br>
better to educate the practice away or in the future just repair 
<br>
the damage.
<br>

<br>
There is a great deal of difference between this ambiguous case 
<br>
and the harm that oculd be done by the incautious and 
<br>
over-exuberant actions of an AI, self-directed or otherwise.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; My point is, if/when singularity occurs, it can't be forced on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general population, they must willingly accept the technology. IMO, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating the technology necessary to achieve singularity is only half 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the battle, the other half is convincing the people it is going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve their lives. The true goal of the singularity is in fact to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve peoples lives, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I agree a lot with your conclusions and with the focus.  It is 
<br>
not universal here though.  For some the goal is creating more, 
<br>
preferably maximally more and better, intelligence whether that 
<br>
is good at all for people and their lives or not.
