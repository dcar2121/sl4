&lt;snipping and re-ordering your points&gt;

<br>
SA&gt; I don't think it is wired into our evolution that the only way to
<br>
SA&gt; live is through endless competition for material things even in
<br>
SA&gt; times of great abundance.
<br>

<br>
I agree, and as you point out there have been/are cultures based
<br>
around other paradigms.
<br>

<br>
SA&gt; Perhaps, while we can't espect a major spiritual transformation,
<br>
SA&gt; we can expect enough of a shift in beliefs and perceptions that 
<br>
SA&gt; we can re-order some of our institutions, our  economics and 
<br>
SA&gt; parts of our politics and expectations to be based on abundance 
<br>
SA&gt; ratheer than scarcity.
<br>

<br>
But this I'm not too sure of.  Our institutions, economics and
<br>
politics by and large are based on zero-sum tactics, scarcity
<br>
thinking, however you want to describe or name it.
<br>

<br>
To raise a hypothetical: there's plenty of &quot;free energy&quot; theorists out
<br>
there (some very amusing, the majority running financial scams to
<br>
get &quot;investors&quot;), and almost all of them posit a conspiracy by Big
<br>
Oil / Big Energy.  But what if there really *was* a cheap/easy way to
<br>
create an abundance of energy -- what if, say, somebody managed to get
<br>
some form of tabletop (or &quot;cold&quot;) fusion working?  I think The Powers
<br>
That Be* would do everything in their power to shut that down.  At this
<br>
point, they're too entrenched in scarcity-based thinking -- too
<br>
&quot;addicted&quot; to power -- to be able to see beyond it.
<br>

<br>

<br>
* By such a glib phrase I don't mean simply people in power, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions, which over a certain level of complexity become
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;more than the sum of their parts&quot;, with their own motivations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.  Every last person working at a cigarette or bomb factory may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be a &quot;nice guy&quot; while the organization as a whole can still act
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;despicably.  (see <a href="http://www.ag.wastholm.net/aphorism/A-1102">http://www.ag.wastholm.net/aphorism/A-1102</a> )
