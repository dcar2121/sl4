<p>There is very little really &quot;new&quot; in Java.  Garbage collection?

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, it was around in Lisp more than 4 decades ago and in 
<br>
Smalltalk for over 2 decades.  It was perfected in both to a 
<br>
level far surpassing the current or near term future versions of 
<br>
Java.  Byte code intermediate implementation aiding distribution 
<br>
of code and portability?  Again Lisp and Smalltalk and other 
<br>
languages had that for quite some time.  OO of course is quite 
<br>
ancient compared to a new comer like Java.  Java and C# are 
<br>
static OO models.  This is a serious and unnecessary limitation 
<br>
on what is possible to code and how naturally.

<em>&gt; Modern languages have higher productivity for three main reasons: more

<p>Compared to Smalltalk, which the Java libraries were designed to

partially duplicate, Java libraries are not any great shakes. 
<br>
One thing I do like about Java is a very smooth integration of 
<br>
multi-threading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; hardware agnostic in that they both compile into platform independent

<p><em>&gt; Basic that also compile down to platform independent &quot;bytecode&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Multi-language implementations in a core language was done on 
<br>
the Lisp machines around a couple of decades ago. C# and Java 
<br>
seriously handicap the implementation of many languages that do 
<br>
are not as static, many not be C-stack based, or may allow 
<br>
significant departure from an OO, class-centric model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that software is doing a lot better that you believe. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  It isn't.  If anything, I am overly optimistic. C# and 
<br>
Java or any language alone cannot be fully responsible for 
<br>
software being healthy of course.  What C# and Java do have is 
<br>
huge companies behind their adoption, for better or worse.
