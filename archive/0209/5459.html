BG&gt; You seem to be making the observation that the &quot;higher self&quot; (as
<br>
BG&gt; some have referred to it) is one and indivisible -- is the same
<br>
BG&gt; &quot;core self&quot; inside all of us.  This is an age-old mystical
<br>
BG&gt; observation which has a deep validity to it.
<br>

<br>
I think &quot;observation&quot; is the right word here.  There are mystical
<br>
states (that can be achieved by a number of methods) where this core
<br>
self is directly experienced.
<br>

<br>
Without going into detail, when (if?) I experienced such a state I
<br>
found myself quite speechless -- and utterly convinced of immortality.
<br>
Immortality of consciousness, that is -- not the personal sort.  And
<br>
convinced, also, of a striving-towards-Godness that is immanent in the
<br>
universe.  I don't mean Godness in a traditional religious sense,
<br>
but rather in the sense of us all being fragments, perhaps, who've
<br>
forgotten our underlying unity.  A struggling to wake up from this
<br>
dream and a sense that we're (or I AM, in biblical terms) close to
<br>
doing so.  Perhaps akin to what Philip K. Dick meant by 'anamnesis'.
<br>

<br>
So much for mysticism.
<br>

<br>
As a geek, neophile, technophile, what have you, my (crude metaphor
<br>
ahoy!) left brain is fascinated with the Singularity and how to get
<br>
there: evaluating possible approaches to AI, drawing exponential
<br>
graphs, speculating on nanotech, uploading and the rest.
<br>

<br>
And I wonder if this technical path goes up the same mountain, just
<br>
from the other side, and meets up with the mystical path at the top.
<br>

<br>
Sometimes I wonder whether science and mysticism must meet and
<br>
integrate at some point before the top in order to get all the way to
<br>
the top -- that place where magic and technology become truly
<br>
indistinguishable (not just to those with lesser technology).
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; However, this &quot;higher self&quot; or &quot;deep self&quot; or &quot;raw core of
<br>
BG&gt; awareness&quot; (First as Charles Peirce called it) is not the same as
<br>
BG&gt; the &quot;psychosocial self&quot; which individuates us and makes us &quot;who we
<br>
BG&gt; are&quot;, in the sense that I am different from Eliezer, who is
<br>
BG&gt; different from my friend's housecleaner, etc. 
<br>

<br>
Yes.  And I don't know whether it makes sense to think in terms of
<br>
individual survival past the Singularity.  My psychosocial self, me,
<br>
myself, &quot;I&quot; -- of course I desire it.  At times that seems like a
<br>
selfish or fear-based desire though -- akin to an infant not wanting
<br>
to leave the womb.  In my own case, I find it hard to clearly separate
<br>
my fear of death from my fear of pain from my will to survive from my
<br>
will for Something to survive.
<br>

<br>
Maybe the Singularity will let me *return* to the womb.
<br>
