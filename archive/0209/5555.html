<br>
I am not defining intelligence here.  I'm talking about rational 
<br>
intelligence, something which is very different from intelligence.  It 
<br>
refers only to a measure of the amount of rationality drawn upon.  I 
<br>
would not use the world intelligence to describe evolution as using the 
<br>
common meaning of `intelligence', however it is true that it can be 
<br>
useful to think of evolution as being intelligent, just not most of the 
<br>
time.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I do consider evolution to display intelligence, though a different kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than human intelligence.
</em><br>

<br>
Yes, vastly different.  Different enough that I would avoid using the 
<br>
term `intelligence' when discussing evolution to avoid confusion.  It's 
<br>
useful only for showing that all processes that draw upon rationality 
<br>
exhibit a certain trait which can be thought of as an intelligence 
<br>
(goal-oriented work).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; However, I don't think it's important that the two of us define all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms in exactly the same ways, just that we're clear about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we individually use.
</em><br>

<br>
This is useless for meaningful communication.  The only reason for 
<br>
giving a specific definition of work is to be explicit about what 
<br>
rationality is (and then only because I don't want to write the 
<br>
explanation every time).  In all other cases I try to go by what would 
<br>
be a common sense definition.  In the case of rationality, it's not that 
<br>
there isn't a common definition of rationality, only that most people 
<br>
can't understand it.  I'm trying to explain more than define.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I now see a lot more harmony between our differing definitions of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things than I did a month ago.
</em><br>

<br>
I don't.  Intelligence is not rationality.  Intelligence is not a force 
<br>
that processes can draw upon.  Intelligence refers to goal-oriented 
<br>
processes (NOTE:  intelligence != rational intelligence) that draws on 
<br>
rationality.  The human mind has explicit goals, evolution does not.
