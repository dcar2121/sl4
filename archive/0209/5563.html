The following is a follow-up on a previous question-response.

<br>
(www.sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/0206/0402.html)
<br>

<br>
I believe the question was misinterpreted due to poor phrasing.
<br>

<br>
01.  What cognitive processes may allow for altruism?
<br>

<br>
02.  What does it mean for a cognitive process to allow for altruism?
<br>

<br>
********************************************************
<br>

<br>
The following are prompted by recent difficulty in explaining aspects of
<br>
Friendliness.  (Apologies if some of these are wrong questions.)
<br>

<br>
********************************************************
<br>

<br>
03.  &quot;...for any sort of diverse audience, humans generally use the
<br>
semantics of objectivity, by which I mean that a statement is argued to
<br>
be 'true' or 'false' without reference to data that the
<br>
audience/persuadee would cognitively process as 'individual.'&quot;
<br>
(www.intelligence.org/CFAI/design/structure/shaper.html#some)
<br>

<br>
What are the implications of the semantics of objectivity?
<br>

<br>
04.  &quot;Thus, when humans talk about 'morality,' we generally refer to the
<br>
body of cognitive material that uses the semantics of objectivity.&quot;
<br>
(www.intelligence.org/CFAI/design/structure/shaper.html#some)
<br>

<br>
What composes said body of cognitive material?
<br>

<br>
05.  What are examples of non-good/non-bad Gaussian abilities that
<br>
ground in panhuman characteristics?
<br>

<br>
06.  What are examples of good or bad Gaussian abilities that ground in
<br>
panhuman characteristics and that the shaper network will recognize?
<br>

<br>
07.  &quot;The renormalizing shaper network should ultimately ground itself
<br>
in the panhuman and gaussian layers, without use of material from the
<br>
personality layer of the original programmer.&quot;
<br>
(www.intelligence.org/CFAI/design/structure/friendliness.html)
<br>

<br>
What does &quot;material&quot; refer to?  Please give examples of material in the
<br>
panhuman and gaussian layers that the shaper network will use.
<br>

<br>
08.  &quot;...requires all the structural Friendliness so far described, an
<br>
explicit surface-level decision of the starting set to converge,
<br>
prejudice against circular logic as a surface decision, protection
<br>
against extraneous causes by causal validity semantics and surface
<br>
decision,...&quot;)
<br>
(www.intelligence.org/CFAI/design/structure/friendliness.html)
<br>

<br>
What does &quot;surface decision&quot; mean?
<br>

<br>
09.  What is the best way to determine whether an action is Friendly,
<br>
and why?  What is the _last_ way, and why?  (Prehuman AI, Infrahuman AI)
<br>

<br>
10.  What are your present predictions on why Friendly AI will fail?
<br>

<br>
********************************************************
<br>

<br>
The following are prompted by personal curiosity.
<br>

<br>
********************************************************
<br>

<br>
11.  What have you studied or what are you studying for Friendliness
<br>
content?
<br>

<br>
12.  What recent progress have you made and what progress do you need to
<br>
make on Friendliness content?
<br>

<br>
13.  What are the next steps for Friendly AI theory?
<br>

<br>
