<p>BP&gt; All,

BP&gt;   I would like to recommend dropping the thread.
<br>
BP&gt; SL4 is a list about machine intelligence and 
<br>
BP&gt; while [...]
<br>
<p>&quot;Shock Level Four includes the Singularity (or the technological
<br>
creation of greater-than-human intelligence), ultraintelligence,
<br>
Powers, Jupiter Brains, posthumanity, Alpha-Point cosmologies,
<br>
Apotheosis, and so on.  This list was created for discussion of the
<br>
Singularity or other SL4 topics, and chat among Singularitarians or
<br>
other aficionados of the future.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- <a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/SL4.html">http://sysopmind.com/sing/SL4.html</a>
<br>
<p>In that some have argued (John Lilly, Timothy Leary, Aleister Crowley,
<br>
et al) that possible paths towards greater-than-ordinary human
<br>
intelligence might include the use of psychedelics, I disagree that
<br>
this subject is per definition excluded from the charter of this list.
<br>
<p>If some forms of or combinations of neurological manipulation
<br>
(physically or through, e.g., pulsed magnetic fields), Yoga,
<br>
meditation, occult practices, psychedelics, etc. could for instance
<br>
&quot;give access&quot; to the same facilities some &quot;idiot savants&quot; have, I
<br>
would count that as a SL4-worthy topic.  (E.g., if there is further
<br>
expansion on articles like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,51421,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,51421,00.html</a>
<br>
I would consider this relevant, at least to the charter as written.)
<br>
<p>I would also agree with Ben Goertzel that a sense of just *how vastly*
<br>
different awareness/consciousness can become -- whether under the
<br>
influence of meditation, Yoga, psychedelics, or what have you -- might
<br>
be of value to those trying to imagine post- or super-human
<br>
intelligence.  Not to discount the dangers of experimentation in these
<br>
fields -- which are large -- and not to imply that any insights so
<br>
gleaned will give an at all accurate or even insightful picture -- but
<br>
in the sense of giving the participant, as it were, a Shock Level + 1
<br>
or 2 their current level in a very direct way.  (Certain occult
<br>
rituals appear to be designed towards that same purpose.)  As much as
<br>
words and thoughts can contribute to a sense of utter &quot;other&quot;ness,
<br>
they cannot IMO compare to the impact of an overwhelming *experience*.
