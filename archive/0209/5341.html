----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Cliff Stabbert&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cps46@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20anonymous%20collaborative%20filtering">cps46@earthlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's a reformulation:  a new discussion board-type technology where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anonymous contributions become, through some form of collaberative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filtering/reordering/reformulation, a _single train of thought_.
</em><br>
<p>Your wording doesn't make sense to me. A collaborative technique or action
<br>
has the end result of a single train of thought. And if it human
<br>
collaboration that is employing the technique, the only benefit from using a
<br>
particular technology is simply as a tool for the individual humans to enter
<br>
and filter/reorder/reformulate the stored information. If the collaboration
<br>
is performed by an AI, then the discussion board technology simply becomes
<br>
an issue of human user interface design on how to enter and render
<br>
information.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My main thrust isn't the anonymity itself, but producing those single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threads of thought collectively.  Something somewhat akin, perhaps, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how two authors can collaborate on a piece of fiction -- refining and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hammering each paragraph, each chapter, the overall structure until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither can even clearly point to &quot;which bits&quot; they wrote.  But with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more people.
</em><br>
<p>In programming, merging two pieces of source code can be done automatically
<br>
without any intelligence in a lot of cases. Intelligence is needed to make a
<br>
decision when there are overlapping differences, rather than simple addition
<br>
or deletions. If the source code is well organized due to good software
<br>
architecture, most text merges will be of a simple nature.
<br>
<p>In a collaborative system, we are using ideas instead of text to merge
<br>
together. But unlike linear text that is pre-designed, tested and
<br>
scrutinized before attempting to merge, ideas are very non-linear and the
<br>
resulting natural language text is very complex, so that the only simple
<br>
automated merges are additions and deletions.
<br>
<p>I myself have had visions of an email client that could manage threads of
<br>
conversation at the sub-message level. I despise traditional methods of
<br>
quoting and re-quoting, line-wrapping, inconsistent markup that various
<br>
individuals prefer. The next step from having a dumb system that can follow
<br>
threads of conversation where the textual merging consists of additions, is
<br>
to do what you are asking and use Natural Language Processing to consolidate
<br>
the linear thread of a conversation, removing redundancies, and making
<br>
intelligent decisions between two texts that represent the same idea.
<br>
<p>Your authoring example also has the requirement that everyone is speaking
<br>
the same language. Ideas should be parsed and merged correctly, regardless
<br>
of their natural language text encoding.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I imagine anonymity as helpful in eliminating ego
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects; in the right context with the right people it may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely necessary but I'd still opt for it because ego has a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sneaking up on you.
</em><br>
<p>This is a social problem. You need to figure out the idea parsing first.
<br>
Personally, I prefer people to be identifiable and accountable for what they
<br>
say, egotistically or not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Two things that come to mind as threads to explore: mind mapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software (googleable; I've seen better examples than at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.visual-mind.com/introd.htm">http://www.visual-mind.com/introd.htm</a> but it'll do for a start),
</em><br>
<p>The trademarked Mind Maps were developed by Tony Buzan, and is designed very
<br>
specifically for humans to work and think in a more visual mode.
<br>
<a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~caveman/Creative/Mindmap/index.html">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~caveman/Creative/Mindmap/index.html</a>
<br>
Creating a discussion board that uses graphical artifacts will be difficult
<br>
to sell to people because they are still used to thinking linearly, in a
<br>
&quot;train of thought&quot; as you put it. The introduction of HTTP hyperlinks in
<br>
email is commonplace because it is encoded as simple text; you just type it
<br>
in, no buttons to press or commands to remember. Not very many people
<br>
re-read what they just wrote in an email, let alone grammar-check or simply
<br>
spell-check it!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; the &quot;glass bead game&quot; (also googleable, see e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.corewave.com/core/">http://www.corewave.com/core/</a> and check the tour and main map).
</em><br>
<p>It &quot;looks&quot; interesting because of the visual component of the map. I will
<br>
read more of this site when I have time. The moves, mapping to progression
<br>
of idea discussion, seem to take a very long time on the order of months. I
<br>
would not find a serious discussion very productive on that time scale.
<br>
<p><p>cheers,
<br>
