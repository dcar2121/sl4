</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  I have no problem with restricting it to the last 10,000 years if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's something that requires writing but hasn't been tried over that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, or the last 500 years if it's something that requires printing but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has never been tried, and is significantly different and significantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more powerful than anything that has previously been tried.
</em><br>
<p><p>I am attempting to point out that exponentially increasing 
<br>
technology cuts more than one way.  It enables psychological, 
<br>
social and economic changes that would not have been considred 
<br>
or would not have been viable earlier.   I also have some 
<br>
misgiving about the truly effective or worth doing, by 
<br>
implication above, being limited to the &quot;significantly 
<br>
different&quot; and &quot;significantly more powerful&quot;.   It tends to 
<br>
limit consideration to *the* most singnificantly different and 
<br>
more powerful we can conceive of. It tends to miss cumulative 
<br>
effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, not trying to be difficult; this is a test met by seed AI, as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy in the battle against human suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong.  The above is a good question. However, I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not yet prepare to offer an answer I believe goes deep enough to satisfy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  I'm glad you're not jumping on an answer.  Just remember that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there *is* at least one answer which *does* satisfy the above the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements.    And that some of us are moving on it already.  Speed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counts, sometimes.  If you want us to do something differently, such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend X% of our resources on something else, we're going to want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concrete answers to certain questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree the requirements are actually all required to 
<br>
significantly increase the well-being  of humanity and better 
<br>
insure our survival or that the above requirements provide 
<br>
coverage of what is needed. The seed AI  may or may not lead to 
<br>
the well-being of humanity.  It is a good bet, but it is not the 
<br>
only one or so obviously the very best one to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Remember, us AIfolk have to deal with the shadow of fifty years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; failure; everyone wants to know what we're going to do that hasn't been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; tried before.  You have to dig yourself out from under the heap of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; people's failures; show that your thinking is new enough not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; belong in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the trash heap with the things that have been tried before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think this is a poor way of thinking.  Each effort stands more on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; its own merits without being bogged down by everything before. Yes we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; learn from past failures but we do not have to personally redeem all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that baggage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not?  It seems like a good test to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because it is &quot;putting new wine in old bottles&quot;. It is starting 
<br>
from a place of apology and differentiating from instead of 
<br>
explication, creation and refinement of what I wish to see come 
<br>
into existence. I don't have to dig myself out from under this 
<br>
heap unless I agree to be buried under all that stuff. Now, it 
<br>
is certainly true that people will ask and should ask how what 
<br>
is proposed is different from what has been proposed and tried 
<br>
before and/or how the situation now is more conducive to 
<br>
something similar working.  But at some point the work has to 
<br>
stand or fall on its own merits and find its own form rather 
<br>
than being defined in terms of similarities and differences to 
<br>
what has come before.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is your thinking that new?  Why are your plans that original?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; New and original are not necessarily primary criteria.  The situation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is new.  The communication bandwidth is new.  Can something effective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be done with that?  Perhaps.  It is to be designed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then just do it.  It's the very first test you're facing.  It is very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from the last.  It's what you have to do right at the beginning in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to get started.  *Meet* the challenge, don't just acknowledge it.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Face it down, accomplish it, get it over with, and go on to the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step on the path.  You are running out of time.  Admiring a problem is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor substitute for solving it, especially if it's just a first step.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I really, really hear that!  I am very much aware that there is 
<br>
little time - that if anything is to be done it must be done 
<br>
soon and it must begin *now*. Since I believe this strategy is 
<br>
very much needed I must, out of my own caring for humanity, 
<br>
pursue it. At the very least I must work it through to where I 
<br>
can see if it is as real and viable as I believe.  I would not 
<br>
be able to believe I had done everything possible to be of help 
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Understand, I am not asking this in order to be difficult.  I can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; at least three things you could try, in terms of promoting greater human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; enlightenment before the Singularity, that have never been tried 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; before. What I want to know is what *you're* thinking of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Please share those things.  They may make a real difference. My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thinking is early and tentative.  I am not fully ready to lay it out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1:  See whether humans can use feedback from realtime fMRI to help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify internal rationalization, hatred, tribal-based thinking, etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may not get all the bugs, but if you can get just some, it may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to tip the internal mental balance.  Evolution has no experience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puppeteering humans with access to that information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2:  Collaborative filtering and/or the Earthweb; a means whereby one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea can very rapidly spread to billions and be built upon by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands. Accelerated memetic evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3:  See whether humans who talk to infrahuman but clear-thinking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AIs learn anything from that about how to think rationally.  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words, AI-trained humans may be doable pre-Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I'm trying to say is that you have not accomplished anything until 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you pick one of those strategies or something like it, and get started 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on implementing it directly.  The Singularity is not a religion, it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GANTT chart.  You cannot worship it, admire it, believe in it, or accept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it into your heart; you have to find one of the open boxes and turn it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; green.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>While some or all of the above are of some help I do not believe 
<br>
any or all of them are a panacea or that nothing at all can be 
<br>
accomplished without them.  A lot of my particular focus is not 
<br>
in the technological area.  It is more concerned with the 
<br>
consciousness of the users of the technology  which drives what 
<br>
they use the technology for and in what context.  It drives what 
<br>
their extensions of the technology and all other parts of their 
<br>
life will be. That said, (2) and many variants, is quite 
<br>
interesting to me and promoting/building some parts of it will 
<br>
be one thing I am involved in.   It is one of several tools that 
<br>
is needed to do the work more effectively.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; It doesn't do much good to issue calls to action without a strategy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; promises to work.  Not a strategy that *sounds* good.  Not a strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; that blazes like a banner and uplifts your heart.  A strategy which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; unlike the stuff that's been previously tried over the last 50,000 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; will actually work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is of course still a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; crucial part of reaching enough people.  What do you believe will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; actaully work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seed AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or computer-mediated telepathy between 64-node clustered humans whose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefrontal cortices have learned to talk to one another over meganeuron 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadband connections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some form of transhumanity which can be achieved as rapidly as possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using our existing technological base; that's a big enough hammer.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't believe there's much else that *really would* work, however nice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it sounded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is a crucial part of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaching enough people, but having a workable strategy comes first. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise the cheering doesn't *accomplish* anything.  Humans like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheering and will cheer whether or not anything gets done as a result.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am deeply suspicious of cheering, and I speak as a cheerleader.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you can focus enough people a bit differently that can 
<br>
accomplish wonders.  It is a lot more than &quot;cheering&quot;. It is 
<br>
changed lives, perceptions and actions (to name a short list) 
<br>
that I am after.  I want to see a changed set of assumptions 
<br>
about what life is about and what its possibilities are, locally 
<br>
and globally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again:  What are you going to do, and why is it going to work when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; everything previous has failed?  To quote Doonesbury, &quot;Let's kick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; butt!&quot; is not a plan unless you know which butts to kick, how far, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and in which direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That notion of kicking butt is actually almost diametrically opposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to what I believe needs to happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know.  Still a good quote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>OK.
