</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with your example is that the system artificially behaves
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintended consequences of the laws and regulations that education

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is itself the problem.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand your distinction between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot;
<br>
social subsystems.
<br>
<p>Your statement reminds me of the common Libertarian assumption that the
<br>
state and the government are some kind of parasitic excrescence that can
<br>
just be scraped off the surface of a society that functions essentially
<br>
without them.
<br>
<p>Rather, I think the government and its actions are integral parts of a
<br>
highly complex system (which has strengths and weaknesses), and that
<br>
institutions and social patterns implemented by the government are the
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; consequences of deeper social forces.  Governmental
<br>
systems evolve by largely the same patterns as nongovernmental social
<br>
institutions.
<br>
<p>In my statement, I was not assuming anything about the &quot;value&quot; of public
<br>
school systems.  That is a deep topic unto itself, which your historical
<br>
analysis didn't fully address, because back in the 1800's when public
<br>
schools were started, the existing private school system didn't really deal
<br>
with the issue of educating lower-income kids.  The current debate over
<br>
privatization of schools, centers around effects on lower-income kids; I
<br>
think it's more widely accepted that upper-income kids (the only kind who
<br>
went to school way back when) would fare at least as well under a privatized
<br>
education system.  (Personally, I am in favor of the voucher system, but
<br>
that argument would take us too far from SL4 topics).
<br>
<p>I was merely giving an example of Cliff's point: that changing the minds of
<br>
people is even MORE difficult than it would be otherwise, because the social
<br>
institutions in which they're involved enforce a kind of conservatism.
<br>
<p>The sad fact is, the social institutions that have persevered and flourished
<br>
are in large part not the ones with the greatest positive benefits for
<br>
humans, but rather the ones that have done best at surviving and
<br>
multiplying.  Straightforward evolutionary logic.
<br>
<p>This pattern can be seen throughout history.  Look at the history of
<br>
Christianity (to introduce another controversial topic).  In the 200 years
<br>
after the birth of Christ, there were dozens of interesting gnostic
<br>
Christian sects, many of which were nonsexist, egalitarian, and oriented
<br>
toward individual spiritual/mental exploration.  Which of these sects
<br>
survived and eventually dominated?  The one that grew into Catholicism?
<br>
Why?  Largely, because its authoritarian and dogmatic structure was more
<br>
amenable to &quot;franchising&quot;....  It was better at propagating itself than its
<br>
&quot;competitors.&quot;
<br>
<p>Generally, authoritarianism and dogmatism (characteristics of the public
<br>
schools system as well as the Catholic church) seem to grant institutions
<br>
with a lot of survival value....  Flexible, egalitarian organizations seem
<br>
more prone to dissolve.  Modern parliamentary democratic systems occupy an
<br>
interesting middle ground, and obviously have achieved some survival value.
<br>
<p>It may be that the Net and other modern communication systems can change
<br>
this dynamic somewhat.  Looser forms of organization, like the
<br>
much-discussed Linux team, have demonstrated a fair bit of staying power.
<br>
If modern communication tech can allow different sorts of social structures
<br>
to survive and flourish, this may make a really big difference in human
<br>
psychology and sociology.  So far, the verdict is not in on this point,
<br>
really....
<br>
<p>To an extent, we are relying on these recent, tech-driven trends
<br>
organizational structure within the Novamente team -- which is a physically
<br>
widely distributed organization, with a central core that is a traditional
<br>
software development team, and another group of broadly distributed
<br>
communicators not organized in a traditional manner...

<em>&gt; As most people are aware, public education didn't always exist in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S., with it being implemented as late as 1920 in some States.  Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advent of public education, the US was the most literate country in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world, with some states in the mid-19th century boasting literacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rates higher than they are today in those same states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Massachusetts was among the first states to dabble in public education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and opened public schools in the 1830's as an ideological alternative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the vast number and range of private schools in operation.  The schools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were an utter failure, both in terms of the quality of the teaching and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their ability to attract even the poorest students even though they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were free.  The quality of the education provided by these schools was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regularly savaged by representatives in the State government, a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whom thought the whole idea of public education was a disaster and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this experiment in an open market proved it.  Even while the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools were free, virtually everyone chose to go to private schools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is substantial historical writings during that period to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect, as it was a topic of significant discussion.  Note that even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poorest children were able to get a private education -- there were many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free schools around to provide for this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a solution to the problem of the public schools not attracting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students during the twenty year experiment, the State of Massachusetts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed a body of legislation in 1851 that effectively forced most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private schools out of business and mandated school attendance within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strict guidelines that were designed to favor public schools. Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public education system could not compete on an open market for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education, the State legislatively eliminated the competition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Massachusetts was the first State to do this, and most of the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the States copied this model eventually.  It was not a popular decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one of the cases where we have a long history of both private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and government provided solutions, as well as significant periods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time where both these solutions existed in parallel, allowing people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote with their feet and dollars for what they preferred.  The sad part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that even though private education was considered vastly better and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely recognized as such at the time when both options were available,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government still chose to force people to use public education.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did a lot of research (due to a heated argument) on the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education in the U.S. a year or two ago and was amazed at what I found.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have since become avidly against the institution of government-run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education, as history does not look favorably on it at all and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who actually had an honest choice between the two despised public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education as an option for the very same reasons that people despise it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today. It is something that should never have happened, but now that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have exceptionally good data points for all cases, nobody has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courage to actually switch back to the model that worked best.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people-systems that exhibit pathological behaviors are that way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because somebody created a rule that makes them that way, regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the intent of the rule.
</em><br>
