<em>&gt; &gt; I trust that someone is thinking rationally about the Singularity, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposed to rationalizing, when I see that they are willing to make major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *new* life decisions explicitly on the basis of how it affects the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, no one can make a decision based on how anything will affect the
<br>
Singularity, only based on how they're guessing something will affect the
<br>
Singularity!
<br>
<p>And it seems to me that someone could *rationally* decide that nothing they
<br>
do is likely to affect the course of the Singularity, and hence rationally
<br>
decide NOT to change their life based on their thinking about the
<br>
Singularity.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with their reasoning, because I
<br>
think there are things ANYONE could do to help with the Singularity. But
<br>
based on the limited information available and the difficulty of predicting
<br>
the future, I wouldn't consider their thinking about the Singularity
<br>
IRRATIONAL.
<br>
<p>Also, someone could easily change their life to a life of
<br>
Singularity-devoted activity, based on IRRATIONAL thinking about the
<br>
Singularity, e.g. based on Utopian delusions about the Singularity.
<br>
<p>All in all, I'm not so sure that the willingness to make life decisions
<br>
based on the Singularity is highly correlated with rational thinking about
<br>
the Singularity. Though it is definitely correlated with
<br>
Singularity-awareness ;)
<br>
<p>Anyway, I didn't mean this argument to distract from the excitement of SIAI
<br>
getting a new full-time staff member.  That is great news!  I'm sure that
<br>
having someone to focus specifically on coordination of volunteer efforts
<br>
will be a big help to your excellent &amp; important work...
