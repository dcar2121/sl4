<p>
How can people be expected to parse this sentence?  I have to be pedantic: I
<br>
*think* you mean &quot;Given it has been shown without doubt that x person could
<br>
deliberately act to hasten the Singularity by one week, then, in the case that
<br>
he decline to do thus, it at least behooves him to see to it that the number of
<br>
people who would have died in any given week make it to see the Singularity,
<br>
however it might be done (good luck on that one).&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is what you mean then I agree.  Though I don't know how one might
<br>
show the given except in retrospect when it's too late.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I think Ben's full of crap saying implicitly that working toward the
<br>
singularity isn't helping humans concretely in the present world.  CFAI is a
<br>
herculean task like the Augean Stables: Ben would have some of us throw dung out
<br>
of the stable with old reliable spoons, while the bigger thinker sees the
<br>
solution (diverting most of a river with a giant hollow log or such so that it
<br>
passes through the stables, according to the story).  For a lot of people to act
<br>
together to move the log were more effective than getting them to spoon more
<br>
dung in that at least with the log there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and
<br>
the more people pitch in to move the log the faster it is accomplished.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many instances the only way x person might help expedite Singularity is
<br>
by donating a part of his income to those who have the requisite skill.  That is
<br>
beyond debate; it's showing how the log will work and convincing him with, say,
<br>
a scale model.  It's convincing all of them who can contribute.  Ay, there's the
<br>
rub.  The thing Ben needs to see is that the spooners could even slow the
<br>
loggers down (they don't help matters simply by remaining spooners or neutral
<br>
bystanders either), and that we can't let ourselves become obsessed with the bit
<br>
of dung immediately before us and start spooning at it, but must see the whole
<br>
problem.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sentiment is that all this ought to go without saying, but I felt like
<br>
typing today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is going to have to be a huge amount of help.  See the WTA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deathwatch for the numbers.  For example, if that person's helping made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity occur one week earlier, if he didn't work on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity then I think that it would be fair to expect him to see to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it that the number of people who would have died in any given week make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to see the Singularity.
