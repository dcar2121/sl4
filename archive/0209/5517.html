<br>
This is a side point for sure, but I can't help taking the bait this early
<br>
New Mexico morning...
<br>

<br>
Chris, have you traveled much outside the Western world?
<br>

<br>
I have, and based on what I've seen, your statement is a bit of an
<br>
overstatement.
<br>

<br>
There are pockets of really terrible adversity now -- say, war-torn sections
<br>
of the Congo, Ethiopia, etc.  [Although reportedly, the pygmies in the Congo
<br>
are OK, having retreated deep into the forest.]
<br>

<br>
But from what I saw in (for example) China and Indonesia, there are a lot of
<br>
people enjoying themselves reasonably well in spite of having a lot less
<br>
money than us.  Not that they wouldn't prefer more personal and political
<br>
freedom, or more possessions -- hey, so would I! -- but....  Ditto when I
<br>
traveled thru Bulgaria when it was still communist.
<br>

<br>
Of course I've also seen plenty of bad poverty, most notably in India (which
<br>
is part of the &quot;free world&quot; in the sense that it has a democratic government
<br>
and is a US ally).  But although life for the beggars in Bombay looked
<br>
awfully bad, life for the poor in the Indian *villages* looked highly
<br>
acceptable to me....
<br>

<br>
[As a a side point, it does not seem to be true that people are more
<br>
&quot;well-off&quot; statistically in Third World countries with democratic,
<br>
US-friendly governments.  There are plenty of poor &quot;free&quot; countries where
<br>
the people are worse off than in China, for example.]
<br>

<br>
Finally, having known a certain number of wealthy people here in the US, I
<br>
can also affirm that the absence of hardship does not imply the absence of
<br>
misery and suffering!  I'm sure the percentage of misery and suffering is
<br>
less among wealthy people than among poor people, but, perhaps not *as much*
<br>
less as you're suspecting.
<br>

<br>
I do feel the world political system is sick, in the sense that the world is
<br>
now generating enough wealth that physically painful impoverishment (as with
<br>
Indian beggars, or poor folk in wartorn Congo) &quot;shouldn't&quot; exist.  I just
<br>
don't think it's quite as badly sick as your comment implies.
<br>

<br>
I agree that the reason for this sickness is the operation of the human
<br>
brain....  This is pretty damn clear with the political situation in so many
<br>
African countries, where endless battles between rival warlords are
<br>
destroying lives and nations.  Look at www.lonelyplanet.com and run thru the
<br>
list of central African nations and see how many have war-based travel
<br>
advisories [a source of vexation to me since I really want to take a trip
<br>
into the Central African Republic jungle one of these years...].
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Lets say -hypothetically of course - I hand you (Aaron) a true AI entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is able to improve its own processing capability. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to do with it? Sure, it can provide you with everything you ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreamed of, but what about the other 6 billion people on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is their fate? Are you going to allow these people to choose their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destiny, or are you going to force your version of what's best on them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, when a human rights group used FORCE to stop an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient ritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that involved the mutilation of female genitalia as a right of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the women who fought back claiming it was their right and no one had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the authority to take that away, even though the human rights group was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting in the best interest of the women.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point is, if/when singularity occurs, it can't be forced on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population, they must willingly accept the technology. IMO, creating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology necessary to achieve singularity is only half the battle, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other half is convincing the people it is going to improve their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true goal of the singularity is in fact to improve peoples lives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't it?
</em><br>

<br>
The true goal of the Singularity is NOT merely to improve human lives.
<br>

<br>
This is ONE goal.  The advancement of mind in (this part of) the universe to
<br>
a new level is also a valid and valuable goal, quite separately from the
<br>
improvement of human lives.
<br>

<br>
If NO human lives were improved at all by the Singularity, but a tremendous
<br>
new form of intelligence were created, I'd consider the Singularity very
<br>
worthwhile.
<br>

<br>
Another interesting point is that if human lives are improved too much, they
<br>
will cease to be *human* lives.  What is it to be human?  Isn't our
<br>
&quot;humanity&quot; tied up with the various weaknesses of our brain, which cause us
<br>
to experience human unhappiness, human happiness, etc.?  If the &quot;irrational&quot;
<br>
pain and suffering on being dumped by a lover is vanquished by
<br>
neuroengineering, then have we not become less human?  [I don't say that
<br>
becoming less &quot;human&quot; is always bad, by the way.]
<br>

<br>
Finally, it could easily be argued that the job of convincing people the
<br>
Singularity is good will be much easier once tech has advanced another 20
<br>
years.  A direct *demonstration* of the superiority of tech-enhanced ways of
<br>
life will go a lot further than any arguments we can pose.  So there's a
<br>
good argument for keeping the evangelism low-key until we truly have tech to
<br>
back it up.
<br>

<br>
The best argument AGAINST this, so far as I can see, is that a more positive
<br>
general attitude toward the Singularity could lead to
<br>

<br>
a) more R&amp;D funding [though industry seems to be doing OK on its own,
<br>
generally speaking, clearly things could do better -- the world governments
<br>
could start a few Manhattan Projects for AGI, for example, resulting in
<br>
Novamente, SIAI and A2I2 and so forth suddenly getting well-funded]
<br>

<br>
b) fewer Luddites, ergo less chance of Singularity researchers getting
<br>
detonated when S-Day gets nearer...
<br>

<br>
For these reasons, evangelism now may be worthwhile.
