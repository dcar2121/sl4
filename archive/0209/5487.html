ESY&gt; Incidentally, this should be common sense, but it deserves to be
<br>
ESY&gt; said explicitly:
<br>

<br>
ESY&gt; This is a public forum which will be publicly archived.
<br>

<br>
Duly noted.
<br>

<br>
ESY&gt; Do not propose, in this public forum, any security measure which
<br>
ESY&gt; is weakened if the brainwasher anticipates it; discuss it
<br>
ESY&gt; privately using strong cryptography, if at all.
<br>

<br>
I would argue for openness as the best security measure, both morally
<br>
and practically -- through traditional publishing, open source code
<br>
releases, and the like.  This tactic is not weakened by anticipation.
<br>

<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>

<br>
ESY&gt; Bear in mind that sometimes, talking as if you expect people to
<br>
ESY&gt; do immoral things increases the possibility that they will do so.
<br>

<br>
Possibly.  In general, I think governments and companies are granted
<br>
with more credit for benevolence than is their due.  I don't know to
<br>
what extent that is shared by members of this list, but don't see much
<br>
harm in suggesting a dose of skepticism, even cynicism, when
<br>
speculating on the motives of the powerful.
<br>

<br>
ESY&gt; Finally, try not to contribute to creating a *psychology* (which
<br>
ESY&gt; may spread beyond this mailing list) under which AI is a valuable
<br>
ESY&gt; thing that people can steal and use, as opposed to an independent
<br>
ESY&gt; sentient entity capable of making its own decisions.  Don't use
<br>
ESY&gt; the word *steal*.  Use the word *brainwash* or *pervert*.
<br>

<br>
Noted.  I used the catchall &quot;grab&quot; for nanotech and AI but later used
<br>
&quot;subvert&quot; when referring to AI, which has much the same meaning as
<br>
your terms in this context.  I didn't mean to create the impression
<br>
that either of these technologies can easily be &quot;stolen&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Especially in AI's case any such effort may very well be doomed from
<br>
the start (in terms of being able to use the technology for other
<br>
ends).  But that wouldn't necessarily stop an organization from trying
<br>
-- they're not renowned for their smarts, especially as they get
<br>
larger.  The risk that I feel should be mitigated is not so much
<br>
subversion but the loss of scientific/technological progress.  Again,
<br>
I think openness is the best approach here in most cases; for those
<br>
who disagree (or choose not to use this approach for various reasons)
<br>
I would concur: full-on encrypted communications are *highly*
<br>
recommended.
