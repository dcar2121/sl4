</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking -- too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;addicted&quot; to power -- to be able to see beyond it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Substitute &quot;music&quot; for &quot;energy&quot; and you can watch
<br>
a real world example of the battle between scarcity
<br>
and abundance in action.  There is a cheap and easy
<br>
way to create an abundance of music, between CD
<br>
burners and file-sharing applications.  And the 
<br>
music industry is doing everything they can think of
<br>
to stop it.  To use communist rhetoric, music is
<br>
being shared 'from each according to his ability,
<br>
to each according to his needs', and 'the ownership
<br>
of the means of production is in the hands of the
<br>
masses'.
<br>

<br>
Big music companies came to exist in the era when
<br>
the production equipment cost lots of money.  A CD
<br>
factory built here in Huntsville, AL cost quite a
<br>
few millions of dollars to build.  Now that anyone
<br>
can make CDs, the days of big music are numbered.
<br>

<br>
Once upon a time laser printers were $100,000
<br>
machines.  Today almost anyone can afford one.
<br>
Today 3-D printers (the machines that produce
<br>
solid objects layer by layer, either via plastic
<br>
polymerization or laser sintering metals) cost
<br>
many thousands of dollars.  Perhaps in a decade
<br>
they will be standard PC peripherals.
<br>

<br>
Taking a wider view, we may be moving into a post-
<br>
scarcity economy even now.  In 1984 the necessities
<br>
(food, housing, &amp; clothing) took 51.3% of total
<br>
spending.  In 2000, adjusting for the 20% increase
<br>
in home sizes over the interval, the necessities
<br>
took 45.1% of total spending.
<br>

<br>
As manufacturing continues to get more productive, 
<br>
the basic 'stuff' we need to live gets less expensive,
<br>
and we can spend more, if we go to the effort of
<br>
working for it, on optional stuff.
