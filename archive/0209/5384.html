<p><em>&gt; The potential donors are interesting; the potential capitalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not, due to their mundane methods of calculating ROI.  Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of high-tech stuff is sl&lt;4.  In a way the donors are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors in a higher category, seeming offbeat to the squares who can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dance to new school beats, seeming overly speculative to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who can't see what's on the horizon.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; doesn't see how a whole dish (complex organization around a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top-down, rational principle) approach is necessary, i.e.- an a la carte
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (altering strictly local properties, goals tacked on as almost an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterthought) approach won't work.
</em><br>
<p>This is a very naive view of the way in which new technology is built and
<br>
funded. In the real world, new technology is funded by a process of small
<br>
incremental steps; you have to show that you can do something meaningful
<br>
with $100,000, then $500,000, then a few million, etc.
<br>
<p>ROI calculations are not mundane. They are an essential calibration and
<br>
feedback mechanism for people wanting to invest in development that is going
<br>
to work. If you can't produce something meaningful or see how you can
<br>
produce something meaningful with $100,000, then you are unlikely to have
<br>
the skills to be able to produce something meaningful with 100 or 1000 times
<br>
that much money.
<br>
<p>Quite aside from raw capitalism, this is also how government research
<br>
funding works.
<br>
<p>I would go further and assert that any &quot;technology&quot; or &quot;field of study&quot; that
<br>
can't produce meaningful results (be they studies, offshoots, useful
<br>
information, minor products, small incremental gains or whatnot) at lower
<br>
funding levels isn't actually a feasible, real, useful technology or field
<br>
of study.
