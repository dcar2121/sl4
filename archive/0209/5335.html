<em> &gt; Robert P. Hoyt, Ph.D, President, CEO, &amp; Chief Scientist
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Friends,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It is my sad duty to inform you that Dr. Robert L. Forward has left
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this mortal Earth.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Bob passed away early in the morning on September 21, 2002.  A
</em><br>
<em> &gt; memorial service is scheduled for Saturday, September 28th, at 1 p.m.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; at the Westwood Hills Congregational Church in Westwood, CA (Los
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Angeles area).
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Bob Forward leaves behind a truly astounding legacy.  In addition to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; his pioneering work on solar sails, space tethers, antimatter
</em><br>
<em> &gt; propulsion, and other advanced space propulsion technologies, Bob also
</em><br>
<em> &gt; performed seminal work in several other areas, including smart
</em><br>
<em> &gt; structures and gravitational astronomy.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In addition to his technical work, Bob also strove -- through his
</em><br>
<em> &gt; popular science writings, science fiction books, and countless
</em><br>
<em> &gt; lectures -- to educate and inspire the next generations of scientists.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The many letters and emails that people sent to him over the past
</em><br>
<em> &gt; several months are testament to the fact that his work had a strong
</em><br>
<em> &gt; influence on the careers of many of us.  Those letters meant a great
</em><br>
<em> &gt; deal to him.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Bob prepared several obituaries for the various professional
</em><br>
<em> &gt; organizations to which he belonged.  One of them is given below:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Robert Lull Forward
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The intelligent pattern of protoplasm that had been Robert L. Forward
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ceased coherent operation on  September 21, 2002.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Robert Lull Forward died at home of brain cancer at the age of 70.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Forward was born 15 August 1932 in Geneva, New York.  After graduation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; from the University of Maryland in 1954 with a BS degree in Physics
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and a Second Lieutenant commission in the Air Force, he married Martha
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Neil Dodson and served two years stateside during the closing years of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the Korean War.  Upon leaving the service Forward was awarded a Hughes
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Aircraft Company Graduate Research Fellowship, which he used to obtain
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a MS in Applied Physics from UCLA in 1958 and a PhD in Physics from
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the University of Maryland in 1965. Forward was one of the early
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pioneers in the field of experimental gravitational radiation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; astronomy.  For his PhD thesis he built and operated the first bar
</em><br>
<em> &gt; antenna for the detection of gravitational radiation under the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; direction of Profs. Weber and Zipoy.  The antenna is now in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Smithsonian Museum.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Forward worked for 31 years at the Hughes Aircraft Company Corporate
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Research Laboratories in Malibu, CA in positions of increasing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; responsibility until he took early retirement in 1987 to spend more
</em><br>
<em> &gt; time on writing novels and his aerospace consulting company business -
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Forward Unlimited .  During his tenure at Hughes, he received 18
</em><br>
<em> &gt; patents, and published numerous papers on experimental gravity
</em><br>
<em> &gt; instruments and measurements, including the first paper on using the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; normal modes of the Earth to set an upper limit on interstellar
</em><br>
<em> &gt; millicycle gravitational radiation; a paper on the details of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wideband &quot;chirp&quot; signal to be expected from the gravitational collapse
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of a binary neutron star pair; and a method for &quot;flattening&quot; spacetime
</em><br>
<em> &gt; over a hatbox-sized region in an orbiting microgravity space lab to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the picogravity level.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Forward also published the first paper showing that it was possible to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; build and operate a laser interferometer gravitational radiation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; antenna that was photon noise limited over the band from 1-20 kHz, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that further improvements in gravitational strain sensitivity needed
</em><br>
<em> &gt; only more laser power and longer lengths in the interferometer arms.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The broadband gravitational strain sensitivity his laser
</em><br>
<em> &gt; interferometer antenna reached in 1972 was not bettered for over a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; decade.  Forward also invented the multidirectional spherical bar
</em><br>
<em> &gt; antenna for gravitational radiation, and the rotating cruciform
</em><br>
<em> &gt; gravity gradiometer Mass Detector for Lunar Mascon measurements (which
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Misner, Wheeler &amp; Thorne pointed out can detect the curvature of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; spacetime produced by a fist).
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; From the time of his retirement from Hughes in 1987 onward, Forward
</em><br>
<em> &gt; was a consultant for the Air Force and NASA on advanced space
</em><br>
<em> &gt; propulsion concepts, with an emphasis on propulsion methods
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (lightsail, antimatter, electrodynamic tether, etc.), that use
</em><br>
<em> &gt; physical principles other than chemical or nuclear rockets.  In 1992
</em><br>
<em> &gt; he formed the company, Tethers Unlimited, with Dr. Robert P. Hoyt.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; When he reached 70 he &quot;retired&quot; to part time consulting and writing.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In addition to over 200 papers and articles, Forward published 11
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;hard&quot; science fiction novels, where the science is as accurate as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; possible-consistent with telling a good story.  Forward &quot;taught&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; science through his novels.  His first book, DRAGON'S EGG, expanded
</em><br>
<em> &gt; upon Frank Drake's idea of tiny fast-living creatures living on the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; surface of a neutron star.  Forward called it, &quot;A textbook on neutron
</em><br>
<em> &gt; star physics disguised as a novel.&quot;  The book is often assigned as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;extra credit reading&quot; in beginning astronomy courses.  The science in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; his books has often been novel enough that many of his fiction books
</em><br>
<em> &gt; have been referenced in journal publications as &quot;prior art
</em><br>
<em> &gt; publications&quot;.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
