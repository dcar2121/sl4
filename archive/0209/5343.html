<p>
First of all, I must apologize to Samantha if I seemed to imply that the
<br>
kind of cheerleading she (and Eliezer) do is in any way, shape or form
<br>
similar to the emotionally exploitative and effectively negative type of
<br>
&quot;cheerleading&quot; I criticized. I was warning against anyone at all going to
<br>
that extreme, not indicating that anyone on this list would do so. I regret
<br>
any misunderstanding, and assume the fault is my own for not being more
<br>
clear.
<br>
<p>Second, I think that brain mapping, whether by means of the 122-SQUID
<br>
neuromagnetometer mentioned by Samantha or some similar device, would only
<br>
achieve maximal value if it is portable and convenient enough to be
<br>
worn/used during normal everyday activities. It's only in those
<br>
situations--not lying inside a massive ring of superconducting magnets or
<br>
lugging a liquid helium cooled device--that we normally experience the
<br>
mental/emotional events that cause us to think and act irrationally. We need
<br>
the feedback in real-time and in real-life. Furthermore, as Dr. Persinger
<br>
has discovered, we may be neurologically affected by low-level magnetic
<br>
fields in our environment which can influence our mental states in important
<br>
ways. We need to roam in order to see how and where this happens.
<br>
<p>Finally, the reason why I believe that ubiquitous computing and
<br>
high-bandwidth wireless will be important for successful Earthweb/collective
<br>
filtering is that participants must be able to access the online action
<br>
anywhere, anytime. This should virtually eliminate problems of latency. It
<br>
should also establish a level playing field for timely input, thus avoiding
<br>
the time-bias that would occur if some participants were able to sit at
<br>
their computers all day, while others were forced by work and other
<br>
requirements to be offline for many hours per day. Of course, current
<br>
limited access does not prevent Earthweb/collective filtering from
<br>
occurring, it merely slows and skews the results in favor of input from
<br>
certain players. As we accelerate toward the Singularity, such a bias would
<br>
become more and more apparent.

<em>&gt; &gt; I would like to see this attempted. It may, however, require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far smaller,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; portable equipment in order to capture the brain events in the midst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real-life activities. Using functional magnetic resonance

<em>&gt; imaging in this

<em>&gt; &gt; way could be similar to the use of biofeedback machines by

<em>&gt; meditators. Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the work of Dr. Michael Persinger at Laurentian University in applying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; external magnetic field to induce brain changes may give some hints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Persinger is especially interested in how transient electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spikes in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; temporal lobe are correlated with subjective reports of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blissful, unitary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mystical states. Stimulating different areas can result in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hellish, paranoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe if you look up SQUIDs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://boojum.hut.fi/triennial/squid.html">http://boojum.hut.fi/triennial/squid.html</a>)  and can predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective room temperature superconductors and continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miniturization of electronics that you end up with a quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective way to watch the brain at work.  I do not agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however that you will find most of the itneresting large scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns, for good or ill, simply by mapping the brain at such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level, much less effective  means of accentuating the positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns and mitigating the negative ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;2:  Collaborative filtering and/or the Earthweb; a means

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the Net has already shown us that this is a real possibility. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; order to work effectively though, we probably need ubiquitous computing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; high-bandwidth wireless, and sufficient security/authentication so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people feel comfortable with a high degree of intimate real-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can, I believe, work quite effectively long before most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is in place.  I do agree that security of a kind that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *not* seen as synonymous with zero privacy would be a very good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing fo this and other purposes. I don't know that more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ubiquitous computing that a web-app would be absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential at this point and while high-bandwidth wireless is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my shopping list for many reasons I don't think it is essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an EarthWeb scenario - high bandwidth yes, wireless not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Or computer-mediated telepathy between 64-node clustered humans whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;prefrontal cortices have learned to talk to one another over meganeuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;broadband connections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is a development I'd like to see, but one which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably freak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out a lot of the population, even if they had no interaction with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clustered humans. We need to watch our backs for approaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peasants with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pitchforks when we begin walking down this road. Scare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headline: &quot;When SL0's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Attack!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they like that then they will just love what happens when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have early neural i/o with wearable computers and ubiquitous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-speed wireless.  Persons so equipped have access to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global computer grid and to one another to a degree that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verge on telepathy  I see no reason it would be limited to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized 64-node clusters with surgical enhancements.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would simply be better at it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Some form of transhumanity which can be achieved as rapidly as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;using our existing technological base; that's a big enough hammer.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;don't believe there's much else that *really would* work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however nice it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;sounded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is a crucial part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;reaching enough people, but having a workable strategy comes first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Otherwise the cheering doesn't *accomplish* anything.  Humans like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;cheering and will cheer whether or not anything gets done as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;am deeply suspicious of cheering, and I speak as a cheerleader.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree that cheering is both necessary and insufficient. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, wrongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used it can be downright counterproductive. Homo sapiens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large groups can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be swept up in mass cheering to the point that they abandon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with surges of emotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I am talking about hasn't a darn thing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cheering&quot; of this kind and it certainly doesn't have anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with Nazi mass-hysteria (below).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is a reason why the Nazis favored mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rallies held at night with torches, marching bands, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional speeches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; designed to pluck the heartstrings of nationalism, tribalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Subtract the racism and similar ideas, replace them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvation through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faith, change the musical genre, and you're got a Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revival meeting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While some revival meetings and equivalent mass therapy programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on use explicitly or implicitly certain techniques of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass mental programming, this also has not a damn thing to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with what I was speaking of.
