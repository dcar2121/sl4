----- Original Message -----

<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But with any kind of system like this there is a potential for abuse by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people who take out multiple accounts, either to artificially inflate
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value of their opinions or to get around flagging limitations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One way to manage this is to weight any points given to a post by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's reputation based on previous posts.  This encourages not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution, but contribution that has good value.  People who post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that garner lots of points will in turn be able to have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact on the scoring of the posts of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sets a barrier of entry on a new account such that a person won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to significantly moderate other people's posts until they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made some worthwhile contributions of their own.  Among other things, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimizes the value of having multiple accounts so that you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astroturf your stats.
</em><br>
<p>I think this would work well for more the most intellectual and
<br>
scientific-style forums.  I'm not so sure it would be appropriate for more
<br>
rough-and-tumble forums of popular/political discourse, where it would be
<br>
best to simply make it very difficult for one person to hold more than one
<br>
account.  The main reason I say this is that the nature of a forum changes
<br>
as it ages; a newcomer to a very mature forum may have trouble finding new
<br>
things to add, but this doesn't mean that they don't understand the issues
<br>
well enough to render meaningful judgment of a post.
<br>
<p>And in any case where different users have more points to dole out than
<br>
other users, it would be best to limit the disproportionate impact.  For
<br>
example, it might be wholly appropriate for a newbie with only one slightly
<br>
scored post to have only a 10th the voting power of a veteran poster.  But
<br>
it would not be appropriate for a veteran poster to be trumped by a godlike
<br>
veteran who happens to have 10 times more weight than the &quot;average&quot; veteran.
<br>
In other words, the weight would have to max out pretty early on, perhaps
<br>
requiring that the user to meet some sort of maintenance level of regular
<br>
participation to hold this status.
<br>
<p>But weighted systems are subject to their own breed of manipulation. E-Bay
<br>
cartels are the most notorious example I can think of -- playing off the
<br>
all-important &quot;feedback&quot; feature.
