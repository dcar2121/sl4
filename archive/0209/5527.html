This story by Mike Deering should help explain why trying to get the 
<br>
populace comfortable with the Singularity now is not necessary.  The 
<br>
Transition Guide will take care of it if there's anything of which needs 
<br>
taking care.

There is no Singularity Command and Control.  We may joke from time to 
<br>
time about there being a Conspiracy, but there isn't actually one.  Each 
<br>
of us is open about what it is safe to be open about.  I don't go around 
<br>
telling everyone that &lt;mumble mumble mumble&gt; because it might add to our 
<br>
opponents.  In the same way, I don't solicit funds for SIAI from people 
<br>
who would likely oppose the Singularity and GAI without knowing about 
<br>
&lt;mumble mumble mumble&gt;.  Of course, I expect it will go like with 
<br>
cloning:  no one will care until we have a human level AI.
