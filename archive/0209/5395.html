Hmmm.  Are you starting with assumptions that:
<br>

<br>
a) only matter matters;
<br>

<br>
b) your own post-Singularity civ should have say over all matter that you can
<br>
possibly influence?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Matter can be organized into boring uncomplex things like stars.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is rather pointless so you want to transform this matter into state (1).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, all else being equal, why not?  Also, Fred is running out of room
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for his MP3 collection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Well, stars are &quot;pretty&quot;, are interesting energy sources, might have planets 
<br>
which might have life now or later and so on.   Hardly necessarily viewed as 
<br>
pointless. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Matter can be organized into evolving but nonsentient replicators.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This still isn't exactly a lot of complexity by comparison with (1) and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguably (hey, I think so) pretty much morally the same as (2).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
What does &quot;morality&quot; have to do with it?  Are you implying a moral duty to 
<br>
organize all matter as complexly as possible?   At what level do you consider 
<br>
some replicators to be sentient?  If they are capable of evolving to 
<br>
sentience does their moral status change as far as what you, the powerful 
<br>
SAI, might do or not do with that bunch of matter?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Matter can be organized into evolved, intelligent, but pre-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities.  In this case their quality of life is pretty hideous by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison with (1) so you want to show up and rescue them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Why would you consider it moral to &quot;rescue&quot; other life to your presumed much 
<br>
preferable state?  Are you sure you can do that without effectively 
<br>
destroying that life and simply rearranging the matter into entities more to 
<br>
your liking?   Rescue could spell doom if not deeply considered and very 
<br>
carefully and patiently, if at all, implemented.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 5)  Matter can be organized into a different enlightened post-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization than your own.  In this case you want to show up and say hi -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange information to increase the total nonduplicated complexity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Cool.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 6)  Matter can be organized into shapes that are dangerous and unpleasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the result of Singularities gone wrong.  You want to know where these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infestations are, maybe even do something about them, and you certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to show up *before* that point if at all possible.  In fact, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone provides an adequate rationale for cataloguing all the matter in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe and making sure none of it is developing into hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence.  (Alternatively, you might want to run away into your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own little hidey-hole universe, in which case you are not visibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering galaxies or whatever, which is how this conversation got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
What determines what &quot;gone wrong&quot; is and is not?  What is and is not 
<br>
&quot;hostile&quot; or potentially so?  How do you avoid the &quot;drop a big chunk of rock 
<br>
on any developing life remotely threatening&quot; scenario?  
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I realize we don't know what choices smarter-than-human intelligences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make, but the choice to sit and contemplate your own navel seems a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot more anthropomorphic than the alternative.  Even if you don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce, or you don't want to reproduce too often, you'll still want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow your mind over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
What do you mean by &quot;contemplate your own navel&quot; here?  There are a tremendous
<br>
number of things that can be fruitfully explored without feeling a pressing 
<br>
need to catalog all matter for possible threats.  I would consider making the 
<br>
latter a most pressing task to be more likely pathological than the 
<br>
alternative. 
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Now, is there any good reason why an enlightened, moral post-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization would *not* be out to absorb, say hi to, or rescue all matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the universe?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Yes, assuming morality includes a respect for or appreciation of different 
<br>
than itself living and non-living, sentient and non-sentient existence.  At 
<br>
the least I believe a moral super-intelligence would understand or find out 
<br>
very quickly that &quot;rescue&quot; is often not a very good idea.  It would probably 
<br>
find out pretty soon that wiping out or co-opting potential hostiles too 
<br>
easily puts it on the &quot;possibly hostile&quot; list of some other entity.   It also 
<br>
potentially wipes out possibly future very productive and beneficial 
<br>
different sentiences.
