<br>
<em>&gt; Rationality is employed in nonaccidently successful processes.  Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their nonaccidental nature, there must be something guiding them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right direction.  If you examine enough examples I think you'll find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the BPT exists as that guiding force.
</em><br>

<br>
I guess I don't understand what you mean by a &quot;force&quot; ...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any subset of the universe that changes over time may be said to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; carrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out a &quot;process&quot;.  If the moon crashes into the sun, is this to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational?  It's a process which comes to completion....  So by your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition, it seems that yes, this is rational.  But this doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accord
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with my understanding of rationality at all...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look at the definition of work I just gave you.  If you still think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this could be rational, why?
</em><br>

<br>
No, when you include your eccentric definition of &quot;work&quot;, then your
<br>
definition of rationality comes very close to my definition of intelligence
<br>
as the &quot;ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments.&quot;  What
<br>
you're calling rationality, I just call intelligence, basically.  The
<br>
difference is that intelligence is measured (according to my definition) in
<br>
terms of the complexity of the goals achieved, whereas a system with very
<br>
simple goals that achieves them effectively may be called just as rational
<br>
as a system with very complex goals that achieves them effectively.
<br>

<br>
Putting our two perspectives together we find: Rationality is about
<br>
effective goal-achievement, intelligence is about effective
<br>
complex-goal-achievement.
<br>

<br>
To me, &quot;truth-finding&quot; emerges as a side-effect of goal-achievement.  No
<br>
finite organism has objective truth, but it has subjective truths that help
<br>
it achieve its goals.  And from a perspective encompassing an organism plus
<br>
its environment, one can assess agreement btw subjective and
<br>
objective/environmental truth.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, as it happens, I *am* interested in many things besides SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology....  For example, pygmies, Russian literature, peculiar piano
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chords, and cactus flesh and pot-bellied pigs.  [And -- well, no I won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even get into that, there may be minors on this list... ;-&gt;]  So what???
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you spend time getting excited about the potential of flying cars and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaceships to mars?  Or do you find those things boring because you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively trying to create things that are much more exciting.
</em><br>

<br>
Well I spent a lot of time this last weekend getting excited about the
<br>
interactions between 12-bar blues chord progressions and Middle Eastern
<br>
scales.  Not boring to me at all, even though not as important in any sense
<br>
as the Singularity or my AI work....  And I can get VERY excited about the
<br>
idea of an intelligent musical computer program that one could jam with...
<br>
even though it's not as important or exciting as the Singularity...
<br>

<br>
So what?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want the Singularity to happen you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; should be doing what you can to work towards it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I personally AM, but I don't believe this is the optimal path for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a person wants to see the Singularity happen and is capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing to it's creation, under what conditions would working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards the Singularity not be an optimal path?
</em><br>

<br>
If that person was capable of contributing *much more strongly* to other
<br>
valuable things like helping humans concretely in the present world.
<br>
