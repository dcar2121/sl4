Would you lay down and die if Friendly AI was somehow shown to 
<br>
be impossible in say, the next 40 years?  It has been well

argued that Singularity is the *best* option.  But that doesn't

mean it is the *only* option.

<p><em>&gt; The kind of changes that you want to see are only

</em><br>
<p>Sufficient partial acheivement is all that is required in order 
<br>
to keep us from destroying one another and keep us moving toward 
<br>
a better world.  I don't call what is needed making the populace 
<br>
more [capital-R] Rational though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you'll figure out how to succeed where Jesus and Siddhartha and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ghandi failed.  More likely you won't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>They did not in any sense *fail*.  They were spiritual lights 
<br>
that inspired many millions and do so to this day.  Arguably in 
<br>
both cases the &quot;Pharisees&quot; took over and started supposed 
<br>
religions based on their teachings that often are 
<br>
counter-productive.  Most who say they are followers quite 
<br>
honestly really don't &quot;get it&quot;. But much good grew out of their 
<br>
teachings also. They succeeded in beginning the process, in 
<br>
lighting the way within their own context. Ghandi was successful 
<br>
in even the material realm in that he led a non-violent movement 
<br>
that freed the Indian people simply by always standing for the 
<br>
truth and for the best understanding and motivations in those 
<br>
who were against independence. By example and words he inspired 
<br>
hundreds of thousands to do the same. It is up to some of us to 
<br>
continue positive changes in human consciousness and 
<br>
institutions within the context of our own abilities, time and 
<br>
situations. In any case, I hardly have any choice but to try.  I 
<br>
don't expect to be a Ghandi.  But then again, neither did he.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is not to discourage you.  If you're successful enough before the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity maybe you can save enough people that you did better than if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you contributed more to creating the Singularity.  You have a better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea than I do of what you are capable of and what you can contribute 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where.  I just hope that you will make the best choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.  May your choice be the best for you also.
