</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.  Maybe someone has done this already.
</em><br>
<p>A couple of perhaps useful articles (or at least ones I like):
<br>
<p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/icad.html">http://paulgraham.com/icad.html</a>  (general comments on 
<br>
differences in language)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.flownet.com/gat/papers/lisp-java.pdf">http://www.flownet.com/gat/papers/lisp-java.pdf</a>  (Lisp as 
<br>
alternative to Java referencing empirical comparisons)
<br>
<p>There are quite a few language comparisons out there that are 
<br>
findable with google.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My own view is that the more complex software projects being undertaken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, would hardly have been possible using the software tools of 15-20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago.  Certainly, prior to scalable, distributed-processing friendly OO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software technology, something like Novamente could not have been attempted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a small team.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How odd.  I was designing and implementing complex projects over 
<br>
a decade ago although not as complex as those some of my peers 
<br>
were involved in.  And yes, these were successful projects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the Net has made the development of complex software much faster,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there are so many sourcecode snippets and open-source projects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messageboards out there to look at.  Before the Net, it was a hell of a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harder to find useful &quot;lore&quot; about how to solve various difficult software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.
</em><br>
<p>This is mostly true although the underpinnings were there for at 
<br>
least the last two decades.  The usenet groups for various 
<br>
languages and environments had wide use for finding expertise 
<br>
and snippets of code.  The GNU project started in the mid 80s. 
<br>
Many university labs were sources for code.  But the full 
<br>
revolution was greatly aided by the WWW.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't enjoy using Visual Basic or Visual C++, but these tools have clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made it much easier for *average people* to produce software that *average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people* can use.  This is not the kind of progress that excites scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is an important kind of progress, and it's been accelerating fast.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Average people should not be writing software at that low a 
<br>
level imho.  They should use tools build by very non-average 
<br>
tool builders to express what they wish the computers to do. 
<br>
These non-average people should never ever be restricted to 
<br>
*average* languages.
<br>
<p>I would give a lot to have back all the fruitful years eaten by 
<br>
such *average* *popular* languages as C++, Fortran, and Java.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Creating a distributed application, as Ben H points out, is WAY easier now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than in the 80's or early 90's.  There's no comparison.  Java and .net make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it easiest, but even in vanilla C++ there are so many handy libraries for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such things out there... this sort of thing didn't exist back in the day....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is easier to create a working distributed application within 
<br>
some quite restricted parameters.  But it will not be 
<br>
particularly efficient and certainly not very flexible.  C++ 
<br>
libraries not very clean or standardized (STL to one side) or 
<br>
easily browseable.  All of this and more was part of languages 
<br>
like Smalltalk and many Lisp environments.  Which I am sure you 
<br>
know.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Software technology has not progressed in quite the way I would have liked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to.  I'd like to see specialized chips for graph rewriting to enable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient  Etc. Etc. However, there is no question in my mind that software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology has progressed very rapidly in directions that society has found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not really.  The moaning about the tremendous software backlog, 
<br>
the high cost of software production, the low level of 
<br>
dependability, the general expectation of major cost overruns, 
<br>
the inflexibility of results and so on started over 2 decades 
<br>
ago and has in no way abated to this day.  If anything it has 
<br>
increased in volume.  Even *average* users do not want bloatware 
<br>
that forces them to more and more expensive dumb boxen to do the 
<br>
few things they really want to do with a computer or became 
<br>
convinced computers would make easier.  Ask your *average* 
<br>
business or home computer user how satisfied they are with the 
<br>
systems of today.  Ask the sys admin.  Ask the people writing 
<br>
the code.  Especially ask the support people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Saying software tech hasn't progressed because it hasn't progressed in *your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directions of choice* is like saying hardware tech hasn't progressed because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it hasn't moved substantially toward massively parallel computing...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not at all and I am surprised at such an empty dismissal from you.
