<em>&gt; It is not just an intuition of course.  Psychedelics are one way of

<em>&gt; artificially small if we assumed that altered states are all pathological

or
<br>

&quot;altered&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; than being uploaded. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is part of the &quot;understanding the issues&quot; I spoke of earlier.
<br>
Anyone who has experienced what is colloquially referred to
<br>
as &quot;ego-death&quot; under any of the less pleasant entheogens
<br>
understands the truly frightening implications of the classic
<br>
extropian catchphrase &quot;an uploaded human mind able to
<br>
self-modify it's own cognition and ascend into a posthuman
<br>
entity&quot;. Note I am not talking about runaway goo or psychopathic
<br>
posthuman entities or anything.. simply what internal mental
<br>
change of this order (even if successful) would be like *from
<br>
the inside*.  Take a quick trip to the mental wards, choose the
<br>
long-term care facilities at a state hospital (where all the *throwaways*
<br>
get sent) and read something by Sacks. Altered states of consciousness
<br>
are *boring*?  Try terrifying. Possibly neccessary, often profitable but
<br>
among the most scary experiences one can undergo in one's life.
<br>
And these are the &quot;temporary changes&quot;....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The value of extensive clinical exposure becoming evident yet?)
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; The current self-image/personality/ego structure is indeed quite likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissolve when much of its ground of being changes significantly.   Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditions, such as Buddhism, have long held that what we normally see as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; is an illusion   Meditators and others who have done much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-examination often have a good understanding for how much the self is
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; construct, not the true self or center of consciousness (the observer) and
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is very true.. but is not of especially great help when one is storming
<br>
the Bardo :)
<br>
<em>&gt; When *you* are not an advanced primate biological lifeform any longer then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much that is derived from that previous state will be superflous.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity largely is no more then all kinds of beliefs, assumptions, habits
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; mind will need serious overhaul.  When we perhaps can choose to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boundaries between our minds more porous selectively even the notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves as individual might come under modification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we have the powers and abilities that we believe will be possible in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future states then we also have great need to adjust and modify our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional/reactive natures, to re-integrate on a quite different basis
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; normal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For all of these reasons and many more I believe that work on
</em><br>
consciousness,
<br>
<em>&gt; on understanding and also on shifting and modifying states of
</em><br>
consciousness,
<br>
<em>&gt; is quite crucial to Singularity.
</em><br>

<br>
I suspect that understanding the mechanisms whereby a biological frame
<br>
produces sentience is only the first step in getting a *useful*
<br>
machine intelligence.
<br>
I have raised this point before, with Annissimov and others.
<br>
&quot;How do you get something that can or will talk to you?&quot;
<br>
Apparently people have a real problem with discerning the difference
<br>
between a critique of Friendliness and a healthy appreciation of
<br>
the differences between *purely human states of mental function
<br>
within the SAME BRAIN* (normal vs. tripping), to say nothing
<br>
of what an AI's &quot;thought processesses&quot; would be like.
<br>
I don't critique Friendliness, it sounds like a grand idea (you
<br>
want to give the AI something like a rationally derived
<br>
Buddha-nature, this sounds like a good thing for a functionally
<br>
omnipotent entity to have....). I do think the communication
<br>
issues are non-trivial (and boy are they EVER non-trivial).
<br>
(The worst part is  people tell  me I am &quot;anthropomorphizing
<br>
AI&quot;.. feyh!)
<br>
This is a wildly anthropomorphic example but it should serve
<br>
to illustrate the point.  (Just as a thought experiment)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upload a lungfish. Give it an IQ of 130 or so. From the point
<br>
you turn the computer on make sure the lungfish is experiencing
<br>
something rather analogous to the effects of 600 micrograms
<br>
of LSD in a healthy 90 kg adult human. The rise-plateau-fall
<br>
pattern of intensity interaction is, rather than linear, wildly chaotic,
<br>
or perhaps rythmic in some virutally undetectable pattern (for
<br>
the lungfish anyway). Give the lungfish the ability to moderate the
<br>
dissolving effects of the drug, with one difference.. the lungfish
<br>
doesn't know which way is *down* (i.e. even if it knew
<br>
what normal was like it can't apply that knowledge to the
<br>
present state). Give this lungfish access to a file in which you
<br>
have placed an electronic version of the human Universal
<br>
Grammer. Talk to the lungfish.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was what you just did to the lungfish a nice thing to do?
<br>
Would you do it to a child? A pet? a seed AI?
<br>
Hmmm......
<br>

<br>

<br>
Samantha I'm glad you chimed in, you and Ben seem
<br>
to at least have exposure to the issues, both in terms
<br>
of the substances and the non-drug induced mental
<br>
tinkering of the meditative traditions.  But most
<br>
people don't, and they simply don't know that they don't
<br>
know.  Which is why talking about this issue on SL4 is almost,
<br>
but not quite, completely useless.
<br>

<br>
regards,
<br>
Brian
