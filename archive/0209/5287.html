<em>&gt; Subject: Worldcon report
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I was able to make it to Worldcon last Sunday, and I'm glad I went.
</em><br>
<p>Regarding Vinge, Jason Joachim wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, I failed to get picked from the audience to ask a question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wanted to challenge him on his sorely under developed idea of finding
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'd be curious to hear Vinge's ideas on this also.
<br>
<p>However, I think the basic concept of &quot;safety thru a slow takeoff&quot; is very
<br>
simple.
<br>
<p>It is:
<br>
<p>1) The feeling that, right now, we don't know enough about AGI and other
<br>
Singularity-enabling technologies to meaningfully figure out how to make a
<br>
safe Singularity.
<br>
<p>2) The hope that, if these technologies mature relatively slowly, we will
<br>
have time to understand them better BEFORE they &quot;take power&quot;, and hence will
<br>
be able to figure out LATER what we're not able to figure out NOW (how to
<br>
have a safe Singularity)
<br>
<p>Underlying this is the assumption that
<br>
<p>3) There are good ways to mitigate the pre-Singularity risk of
<br>
not-quite-Singularity-ready advanced technologies being used to destroy
<br>
humanity
<br>
<p>To me, 3) is a major worry.  If not for this worry, I would be more inclined
<br>
to accept 1) and 2).
<br>
<p><p>Regarding Vinge using Eliezer to get a laugh, that's too bad.  I wonder if
<br>
Vinge has studied Eliezer's writing in any detail.
<br>
<p>I think that what Vinge is *probably* reacting to in Eliezer's work, is the
<br>
impression that Eliezer does not agree with Vinge on point 1) above.
<br>
<p>At a recent conference I attended (at IBM, on 'autonomic computing'), a
<br>
speaker on AI got up and his first words, intended to placate the audience,
<br>
were about how modern AI really isn't about trying to create HAL or any
<br>
other kind of general intelligence, it's focused on building probabilistic
<br>
inference based machine learning and knowledge management systems to be used
<br>
in narrow domains.  He said &quot;You know, general human-level AI is fun to talk
<br>
about at cocktail parties, but it's not what we AI researchers think about
<br>
when we get up in the morning.&quot;  Everyone laughed.  Yuk yuk yuk.
<br>
<p>I guess Vinge is not as conservative as that guy, but it's a *little*
<br>
disappointing that the original Singularity-guru himself seems to be shying
<br>
away from deeply thinking about the more radical possible near-term futures
<br>
related to his own ideas...
