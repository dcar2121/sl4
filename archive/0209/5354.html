<p>I wouldn't lay down and die.  Rather, I'd try to find another solution, 
<br>
hopefully one that is just as safe or safer.  Alas, I can't think of 
<br>
anything that I think would actually work besides the Singularity that 
<br>
will solve the problem of humans blowing themselves up; all other 
<br>
solutions that I know of merely delay the destruction of humanity a 
<br>
little while longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The kind of changes that you want to see are only partially achievable 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; battle; you have to get people to actually fix their minds on their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; own.  Even then there is only so much fixing that can be done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sufficient partial acheivement is all that is required in order to keep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us from destroying one another and keep us moving toward a better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  I don't call what is needed making the populace more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [capital-R] Rational though.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  If you win only partial achievement, one crazy out in the 
<br>
desert can still do a lot of damage.  You may keep humans from dying 
<br>
this year, but next year when the crazies release Super Smallpox and 95% 
<br>
of the population dies, that looks like failure to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Maybe you'll figure out how to succeed where Jesus and Siddhartha and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Ghandi failed.  More likely you won't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They did not in any sense *fail*.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying that the sum of their efforts failed.  I'm saying that 
<br>
their efforts to fundamentally reshape society to end death and 
<br>
destruction failed.  Sure they helped inspire a few more people to be 
<br>
nice, but it only takes one not nice person to blow up the planet.
