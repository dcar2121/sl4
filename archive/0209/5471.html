<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sysopmind.com?Subject=RE:%20continuity%20of%20self%20%20[%20was%20META:%20Sept.%2011%20and%20Singularity]">owner-sl4@sysopmind.com</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sysopmind.com?Subject=RE:%20continuity%20of%20self%20%20[%20was%20META:%20Sept.%2011%20and%20Singularity]">owner-sl4@sysopmind.com</a>]On Behalf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of Ben Goertzel
</em><br>
. . . .
<br>
<em>&gt; While I don't feel at all certain that creating a human-friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI will solve everything, I still feel this is the path most likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeed.  This is because I am a bit cynical about human neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard-wiring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We may see a tendency toward more advanced consciousness, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we will see a tendency toward more advanced and more easily deployed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massively destructive weapons technology (bio weapons and others).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately I'm afraid the weapons progress may outpace the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress, and so I'm hoping in my gut (and working to ensure that) the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress will outpace either...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben G
</em><br>

<br>
Much though I would prefer to agree with Samantha here about the potential
<br>
for spiritually-based transformation of consciousness on a mass scale, I am
<br>
compelled by my knowledge of history and by my personal experience in this
<br>
realm to conclude that any such transformation will be small-scale and
<br>
individual. Like Ben, I think our human shortcomings--what Stewart Brand
<br>
calls our &quot;human cussedness&quot;--as being hard-wired artifacts of our
<br>
evolutionary origins. We need transhuman transformation to overcome these on
<br>
a mass scale. (One or two Gandhis we can get now, but that's not enough.)
<br>
And, in my opinion, that needed transhuman transformation will not transpire
<br>
without some essential tools, the most important of which is Friendly AI.
<br>

<br>
There are no guarantees that we will succeed in this endeavor. But what
<br>
choice do what have except to try? The alternative is either to go on as
<br>
things are now until humanity kills itself (or dies off), or else to
<br>
transcend into transhumanity via a positive Singularity.
