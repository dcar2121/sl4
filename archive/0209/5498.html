<em>&gt;Hi guys,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm new to the SL4 list, so please, be gentle ;)
</em><br>

<br>
Welcome Chris.  I'll try.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;I've been lurking for a few days, and feel I have something to contribute 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the thread...
</em><br>

<br>
You might want to lurk a bit longer.

<br>
<em>&gt;&lt;clip political rant&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
We try to keep political rants off of this list.  They tend to not be very 
<br>
productive.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Currently, this is about as far as I have gone with the concept, as I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now focusing all my efforts into establishing the software company. My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point is, that there are things we can do today that will 'prepare' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humanity for the singularity, we just need to be creative, and if necessary
</em><br>

<br>
Anyone who thinks humanity can be prepared for the singularity doesn't 
<br>
understand what singularity means.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;play the game on the level that the greedy, selfish individuals who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currently hold power (by appealing to the masses own sense of greed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create conformity). I believe that &quot;scarcity based&quot; / &quot;zero sum&quot; / 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;selfish&quot; thinking is 90% nurture and 10% nature, here's why:
</em><br>

<br>
I suggest you read the Evolutionary Psychology primer 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html">http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html</a>).  Nature vs. nurture 
<br>
is sillyness.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, the question we should be asking is how long can we continue on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our current trajectory, and does that leave us with enough time to reach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the singularity.
</em><br>

<br>
There are bigger issues than nuclear exchange to worry about, but I don't 
<br>
want to get into them here.  We probably don't have time for a 100 year 
<br>
take off though.  We may not even have 15 years to wait.  (Nobody knows of 
<br>
course.)  It would seem that the only solution is to try to accelerate a 
<br>
friendly singularity (friendly intentionally not capitalized to denote a 
<br>
more general case).
