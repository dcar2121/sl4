Well, to each his own, I guess ;)
<br>

<em>&gt; Perhaps after a trip or getting high, you will notice that the

<br>
I'm not quite sure what you're getting at here...
<br>

<br>
I didn't believe in an absolutely real external reality BEFORE first taking
<br>
psychedelics at age 16, and I didn't believe in it afterwards...
<br>

<br>
Both before &amp; after my psychedelic experiences, I believed in the
<br>
scientific, rationalist perspective as one among a number of valuable &amp;
<br>
interesting perspectives that a mind can take on the world
<br>

<br>
The reasons for altered states of consciousness being interesting, vary
<br>
based on the particular altered states in question.  But they don't often
<br>
have to with any kind of rationalist &quot;matching up to empirical reality.&quot;
<br>
Experiential truth is not the same as empirical or mathematical truth; all
<br>
these kinds of truth have their own validity and interest, in my view.
