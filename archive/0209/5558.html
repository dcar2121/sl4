<br>
Hm.  I have to say this sounds a bit confused even to me.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Work&quot; or &quot;Nonaccidental success&quot;:  Nonaccidental truthfinding within an 
<br>
intelligence, defined as the nonaccidental correlation of an internal 
<br>
pattern with an aspect of reality; and nonaccidental achievement within 
<br>
any physical process, defined as nonaccidental development to a goal state 
<br>
that exhibits some degree of empirical regularity across multiple 
<br>
*classes* of physical systems.  That is, the evolutionary &quot;goal&quot; of 
<br>
successful reproduction appears with some empirical regularity across 
<br>
widely different complex systems, and motivates much of the substance of 
<br>
that complexity, which is not something you can say about stellar dynamics.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Intelligence&quot;:  A class of physical systems which generates nonaccidental 
<br>
achievements using an internal model of aspects of reality.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Rational physical process&quot;:  A physical process which can be viewed as an 
<br>
imperfect approximation of the Bayesian Probability Theorem; in that, with 
<br>
some degree of empirical regularity, the physical process encounters (some 
<br>
classes of) variables, and undergoes a perseverant change depending on the 
<br>
encountered value of that variable, in such a way that it sometimes 
<br>
enables future achievements (as defined above) because of empirical 
<br>
regularities within the value of that variable or empirical regularities 
<br>
connecting that variable to other variables.  Since the Bayesian 
<br>
Probability Theorem describes a normative way for an intelligence to 
<br>
adjust the expected value of future variables using a previously 
<br>
encountered variable as evidence, rational physical processes such as 
<br>
evolution can be viewed as working because they reflect, however 
<br>
imperfectly and partially, the Bayesian Probability Theorem.  In 
<br>
particular, the strategies employed by these physical processes are 
<br>
fundamentally within the purview of rationality, in that a purely rational 
<br>
Bayesian reasoner can understand how they work and could choose to employ 
<br>
them if the computational and physical capacity to do so existed - there 
<br>
is no mystical higher force at work.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Evolution&quot;:  An accidental, imperfect approximation of the Bayesian 
<br>
Probability Theorem, which, insofar as it produces nonaccidental 
<br>
successes, can be viewed as producing them because of a physical process 
<br>
which reflects the Bayesian Probability Theorem; changes to the genetic 
<br>
distribution of a future population are based on the environmental 
<br>
successes of organisms in the past population, but environmental success 
<br>
correlates to some degree with differential DNA strings, and differential 
<br>
DNA strings achieve differential successes with some degree of empirical 
<br>
regularity.  This physical process can be viewed as a specialized, 
<br>
imperfect version of the Bayesian Probability Theorem which reasons about 
<br>
the likely success of future organisms using the likely success of past 
<br>
organisms - not really a *flawed* version of the BPT, however; rather a 
<br>
physical process which, insofar as it works, works because it imperfectly 
<br>
mirrors the BPT.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Humans&quot;:  Nonaccidentally evolved imperfect approximations of the 
<br>
Bayesian Probability Theorem; intelligent systems which, insofar as they 
<br>
work, work because the physical process of those intelligent systems 
<br>
imperfectly mirrors the BPT with respect to some task or subtask.  Gordon 
<br>
is, as far as I know, correct in stating that all known nonaccidental 
<br>
successes have evolution somewhere in their causal chain; evolution, 
<br>
humans, and human technology.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Rationality&quot;:  I think this ends up referring to the degree which human 
<br>
reasoning, especially high-level deliberation about declarative beliefs, 
<br>
mirrors the BPT consistently and correctly, rather than mirroring it in 
<br>
occasional flashes which get small amounts of work done.  Also the degree 
<br>
to which truthfinding in particular functions consistently and correctly, 
<br>
perhaps in despite of other evolutionary adaptations which produce 
<br>
nonaccidental achievement in reproduction at the expense of nonaccidental 
<br>
truthfinding.  Rationality as a discipline exists because of those 
<br>
empirical regularities in the degree of human rationality which depend on 
<br>
variables subject to human volition (such as philosophical beliefs).
