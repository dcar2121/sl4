<em>&gt; &gt;     I mean I think Ben's full of crap saying implicitly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; singularity isn't helping humans concretely in the present world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  CFAI is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; herculean task like the Augean Stables: Ben would have some of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; throw dung out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the stable with old reliable spoons, while the bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinker sees the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solution (diverting most of a river with a giant hollow log or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such so that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; passes through the stables, according to the story).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To pursue your metaphor a little further... (and then explain why I think
<br>
it's a bad one ;)
<br>
<p>You assume the hollow log strategem is going to work.  But suppose the
<br>
hollow log theory fails, because, for instance, the water in that particular
<br>
river turns out to be acidic and dissolves the log....
<br>
<p>It makes sense to put 100% of resources on the hollow log strategem only if
<br>
<p>1) there is a 100% estimated chance of the stratagem working
<br>
<p>2) without 100% of resources on the hollow log strategem, the odds of the
<br>
hollow log stratagem working drastically decrease; and there are no other
<br>
plausible strategies on the horizon
<br>
<p>[These are just rough guidelines, of course one can make a thorough
<br>
probabilistic analysis of the optimum amount of resources it makes sense to
<br>
devote to the hollow log strategem, based on various assumptions.]
<br>
<p>Otherwise, it may  make sense to have some people focus on throwing dung out
<br>
of the stable with spoons, so that if the hollow log strategem fails,
<br>
everyone doesn't immediately drown when it fails -- but there's time to work
<br>
out another strategy, to build a reinforced log, or whatever.
<br>
<p>But fortunately, this metaphor is NOT apt for the current situation.
<br>
Instead our situation is more like on in which there are 6 billion people in
<br>
the stables, a small handful of them are working on the hollow log
<br>
strategem, and a small handful of them are spooning out dung, and the rest
<br>
are watching Gilligan's Island reruns, reading People Magazine or trading
<br>
Pokemon cards.  Arguing over whether the spooning or the log are better is
<br>
silly, when both are so under-resourced compared to what they should be.
<br>
<p>So, getting back to the real world, I think that BOTH
<br>
<p>a) singularity-oriented R&amp;D
<br>
<p>b) genuine efforts to raise of the consciousness of human beings
<br>
<p>are under-resourced in our society, compared to what would be optimal.
<br>
Which is more under-resourced depends on interpretation of borderline cases.
<br>
(Which research counts as singularity-oriented --- do we count work on
<br>
faster microprocessors?  Which work counts as consciousness-raising -- do we
<br>
count the yoga studio on the corner?)
<br>
<p>I don't think it's worthwhile to think in terms of a zero-sum game between
<br>
Singularity-oriented R&amp;D and human-consciousness-raising.  Not at all.  I'm
<br>
happy to see people spend their time on EITHER.  And if someone has a real
<br>
passion for one of these, it's probably not going to be optimal to try to
<br>
compel them to focus on the other.  Increasing the percentage of humanity
<br>
concerned with EITHER of these things would be a good thing.
<br>
