<br>
And, once again, your use of the phrase &quot;one of *those* squabbles&quot;
<br>
indicates a view of morality, and of what issues are important within
<br>
morality, that differs very strongly from mine (this is an Eliezer code
<br>
phrase for &quot;contains gaping logical flaws&quot;), along with a very different
<br>
idea of what is socially acceptable and what constitutes a &quot;squabble&quot;.  In
<br>
my view, the phrase &quot;your idea contains a gaping logical flaw&quot; is
<br>
constructive, useful, and helpful, while the phrase &quot;your outlook is very
<br>
different from mine&quot; is useless and, in fact, seems more destructively
<br>
exploiting someone's social brainware at the expense of their rationality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It brings into play a social view of opinions as tools for building
<br>
political concordancy within a tribe, so that tolerance is a virtue
<br>
because it enables people to get along.  Which messes up what could 
<br>
otherwise have been a Bayesian weighing of evidence.
<br>

<br>
And this is part of what it means for me to have an outlook that really
<br>
*is* different from yours, as opposed to one that involves a couple of
<br>
agreed-upon disagreements.
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt; Don't worry, I fully accept that you have an outlook that is very
</em><br>
<em> &gt; different from mine.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; And each of us has an outlook very different from that of the average
</em><br>
<em> &gt; American!
</em><br>

<br>
Ben, you would be a better person if you deleted the word &quot;different&quot; from
<br>
your vocabulary and spent one month using only &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;.  Not
<br>
a different person.  A *better* person.
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; For that matter, I could also be tortured until I considered ending
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; the pain to be the most important thing in the universe.  So what?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hmmm.  Are you volunteering?? ;-D
</em><br>

<br>
Not unless it constitutes a net benefit to the Singularity, and I don't
<br>
see how it would.
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt; Ok, let's compare
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; A) the way some people live: In a Bombay alleyway, with a couple of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; limbs cut off by their parents in their early youth because limbless
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; full of diseases
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; B) The way I live at the moment -- in a nice house up in the mountains,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I'm not wealthy by any means, at the moment I'm sorta financially
</em><br>
<em> &gt; struggling, but I still say I'm living a lot better than the folks in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; case A).  I think &quot;vastly better&quot; is a fair description, and I think
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that the folks in case A) would very likely agree if the question were
</em><br>
<em> &gt; posed to them.
</em><br>

<br>
Ben, is giving two comparisons from *your* own culture (your culture is
<br>
&quot;21st century Earth&quot;, btw) really the best way to arrive at an accurate
<br>
estimate?
<br>

<br>
Here, let me rephrase your question as it applies, say, 50,000 years ago:
<br>

<br>
A) the way some people live: in a tribal savannah, with diseases, wolves,
<br>
in total ignorance, a life of constant hardship and danger and worst of
<br>
all politics, with no air conditioning, penicillin, CD players, Internet
<br>
access, or the prospect of actually living through the Singularity, plus
<br>
they don't have any good fruit trees;
<br>

<br>
B) the way some other people live: in a tribal savannah, with diseases,
<br>
wolves, in total ignorance, a life of constant hardship and danger and
<br>
worst of all politics, with no air conditioning, penicillin, CD players,
<br>
Internet access, or the prospect of actually living through the
<br>
Singularity; *but* they have some good fruit trees nearby, unlike the poor
<br>
saps who live across the river
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; If I am a person of &quot;great material privilege&quot;, by the way, I would
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; very much like to have my own nanocomputer.  What?  I can't buy that?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; And neither can Bill Gates?  Guess we're both poor.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Yes, you are both very poor materially relative to someone 100 years in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the future, and very rich materially compared to the above-mentioned
</em><br>
<em> &gt; beggar, who has no possessions and must spend essentially all their
</em><br>
<em> &gt; time literally grubbing around for food.
</em><br>

<br>
The 100-years-in-the-future perspective is the correct one; it is vastly
<br>
more intelligent than our own.  (Note: Perspectives can be &quot;correct&quot; or
<br>
&quot;incorrect&quot;.)
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt; But I am perplexed that, in your &quot;different morality&quot;, you consider
</em><br>
<em> &gt; human lives very valuable (so that you say a single human death is a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; terrible thing which pains you and is morally unacceptable), yet you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; trivialize human suffering as perceived by actual human beings.  To me,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this mix of attitudes feels odd.
</em><br>

<br>
I don't trivialize human suffering.  But if you mean that I have no
<br>
compunctions about seeking out irrationalities in the contemporary view of 
<br>
human suffering, you are absolutely correct.  The human view of orbital 
<br>
mechanics is wrong.  Why would the human view of human suffering *not* be 
<br>
wrong?  Why would you even expect it to be right?  By default, humans get 
<br>
stuff wrong.  That's what it means to be a modified chimp.  For every 
<br>
right answer there are a thousand wrong answers, at least a hundred of 
<br>
which *look* more attractive than the right answer on the surface.  It's 
<br>
real suffering that's important, not the contemporary human view of human 
<br>
suffering, what you call &quot;human suffering as perceived by actual human 
<br>
beings&quot;.  Is &quot;actual human beings&quot; supposed to be a compliment, in this 
<br>
phrase?  Why not replace it with the more technical terminology, 
<br>
&quot;suffering as perceived by thinly modified chimpanzees hacked to support 
<br>
general intelligence&quot;?  This more technical phrase does neatly explain the 
<br>
irrational diversion of attention to certain particular kinds of 
<br>
suffering; they are stimuli that grab brainware because they are 
<br>
ancestrally relevant.  That's all.  It doesn't necessarily indicate what's 
<br>
really going on or what to do about it.
