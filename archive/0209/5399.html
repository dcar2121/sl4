<br>
<em>&gt;&lt;in re to David Cake's post&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Being a nonproffessional in the area of neurochemistry, but an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interested bystander, I am struck by the way that this thread has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressed with very little attention to the relative biological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;danger inherent in most of these drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MDMA and it's parent MDA, which David Cake upholds as &quot;quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasonable for particular purposes&quot; is a stimulant, and a relative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the extraordinarily negative Methamphetamine or &quot;Crystal Meth&quot;.
</em><br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No I did not make that explicit connection - the drugs I was 
<br>
referring to with that comment were not MDMA. You are presuming 
<br>
something I didn't say. I did say that damage from MDMA use has only 
<br>
been confirmed from overuse, from what I know of the current 
<br>
literature.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to strongly distance myself here from the implication 
<br>
that I advocated the use of a drug known to have negative effects, 
<br>
and ones that are currently not well understood. I would not advocate 
<br>
consumption of MDMA, certainly not regularly or to excess. Its 
<br>
unclear how much damage occasional light consumption does - but 
<br>
regular heavy consumption certainly does serious damage. But there 
<br>
are drugs, such as long term alcohol abuse, or solvent abuse, that 
<br>
are much worse for you. And other drugs that are probably not as bad 
<br>
for you.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  The relatively negative neurochemical effects of powerful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stimulants are well known.
</em><br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats a broad overgeneralisation - 'stimulants' is a very 
<br>
vague description in pharmacological terms, and certainly a 
<br>
simplification of what MDMA does. We prescribe stimulants for many 
<br>
medical conditions (narcolepsy, for example). Stimulants certainly 
<br>
aren't something to mess with without a good understanding of their 
<br>
effects, but they certainly can be used in positive ways. 
<br>
Dexamphetamine is used almost routinely here for treatment of 
<br>
attention deficit disorder, for example.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  This is entirely seperate from the research of Dr. George Ricaurte 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of John Hopkins, which suggests that significant 'structural' damage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is incurred through MDMA use over time.
</em><br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers vary greatly (as they almost always do in a 
<br>
politically loaded area), but most research agrees that prolonged use 
<br>
of MDMA is bad for you. Just how much damage occasional use causes is 
<br>
much more debatable. Ricaurtes well known research, for example, used 
<br>
a control group who had taken the drug 75 or more times. Animal 
<br>
studies indicate you need to take several times the effective dose 
<br>
before neuro-toxicity appears - which some street users certainly do, 
<br>
but not necessarily every user.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Not to mention MDMA's role as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is well documented.
</em><br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats simply a description of MDMAs primary effect.  I don't 
<br>
regard being a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor as an automatically 
<br>
negative property, but simply a functional description. It appears 
<br>
you do regard it as an inherently negative property. Serotonin 
<br>
re-uptake inhibition is how drugs in the prozac family operate, and 
<br>
while they have problems on the whole they have probably greatly 
<br>
helped human suffering (and as we gain more experience with this 
<br>
family, will probably go on to have a very great positive effect in 
<br>
the future).
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note only that the range of experiences that can be 
<br>
psychologically addictive is very broad, and goes far beyond drugs, 
<br>
to exploiting many of the bodies natural states through unusual 
<br>
stimuli.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say many of the sorts of genuinely expanded 
<br>
consciousness available in an SL4 scenario are profoundly 
<br>
psychologically addictive - I don't think this is in itself a reason 
<br>
to avoid them. I might find it terribly hard to give up the mental 
<br>
augmentation from my brain implants!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its also worth noting the difference between psychologically 
<br>
addictive and physically addictive is very large (and most serious 
<br>
addictions combine both). Also, that many psychedelic drugs are not 
<br>
usually psychologically addictive, and instead tolerance grows 
<br>
quickly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of addiction can indeed be terrible. Human 
<br>
consciousness alteration is not without its dangers. And human 
<br>
consciousness alteration is certainly something that I think we 
<br>
probably agree is relevant to SL4. Drugs are certainly one of the 
<br>
available tools for consciousness alteration at the moment - 
<br>
sometimes in a socially sanctioned way, sometimes not. Sometimes in a 
<br>
potentially useful way, often not.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of are drugs a useful tool for inspiration is a 
<br>
complex one - first define inspiration! In general, I agree that 
<br>
drugs are not a source of general insight in the way some advocate. 
<br>
But are they a source of insight about the altered consciousness? I 
<br>
think pretty clearly - if nothing else, a serotonin re-uptake 
<br>
inhibitor can teach something about the effects of serotonin on 
<br>
cognition. Which is not to say that accounts of the value of the 
<br>
insights obtained from drugs might not be wildly overrated.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FWIW, I think psychedelic use can provide some psychological 
<br>
insights not easily otherwise available.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;This above discussion ignores the fact that most psychoactive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substances are illegal in many countries, and the available 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;streetdrugs are of uncertain composition, and often arbitrary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dosage. The wisdom of ingesting completely unknown substances 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advertised as psychoactive drugs obtained from people who smuggle, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steal, murder, and write incoherent poetry occasionally is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decision entirely seperate from the inherent toxicity of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposed makeup of said drugs.
</em><br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed. But a response to this would get firmly into the area 
<br>
of political drug policy and the wisdom of pure prohibition, which 
<br>
probably is even more off topic than the rest of it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David
