Samantha:
<br>

<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; Okay.  I have no problem with restricting it to the last 10,000
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; years if it's something that requires writing but hasn't been tried
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; over that time, or the last 500 years if it's something that
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; requires printing but has never been tried, and is significantly
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; different and significantly more powerful than anything that has
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; previously been tried.
<br>

<br>
SA&gt; I am attempting to point out that exponentially increasing 
<br>
SA&gt; technology cuts more than one way.  It enables psychological, 
<br>
SA&gt; social and economic changes that would not have been considred 
<br>
SA&gt; or would not have been viable earlier.   I also have some 
<br>
SA&gt; misgiving about the truly effective or worth doing, by 
<br>
SA&gt; implication above, being limited to the &quot;significantly 
<br>
SA&gt; different&quot; and &quot;significantly more powerful&quot;.   It tends to 
<br>
SA&gt; limit consideration to *the* most singnificantly different and
<br>
SA&gt; more powerful we can conceive of. It tends to miss cumulative 
<br>
SA&gt; effects.
<br>

<br>
[later]:
<br>
SA&gt; If you can focus enough people a bit differently that can
<br>
SA&gt; accomplish wonders.  It is a lot more than &quot;cheering&quot;. It is 
<br>
SA&gt; changed lives, perceptions and actions (to name a short list) 
<br>
SA&gt; that I am after.  I want to see a changed set of assumptions 
<br>
SA&gt; about what life is about and what its possibilities are, locally 
<br>
SA&gt; and globally.
<br>

<br>
Samantha, I agree.  Cultural change does accrete and accumulate --
<br>
often in ways difficult to see when one is in the midst of it.
<br>
Cultural change has been accelerating right along with technological
<br>
change -- to paint a picture in terms of forces, yes largely driven by
<br>
it, but that misses some essential points.
<br>

<br>
***
<br>

<br>
Example one: was Jesus' approach a &quot;failure&quot;?  Surely this is too
<br>
simplistic a way to view things.  He (or at least someone or some
<br>
group or *something*) had a huge impact.  That the message was
<br>
subverted within a century or two (or 70 years) does not mean the
<br>
message had no impact.  It is in fact impossible to assess these
<br>
things as we don't have a spare control society handy -- at least
<br>
until we develop the parallel time machine ;)  Perhaps things would
<br>
have been worse without that message; perhaps it made some things
<br>
worse short term, but better over the long term...hard to say,
<br>
although I lean towards a time-released-/time-bomb-meme
<br>
interpretation. 
<br>

<br>
(side note:  condemning usury / advocating for an interest
<br>
free form of currency IMO encourages abundance thinking)
<br>

<br>
So. Let's take some other cases, less emburdened by the myriad
<br>
ideological skirmishes small and large that have accreted to the Jesus
<br>
story over the centuries.
<br>

<br>
Ghandi: quite successful in spreading a non-violence-as-both-ethic-
<br>
and-tactic meme.  Not an unqualified, overwhelming 100% of the world
<br>
followed his example success to be sure.  But certainly no &quot;failure&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Ghandi's autobiography and _Ghandi_ were worldwide successes.  What's
<br>
the most recent century in which the civilized world embraced a
<br>
story featuring a non-violence preaching and practicing hero?
<br>

<br>
Influence, too.  Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement did
<br>
much to spread those memes -- and this converges with technological
<br>
acceleration of communications technologies: TV footage and newspaper
<br>
imagery did much to capture the imagination.  Putting a flower in the
<br>
barrel of that gun.  Monks burning themselves over Vietnam.
<br>
Tiananmen square student vs. tank faceoff.
<br>

<br>
Relevance to abundance indirect: emphasis on individual freedom from
<br>
oppression and coercion, brotherly love; condemnation of one-sided
<br>
exploitation.   
<br>

<br>
Of more direct relevance, there's Marxism, its memetic impact largely
<br>
due to an &quot;if we all played nice and shared&quot; (i.e. non-competition)
<br>
message.  Didn't *quite* work out as planned...but in cultural
<br>
history, the thought *does* count for something.
<br>

<br>
The neophile/transhumanist/extropian/singularity braid of memes has
<br>
significantly advanced abundance thinking as well, and IMO (I'm not a
<br>
transhumanist or extropian, and haven't read in depth on them) shows a
<br>
strong (direct or indirect) Buckminster Fuller influence -- who was a
<br>
strong advocate, and more importantly, engineer and demonstrator of
<br>
abundance.  That influence, his memes, have intertwined themselves in
<br>
other threads as well, e.g., the _Whole Earth Catalog_ (Stewart Brand,
<br>
ed.) introduced him to a wide audience and Robert Anton Wilson links
<br>
extensively to him; they and others both have exposed him to greater
<br>
audiences.
<br>

<br>
Open Source deserves mention as well: a meme that could be described
<br>
as a runaway explosion.  Richard Stallman is a pretty good example of
<br>
the influence of some of the above threads as well (hippie culture,
<br>
socialism).
<br>

<br>
***
<br>

<br>
Notice something about these examples: with the exception of Jesus all
<br>
pretty recent.  With IMO an increasing and increasingly visible
<br>
influence.
<br>

<br>
Notice something else about these examples.  Alleged dude Jesus:
<br>
allegedly killed by power holders.  Marxism: undermined by internal
<br>
power seekers and external power holders.  Ghandi: God the Brits must
<br>
have hated that.  And oh, he got shot too.   MLK and the civil rights
<br>
movement: your friendly local FBI agent is *on the case*, Mr. Hoover!
<br>
Also shot down (MLK, Kent square).  Chinese dissidents in jail and
<br>
executed...ehm, am I belaboring this point yet?
<br>

<br>
(Perhaps things have gotten better: people openly question the FBI's
<br>
benevolence, people openly condemn Chinese crackdowns and agitate
<br>
for the US to threaten withdrawal of favored treatment, etc.
<br>
(I have faith Ashcroft represents a temporary and lesser pendulum
<br>
counterswing).)
<br>

<br>
It is IMO undoable to separate the peace &amp; plenty message, from the
<br>
oppression-coercion-usury suck message, from the free yourself and
<br>
others from power games message.  And that last is *inherently*
<br>
inimical to power structures.
<br>

<br>
Perhaps there are systemic measures we can attempt to transform those
<br>
structures in addition to transforming their participants...
<br>

<br>
Michael Roy Ames:
<br>
MRA&gt; I have noticed this quality in children (becoming more receptive
<br>
MRA&gt; to new ways of looking at things).  The current growing
<br>
MRA&gt; environment for children (of school age in the western world)
<br>
MRA&gt; contains many SL3 and even some SL4 memes... ideas that are
<br>
MRA&gt; readily accepted by many kids. 
<br>

<br>
Anecdotal support for some of the above.
<br>

<br>
MRA&gt; The vast majority of people are just too wrapped up in day-to-day
<br>
MRA&gt; survival+primate-social stuff to (as Samantha  paints) 'think in
<br>
MRA&gt; a much more &quot;holistic&quot; or integral manner with much more real
<br>
MRA&gt; care for the maximization of all individual potentials'. Is
<br>
MRA&gt; there any way to compress that into a three-word sound bite?  ;)
<br>

<br>
The subject, &quot;pre-Singularity human enlightenment&quot;, isn't bad.
<br>
Accepting abundance.  Post scarcity thinking.  Peace and plenty
<br>
realization.  RTFLP (Read The Fucking Lord's Prayer ;)
<br>

<br>
Eliezer:
<br>
ESY&gt; 1:  See whether humans can use feedback from realtime fMRI to help
<br>
ESY&gt; identify internal rationalization, hatred, tribal-based thinking,
<br>
ESY&gt; etc. You may not get all the bugs, but if you can get just some, it
<br>
ESY&gt; may be enough to tip the internal mental balance.  Evolution has no
<br>
ESY&gt; experience puppeteering humans with access to that information.
<br>

<br>
Such identification can be inspired by reading and conversation.  Some
<br>
of this can result from therapy or analysis.  Some of this is
<br>
reportedly intentionally engineered in the successive initiation
<br>
rituals of Freemasonry. Certain aspects are explicitly dealt with in
<br>
Fuller's &quot;World Game.&quot;
<br>

<br>
I doubt the levels of abstraction you imply can be captured by visual
<br>
images, no matter how detailed their record of brain activation
<br>
patterns.  Anger, sure; hatred, arguably...
<br>

<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; 2:  Collaborative filtering and/or the Earthweb; a means whereby one
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; good idea can very rapidly spread to billions and be built upon by
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; thousands. Accelerated memetic evolution.
<br>

<br>
Excellent; in some ways starting to happen.  One possible example is
<br>
the blogging world and its subcultures, which may be developing into
<br>
such a network rapidly.  One early sign is the rapid spread of better
<br>
blogging tools and approaches (e.g., &quot;trackback&quot;) *through blogs*;
<br>
another is the increasing exposure imo-worthy ideas like spinsanity's,
<br>
dailyhowler's, comp.risks', virusmyths' etc. are getting through blogs
<br>
-- some of which filters pretty rapidly to mainstream media).
<br>

<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; 3:  See whether humans who talk to infrahuman but clear-thinking
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; Friendly AIs learn anything from that about how to think
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; rationally.  In  other words, AI-trained humans may be doable
<br>
SA&gt;ESY&gt; pre-Singularity.
<br>

<br>
Apropos of this, read the bit starting with &quot;Suppose I were an
<br>
extraterrestrial&quot; at (long-ass url split in two):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dextromethorphan.ws/schroedingers-cat/">http://www.dextromethorphan.ws/schroedingers-cat/</a>

<br>

<br>

<br>
[1] Witness the fact that many people independently arrive at the
<br>
conclusion that the Palestinians would have had or might still have
<br>
far more success had they followed that example.
<br>

<br>
That they in fact *didn't* is not the only relevant datapoint here.
<br>
AFAIK nobody has employed non-violence on Ghandi's scale in most of
<br>
human history prior to this century. What's encouraging to me is that
<br>
in my experience, so many folk make this same observation -- the
<br>
&quot;Palestinians *would have had better results* with nonviolence&quot; meme
<br>
can be found in articles, editorials, columns, blogs.  That's an
<br>
abundance theme meme.
<br>

<br>
