CS&gt; Although I remain somewhat mystified by Eliezer's criteria for asking
<br>
CS&gt; people not to post, rereading GK's latest message one _could_
<br>
CS&gt; interpret it as potentially trolling for an evangelical thread
<br>
CS&gt; (&quot;If there is a Being&quot; [...] &quot;it stands to reason that He *may*
<br>
CS&gt; have something to say about this dream of Immortality we have...&quot; --
<br>
CS&gt; note the capitalization).
<br>

<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
BG&gt; As I have said before, I am not religious and I have a strong personal
<br>
BG&gt; emotional reaction against the superstitious &amp; conformist aspects of
<br>
BG&gt; religions.  However, I have a lot of respect for individual &amp; collective
<br>
BG&gt; spiritual experience, and I feel that individuals who are experienced in
<br>
BG&gt; this way may have a lot to contribute to our thinking about the Singularity.
<br>

<br>
The reason I used the word &quot;evangelical&quot; is the second part of his
<br>
message I quoted: &quot;He *may* have something to say about this [...]&quot;
<br>
could -- I emphasize, *could* -- be interpreted as a segue into
<br>
quoting Scripture on not making Images or what have you.
<br>

<br>
I generally have a dislike for conformist aspects of religion, some
<br>
interest in superstitious/ritual behaviours, and a lot of interest in
<br>
spirituality.  Discussions on whether the Singularity would be
<br>
God-like for various values of &quot;God&quot; from different religions;
<br>
speculation about the possibility of this universe being the result of
<br>
or existing in the mind of some previous Singularity; speculation
<br>
about whether human intelligence or the earth is itself some ongoing
<br>
experiment by some greater Intelligence -- these all could be
<br>
interesting topics IMO (although I'm not sure of their
<br>
SL4-worthiness).
<br>

<br>
Again, I'm not sure where GK was going with this nor what Eliezer had
<br>
in mind; I was offering a possible interpretation -- Eliezer saw GK as
<br>
about to go into evangelical mode (which I distinguish from &quot;shooting
<br>
the shit about spiritual aspects&quot; mode).  I feel that at the least,
<br>
*if* this was the reason, some more room should have been given for
<br>
that to become apparent.  If it was not the reason I'm unclear what
<br>
was (besides catching up a bit, perhaps).  But then again, I'm not
<br>
clear why Mike &amp; Donna Deering were banned.  I'm not clear why I
<br>
haven't been, for that matter.
<br>

<br>
Perhaps this all goes to show something about what happens to our
<br>
sense of certainty in the presence of a superior -- at the least more
<br>
powerful -- Intelligence.  Question: is Eliezer &quot;Friendly&quot;?  ;)
