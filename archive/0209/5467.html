I am very delighted at how many people here do &quot;get it&quot;.  It 
<br>
feels like the efforts toward Singularity are much more balanced 
<br>
as a result.  I believe a good deal of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;we&quot; based 
<br>
world/self/humnity understanding is quite important in addition 
<br>
to the more &quot;it&quot; objective external reality based understanding 
<br>
of the purely scientific/rational.  Both are essential to any 
<br>
efforts to transform/transcend human limitations.  Without that 
<br>
balance we are likely to fail to understand ourselves, our world 
<br>
or what it is we wish to see magnified and freed from current 
<br>
limitation.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a different perspective than the &quot;rationalist&quot; perspective often put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth on this list, but in my view it is also a very valid perspective.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads to statements that are neither supported nor refuted by empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations, but are strongly supported by &quot;experiential evidence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
It can be argued that the inner world is by no means 
<br>
non-empirical just because it is inner.  Not when the same 
<br>
experiences, states of consciousness, stages of development are 
<br>
seen in inner life of person after person across many cultures 
<br>
and throughout recorded history.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; A few years back I wrote a kind of blank-verse prose poem on similar themes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Journey of the Void.&quot;  <a href="http://www.goertzel.org/fiction/journey.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/fiction/journey.htm</a>  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I call the Void there is what you call That or Universal Mind ... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suchness of Being, others have said.  The nature of the universe can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes be usefully viewed by humans as consisting of a primordial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate of some sort, which has separated little bits of itself off into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular forms... these little bits suffer from their separateness from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole, but also display great beauty at times (and various forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;time&quot; are themselves just little bits of the original whole) ... and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is then a process of reunification with the whole....  The Singularity fits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into this pattern.  It must be admitted that Teilhard de Chardin was getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at this same archetypal pattern with his vision of the Omega point at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end of the evolution of the noosphere -- although his language and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of his vision were too closely tied to his Christianity for my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taste....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
And to a particular rather mythic and exclusive variant at that. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many others since then and many mystics of all 
<br>
faiths and varieties who said similar things.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is interesting to observe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) some of us on this list, who are die-hard Singularitiarians, take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spiritual perspective on the Singularity (among other perspectives that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) most people in the world are religious (&amp; to some extent spiritual)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One might conclude from this that the spiritual aspect of the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be a good way to connect Singularitarian thought with the world-view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;the masses.&quot;  Unfortunately though it doesn't seem to work out that way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is, in my view, because the entrenched belief systems of the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions have deviated too far from the spiritual experience that was at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the essence of all these religions originally.  The Singularity idea is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely harmonious with the spiritual experience at the essence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion, but not very harmonious at all with many of the beliefs that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accreted onto these experiences to form organized and doctrinized religions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
This is a very interesting point and one that I have pondered 
<br>
for some time now.  As the level of general abundance through 
<br>
technology increases there is, imho, a non-zero probability that 
<br>
patterns of societal and individual consciousness may make a 
<br>
jump into a new state based around a different set of 
<br>
fundamental abundance vs. scarcity core reality assumptions.  As 
<br>
the technology increases our abilities and the speed at which 
<br>
developments unfold, there is a magnifying of the effects of our 
<br>
individual and collective state of consciousness, it becomes 
<br>
increasingly crucial that consciousness itself is transformed 
<br>
using all means possible.  Short of rewiring human brains, 
<br>
spirituality/philosophy/&quot;consciousness raising&quot; is the fastest 
<br>
way of effecting such change.  You say that it doesn't seem to 
<br>
work out.  But I have to ask, have we really tried in the modern 
<br>
context of abundance and its radically internal and external 
<br>
implications?
<br>

<br>
What would happen if you could take the essence of the 
<br>
religions, the spiritual awakening at the core of their 
<br>
founding, and link it up to a radically abundant and prosperous 
<br>
vision of what everyday, on earth human society and life can be? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you could support the &quot;getting it&quot; on a larger scale 
<br>
and  without requiring &quot;leaving the world&quot; but instead greatly 
<br>
and positively transforming the world precisely by means of part 
<br>
of that &quot;getting it&quot;?  What if you could get enough people en 
<br>
masse to step beyond scarcity thinking and begin thinking in 
<br>
terms of abundance and maximal development and well-being for 
<br>
everyone?  It would be extremely and wonderfully powerful.  It 
<br>
could turn the tide of a lot of dystopias and impending disasters.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Put simply, one of the things the spiritual experience brings is a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humility, coming from the knowledge that we humans are just a teeny tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the Big Grand Multi-Universal Mish-Mash (Douglas Adams called it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like that in the Hitchhiker series ;) .. it brings a sense of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely limited nature of our own knowledge and understanding, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential massivity and power of what else is out there....  Yet somehow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thru the pragmatics of human cultural dynamics, this humility &amp; intuition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has become associated with a whole host of overconfident beliefs about life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after death, the rules we're supposed to live by each day, etc. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yecccch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Well, we &quot;tiny parts&quot; seem to have the Whole ingrained within us 
<br>
and be able to some extent to consciously plug into the Whole. 
<br>
Ultimately I don't see that there are any limits. Of course, as 
<br>
we plug into this Whole in various ways, especially 
<br>
technologically we become different from what we were at the 
<br>
beginning.  Our tininess is both necessary to apprehend to not 
<br>
place so much emphasis on our mini-me and local temporary drama 
<br>
and necessary as the flip side of recognizing the Unlimited 
<br>
Wholeness, yearning for it, reaching for it, bringing it into 
<br>
being in our lives  and fully appreciating It.
<br>

<br>
Spiritual laws exist and are important truths of our existence 
<br>
and development.  They are fundamental laws of that inner side 
<br>
of the balance.  But they are much, much different from some 
<br>
hoary lists of &quot;Thou Shall&quot; and &quot;Thou Shall Not&quot;.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Well I have rambled long enough for one weekend morning -- time to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids brekky!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I believe that even before Singularity the Path of Technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will lead us to the point where we must transcend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evolved-ape phase in some quite crucial ways if we are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;survive at all.  If we are going to be able to upload and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;continue to grow the notion of self must become more fluid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This I am not so sure about.  It depends on the timing of events....  if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity comes rapidly enough this won't be the case...
</em><br>

<br>
I think that at least some of us must devote our lives and best 
<br>
efforts to the work of transforming/transcending  human 
<br>
consciousness and institutions.  We can't put all our eggs into 
<br>
one basket.  Nor do I think we can assume that humans can create 
<br>
a true Friendly AI seed without to a large extent raising our 
<br>
own consciousness.   I think it is highly dangerous to believe 
<br>
we can do a mainly techological and super-rational end-run that 
<br>
will solve everything and keep us from the need for such efforts.
<br>

<br>
If the Singularity does not come rapidly or does not &quot;save us&quot; 
<br>
quite like we hoped it would, then we may well not have time 
<br>
enough for the work at the consciousness level before we succeed 
<br>
in destroying ourselves.
