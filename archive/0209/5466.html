<br>
No, some of us &quot;get it&quot; quite vividly....
<br>

<br>
It is a different perspective than the &quot;rationalist&quot; perspective often put
<br>
forth on this list, but in my view it is also a very valid perspective.  It
<br>
leads to statements that are neither supported nor refuted by empirical
<br>
observations, but are strongly supported by &quot;experiential evidence.&quot;
<br>

<br>
A few years back I wrote a kind of blank-verse prose poem on similar themes,
<br>
&quot;The Journey of the Void.&quot;  <a href="http://www.goertzel.org/fiction/journey.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/fiction/journey.htm</a>  ...
<br>
What I call the Void there is what you call That or Universal Mind ... the
<br>
Suchness of Being, others have said.  The nature of the universe can
<br>
sometimes be usefully viewed by humans as consisting of a primordial
<br>
substrate of some sort, which has separated little bits of itself off into
<br>
particular forms... these little bits suffer from their separateness from
<br>
the whole, but also display great beauty at times (and various forms of
<br>
&quot;time&quot; are themselves just little bits of the original whole) ... and there
<br>
is then a process of reunification with the whole....  The Singularity fits
<br>
into this pattern.  It must be admitted that Teilhard de Chardin was getting
<br>
at this same archetypal pattern with his vision of the Omega point at the
<br>
end of the evolution of the noosphere -- although his language and the
<br>
details of his vision were too closely tied to his Christianity for my
<br>
taste....
<br>

<br>
You say &quot;It is difficult to say what I mean&quot; ... I agree, it is hard for any
<br>
of us to write about such things without sounding ridiculous, and one might
<br>
conclude that this is because what's being said *is* ridiculous... but
<br>
perhaps it's because language -- modern Western language especially -- is
<br>
not made for discussing such things, it is made mostly for discussing
<br>
practical things in the physical world -- with specialized vocabularies for
<br>
discussing other topics, which draw on the &quot;practically focused&quot; subset of
<br>
language for metaphors.  The physical-world metaphors infusing our language
<br>
are particularly misleading and awkward when talking about things that are
<br>
beyond our physical universe....  Words like &quot;process&quot;, &quot;reunification&quot;,
<br>
&quot;bits&quot;, &quot;forms&quot; bring to mind everyday-life connotations that are not quite
<br>
appropriate and, in the context of a conversation like this one, can mislead
<br>
the reader if the reader doesn't have the experiential grounding to see
<br>
through the language-bias-induced implicit-misleading-metaphors...
<br>

<br>
It is interesting to observe that
<br>

<br>
1) some of us on this list, who are die-hard Singularitiarians, take a
<br>
spiritual perspective on the Singularity (among other perspectives that we
<br>
take)
<br>

<br>
2) most people in the world are religious (&amp; to some extent spiritual)
<br>

<br>
One might conclude from this that the spiritual aspect of the Singularity
<br>
could be a good way to connect Singularitarian thought with the world-view
<br>
of &quot;the masses.&quot;  Unfortunately though it doesn't seem to work out that way.
<br>
This is, in my view, because the entrenched belief systems of the world's
<br>
religions have deviated too far from the spiritual experience that was at
<br>
the essence of all these religions originally.  The Singularity idea is
<br>
extremely harmonious with the spiritual experience at the essence of
<br>
religion, but not very harmonious at all with many of the beliefs that have
<br>
accreted onto these experiences to form organized and doctrinized religions.
<br>

<br>
Put simply, one of the things the spiritual experience brings is a kind of
<br>
humility, coming from the knowledge that we humans are just a teeny tiny
<br>
part of the Big Grand Multi-Universal Mish-Mash (Douglas Adams called it
<br>
something like that in the Hitchhiker series ;) .. it brings a sense of the
<br>
extremely limited nature of our own knowledge and understanding, and the
<br>
potential massivity and power of what else is out there....  Yet somehow,
<br>
thru the pragmatics of human cultural dynamics, this humility &amp; intuition
<br>
has become associated with a whole host of overconfident beliefs about life
<br>
after death, the rules we're supposed to live by each day, etc. etc.
<br>
Yecccch.
<br>

<br>
Well I have rambled long enough for one weekend morning -- time to get the
<br>
kids brekky!!
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I believe that even before Singularity the Path of Technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will lead us to the point where we must transcend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved-ape phase in some quite crucial ways if we are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive at all.  If we are going to be able to upload and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to grow the notion of self must become more fluid.
</em><br>

<br>
This I am not so sure about.  It depends on the timing of events....  if the
<br>
Singularity comes rapidly enough this won't be the case...
<br>
