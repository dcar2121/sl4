<p>If there is no Singularity and there is no Friendly AI then humans are 
<br>
as good as dead.  The kind of changes that you want to see are only 
<br>
partially achievable at best.  Making the populace more Rational is not 
<br>
merely a memetic battle; you have to get people to actually fix their 
<br>
minds on their own.  Even then there is only so much fixing that can be 
<br>
done.
<br>
<p>Maybe you'll figure out how to succeed where Jesus and Siddhartha and 
<br>
Ghandi failed.  More likely you won't.
<br>
<p>This is not to discourage you.  If you're successful enough before the 
<br>
Singularity maybe you can save enough people that you did better than if 
<br>
you contributed more to creating the Singularity.  You have a better 
<br>
idea than I do of what you are capable of and what you can contribute 
<br>
where.  I just hope that you will make the best choice.
