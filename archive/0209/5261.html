<em> &gt; A phrase intended to evoke something similar to your phrase &quot;under the

</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; But one time I stayed in the inverse meta too many consecutive days,

<p>You know, by golly, I used to whack my computer with a sledgehammer every 
<br>
morning, and it would sometimes give really creative results for word 
<br>
processing and spreadsheet programs.  Of course the hard drive caught fire 
<br>
and the mouse ran away and you could actually hear the monitors screaming 
<br>
just before they exploded; but it's better than boring old *normal* 
<br>
operation, isn't it?  Besides I once had a friend whose mother's uncle's 
<br>
cousin's daughter's roommate's IRS auditor said that his computer worked 
<br>
better if he whacked it with a sledgehammer.
<br>
<p>Just trying to provide some perspective on what all this boasting about 
<br>
&quot;past experiences I have had burning out my own neurons&quot; sounds like from 
<br>
over in this corner of room.  If you haven't done it yourself, the bizarre 
<br>
tone of defiant pride in others' reports sounds *really really* odd, given 
<br>
the subject matter.  &quot;Oh, yeah, when I was a kid, I used to go down to the 
<br>
nuclear waste facility and snort radioactive cobalt up my nose, and I 
<br>
think it was really a valuable experience, though of course I wouldn't do 
<br>
it now.&quot;
