<em>&gt;Horrible example.  This rite of passage has been forced in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevent women from fully being able to enjoy sex to supposedly protect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their purity but actually to protect their husbands from any thought of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;straying for better sex partners. In strictly human terms the practice is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;barbaric and deplorable in the extreme.  Stopping it is not an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unreasonable use of force.  Using force to stop the use of of forceo on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unwilling or unwitting victims is not a clear wrong.   It might have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better to educate the practice away or in the future just repair the damage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is a great deal of difference between this ambiguous case and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harm that oculd be done by the incautious and over-exuberant actions of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI, self-directed or otherwise.
</em><br>

<br>
Yes, that was a bad example that didn't quite convey my point, which is 
<br>
that many people, through centuries of exposure to oppressive cultural 
<br>
practices (from genital mutilation to capitalism), have never experienced 
<br>
true freedom in their lives. And when outsiders, who don't fully understand 
<br>
the situation, attempt to do the right thing according to their own 
<br>
morality, can actually make the net situation worse for those they are 
<br>
trying to help. To these oppressed people, the creation of an AI is totally 
<br>
irrelevant until the benefits are accepted by the people themselves. Hence 
<br>
the need for 'preparation' of humanity for the types of benefits the 
<br>
singularity will create - such as abundance - which is the objective of the 
<br>
company I am founding.
<br>
