<br>
I'm not subscribed to Extropians because the volume is too high, and there's
<br>
too much chat on contemporary politics, much of it from a perspective
<br>
(extreme libertarianism) that bores me.
<br>

<br>
I very much appreciate the fact that this is a moderated list.  Some
<br>
unmoderated lists are very good, of course, but those tend to be on narrow
<br>
tech topics, which don't attract many people in the first place.  I think
<br>
that a moderated list is appropriate for a topic like this, which
<br>
potentially appeals to a huge group of people.
<br>

<br>
If I ran a futurist/Singularitiarian list it would also be moderated, and
<br>
along roughly the same lines as you moderate your list.  So, I generally
<br>
think your style of moderation is quite good.
<br>

<br>
My personal style, however, would be perhaps 30% less stringent than yours.
<br>

<br>
I would certainly issue warnings to people before banning them from posting,
<br>
but I know that takes extra effort, and I also know that you've done that at
<br>
least in some cases.
<br>

<br>
Anyway, I didn't mean to imply that I had a general problem with how you run
<br>
the list; I just disagree with some of your particular decisions, as is to
<br>
be expected.
<br>

<br>
In particular -- thinking thru your most recent bans -- I find I miss Mike
<br>
(and the elusive Donna) Deering's excellent &amp; insightful sense of humor on
<br>
the list...
<br>

<br>
Some of your bans I found 100% appropriate, of course.  I'm not going to
<br>
bother to name names ;-&gt;
