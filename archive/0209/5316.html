<em>&gt;  &gt;  individual potentials before we get to Singularity.  Again, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; see how just getting to Singularity makes this occuring more likely if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the groundwork has not been laid.  Sure the Singularity could simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; establish this, plus or minus &quot;Transition Guides&quot;, but we need as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  of this as we can possibly get beforehand if we are to survive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; reach Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are you going to do that hasn't been tried in the last 50,000 years?
</em><br>
<p>Considering that we haven't really bad even written records for 
<br>
more than 10,000 years, that is about 40,000 years too much to 
<br>
consider.  Also, until recently, as I have attempted to point 
<br>
out, we were not in a technological and economic position to 
<br>
escape certain harsh realities.  Those potentially open new 
<br>
possibilities for how we consciously perceive what &quot;life is all 
<br>
about&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong.  The above is a good question. 
<br>
However, I am not yet prepare to offer an answer I believe goes 
<br>
deep enough to satisfy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Remember, us AIfolk have to deal with the shadow of fifty years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failure; everyone wants to know what we're going to do that hasn't been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried before.  You have to dig yourself out from under the heap of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's failures; show that your thinking is new enough not to belong in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trash heap with the things that have been tried before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a poor way of thinking.  Each effort stands more 
<br>
on its own merits without being bogged down by everything 
<br>
before. Yes we learn from past failures but we do not have to 
<br>
personally redeem all that baggage.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Why is your thinking that new?  Why are your plans that original?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>New and original are not necessarily primary criteria.  The 
<br>
situation is new.  The communication bandwidth is new.  Can 
<br>
something effective be done with that?  Perhaps.  It is to be 
<br>
designed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Understand, I am not asking this in order to be difficult.  I can think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least three things you could try, in terms of promoting greater human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightenment before the Singularity, that have never been tried before. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I want to know is what *you're* thinking of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Please share those things.  They may make a real difference. My 
<br>
thinking is early and tentative.  I am not fully ready to lay it 
<br>
out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't do much good to issue calls to action without a strategy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promises to work.  Not a strategy that *sounds* good.  Not a strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that blazes like a banner and uplifts your heart.  A strategy which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlike the stuff that's been previously tried over the last 50,000 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will actually work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is of course 
<br>
still a crucial part of reaching enough people.  What do you 
<br>
believe will actaully work?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; I am probably expressing this inadequately.  But I believe that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; sometimes make the mistake of overemphasizing the intellect side of SAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  and underemphasizing its &quot;heart&quot; - the deep appreciation, caring for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  compassion for, nurturing of all.  A god sized being without that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; would be extremely problematic. Our conceptions of SAI are in danger of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; being unbalanced in much the same ways that we ourselves lack balance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again:  What are you going to do, and why is it going to work when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything previous has failed?  To quote Doonesbury, &quot;Let's kick butt!&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a plan unless you know which butts to kick, how far, and in which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That notion of kicking butt is actually almost diametrically 
<br>
opposed to what I believe needs to happen.
