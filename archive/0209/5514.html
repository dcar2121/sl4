BG&gt; I love AI research, but if it were clear to me I could do much
<br>
BG&gt; more good by evangelizing about the future -- trying to convince
<br>
BG&gt; people to take abundance into account into their thinking -- then
<br>
BG&gt; I would do that.  Kurzweil has apparently made that decision -- to
<br>
BG&gt; evangelize &amp; leave the research to others, because he feels there
<br>
BG&gt; are plenty of other smart researchers out there, but few as well
<br>
BG&gt; positioned as he is to effectively evangelize.... 
<br>

<br>
In the context of scarcity-and-power thinking, I think Buckminster
<br>
Fuller's work, and educating people on the Prisoner's Dilemma, are
<br>
more relevant (or perhaps prerequisites).  (I'd include Korzybski's
<br>
_Science and Sanity_ and Reich's _Mass Psychology of Fascism_ (don't
<br>
hurt me mike99!) in that memetic stream, even though they don't
<br>
directly address the scarcity/abundance issue).
<br>

<br>
But as I've mentioned before, I don't think the main risks to the
<br>
achieving the singularity are from the public at large, but rather
<br>
from those people and organizations currently in a position of
<br>
privilege, because they have (perceived) motive and they have (some)
<br>
means to foul up progress.
