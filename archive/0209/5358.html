Tony:
<br>
TG&gt; The original WikiWiki seems to think it's a collective
<br>
TG&gt; intelligence of some form:

<br>
TG&gt;
<br>
TG&gt; Is this similar to what you're after?
<br>
<p>Some of that is very close, certainly, in goals.  (I had thought
<br>
briefly of mentioning Wiki Wiki but my understanding of it was terribly
<br>
outdated and/or based on the wrong sites.)
<br>
<p>I haven't read all the articles and the ones they link to in depth but
<br>
Wiki Wiki definitely has the right approach in some instances, IMO.
<br>
Where I would differ is in a) wanting to increase the speed of
<br>
conversation b) integrate more collaborative filtering and c)
<br>
preserving anonymity in threaded &quot;discussions&quot;.  I do like a lot of
<br>
things about the approach, so thanks very much for pointing it out.
<br>
<p>Simon McClenahan:
<br>
SM&gt; Your wording doesn't make sense to me. A collaborative technique
<br>
SM&gt; or action has the end result of a single train of thought. And if
<br>
SM&gt; it human collaboration that is employing the technique, the only
<br>
SM&gt; benefit from using a particular technology is simply as a tool for
<br>
SM&gt; the individual humans to enter and filter/reorder/reformulate the
<br>
SM&gt; stored information. 
<br>
<p>The words &quot;only&quot; and &quot;simply&quot; in that sentence bother me...In my
<br>
experience, two people bouncing ideas off each other can come up with
<br>
new ideas neither would have developed on their own.  IMO, this
<br>
can work with up to, perhaps, five people; more, and it starts to
<br>
deteriorate.  One of the system goals is to enable such productivity
<br>
on larger scales, with more participants.
<br>
<p>SM&gt; If the collaboration is performed by an AI, then the discussion
<br>
SM&gt; board technology simply becomes an issue of human user interface
<br>
SM&gt; design on how to enter and render information.
<br>
<p>I haven't considered AI as a component of This Damned Thing yet, but I
<br>
object to &quot;simply&quot; here as well: interface design can have a huge 
<br>
impact; and depending on how AI was employed it might be able to
<br>
present &quot;new&quot; (subjectively, to the participants) information, as it
<br>
were datamined from the contributions and their cross-references (see
<br>
Mitch's point, below).
<br>
<p>SM&gt; This [ego] is a social problem. You need to figure out the idea
<br>
SM&gt; parsing first. Personally, I prefer people to be identifiable and
<br>
SM&gt; accountable for what they say, egotistically or not.
<br>
<p>In the usual forum structures, I agree.  The goal of The Damned Thing
<br>
I'm after, however, is precisely to transcend individuals in an
<br>
attempt at something similar to human clustering.
<br>
<p>SM&gt; The trademarked Mind Maps were developed by Tony Buzan, and is
<br>
SM&gt; designed very specifically for humans to work and think in a more
<br>
SM&gt; visual mode. 
<br>
<p>re: Mind Maps -- I haven't been able to hunt down the software that
<br>
I was thinking of originally.  Somewhat similar to Mind Maps, but
<br>
network- rather than hierarchy-oriented, it also would recenter on
<br>
whatever node you clicked on.
<br>
<p>Some further googling reveals Axon's &quot;Concept Mapping&quot; to possbily
<br>
more akin to what I mean; see
<br>
<a href="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~axon2000/brochure.htm">http://web.singnet.com.sg/~axon2000/brochure.htm</a>.  &quot;Concept mapping
<br>
software&quot; might be the more appropriate google phrase.
<br>
<p>SM&gt; Creating a discussion board that uses graphical artifacts will be
<br>
SM&gt; difficult to sell to people because they are still used to
<br>
SM&gt; thinking linearly, in a &quot;train of thought&quot; as you put it.
<br>
<p>As far as it being visually oriented, I see this (and the glass bead
<br>
game) as one (possible) aspect of the software I envision -- allowing
<br>
an overview of the connections (and properties of individual
<br>
connections, e.g. cause, prerequisite, concomitant, precedent) within
<br>
a network of concepts or thoughts.  E.g. perhaps one would
<br>
double-click on a node to see its full text.
<br>
<p>Mitch Howe:
<br>
MH&gt; I thought this was a pretty interesting idea, and I wound up
<br>
MH&gt; losing a bit of sleep thinking about how something like this might
<br>
MH&gt; be made to work. 
<br>
<p>Whoops ;)
<br>
<p>MH&gt; One of the specific things that came to mind was the online forums
<br>
MH&gt; of public discourse that figure prominently in the novel *Ender's
<br>
MH&gt; Game* by Orson Scott Card.  These were very popular and had
<br>
MH&gt; enormous sway over public opinion -- so much so, that two gifted
<br>
MH&gt; children were able to wield a surprising deal of influence...
<br>
<p>This book just got moved up a number of spots in my queue.
<br>
<p>MH&gt; But one has to wonder how such forums could ever arise without
<br>
MH&gt; collapsing under the weight of petty human squabbles and inept,
<br>
MH&gt; unintelligent posts. Anonymity, I think, is just part of the
<br>
MH&gt; answer.  Here are my ideas for such a system, which I envision as
<br>
MH&gt; a modified bulletin board: 
<br>
MH&gt;
<br>
MH&gt; Rules (for enforcement, see below):
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I agree, these are useful rules.
<br>
<p>MH&gt; For statistical purposes, each unique user that views a post adds
<br>
MH&gt; to a *read* total on the post.
<br>
MH&gt;
<br>
MH&gt; Immediately I can envision a number of interesting lists arranged
<br>
MH&gt; not just by post value, but by controversialness (total number of
<br>
MH&gt; points on the *post* and on the rebuttals -- providing post value
<br>
MH&gt; is not too low), impact (number of points on posts/rebuttals vs.
<br>
MH&gt; number of reads) activity (number of reads, posts, and points
<br>
MH&gt; added over a given time frame), and size (total number of
<br>
MH&gt; rebuttals and counter rebuttals). 
<br>
<p>That's an excellent idea, and if some AI/datamining technology were to
<br>
be used as a component of the system, such statistics would make a
<br>
good starting point.
<br>
<p>[snipping the rest, re: rankings and abusing them; I may comment on
<br>
this after some further thought]
<br>
<p>Thanks all for the feedback and input...I definitely have a more
<br>
clearly defined concept of what I'm after now, as well as plenty of
<br>
usable ideas from the various tools and some intuitions about how to
<br>
integrate them.
