<br>
m&gt; Could you name some of these near-paradisiacal societies? I must
<br>
m&gt; have missed them.
<br>

<br>
I could be wrong and I've only read some superficial texts on this,
<br>
but my understanding is that classic Balinese culture would qualify
<br>
(not sure about the near-paradisical part, but the non-scarcity-based
<br>
part).  Possibly also Eskimo society, and that of a few of the Native
<br>
American tribes.
<br>

<br>
Some claim that in broad strokes the distinction between &quot;matriarchal&quot;
<br>
and &quot;patriarchal&quot; societies is what's relevant; some that there's a
<br>
strong geographical component; some that the transition from
<br>
hunter-gatherers to agricultural societies is most strongly implicated
<br>
in moving towards hierarchical structures.  I've recently been reading
<br>
bits of James DeMeo's studies/theories on these issues and found them
<br>
interesting: <a href="http://www.orgonelab.org/saharasia.htm">http://www.orgonelab.org/saharasia.htm</a>
