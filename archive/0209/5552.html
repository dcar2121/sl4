<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some software types, like word processors and general-purpose programming

</em><br>

<br>
Well, I have a well-known and perhaps too often stated 
<br>
disagreement with your contention about general purpose 
<br>
programming languages.  The most populat languages today 
<br>
actually are deficient in many features present a decade or more 
<br>
ago in less popular and arguably &quot;higher level&quot; languages.  Some 
<br>
features are a bit more developed but many are, imo, retrograde.
<br>

<br>
I also believe that the entire form of software today is overdue 
<br>
for an overhaul.  For 18 years now I have been expecting 
<br>
software to evolve away from a file-based and application-based 
<br>
set of assumptions entirely.  I expect more of a &quot;cloud of 
<br>
objects and capabilities&quot; environment where the work to be done 
<br>
occurs by the relevant components being more or less 
<br>
transparently assembled, managed, evolved, disassembled in 
<br>
conjunction with many other types of simultaneous work some of 
<br>
the components may or may not be involved in.  The exact 
<br>
location of any of these components on the network or whether it 
<br>
is in this or that type of memory (in-menory or on disk in old 
<br>
thinking for instance) is not relevant except to low-level, 
<br>
mostly automated parts of the environmental infrastructure that 
<br>
can monitor and adjust such details based on the work needed. 
<br>
Data-only &quot;objects&quot; are also much more fluid in this sort of 
<br>
environment.
<br>

<br>
.NET and Java give some parts of this but they have other 
<br>
unnecessary restrictions.
<br>

<br>
I am also waiting for (and should be developing) tools that work 
<br>
better with extending, storing, mining, sharing the experiences, 
<br>
thoughts, works, communications of individuals and groups - 
<br>
tools that truly are mind extensions. Many things have been 
<br>
talked about and written about. But few have actually been 
<br>
build.  Some of them, like LifeStreams, seem to be tied up in IP 
<br>
restrictions.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, I've been working with Maple a fair bit lately, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no doubt in my mind that mathematical software has advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponentially.  I remember using tools like Derive back in the 80's -- they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could graph simple 1-D function and do some very simple equation-solving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Comparatively, modern tools like Maple, Mathematica and MATLAB are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
I remember the old Macsyma from around 1979 or so.  It was very 
<br>
powerful but nowhere near as friedly and powerful as tools like 
<br>
Mathematica today.  Now, if I could just reuse all the 
<br>
components of those tools in other ways at will as part of her 
<br>
problems and solution spaces, I would be much happier.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; The same could be said for graphic software such as Photoshop &amp; Flash ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that stuff has come a LONG way..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I imagine that if one analyzed the progress of software in detail, one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find that, as with hardware, some subdomains have exponentially advanced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some have stagnated.  Comparing &quot;software progress&quot; generally with &quot;computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware progress&quot; is not a great comparison, because software is a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverse universe, whereas computer hardware is a narrower set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies, within the larger domain of all hardware (some aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which have advanced rapidly, others not).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
This is true.  Open Source / Free Software has also come a long 
<br>
way and is imo significantly advancing the general level of 
<br>
tools and skills present in the software world.
