Hi guys,
<br>

<br>
I'm new to the SL4 list, so please, be gentle ;)
<br>

<br>
I've been lurking for a few days, and feel I have something to contribute 
<br>
to the thread...
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt; How big would the temptation be for any current superpower to grab the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; first workable nanotech or the first usable general AI and use it to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wield power over others?
</em><br>

<br>
I couldn't agree more! In fact, the temptation IS too great according to 
<br>
the following:
<br>

<br>
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0915-01.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0915-01.htm</a>
<br>

<br>
It seems that the use of future tech is already being considered as a 
<br>
'politically useful tool' by the likes of Bush, Cheney &amp; Rumsfield.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Again, I don't think convincing humanity at large is of anywhere near
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the importance as is convincing those in power -- those who have a far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greater ability, and IMO greater subjective motivation (misguided, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present) to stop or divert progress towards universal abundance.
</em><br>

<br>
I agree, but I doubt very much that you would be successful in convincing 
<br>
those with power to submit to anything but a greater power. In fact, I 
<br>
think you would end up encased in a 44 gallon drum and sent to the bottom 
<br>
of the ocean if you tried to sell the case for abundance. Even though the 
<br>
ship (humanity) may be sinking, you are asking people to give up their 
<br>
first class cabin to try &amp; paddle it to an island paradise that's beyond 
<br>
the horizon. The very means (greed) by which these people have attained 
<br>
their position within the hierarchy dictates that they will not give up 
<br>
what they have without a fight.
<br>

<br>
I have put some thought into this a few months ago, &amp; came to the 
<br>
conclusion that the only viable means of dismantling the hierarchical power 
<br>
structures (economic or political) humanity has created, is from the bottom 
<br>
up. One possible solution is abundance. By suppling the desires of the 
<br>
masses with material wealth (presumably from a general assembler created by 
<br>
an AI), the structure of the hierarchy will begin to disintegrate as the 
<br>
individuals are no longer bound by financial necessity.
<br>

<br>
However, it is likely to be 10-20 years before this is possible. In the 
<br>
mean time, I believe it is possible to make substantial progress towards 
<br>
this scenario - before a general assembler is available. For example, one 
<br>
idea I am actively pursue is creating a software company that has no 
<br>
internal hierarchy. There are no company owners, shareholders or managers. 
<br>
Instead, workers are organized into cells, such as 'development', 'sales', 
<br>
'support' etc. The idea is that each worker is an entity that is equal in 
<br>
every respect - including their share of the profit that the cell makes. 
<br>
The catch is, that because there are no business owners siphoning off 
<br>
profit (which is how the elite attain their wealth), the company will be 
<br>
able to offer substantially higher wages to it's workers. Also, because 
<br>
making profit is the responsibility of the workers, the cell will function 
<br>
at maximum efficiency. Basically, each individual is directly responsible 
<br>
for their own income, the business is just a frame work in which they 
<br>
operate. If this type of model proves successful it will spread very 
<br>
quickly. This will erode the hierarchical economic power structure created 
<br>
by capitalism by eliminating the accumulation of massive sums of wealth - 
<br>
from the bottom up. Basically, the idea is: you can't be an emperor if you 
<br>
have no slaves.
<br>

<br>
Currently, this is about as far as I have gone with the concept, as I'm now 
<br>
focusing all my efforts into establishing the software company. My point 
<br>
is, that there are things we can do today that will 'prepare' humanity for 
<br>
the singularity, we just need to be creative, and if necessary play the 
<br>
game on the level that the greedy, selfish individuals who currently hold 
<br>
power (by appealing to the masses own sense of greed to create conformity). 
<br>
I believe that &quot;scarcity based&quot; / &quot;zero sum&quot; / &quot;selfish&quot; thinking is 90% 
<br>
nurture and 10% nature, here's why:
<br>

<br>
<a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/globalization/cointel/567.html">http://www.guerrillanews.com/globalization/cointel/567.html</a>
<br>

<br>
However, the question we should be asking is how long can we continue on 
<br>
our current trajectory, and does that leave us with enough time to reach 
<br>
the singularity. I strongly believe that recent world events are an 
<br>
indication of the current economic/social/political crisis (mainly within 
<br>
the US). My reasoning is, that 18 months ago, I would have laughed at the 
<br>
idea there could be a nuclear exchange, but today, I consider it a very 
<br>
real (currently however, very unlikely) possibility - IF things turn ugly 
<br>
in the middle east and Israel or Pakistan (the 2 nearest nuclear powers) 
<br>
are dragged into the war. I realize that this situation is completely out 
<br>
of our control, however, it is important to recognize that global stability 
<br>
may diminish in the future and apply that knowledge to any long term plans.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Chris
