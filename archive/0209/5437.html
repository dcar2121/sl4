Thumbs up on How the Mind Works.  I believe it's one of the better
<br>
first-step cognitive science books available.  (Peter Gray's Psychology,
<br>
4th Edition, is also good.)  The following is a selection of topics
<br>
found in the book:
<br>

Pinker's The Blank Slate has a US release date of September 26.  The

<br>
Our conceptions of human nature affect every aspect of our lives, from
<br>
the way we raise our children to the political movements we embrace. Yet
<br>
just as science is bringing us into a golden age of understanding human
<br>
nature,  many people are hostile to the very idea. They fear that
<br>
discoveries about innate patterns of thinking and feeling may be used to
<br>
justify inequality, to subvert social change, to dissolve personal
<br>
responsibility, and to strip life of meaning and purpose.
<br>

<br>
In The Blank Slate, Steven Pinker, bestselling author of The Language
<br>
Instinct and How the Mind Works, explores the idea of human nature and
<br>
its moral, emotional, and political colorings. He shows how many
<br>
intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing
<br>
three linked dogmas: The Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits),
<br>
The Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society), and
<br>
The Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free
<br>
from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders
<br>
have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are
<br>
now challenging them.
<br>

<br>
Pinker tries to inject calm and rationality into these debates by
<br>
showing that equality, progress, responsibility, and purpose have
<br>
nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms
<br>
even the most menacing threats with clear thinking, common sense, and
<br>
pertinent facts from science and history. Despite its popularity among
<br>
intellectuals during much of the twentieth century, he argues, the
<br>
doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies
<br>
our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces hardheaded
<br>
analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our
<br>
understanding of government, violence, parenting, and the arts.
<br>

<br>
Pinker shows that an acknowledgment of human nature that is grounded in
<br>
science and common sense,  far from being dangerous,  can complement
<br>
insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and
<br>
philosophers. All this is done in the style that earned his previous
<br>
books many prizes and worldwide acclaim: wit, lucidity, and insight on
<br>
matters great and small.
