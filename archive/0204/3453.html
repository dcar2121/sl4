<p>There are two levels to human society:  the evolved level and the 
<br>
developed level.  The developed level is what you're looking at.  
<br>
Certainly the developed level of society and individual humans changes 
<br>
with time.  Fashions change, tools change, social structures change and 
<br>
the developed level of human society changes to match (or sometimes the 
<br>
change in tools is a result of human society changing; it works both 
<br>
ways).  As much as the developed level changes, the evolved level of 
<br>
human society has remained the same throughout the period of recorded 
<br>
human history.  Furthermore, the developed level sits atop the evolved 
<br>
level of society; every time we adapt to new technologies it is with our 
<br>
brains that were designed to thrive in tribes of 100 to 200 humans.
<br>
<p>Humans have done a lot of good things and our evolved brains go a long 
<br>
way to making us ethical.  The problem is that ethics that match with 
<br>
the ancestoral environment can get screwed when you throw in technology 
<br>
that can cause existential disasters.  The developed level of society is 
<br>
important, but much as the US Constitution takes precedence over laws of 
<br>
Congress, the evolved level of society can swoop in and ruin everything 
<br>
for the developed level of society.
<br>
<p>If you haven't, you may want to read some books about evolutionary 
<br>
psychology.  I had a pretty optimistic view of humans until I learned 
<br>
about how our brains work and how they got that way.  I'll admit, 
<br>
evolutionary psychology is mostly theory, but it's the only existing 
<br>
theory that makes much sense.  You can find some references to a few 
<br>
good texts on the subject on my Singularitarian reading list:
<br>
<p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sing_rc/readings.html">http://homepage.mac.com/sing_rc/readings.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; coming to a point where knowledge about the human body can be used to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulate human thinking. I want to read Francis Fukuyamas new book on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how chemicals/genetics can change the society we live in. He states 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this would be a bad thing. I am not so sure. I think it could be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad thing. But it could be good. And no I don't take drugs myself.
</em><br>
<p>I think many of us on this list are for rewiring human brains.  I'm all 
<br>
for it.  Of course, most of us want to do it post Singularity once we're 
<br>
uploads.  While we would certainly benefit from the right kind of 
<br>
rewiring pre Singularity, there are logistical issues like changing 
<br>
everyone and making sure that the rewired brains are robust enough to 
<br>
keep from letting themselves be taken over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some of the future societies I imagine scare me, but I am trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolate some of the trends I see, which still keep humans alive :), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without going to the singleton scenario which I am sceptical of. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolute power, corruption etc...
</em><br>
<p>Absolute power == absolute corruption is an anthropomorphic argument.  
<br>
IIRC, both I and Mitch Howe address this one:
<br>
<p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sing_rc/papers/sysop.html">http://homepage.mac.com/sing_rc/papers/sysop.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.freedomspace.net/~sysopfaq/sysopfaq.htm">http://www.freedomspace.net/~sysopfaq/sysopfaq.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I am working on revising my paper, so Mitch's writing may be more 
<br>
informative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I assumed there was a way of quantifying intelligence :) The phrase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of human intelligences seems to be used quite a bit.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is a rough estimate.  Most of us have a feel for how smart we 
<br>
are.  We can't really imagine what something 1000 times smarter is like, 
<br>
but it's a big number that gives a hint of how much more intelligence we 
<br>
are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After this I will stop trying to convince the cynics of humanity that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can solve are own problems. Which basically means shutting up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely :)
</em><br>
<p>We're not trying to shut you up.  As long as you have new, interesting 
<br>
points to make, you are free to post.  Who knows, maybe you can convince 
<br>
us all.  I doubt it, since I think many of us have gone from being 
<br>
optimists to cynics with what we think are good reasons, but sometimes 
<br>
what seems impossible turns out to be right.
