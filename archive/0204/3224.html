</em><br>
<p>Ben, why would I rely only on my own intuitions in a case where it's easy 
<br>
to
<br>
just ask people?  I've checked with people who have more software
<br>
development experience.  I checked with *you*, remember?  You said that
<br>
while you started Webmind Inc. believing in distributed development and had
<br>
people scattered all over the place, if you wanted to do it all over you'd
<br>
rather have had everyone in one place.  If you've changed your mind since
<br>
then, I'll take that into consideration, but I will not actually change my
<br>
current plan, because all the *other* experienced software developers I've
<br>
talked to about this have said:  &quot;Yeah, if you want to take a serious shot
<br>
at this you'd better have full-time people on-location, it's not realistic
<br>
otherwise.&quot;
<br>
***
<br>
<p>There is no doubt, the best case is having the best team all in the same 
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>However, in real life one is always making compromises, and there are lots 
<br>
of other factors.
<br>
<p>I started out Webmind Inc. with a distributed team, and while this wasn't 
<br>
optimal, the work that I did with this distributed team was instrumental in 
<br>
helping me get funding -- funding that I used to build a less distributed 
<br>
team!
<br>
<p>Even with funding, though, I was unable to find the right people in New 
<br>
York, where I was located at the time.  I found great AI scientists in New 
<br>
York, but not great software engineers with deep AI knowledge.  I found a 
<br>
group of great software engineers with deep AI knowledge in Brazil, and I 
<br>
am glad I decided to use them instead of just restricting myself to local 
<br>
people.  We are still working together now, a year after Webmind Inc. 
<br>
dissolved.  We have never worked together in one place, though we have 
<br>
visited each other often, sometimes for up to 1-2 months.
<br>
<p>So I've made all sorts of mistakes to do with geography &amp; project 
<br>
management!   First there was the mistake of underestimating the value of 
<br>
F2F communication, and relying on a wildly distributed team too long after 
<br>
funding made it unnecessary.  Then there was the mistake of *too badly* 
<br>
wanting to work with people in New York, which led me to hire inferior 
<br>
NY-based software engineers -- rather than accepting that the Brazilian 
<br>
team I'd found was SO MUCH better than the New Yorkers I was able to 
<br>
recruit at that time, that it was more effective to work with the 
<br>
Brazilians at a distance with frequent visits.  (This was 1998-99, a very 
<br>
hard time to hire good engineers in the US; now the situation is a bit 
<br>
different due to the changes in the economy.  These days it might be a lot 
<br>
easier to build a quality team in New York.)
<br>
<p>So, obviously, the simple rules of thumb like &quot;it's better to be colocated&quot; 
<br>
are just simple rules of thumb.   Real decisions wind up being a lot more 
<br>
complicated.
<br>
<p>In your case, my view is: If funding proves hard to come by, you shouldn't 
<br>
overlook the possibility that working with a distributed team could help 
<br>
bring your project to a point of maturity at which obtaining funding 
<br>
becomes easier.
