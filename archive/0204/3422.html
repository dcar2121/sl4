Hey, Will.  No offense or anything, but I don't think you're caught up on
<br>
the SL4 background material just yet.  Despite various continuing
<br>
disagreements, there are certain terms that we try to use in a precise way. 
<br>
Similarly, there are constraints on which futures can be envisioned under
<br>
certain background assumptions; it isn't all just magic.  (&quot;Magic&quot; tends to
<br>
occupy a certain balance between anthropomorphic characteristics and minor
<br>
departures; a Singularity envisioned as magic will be too anthropomorphic.)

</em><br>
<p>A &quot;seed AI&quot; is an AI designed for self-modification, self-understanding, and
<br>
recursive self-improvement with the intent of growth to beyond human
<br>
intelligence levels.  You don't use a seed AI as a wearable computer,
<br>
although perhaps someday you might use a non-self-improving fragment split
<br>
off by a seed AI in a wearable computer, or wearable computers might be
<br>
wired into a global network that is collectively a seed AI.
<br>
<p>There are powerful design constraints that rule out just putting together a
<br>
seed AI with some random goal system.  You need to read up on Friendly AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The IAS would warn you visually if something bad was about to happen, that it noticed with it's super intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>You don't have wearable computers and superintelligence in the same world. 
<br>
That's a worse anachronism than using chipped flint tools to repair a
<br>
personal computer.  &quot;Superintelligence&quot; is conventionally (on SL4) defined
<br>
as an intelligence with at least hundreds or thousands of times the
<br>
effective brainpower of a human.  If it doesn't have nanotechnology yet, it
<br>
will real soon.  If you're using a wearable computer at this point it's
<br>
because you've decided to join a protected enclave instead of joining the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you still think that self motivated (friendly or otherwise) AI will be first or better for whatever reason, think of this as a backup plan, if programming the goals are too hard :).
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't work as a backup plan.  A computer program that conforms to the
<br>
immediate subgoals of the user, rather than independently originating
<br>
subgoals in the service of long-term goals, has insufficient planning
<br>
ability to support seed AI.  If programming the goals are too hard,
<br>
programming a really simple unworkable system won't help.
