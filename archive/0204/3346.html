<p>
Evan,
<br>
<p>Here is one justification for the belief that &quot;working toward the
<br>
Singularity is important.&quot;
<br>
<p>Consider the probability
<br>
<p>p(t) = the probability that, during year t, some nutcase will wipe out the
<br>
human race via biological terrorism or some other means
<br>
<p>You estimate that p(t)~=0, with a fairly high subjective confidence
<br>
<p>I think that your confidence is primarily not based on objective factors
<br>
<p>I believe that p(t) increases over time -- a reasonable, though not certain
<br>
belief, based on the advent of more &amp; more sophisticated technologies --
<br>
<p>Now, consider the probability that the advent of superintelligent AI will
<br>
decrease the p(t) to another probability
<br>
<p>p*(t) = the probability that intelligence on earth will be wiped out during
<br>
year t, given that superhumanly intelligent AI exists during year t
<br>
<p>I consider that
<br>
<p>p*(t) &lt;&lt; p(t)
<br>
<p>because I reckon that, while superintelligent AI may end up being
<br>
indifferent to us, it's unlikely to be malicious toward us in the manner
<br>
that we are malicious to ourselves.
<br>
<p>Depending upon one's intuitive appraisal of the shapes of these curves, it
<br>
may well come out that working toward the Singularity -- if one believes one
<br>
can personally cause it to come several years earlier than otherwise -- can
<br>
drastically increase the probability of the survival of intelligence on
<br>
Earth in general, and of one's own personal mind in particular.
<br>
<p>Of course, if you estimate these probabilities differently, that's your
<br>
right...
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;  When I first heard Vinge's prediction of the Singularity, in '86, he used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the phrase 'falling into a technological singularity.'.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made before anyone began working consciously toward it.  Everything I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed indicates to me that his prediction is basically correct in terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the image of falling.  So when people say such things as: 'We must work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward this thing because our survival depends on it.', or some such, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just doesn't make any sense to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Isn't there something to be said for accepting the ambiguity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the difficulty of predicting the future?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, but when you have 14 billion years of accelerating change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a prediction that that acceleration will continue without some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obstruction is not all that ambiguous.  And I haven't heard any real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence as to the existence of any major obstructions put forth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of half-baked paranoia, mostly based on fear of the unknown.
</em><br>
