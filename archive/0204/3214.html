hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I understand it, the core people working on Novamente are people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked together for an extended period on Webmind and hence are already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained to work together on the task at hand.
</em><br>
<p>Quite true
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With that core group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full-time experienced people, it becomes possible to coordinate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although I don't know if you have any non-Webmind volunteers at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point(?).
</em><br>
<p>None who are working yet.  I have a number of new recruits, mainly from this
<br>
list, and I'll tell you in 6 months how things worked out in this regard ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you have wanted to *start out* work on Webmind with a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers?  Do you think it would have gotten anywhere?
</em><br>
<p>I *did* start out with a few volunteers, in 1997-early 1998 before achieving
<br>
funding for Webmind Inc.  Those volunteers became the cofounders of Webmind
<br>
Inc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe it would,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since Webmind had a much-less-tight architecture (I expect), but would it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have worked for starting out on building Novamente if you hadn't already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built Webmind?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think the key to using a widely-distributed team is having a
<br>
VERY tight &amp; complete design.  Implementation of a complete design in a
<br>
distributed fashion is a lot easier than the process of converging from
<br>
ambiguous brainstormy ideas to definite designs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Starting on real AI takes programmers working together in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location, full time,
</em><br>
<p>I am not so sure that this is true.  It MAY be true, but I can't imagine how
<br>
you can be *so definite* about such a thing, given your limited experience
<br>
base in software project management.
<br>
<p>In my experience, F2F contact is valuable but intermittent F2F may be
<br>
adequate, coupled with frequent e-mail and/or chat contact.
<br>
<p>My point is that we cannot wait for ideal conditions to begin implementing
<br>
Real AI's.  Yes, it would be nice to have ample funding, and isolate 1000
<br>
researchers/programmers on 50 islands with 20 per island, each pursuing a
<br>
potentially different approach.  But this is not what Mr. Gates has decided
<br>
to do with his spare change this week.  I am committed to pursuing
<br>
team-based Singularity-focused Real AI development by whatever means are
<br>
available...
<br>
<p>Having said that -- of course, if having a team in the same location as you,
<br>
all focused full-time on the project, is the *only* approach that makes you
<br>
adequately comfortable to proceed ... well then, maybe this has to be the
<br>
way for you to proceed.  Best of luck!
<br>
<p><p>-- ben
