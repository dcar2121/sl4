<em>&gt; &gt; Having read some of the archives this list seems very hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any memes that try to suggest any other scenario than Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ai/sysop.
</em><br>
<p>This posited hostility seems to me not to exist.
<br>
<p>For example, I am nowhere near as confident as Eliezer that either Friendly
<br>
AI or Unfriendly AI is a reasonably likely scenario.  My own intuition (in
<br>
which I don't place terribly much faith, as I'm just a meat machine, and
<br>
like all of us meat machines not well qualified to think about such things)
<br>
tends more toward the Incomprehensibly Indifferent AI scenario.  Maybe not
<br>
an Honest Annie scenario in which our AI's actually shut up and disappear
<br>
from us ... but maybe something close....
<br>
<p>I have discussed this scenario on this list more than once, and have not met
<br>
with a hostile reception.  I think this is because
<br>
<p>a) there is no evidence or rational argumentation to refute this scenario...
<br>
and
<br>
b) it does not require any unlikely-sounding special assumption to ensure
<br>
its plausibility.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, for instance, consider the scenario that Vinge puts forth
<br>
in Fire Upon the Deep, that there are limits to intelligence in this part of
<br>
the galaxy which prevent true AI from emerging, but that this is not the
<br>
case in other parts of the galaxy.  This is not *impossible*, and there's no
<br>
evidence or rational argumentation to refute it, but it does require special
<br>
assumptions that seem to me unlikely to ensure its plausibility.  So I don't
<br>
take this hypothesis so seriously, and probably others on the list don't
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>The hard thing about making this sort of judgment, however, is that it's
<br>
almost GUARANTEED the future will bring all sorts of things *which would
<br>
strike our current  mind as currently unlikely* -- probably things that
<br>
would strike our current minds as MORE unlikely than Vinge's
<br>
fictionally-posited cognitively-meaningful spatial-location variations in
<br>
physical law.
<br>
<p>For this reason I am continually cautioning humility in prognostication.
<br>
Something amazing is very likely to happen, but to think that we can capture
<br>
it very thoroughly with our early 21'st century human notions like
<br>
&quot;Singularity&quot; and &quot;Friendly AI&quot; is probably a bit too hubristic.
<br>
<p>Still, *attempting* to comprehend what's to come seems about the best
<br>
alternative we have right now ;&gt;
