<p>
<em>&gt; &gt;From everything I have read here and elsewhere, the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming along rather nicely without your efforts.  So why do you think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special project is required?
</em><br>
<p>I think your statement is partly a variant on a common paradox.
<br>
<p>Another variant of this paradox is: &quot;Why vote?  If I don't vote, who cares,
<br>
I'm just one among very  many voters.&quot;  But yet if everyone thought that
<br>
way, the election wouldn't happen.
<br>
<p>Similarly, it's true that if Eliezer or I or any other one individual or
<br>
small group stopped working on Singularity-focused technology, the
<br>
Singularity would still happen.  But yet, if *everyone* took this to heart
<br>
and hence stopped making efforts, the Singularity *wouldn't* happen.
<br>
Because the Singularity is composed of the sum total of loads of individual
<br>
efforts like ours.
<br>
<p>That said, it's also true that in some cases individuals can make big
<br>
differences in tech and sci. development.  This is because, in life as in
<br>
music, timing is important.
<br>
<p>For instance, if not for Tesla, AC would have been developed -- but when?
<br>
Perhaps Edison's DC would have ended up wiring half the US before someone
<br>
else developed AC.  If Salk hadn't come along, the vaccines he developed
<br>
would very likely have been developed by others, but many individuals would
<br>
have died in the interim.  Etc.  On the more negative side, it could be that
<br>
if a couple fewer scientists had joined the atom-bomb-building project in
<br>
the US, the bomb wouldn't have been finished until after WWII was done, and
<br>
so it never would have been used.
<br>
<p>Eliezer knows the Singularity will happen without him.  But he considers it
<br>
possible (perhaps even likely) that his efforts will cause it to come
<br>
significantly *faster*, and/or to have a *better outcome.*  This seems to me
<br>
enough reason for him to devote his life to it.
<br>
<p>We all need to find  meaning in life somewhere, and this seems a better
<br>
place than many alternatives I've seen.
<br>
