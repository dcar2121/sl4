<p>Ben: I took Eliezer's DGI design intention, to define thoughts ==
<br>
&quot;disposable one-time structures&quot;, as a pragmatic deliniation between
<br>
'ephemeral' vs. 'permanent'.  This 'cut' has to be made somewhere, as
<br>
saving
<br>
a detailed mind-state for every passing thought is just too expensive.
<br>
I
<br>
also have described this border as &quot;a storm of thoughts raging over a
<br>
sea of
<br>
concepts&quot;... when the storm of thoughts abate, the concepts remain,
<br>
although
<br>
somewhat mixed and changed.  This is not to say that a thought cannot
<br>
be
<br>
saved for later retrieval, just that it won't be saved in the same
<br>
format as
<br>
it normally exists.  Instead it will be encoded as a memory - perhaps
<br>
as a
<br>
group of related concepts linked to specific imagery.

<p>Sure, this is correct.  A remembered thought is never quite the same as the
<br>
actual thought.  Generally when remembering a thought, the most significant
<br>
aspects of the thought will be remembered, and the &quot;background&quot; of the
<br>
thought, which gives it much of its flavor, will not be stored.  When the
<br>
thought is revived from memory it then sits against quite a different
<br>
context, which can give it a different aspect the second time around...
