<p>
Well, Damien presents an elegant argument, but if we give the &quot;multiverse&quot; 
<br>
theory creedence, the following becomes obvious:
<br>
<p>1. The very existence of a multiverse demands that all things have occurred, 
<br>
regardless of improbability.
<br>
<p>2. Even if for some reason, we had to initiate the randomizing event in our 
<br>
Earth, every program ever compiled was compiled in all possible worlds in 
<br>
all possible ways. So, in an effective sense, though less elegant, Damien's 
<br>
experiment has been performed every time anyone has ever compiled a program 
<br>
and run it, no matter how trivial.
<br>
<p>3. If multiverses are reversable(a spawned probability to back track to the 
<br>
originating threadal reality) we are confronted with nonsense. Every single 
<br>
universe would be overrrun with time-traveling ancestor worshippers(or 
<br>
worse), and fanatical nihilistic Blight SIs attempting to destroy their own 
<br>
historical precedents and so on. If multiverses are traversable at all, they 
<br>
must be in only one direction, upward and outward, threading new 
<br>
possibilities, never returning to old ones.
<br>
<p>(These analysis are based on an extremely simplified model of reality. 
<br>
Mostly for intelligibility, and partly for meshing with the previous 
<br>
discussion. Every time I try to discuss things like this based on my 
<br>
internal model of reality I end up answering so many questions I revert to 
<br>
'Taoist Answering Machine' mode:
<br>
<p>&quot;Is travel between universes possible&quot;
<br>
<p>-There is no 'division' of 'universes', thus your goal is illusory.
<br>
<p>&quot;Is time travel possible?&quot;
<br>
<p>-There is no time, thus your goal is illusory.
<br>
<p>&quot;Are there really infinite universes?&quot;
<br>
<p>-Infinity is only the ultimate execution of possibility, your division of 
<br>
possibility into universes is unneccesary, thus your goal is illusory
<br>
<p>And so on.. But in the interest of being a good sport, and enjoying the fun, 
<br>
I must point out, that in some universe, this email I am sending is a VB 
<br>
script that someone somewhere will read, and their Outlook Express will 
<br>
execute it, creating a runaway superintelligent virus that will consume all 
<br>
computation available in that universe, then begin spilling into all others, 
<br>
eventually ending in the destruction of the Multiverse, and really pissing 
<br>
off Q. So really, I am the destructor of all you hope and dream, and it was 
<br>
that dumb bastard's fault, who had Outlook Express' script execution 
<br>
enabled.
<br>
<p>AND NOW YOU KNOW!

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been contacted by now? Because if there are an infinite number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of worlds, some Damien out there should have already convinced someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to run this experiment, right?
</em><br>
<p>It's also possible that 'with great power come great responsibility', and 
<br>
it's so blazingly unlikely that anyone could possibly ever step between 
<br>
universes that the few you can, don't, for fear of blowing it all the hell.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this kind of inquiry is sort of nonsensical, but it's so much fun!
