<p>Ok.  I already read somewhere else on your site the stuff that I
<br>
was worried about.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; found in the archives, online material, and so on.  Speaking of which, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may want to spend some time browsing the archives (
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I myself am goal driven.  Please let me explain my reasons to be
<br>
on this list so that you can point out to me how I can fit in.
<br>
<p>Like you, I am worried about mankind.  Something needs to happen
<br>
and soon.  I will not be able to do anything about this, I am
<br>
not a politician with a lot of power (and even those can do VERY
<br>
little).  My hope is that humanity survives itself long enough
<br>
to make it to the stars, and the Singularity seems to be very
<br>
realistic way to achieve that - at least a lot faster then I had
<br>
hoped for before (personally I think it will take another 500 years
<br>
however, but that is not relevant).
<br>
<p>Given the above, the goal is clear: To develop the Seed AI.
<br>
Given that I've now been programming 7 years or so on a C++ library
<br>
that will be needed for programs that are a notch more complex than
<br>
what is possible without it - I realize that the Work I can do alone
<br>
is neglectable; I will *certainly* not be able to write a working AI
<br>
within my own life-span.
<br>
<p>Therefore I seek people who are working on that and whose work
<br>
will likely be used by mankind for future work (I don't think that
<br>
you, or anyone else this generation, will succeed.  But you could
<br>
make a break-through or lay an important basis).
<br>
<p>Then I'd like to help those people by offering them my capability
<br>
to analyze and comprehend abstract things.  Help them with their
<br>
work: the design of the seed AI.
<br>
<p>I am NOT interested in discussing what will happen after the
<br>
Singularity is a fact, nor do I think that it is my place to be
<br>
part of a philosophic discussion about how to Walk The Path Into
<br>
The Singularity (although I think that is extremely important,
<br>
there are more than enough others who can think about that).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From your remark, especially the one where you say that you might
</em><br>
not have time to reply, I conclude that you are not interested
<br>
in hearing my ideas.  Adding that to the fact that I am pretty
<br>
bad in dealing with human relationships (and cooperating in a
<br>
team), the likeliness that I could make a significant difference
<br>
here - together with you and your work - drop below what I feel
<br>
is worth it.
<br>
<p>You've already made clear that you don't believe in making an effort
<br>
together with volunteers on the other side of the World, so - unless
<br>
you convince me now otherwise - my decision has been made that it
<br>
won't be us who will cooperate and I will unsubscribe and continue
<br>
my conversation in private with Ben.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>

PS If there is anyone else on this list who is actively designing
   AI (not necessarily Real AI), then please mail me in private
   if you are interested in setting up a mailinglist that will
   deal with practical design issues.
