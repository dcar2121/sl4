<p><em>&gt; Here, you seem to say that ordinary people pondering the issues of AI

<p>It's an interesting hobby, but about as fruitful as ordinary rubes off the
<br>
street contemplating high energy physics, while not using maths nor a
<br>
particle accelerator. There's a reason natural philosophy never went
<br>
anywhere until people stopped just doing physics in their heads (recall
<br>
the familiar fallacy of &quot;a heavier stone falls faster than a lighter
<br>
one&quot;), and started doing experiments, which confronted them with the fact
<br>
that their ad hoc models and reality disagreed violently.
<br>
<p>The nice thing about experimental AI is that you need a) free time b) 
<br>
literature c) a $999 machine with Internet access to get started.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Armchair AI philosophers&quot; can't come up with anything new? Anyways,
</em><br>
<p>If I'm frozen in orthodoxy, and want to break out of it, the very first
<br>
thing I do is fish for a fresh perspective. It is usually a new fact from
<br>
the outside, not the trodden paths within your mind that do the trick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; do we really have anything better to do? I think the interest
</em><br>
<p>As a hobby, it certainly beats beer and baseball.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; non-experts have in the matter is encouraging, and these random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ponderings can some day grow into a professional interest and talent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in AI, on a personal level, for the person doing the pondering. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what if our random thoughts on the topic aren't &quot;non-armchair&quot;? It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems that the people who work hard at AI (whom I also respect very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much), and the &quot;Armchair AI Philosophers&quot; aren't any closer than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other to the singularity.
</em><br>
<p>I recommend to drop introspection and trying to extract knowledge out of
<br>
your navel and look at how reality is delivering this &quot;Intelligence&quot;
<br>
thing. At the very least this will be guaranteed to surprise you, and
<br>
teach you something new.
