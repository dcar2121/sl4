<p>Hi Evan, if you want to think about it in strictly utilitarian ways, we
<br>
can do some simple math.
<br>
<p>As you note, there are large industries out there right now producing
<br>
more and more powerful computers. The end result of this trend is that
<br>
smaller and smaller organizations can afford more computing power. It
<br>
won't take something on the scale of a manhattan project to fully
<br>
implement a seed AI. So the answer to question 1: &quot;Is it theoretically
<br>
possible that a small group in the post-2010 period could cause a
<br>
Singularity?&quot; is yes. Maybe even before that if computing power grows
<br>
quickly enough and the seed AI design of said group are good enough.
<br>
<p>Question 2: &quot;Why bother when someone else will do it even if we don't
<br>
or can't?&quot; Answer is: 150k people die everyday. Although getting to a
<br>
Singularity a week earlier might not be life-and-death decisive for you
<br>
or anyone you know, it will in general matter greatly to about 1 million
<br>
people. If, by working on our designs for seed AIs now, us or Ben or
<br>
anyone else can be ready to let it fly the moment we can get our hands
<br>
on good enough hardware, this is well worth the efforts. There are many
<br>
examples of technologies only being developed well after they theoretically
<br>
could have been invented... this is not a situation where we want that to
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>Last thing to contemplate: if it turns out that the concepts of Friendly
<br>
AI turn out to be quite important in greatly reducing the risks of a
<br>
seed-AI-driven Singularity, then the work SIAI has already done was well
<br>
worth the pittance of dollars (yes, Eliezer deserves a better salary :-)
<br>
and personal effort we put into it.
<br>
<p>Frankly it's hard to understand how anyone can think about something like
<br>
a Singularity and even come up with the thought &quot;why bother?&quot;. Even if
<br>
you don't care about the 149,999 other deaths per day you should be
<br>
worrying about reaching safety for yourself. This isn't some event that
<br>
will not touch you. For anyone who is convinced a Singularity is likely,
<br>
the conservative way to behave in this era is not &quot;why bother?&quot;. Now is
<br>
the time to seize every day.
