Even if he believes &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, there's also c) it's impossible to describe

<p>I'm probably only in the top 5 percent of intelligence for humans (I say
<br>
&quot;only&quot; because of the company I'm in on this list), but it's impossible

for me to understand in detail many of the actions of people in the top

1/10th percent, a much smaller gap.

I am certainly not the brightest person on this list either, but I tend to
<br>
believe that the problem of depicting a super-intelligence in a work of
<br>
fiction is merely challenging, not by any means impossible.
<br>
<p>In fact, I believe that such entities could make themselves understood by
<br>
lesser beings such as ourselves in so many different ways that these
<br>
super-AI's would make marvelously memorable characters. We and other beings
<br>
at our level could surely not fully comprehend those super-AI's.  But we
<br>
could know about them whatever they wanted us to know -- or wanted us to
<br>
*believe* whether or not those beliefs were true in any sense.
<br>
<p>Now doesn't that sound like the premise for a promising story? It's sure
<br>
worked well in all those works of religious fiction (better known as divine
<br>
revelations) that have propagated the memes of theistic religions so
<br>
successfully.
