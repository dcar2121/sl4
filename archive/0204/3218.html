hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, you've told me a bunch of times that you don't think I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult AI is.  Hopefully you will not be offended if I say the same in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return; I have looked upon the functional decomposition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think you realize how huge it is.  I know that you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger now than you used to think when Webmind was getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore you *think* you have learned how huge intelligence is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you've seen all of the challenge or even most of it.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, our estimate of the size of the problem of creating an AI peaked
<br>
in mid-2000.
<br>
<p>Throughout 2001 we kept discovering how to reduce various mind functions to
<br>
special cases of a moderately small set of mind functions, in what I think
<br>
is a pragmatic way.
<br>
<p>I think one's estimate of the size of the problem of implementing AI depends
<br>
largely on how much functional specialization one is willing to build in, as
<br>
opposed to &quot;being encouraged to emerge.&quot;
<br>
<p>I spent about 15 years carefully studying the nature of human and general
<br>
intelligence, before trying to create a detailed software design for a Real
<br>
AI.  I think this study period gave me a decent sense of the magnitude of
<br>
the problem.  But the complexity of intelligence doesn't directly translate
<br>
into implementation complexity, due to the emergent aspect of intelligent
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is humanity's last software project.  It is one that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeated some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very smart people for fifty years, and I haven't yet seen anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates Novamente has overcome it.  This software project *is* *the*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Singularity* and it would be foolhardy to expect it to be easy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree, creating Real AI is not easy.  But this year it feels easier
<br>
than last to me, based on my concrete work simplifying and systematizing the
<br>
Novamente design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be foolhardy to expect to crack the barrier if we hit it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than full force.  It is *disrespect for the job* to start out by saying,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;And let's do this on a part-time volunteer basis with F2F contact once a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month,&quot; instead of &quot;If the programmers were all MARRIED it might still not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be enough; the least we can do is all work out of the same office.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a rather silly statement.
<br>
<p>I do not agree at all that it is &quot;disrespectful of the task of creating Real
<br>
AI and bringing about the Singularity&quot; for me to have different ideas about
<br>
software project planning than you do.
<br>
<p>I understand that your opinions on this topic are strongly felt and have
<br>
reasons underlying them.  But the fact is, you have never led an
<br>
all-in-one-place development team, *nor* a substantial broadly-distributed
<br>
development team.  This doesn't mean your intuitions are wrong, of course.
<br>
But it does give me less inclination to accept them.
<br>
<p>Perhaps your preferences say more about how YOU are comfortable working,
<br>
than they do about how such projects must be managed in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding has improved to the point where I now think I can see how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create seed AI with one midsized nonprofit, instead of a Manhattan Project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or industrywide effort as I once thought, but to carry out the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a one-man job or with a part-time volunteer crew is still unreasonable.
</em><br>
<p>My view is: It might take 100 part-time volunteers to do the job of 10
<br>
full-timers, but if the 100 volunteers are available and the 10 full-timers
<br>
are not, then I'd take them....  Of course the management overhead is much
<br>
worse in the &quot;100 volunteers&quot; case but is it really *unreasonable*??  I
<br>
don't see why.
<br>
<p>Personally I am aiming for a &quot;20 full-timers plus 50 part-time volunteers&quot;
<br>
setup, with a couple of the full-timers devoted to coordinating the efforts
<br>
of the volunteers.  Needless to say I am far from having 20 full-timers or
<br>
50 part-time volunteers on the project at this point... but we'll get there
<br>
