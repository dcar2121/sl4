Here's a draft chapter from my current book, a collection of essays on the
<br>
need for a recovery of Enlightenment values, possibly to be titled KNOW-ALL
<br>
(in the USA that might well be KNOW-IT-ALL). The idea below is meant
<br>
seriously. I've run it past an active specialist in quantum computation,
<br>
who finds it sound but feels that-- But we'll deal with that in the
<br>
afterword, below. 
<br>
<p>Please do not repost this anywhere else without my permission.
<br>
<p>===================
<br>
<p>Quantum AI Bootstrap, a 1/2-Baked Idea
<br>
<p>I had a rather appalling idea recently, based on my short story `Infinite
<br>
Monkey'. If it works, the idea could change the world as we know it. I know
<br>
at least one man who is trying to make it work. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first some background: according to a widely accepted interpretation
<br>
of quantum theory, every choice and event that ever happens is literally
<br>
doubled and reduplicated, with small crucial variations, in trillions upon
<br>
trillions of diverging parallel realities, spread through infinite lateral
<br>
time. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are having a bad hair day, cheer up--another version of you, in a
<br>
universe at right angles to this one, is doing just fine. And a zillion
<br>
more, it's true, take up every conceivable alternative position in between.
<br>
Some of them are dead. Some are on Mars. A few are sharing Graceland with
<br>
Elvis, who is married to Princess Di or perhaps John Lennon.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many worlds hypothesis was proposed in 1957 by Hugh Everett, III, who
<br>
in this universe died decades ago. According to one of his followers,
<br>
Oxford physicist David Deutsch, this outrageous version of reality ought
<br>
not surprise us, or at least physicists, since it is simply the best theory
<br>
available to science--quantum mechanics--taken perfectly literally without
<br>
metaphysical evasions. The multitude of overlapping histories is needed to
<br>
explain some of the most basic features of our ordinary world. And there
<br>
are some striking and unexpected consequences of this idea. Deutsch argues
<br>
ingeniously, for example, that gene sequences performing the same function
<br>
in different adjacent worlds must be closely similar, while so-called `junk
<br>
DNA' littering genomes will vary at random. It is precisely this
<br>
consistency in true informational structures that marks them off from noisy
<br>
rubbish, however complex and elaborate the noise might seem.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deutsch is one of the founders of quantum computing, and no New Ager. His
<br>
extravagant ideas are worth taking very seriously indeed. My own notion
<br>
might deserve no such respect, but I like it anyway. It generated itself
<br>
spontaneously over good Japanese food and ample wine in the ingenious and
<br>
quick-witted company of James Newton-Thomas, a mining robotics engineer,
<br>
and our companions. James explained a nifty way to use quantum theory to
<br>
search for mineral deposits. I thought it was very clever, and I hope it
<br>
works and makes him (and ultimately the rest of the human species)
<br>
enormously wealthy, so obviously I am not going to tell you about that.
<br>
Recalling my own whimsical fiction, I thought perhaps we might be able to
<br>
create a self-bootstrapping AI--artificial intelligence--that phones home
<br>
once it congeals out of the quantum noise of the infinite overlapping
<br>
universes that exist, according to Many Worlds quantum theory, jammed
<br>
together all around us, unseen but not without their impact upon us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what you do to create this wonderful machine.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a printer driven by, or coupled to, a true quantum randomizer (a
<br>
radioactive isotope emitting purely random electrical noise, for example).
<br>
This becomes, in effect, a quantum die--and such dice have their equivalent
<br>
in every universe that is henceforth entangled with our own.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start by generating a random alphanumeric list of a million characters,
<br>
each chosen by a throw of the quantum die. A very simple program does that
<br>
easily.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were written in an appropriate code, the listed output from this
<br>
process would be a computer program able to run on the computer sitting in
<br>
front of you. Here, now, is the key step: at the end of the space reserved
<br>
for the alphanumeric gibberish, add a clear instruction for the program to
<br>
locate you in superspace and get in touch with you as soon as possible.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most of the stacked-up, entangled universes, this randomly generated
<br>
`program' will be nothing but junk mail. In some, it will contain the
<br>
entire text of Hamlet, in others it will read out as a macabre cookbook for
<br>
making scones from worms; in a few, the words it contains will be so
<br>
piercingly poignant that the version of you reading them will weep and vow
<br>
to change your life for the better.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in at least one superposition, we might hope--if such an outcome is
<br>
mathematically and computationally not impossible--the jumble of utterly
<br>
arbitrary letters and numerals will comprise, by pure chance, a valid AI
<br>
program suitable for the computer at hand (either a standard desktop, or a
<br>
military intelligence hypercomputer, depending on who is initiating this
<br>
stunt).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, your computer tries to compile and run code in every superposed
<br>
universe. In most, the pseudo-code--the noise, the copy of Hamlet--just
<br>
sits there on the hard drive or disk doing nothing. In a few, it might be
<br>
destroyed by a giant meteorite impact, or eaten by the dog.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in at least one superposed cosmos, the AI program runs, wakes up--and
<br>
dutifully calls home. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls every home, presumably.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be Friendly? Almost certainly not. (Not that it would necessarily
<br>
be *unfriendly*, mind you.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will someone do this experiment anyway? If it's doable, surely.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the AI sit there--before or instead of calling `home'--and bootstrap
<br>
itself up to godhood? Well, hell, I would.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could happen any day now.
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
<p>The objections and my responses: 
<br>
<p>1)	&gt;You could try running your machine over and over again until the cows
<br>
come home, or the big crunch occurs. Or am I missing your point somehow?
<br>
<p>I think so. It depends on how smart the self-bootstrapping code becomes.
<br>
The key to success is the bit at the end of the program, which is an
<br>
injunction (or politely phrased quid-pro-quo request) for the new AI to
<br>
find a way to phone home with the news and then to do so.
<br>
<p>2)	&gt;What do you mean &quot;find a way to phone home&quot;?  You mean to communicate
<br>
with the &quot;other branches&quot; of the wave-function?  
<br>
<p>Just so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unfortunately, this does not appear to be possible, in general. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but this is just *our* current understanding of QT, which is
<br>
acknowledged to be incomplete. The possibility entwined in my little notion
<br>
is that the randomly-generated AI will quickly Spike itself into
<br>
hyperintelligence and find a way to do it by hook or by crook. On the other
<br>
hand, the fact that it hasn't spontaneously happened already makes it look
<br>
as if it's never going to--unless in those worlds, and only those, that
<br>
remain tightly entangled with the initiating project, wherever someone
<br>
tries it.
