<p>
If the &quot;many worlds&quot; hypothesis is true, and if transhuman AI is
<br>
possible, then the experiment proposed by Damien Broderick has
<br>
some powerful and disquieting implications even if communication
<br>
between quantum parallel universes is absolutely impossible.
<br>
<p>Suppose one sets up the experimental apparatus and presses
<br>
&quot;enter&quot; to start the process. Branching out from this moment will
<br>
be universes containing *every possible* one-megabyte ASCII text,
<br>
including every possible program source code of size 1 MB or less
<br>
capable of being processed by your compiler of choice.
<br>
<p>As Broderick notes, the outcome will be innocuous in most of the 
<br>
universes arising from the experiment, with the compiler
<br>
complaining that the text is not proper source code. In a small
<br>
proportion of universes, the text will be acceptable source code
<br>
resulting in a relatively uninteresting program (say, one that
<br>
prints &quot;the answer is 42&quot; and terminates).
<br>
<p>And, in a more-than-astronomically small percentage of the
<br>
outcome universes, the compiler will spit out a working seed AI.
<br>
<p>At first, this struck me as a good thing. Just by running this
<br>
seemingly bland experiment at, say, noon, one could guarantee
<br>
that at least one parallel Earth (an endlessly proliferating
<br>
cluster of Earths, actually) would be entering a Singularity
<br>
under the protection of a Transition Guide by supper time. I
<br>
briefly considered suggesting that Eliezer add the Broderick
<br>
experiment to the list of last-ditch options in the &quot;If nanotech
<br>
comes first&quot; section of PtS.
<br>
<p>Then, however, I recalled that some of the seed-AI programs
<br>
generated by the experiment would be other than Friendly. Indeed,
<br>
in some worlds, the source code automatically generated in a
<br>
single pass by the quantum randomizer and then immediately put
<br>
through the compiler would be such that, if supervised by human
<br>
programmers, it would probably have been recognized as
<br>
dangerously flawed and fixed before being fully implemented (or
<br>
never have been deliberately written in the first place). The
<br>
more initially-subtle forms of unfriendly AI would also be
<br>
brought into being, somewhere in the multiverse.
<br>
<p>Some of the non-Friendly AIs would be severely hostile. Outcomes
<br>
worse than a gray-goo wipeout would occur. A set of Earths (and
<br>
perhaps much of the rest of the universes in which those Earths
<br>
resided) would end up as &quot;hell polises&quot; (see the discussion of
<br>
this concept in the &quot;Sysop scenario&quot; section of CFAI).
<br>
<p>Thus (unless there are some limits to the validity of the many-
<br>
worlds hypothesis, or transhuman AI is impossible, or the minimum
<br>
source-code size for a seed AI capable of going transhuman
<br>
exceeds 1 MB), this experiment would bring into existence both
<br>
paradises and nightmare worlds--heavens and hells.
<br>
<p>And if it turns out that transhuman AIs *can* communicate across
<br>
parallel worlds after all? You'd better hope that a nice one gets
<br>
to you before a nasty one does. (And it might not be easy to tell
<br>
which is which.)
<br>
<p>Caution seems advisable.
