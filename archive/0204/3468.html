<p>
Right, Evan, that is the issue. Even the governing AI's that are the SysOp's
<br>
for the upload &quot;polis&quot; domains in DIASPORA are not qualitatively different
<br>
in intelligence from the upload-minds inhabiting those polises (at least, so
<br>
far as I can tell).
<br>
<p>If Egan believes what his characters say in his latest book (as quoted by
<br>
Damien B.) then apparently Egan views general intelligence as a process that
<br>
can be speeded up and given more data processing resources without becoming
<br>
qualitatively different. In this view, there will *not* be any emergent
<br>
phenomena from faster thought processes that have denser data resources
<br>
which could accurately by termed &quot;superintelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>No superintelligence, no Singularity.
<br>
<p>I certainly disagree with that view. It seems to me that Nature shows many
<br>
examples of complex systems exhibiting new behaviors that one would not
<br>
expect by a simple analysis of their component parts/subsystems. I believe
<br>
this will probably also be true of superhuman levels of intelligence.

<p>That's true; but he doesn't even refer to them as being off stage.  I think
<br>
that's the issue.
