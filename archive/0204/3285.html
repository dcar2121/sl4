</em><br>
<p>True.  There are a *lot* of ideas about AI, and I don't have time to listen
<br>
to all of them.  You have a very short time to catch someone's attention if
<br>
you want to talk to them about a new approach to AI - a principle that I
<br>
follow in my own work as well, of course.  Please understand that there is a
<br>
failed-classical-AI generation schema embedded in the minds of most
<br>
programmers; programmers are trained to think through how to solve a problem
<br>
and translate these thoughts into code, and this is sometimes confusion
<br>
between this and the task of building a system that can give rise to
<br>
thoughts on its own.  I tend to filter out those ideas very quickly.
<br>
<p>I suspect there is true of most other AI researchers as well.  I'm just more
<br>
willing to run the risk of offending someone in order to explain it openly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You've already made clear that you don't believe in making an effort
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you convince me now otherwise - my decision has been made that it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; my conversation in private with Ben.
</em><br>
<p>Good luck, but while I can't speak for Ben, my advice to you would be not to
<br>
take his attention for granted - he's doing you a favor if he listens to
<br>
your ideas, you're not doing him a favor by sharing them.  Same rule as for
<br>
writer submitting their stories to editors, or for that matter writers
<br>
sharing their stories with an audience.  My AI ideas are, in my humble
<br>
opinion, brilliant, but everyone (including complete amateurs) who takes the
<br>
time to read one of my pages is still doing me a favor, not the other way
<br>
around.  Even so I don't always have time to return the favor, unless
<br>
something really catches my attention.
