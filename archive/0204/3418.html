<p>
It's a capital mistake to confuse a writer with the fiction, let alone one
<br>
character in a cast. Still this is a provocative passage in SCHILD'S
<br>
LADDER. I'm still reading the book, so for all I know there's a fullblown
<br>
Spike before the end, but I was struck by how Egan's moderately posthuman
<br>
figures are placed 20,000 years hence with no mention of anyone having
<br>
Sublimed. Then on p.55 [UK edition]:
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>`What do you think you're going to find in there [a new region of altered
<br>
spacetime]? Some great shining light of transcendence?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Hardly.' _Transcendence_ was a content-free word left over from religion,
<br>
but in some moribund planetary cultures it had come to refer to a mythical
<br>
process of mental restructuring that would result in vastly greater
<br>
intelligence and a boundless cornucopia of hazy superpowers--if only the
<br>
details could be perfected, preferably by someone else. It was probably an
<br>
appealing notion if you were so lazy that you'd never actually learnt
<br>
anything about the universe you inhabited, and couldn't quite conceive of
<br>
putting in the effort to do so; this magical cargo of transmogrification
<br>
was sure to come along eventually and render the need superfluous.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tchicaya said, `I already possess general intelligence, thanks. I don't
<br>
need anything more.' It was a rigorous result in information theory that
<br>
once you learn in a sufficiently flexible manner--something humanity had
<br>
achieved in the Bronze Age--the only limits you faced were speed and
<br>
storage; all other structural changes were just a matter of style.
