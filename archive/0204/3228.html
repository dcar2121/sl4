<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how sometimes when you wake up from a dream, and right on the edge
<br>
of your mind is THE ANSWER and then it just slips away?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We were in Ocean City last week, and on the board walk there was an arcade.
<br>
I hadn't been to one for a while.  There was the usual multi-player racing
<br>
games and other &quot;ride ons&quot; with super large screens and shifting seats.
<br>
Blaring action music.  I was surprised to see games with motion sensors on them
<br>
to let your game characters mimic your own ducking and weaving.  Beyond that,
<br>
there was a dark corner leading to an unoccupied walkway.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tron! Ms PacMan! Space Invaders, and Tempest, and Centipede!  I recalled many
<br>
summer mornings, our usual gang walking to the arcade, trying to get to the
<br>
barracks along the way before that old Korean guy on his bike.  The soldiers
<br>
rarely returned their beer cans and bottles, and some of them were worth a
<br>
nickel deposit each.  That was before Mike got his TI99/4A.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I put a quarter into Tron.  The stupid twister would only go clockwise,
<br>
but I fought my way into the MCP cone.  I blocked the lightcycle in with the
<br>
old question mark loop.  When I got my TRS80 Color Computer, the first game I
<br>
wrote was Tron lightcycles.  I wish I still had that computer.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried Space Invaders.  Never liked it, even as a kid.  I watched my laser
<br>
beam _crawl_ up the screen, as my turret barely moved left and right along the
<br>
bottom under its shields.  I walked away without even seeing if I hit anything.
<br>
That's when I thought about this mailing list and I had the strange feeling
<br>
that I had just missed something obvious.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been trying to recover that feeling.  The best I can come up with is a
<br>
mix of &quot;how do we know we're not in the spike right now&quot;, &quot;would we recognize
<br>
it&quot;, and mostly &quot;wasted time, we could be so far beyond this already&quot;.  My kids
<br>
take raging 3D graphics and stereo sound as standard.  I remember seeing my
<br>
first computer (a PDP11 or something like it) in 5th grade and thinking &quot;this
<br>
is stupid&quot;.  Never dreamed I would be a hacker.  People always take what they
<br>
already have as a given, and are looking around for more.  If the spike is
<br>
exponential, will the curve ahead of us always make our local section look
<br>
flat?  How will we know when we've entered and passed &quot;the spike&quot;?  Radical
<br>
change in a single lifetime?  My grandparents already had that.  Radical change
<br>
in a time period _much less_ than a lifetime?  The end of death?  AI in a
<br>
bottle?  Nanotech?  I hope my kids look back and write all of that off as
<br>
child's play, like Pong on an Atari.  Cool for its day but just the beginning.
<br>
I guess I'll know it when I see it.  Or it will always be the carrot ahead of
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But that wasn't quite what I was thinking of next to Space Invaders.  I
<br>
thought composing this email would help, but it didn't.  I got closer with the
<br>
subject line than the body.  I should have dreamed on a little more before
<br>
walking over to play Tempest.
