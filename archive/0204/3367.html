A quote from staring into the singularity.
<br>
<p>Don't go Utopian.
<br>
<p>Another quote
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that there isn't fun in this life.  There is.  But any amount of sorrow is unacceptable.  
<br>
<p>This implies that there won't be any suffering and death after the singularity. Which I view as a Utopian view. I have definately got the impression that you believe that death will cease after the singularity.
<br>
<p>Is there any where on the web a visual view of the structure of the seed ai, it is very close to some of my ideas, and I tend to impose some of the things that I am thinking about into the seed AI.
<br>
<p>Quick statement about the difference between AI and IA. An IA system's goal is to please the user. An AI has a preprogrammed goal be it friendly or otherwise. IA can be seen as a specific variant of AI so the technologies are very similar. 
<br>
<p>I see IA systems possibly being embeded in humans with good communication links between individuals and this with genetic alterations to stop the individuals being selfish, becoming an SI. 
<br>
<p>I think that is the bare bones of what I believe will happen. 
<br>
<p>Are my messages HTML? I have no control on this account.
<br>
