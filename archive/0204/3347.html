Now, I think we're finally getting to the heart of things.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20Why%20bother%20(was%20Re:%20Introducing%20myself)">ben@goertzel.org</a>&gt;
<br>
Subject: RE: Why bother (was Re: Introducing myself)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is one justification for the belief that &quot;working toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is important.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(t) = the probability that, during year t, some nutcase will wipe out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human race via biological terrorism or some other means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You estimate that p(t)~=0, with a fairly high subjective confidence
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, no.  After all, the probability of all the air in a room
<br>
gathering itself into one-half the space leaving the rest of the room in
<br>
vacuum is not zero; something on the order of 10 ** - 80 or so.  The odds of
<br>
someone wiping out humanity might be higher than that, it is more difficult
<br>
to quantify than kinetic motion, but I don't take the possibility seriously.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that your confidence is primarily not based on objective factors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And your evaluations are?  What have I been asking for all this time?  If
<br>
you think you have objective factors for your viewpoint then why don't you
<br>
bring them out?  What have I been asking you for all this time?  How many
<br>
times do I need to repeat it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that p(t) increases over time -- a reasonable, though not
</em><br>
certain
<br>
<em>&gt; belief, based on the advent of more &amp; more sophisticated technologies --
</em><br>
<p>I believe the opposite, for the same reason.  You still haven't addressed my
<br>
example of computer viruses that I mentioned in an earlier posting.  By your
<br>
logic, there should be an increasing probability of some computer virus
<br>
wiping out the Internet.  But despite the fact that more people are writing
<br>
them than ever before, and their spread is much easier than it was even 5
<br>
years ago, the damage they do is proportionately less than it was beck when
<br>
Robert Morris sent out his Internet worm.  How do you explain that?
<br>
<p>I explain it by saying that increased technological sophistication allows
<br>
for greater abilities to deal with threats.  Yes, the power of individuals
<br>
to do harm grows, but the power of the system as a whole to respond grows
<br>
faster.  AS long as knowledge about these threats - including nanotech,
<br>
biotech, software etc. - is not bottled up, then I do not see why the same
<br>
logic should not apply to these threats as it does to that of viruses.
<br>
<p>If you have reasons why it shouldn't, then by all means let's discuss them.
<br>
I really want to hear them.
