<p>This is a lot smaller issue than you might think.  SL4 has a clearly 
<br>
specified purpose which excludes chit-chat and discussing issues again 
<br>
and again.  Other lists allow for discussion of other topics and a more 
<br>
casual setting.  Actually, more lists are probably good for everyone, 
<br>
because it gives persons a place to be casual, thus reducing the amount 
<br>
of inappropriate posts on SL4.
<br>
<p>Also, remember that SL4 started as a split from the Extropians and has 
<br>
done quite well and explored several interesting topics.  VCs, IIRC, 
<br>
have something like a 1/20 success rate:  for every 20 businesses they 
<br>
invest in, only about 1 ever makes any money.  Mailing lists are just 
<br>
like that.  Lots of people create different mailing lists for different 
<br>
purposes, and every now and then a new lists comes along the facilitates 
<br>
the discussion of new, important ideas.  I created a mailing list a few 
<br>
months back that died for numerous reasons.  I know why it died and if I 
<br>
had the time I'd probably rework it some to get some meaningful 
<br>
discussion going on it.  Hopefully I'll have time in a couple of weeks 
<br>
to do more writing and work on Singularity related things, but at the 
<br>
moment I just can't.
<br>
<p>At any rate, there's not cause for alarm.  There is always membership 
<br>
crossover between lists and powerful memes tend to propagate between 
<br>
lists.
