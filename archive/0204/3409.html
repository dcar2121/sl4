Eli paraphrased me:
<br>
<em>&gt; BEN GOERTZEL:  Don't worry, Cole!  As a mathematician, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assure you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have absolutely no idea whether this experiment will really destroy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world or condemn a vast number of sentient beings to eternal hell.  So as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can see there's no reason why we should take this matter seriously.
</em><br>
<p>I also have absolutely no idea whether, the next time I fart, it will
<br>
accidentally cause a multi-universe-wide cataclysm, eliminating 1999 billion
<br>
forms of sentient life withoutme even notice it, as a results of laws of
<br>
trans-universal physics that are currently unknown to me....
<br>
<p>Damn, better lay off those pinto beans!!!
<br>
<p>I consider the danger of building an unfriendly AI that annihilates humanity
<br>
to be fairly palpable.  It seems very likely that physical law permits this
<br>
(though there's the off chance of physical limits on intelligent that we
<br>
don't understand yet).  It seems likely to me that humans will create a
<br>
superhuman AI, if not within the next decade, then at very least within the
<br>
next century.  Unfortunately, guaranteeing Friendliness to within a
<br>
reasonable degree of probability seems to me to be a MUCH harder problem
<br>
than constructing the AI in the first place (although the latter is also a
<br>
very very hard problem, of course).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the danger of annihilating the universe via
<br>
multiple-quantum-universe phenomena certainly can't be called ZERO -- and
<br>
I'd definitely place it above the probability of the above-mentioned
<br>
multi-universal fart-triggered fiasco -- but all in all it's an idea that
<br>
relies on very shaky parts of contemporary science, and so I'm not going to
<br>
spend too much time worrying about it or thinking about how to prevent it.
<br>
<p>After all, this universe we all think we're living COULD just be a highly
<br>
advanced virtual reality simulation, right?  The six-eyed alien running the
<br>
simulation could turn it off at any moment, or change the channel....
<br>
<p>When a posited hypothesis strikes me as LESS LIKELY than the &quot;we're all
<br>
brains in a vat being neurally stimulated with a VR reality&quot; hypothesis, I
<br>
tend to turn my attention elsewhere ;&gt;
<br>
<p>So I guess I'll go ahead and have those beans after all...
<br>
<p>And no doubt, the posited idea could form the heart of a funky science
<br>
fiction tale...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
