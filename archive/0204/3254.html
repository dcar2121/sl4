</em><br>
<p>the fact that evolution can be conceptualized as a hierarchically goal-oriented process with maximizing reproduction as the supergoal does not imply that human beings, who are _products_ of the evolutionary process, must have a hierarchically goal-oriented _mental_ architecture.  in fact, the evidence seems to point to the contrary.
<br>
<p>in any case, to categorically extrapolate knowledge about evolved minds (i.e., human beings) for intuition about designed minds (i.e., seed ai) is to fall into the trap of anthropomorphism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Humans who don't do this die out and their genes don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propagate, thus humans who lack this skill die out.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Considering that, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is probably worthwhile to find a way to ensure that violating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendliness causes the AI to 'die' in case such an FoF occurs.  If this 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;remember so much of it.  It may not be clear how to do this right now, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it seems worth at least thinking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>again, this is basically modeled verbatim on the evolutionary process that produced human beings.  since unlike human beings, the ai would be self-modifying and increasingly intelligent, this would seem a sure-fire way to guarantee that the ai thus produced would side-step friendliness and acquire a survival instinct.  after all, survival would be its de facto supergoal, and if it could not figure _that_ out, it would be of little use to us.
<br>
<p>it seems to me that the spirit of the seed ai concept is to achieve rapport with the ai.  that is, we _do_not_ want to deceive the ai _in_any_way_.
