<em>&gt; &gt; I think that your confidence is primarily not based on objective factors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And your evaluations are?
</em><br>
<p>No, mine are not either.  As I said clearly in a previous post, I think that
<br>
there is not available data to make rational judgments on such things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe the opposite, for the same reason.  You still haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of computer viruses that I mentioned in an earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posting.  By your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic, there should be an increasing probability of some computer virus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiping out the Internet.  But despite the fact that more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them than ever before, and their spread is much easier than it was even 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago, the damage they do is proportionately less than it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beck when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert Morris sent out his Internet worm.  How do you explain that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I explain it by saying that increased technological sophistication allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for greater abilities to deal with threats.  Yes, the power of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do harm grows, but the power of the system as a whole to respond grows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster.  AS long as knowledge about these threats - including nanotech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotech, software etc. - is not bottled up, then I do not see why the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic should not apply to these threats as it does to that of viruses.
</em><br>
<p>I think our ability to rewrite computer systems to defend against threats
<br>
has increased FASTER than our ability to rewrite biological systems to
<br>
defend against threats is likely to.
