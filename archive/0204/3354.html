<p>Ben: I took Eliezer's DGI design intention, to define thoughts ==
<br>
&quot;disposable one-time structures&quot;, as a pragmatic deliniation between
<br>
'ephemeral' vs. 'permanent'.  This 'cut' has to be made somewhere, as saving
<br>
a detailed mind-state for every passing thought is just too expensive.  I
<br>
also have described this border as &quot;a storm of thoughts raging over a sea of
<br>
concepts&quot;... when the storm of thoughts abate, the concepts remain, although
<br>
somewhat mixed and changed.  This is not to say that a thought cannot be
<br>
saved for later retrieval, just that it won't be saved in the same format as
<br>
it normally exists.  Instead it will be encoded as a memory - perhaps as a
<br>
group of related concepts linked to specific imagery.

<p><p>I have to side with Ben on this one.  I frequently find myself engaging an a
<br>
veritable panoply of simultaneous thoughts.  It happens often enough that,
<br>
when opening my mouth to participate in a conversation, I have to pause and
<br>
rein-in the thoughts to a semi-serial format so that I don't sound like a
<br>
schitzophrenic who has forgotten to take his meds.
<br>
<p>For an AI, though, I don't think it will make the slightest difference to
<br>
the end result whether the thoughts are in parallel or serial.  However, the
<br>
most *efficient* &quot;number of simultaneous threads of thought&quot; will vary
<br>
depending on: 1) the hardware implementation architecture, 2) the software
<br>
design and 3) the specific thought.
