<p>
In the humble paranoid delusions of this paranoiac ( oops, sorry about the
<br>
humility ) we have real serious problems.
<br>
<p>1.)  Back when the VIC20 was hot stuff, a secret government project with
<br>
help from BIG BLUE and Prince Marvin cracks the problem of computer
<br>
intelligence.  Hurrah, the singularity has arrived, except there's one
<br>
little problem; it's not friendly.  But they successfully limit it's
<br>
intelligence to something around human and are able to keep it in a box,
<br>
while they try to crack the friendliness problem.  Realizing that soon
<br>
(Moore ) everyone will have a computer in their home that could run AI, and
<br>
an unfriendly unlimited AI would be a bad idea, they come up with a plan.
<br>
The plan is a two pronged approach.  Prong one: make deals with all computer
<br>
producers ( IBM, DEC, CRAY, SPERRY, ECT. ) to ensure operating systems will
<br>
not allow self modifying programs ( a key ingredient in their solution ).
<br>
For that matter lets see if we can get it built into the processor chips.
<br>
Henceforth, programs can only be run from protected memory.  But what about
<br>
all those microcomputers?  There could be hundreds of producers.  What we
<br>
need is an operating system monopoly.  They make a deal with a relatively
<br>
unknown programmer and entrepreneur in Redmond.  Prong two:  Prince Marvin
<br>
guides academic AI research in directions that will delay/hide the real AI
<br>
solution.  And while he is at it, consult on all business attempts.  Telling
<br>
the accountants of such businesses that their approach has already been
<br>
tried and proven impossible in academia, therefore they are wasting their
<br>
money.  If necessary, economic black ops actions against any project that
<br>
could succeed.
<br>
<p>They are probably watching SIAI very closely to see if Eliezer solves the
<br>
FAI problem for them, and to stop him if he gets close to finishing his GAI
<br>
project.  There is probably a mole in SIAI.  You should suspect everyone.
<br>
<p>You understand, I don't have any evidence for any of this.  It's just a
<br>
FEELING.
<br>
<p>I'll go into delusions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 at a later time if you are
<br>
interested.
