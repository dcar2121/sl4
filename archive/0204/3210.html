<p>
Carlo,
<br>
<p>I suggest you read Eliezer's essay CREATING A FRIENDLY AI which is on the
<br>
SingInst website.
<br>
<p>He agrees with you that AI's will be goal-oriented, and discusses the goal
<br>
of Friendliness, as distinct from the goal of creating a smarter AI.
<br>
<p>I don't agree with all he says there, but I think it's an excellent essay
<br>
and will clarify many of the issues you are raising  in your e-mail.
<br>
<p>Once you've read his essay, then you can join the ongoing debate Eliezer and
<br>
I have been having on AI goal structures....  In brief: I think that
<br>
Friendliness has to be one among many goals; he thinks it should be wired in
<br>
as the ultimate supergoal in a would-be real AI.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is correct, I have not given any argument actually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But neither have you.  Nevertheless, all we can argue about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the likelihood and since you already say that you acknowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility - that is enough for me.  Hopefully you agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with me then that staying in control should constantly be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest priority and never we should take a risk that we'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a intelligence greater than ours that might choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminate us.  With this in mind I think that especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first AI must operate in a very controlled environment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we learn more about the goals and desires or &quot;instincts&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the beings we created.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, I do have a little argument to add, but choose to first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post my introductory mail ;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that an Artificial Intelligence will have to be, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, &quot;goal driven&quot;.  Otherwise we can not speak of 'intelligence'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (correct me if I am wrong there).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With &quot;goal driven&quot; I mean that a human seeks satisfaction of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire, by achieving a goal.  Psychologist have divided humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a bunch of groups where it comes to what drives a human being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of them is &quot;security&quot; (without doubt my drive too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example: I seek security - therefore I study, get a job and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of money that I safe and keep on my bank account.  Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wanted security and because was hurt often in normal social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contacts I started an electronics hobby and became a radio pirate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six years of my life my social contact have been anonymously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with only audio as contact - and that has worked for me very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well (I was a popular guy on the radio, unlike at school).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Later I was using IRC and I wanted to chat in a safe environment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I needed security and ONLY because of that drive, I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improved the IRC protocol and as such made it impossible to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over channels anymore (I designed 'ircu', the ircd that is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being used on undernet IRC (when I first went there it had 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; users, now it has 80,000)). etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roughly spoken, the thought process involved in order to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a goal works as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Random generator --filter--&gt; neural network to figure out --&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected result -\
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of actions                 what ones expects to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               \__ comparation --&gt; feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 			     result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             /                      |
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                        ^
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        goal -/                       |
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `---------------------------------------------------------------'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this doesn't work 'discreate', there is no 'clock pulse',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it works like the feedback of an OpAmp (electronics), or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like solving a non-lineair differential equation.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what our brain is very good at: solving non-lineair equations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the above is VERY incomplete and not the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of discussion.  I just try to make a point here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If an AI will work in this way, and the 'goal' we set it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be to build an even faster brain, then what will happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it considers being terminated prematurely?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would immedeately conclude that if its existence would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end then it would *certainly* not be able to achieve its goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, independant of the goal is has, it will consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surviving to be the highest priority and might chose to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most time into securing of its own continuation.
