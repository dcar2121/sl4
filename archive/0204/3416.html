</em><br>
<p>In this world, I've been off-line for two days while unimelb washed their
<br>
computer or something. Having now got back in touch with the real world,
<br>
it's been amusing watching everyone here recapitulate the lines of thought
<br>
that James and I ran through in about 10 minutes over sushi.
<br>
<p>I do think that by now we should have been contacted, since a primitive
<br>
version has been tried (ineffectively in this branch, but arguably some
<br>
other versions might have been subtly superior). I should add, for anyone
<br>
wo failed to read between the lines of the first post, that I deliberately
<br>
masked some of the details in my earlier post. 
<br>
<p>The thing to remember, if I understand this correctly myself, is that, in
<br>
MW QT, branching in such cases sets out from *here and now*. Entanglement
<br>
needs to be retained. The Copernican assumption does not mean that
<br>
*anything* can follow from the state I'm in right now; only those events
<br>
that are consistent with my present history will occur (well, except for
<br>
some remotely unlikely tunneling effects).
<br>
<p>Is it unconscionable to try such an experiment because it seems bound to
<br>
yield at least some proportion of hellish worlds? Forget Ben's cosmolethal
<br>
farts, this applies just as readily to Eliezer sitting in his room
<br>
thinking. In some quantum superpositions, evil programs emerge from his
<br>
meditations and slip past his guard, or subvert him entirely and generate
<br>
his evil twin. In others, despite the purity of his soul evil programs
<br>
result from an unnoticed coding error as his fingers slip on the keyboard.
<br>
In yet others, a bitflip does it. Still, the prospect of Bad Gods being
<br>
built is certainly one reason why I've delayed doing anything along these
<br>
lines myself. I'm hoping for a suitable ai theodicy to emerge from
<br>
discussions like this one; thanks to everyone for playing. (And my
<br>
justification for clogging up the list with it is that the issues do seem
<br>
to be somewhat related to ai creation by, coff coff, conventional means.)
