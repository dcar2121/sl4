<em>&gt; Anyway - I don't believe you believe that.  Naturally all humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically the same and we (you and I) experience and 'feel' the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That I consider an axioma :/
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is right.
<br>
<p>I think males and females each have lots of experiences that those of
<br>
opposite sex can never have, for example.
<br>
<p>And, to take another example, there are joys involved in improvising music
<br>
that many people will never know...
<br>
<p>Nietzsche said, though, that if you look at a set of things through a
<br>
sufficiently coarse lense, they will look the same ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What it comes down to is, at times the human urge for sex seems rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncorrelated from the human urge for pleasure....  People will seek sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sometimes, even when greater amounts of pleasure would likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be achieved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But not as a result of being hardwired to seek sex.  The actions needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to start having sex (including social contacts) are WAY to complex to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something hardwired.
</em><br>
<p>I guess perhaps we are not using the word &quot;hardwired&quot; in the same way.
<br>
<p>Of course, the details of sex-seeking behavior are not hard-wired.  But the
<br>
*goal* of sex-seeking is (although this wiring can be modified too, it's not
<br>
*completely* rigid &amp; unmodifiable).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I tried to point out is that when we feel something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pleasure&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;happiness&quot; then what actually is happening that the path that our neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just took are strengthened, and it will be more likely that we will do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same again next time.  That &quot;pleasure&quot; in itself is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex and multi-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimensional feedback wasn't relevant imho;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's relevant if &quot;sexual pleasure&quot; is hardwired as a particular
<br>
component of &quot;pleasure&quot;, isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just a question... isn't it more logical to first write an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is as smart as a mouse or something stupid like that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A lot of people are taking that approach.  See for instance Rodney Brooks'
<br>
well-known work on subsumption robotics.  I don't think it's a stupid
<br>
approach.  I cosupervised a PhD student once, who built a neural net
<br>
simulation of a cockroach brain.  But nor do I think it's an optimal
<br>
approach.
<br>
<p>The reason I don't think the approach is optimal is: Creating perceptual and
<br>
motor systems comparable to those of a mouse or even a cockroach is very
<br>
hard for engineers right now.  Thus I think it's easier to create an AI
<br>
system whose percepts and actions occur in the Internet, a virtual domain.
<br>
This may produce preliminary versions that are less intelligent than humans,
<br>
but, they will very different from mice or cockroaches (and comparing their
<br>
intelligence to that of mice or cockroaches will be hard -- after all, it's
<br>
even hard to say whether a cockroach or Deep Blue is more intelligent,
<br>
really...).
