<p>We agree.  It's just not clear that we do because of some of my 
<br>
assumptions I lay behind terms.
<br>
<p>By brain I am talking about the physical thing the brain.  It is a 
<br>
complex system similar to that in any other animal.  It allows for a 
<br>
wide variety of responses and even the ability to create new responses, 
<br>
but does not do logical reasoning or other things that did not evolve 
<br>
into humans.  It's an advanced tool for making sure our genes propagate.
<br>
<p>By mind I refer to the adaptive part of your brain that is capable of 
<br>
logical reasoning and other learned techniques that were discovered, 
<br>
driven by the brain's interpreter (i.e. the part of your brain that is 
<br>
`you').
<br>
<p>So, when I say that something like suicide is decided by the mind, I 
<br>
mean it has to be an act of reason where the mind is able to override 
<br>
what the brain wants.  Of course, if your brain is not normative, 
<br>
getting your brain to do what your mind wants may be easier or harder 
<br>
(most likely it will be easier).
<br>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong guys, but based on this terminology, here is the 
<br>
difference between what Eliezer and Ben think.  Eliezer claims that an 
<br>
AI needs a brain that has the goal of Friendliness on top, hard coded 
<br>
into place (with the usual exception that the spirit of Friendliness is 
<br>
what is hard coded, not the letter of what Friendliness means).  Ben, 
<br>
though, thinks that the brain just takes care of very basic stuff and 
<br>
the mind picks the goals.  Or, more accurately, there is an extra goal 
<br>
layer between brain and mind and this goal layer decides what the mind 
<br>
can and cannot tell the brain to do, rather than having the brain do its 
<br>
own mind take-over protection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS2 I have been suicidal several times in the past, so I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    first hand experienced how hard it is to take ones life, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    why I didn't do it.  And of course, why I shouldn't do it ;).
</em><br>
<p>FWIW, I have OCD and on a regular basis part of my brain decides that 
<br>
suicide is a good way to get clean but a deeper part of my brain says no 
<br>
and stops it.  Of course, this isn't the kind of suicide that is 
<br>
generally discussed.  While my action would be suicide, it would be 
<br>
caused because my brain was wired wrong not because I didn't feel like 
<br>
living.  In fact, because I feel like living both deep in my brain and 
<br>
in my mind, I'm able to suppress that urge.  So, anyway, if you ever 
<br>
hear that I committed suicide (and I have no plans on doing this), it 
<br>
was because one too many bits flipped in my brain that day, rather than 
<br>
that I decided that living was not for me.  I figure, though, that if I 
<br>
have managed to not do this in the past 19 years, I should be able to 
<br>
continue not doing so long as I stay away from things that change how my 
<br>
brain works.
<br>
<p>Also, I'm noticing that a growing number of people on this list have 
<br>
abnormal brains.  I think it may just seem like an exaggerated number of 
<br>
us are here, though, because it is relevant to cite personal examples 
<br>
where we have learned how a normative human brain works from our 
<br>
abnormal brains.  Most people have no idea I have OCD until they ask why 
<br>
I was washing my hands for five minutes or notice that I am very careful 
<br>
not to step on the cracks on the side walk.  ;-)
