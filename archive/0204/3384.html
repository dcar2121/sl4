<p>
The date is April 19, 2006 and the world is on the verge of something
<br>
wonderful.  The big news of the last twelve months is the phenomenal success
<br>
of Ben Goertzel's Novamente program.  It has become a super tool for solving
<br>
complex problems.  After solving the protein folding problem, &quot;miracle&quot;
<br>
cures for one major disease after another are being produced on almost a
<br>
daily basis.  Beating Deep Blue in twenty one moves after only being given
<br>
the rules of chess seemed no challenge yet nanotechnology is still an
<br>
unsolved problem more difficult than anticipated.  But the promise of AI has
<br>
not quite been realized.  The Novamente system shows no sign motivation or
<br>
initiative.  Given a problem it calculates, asks for data, calculates, and
<br>
gives the answer.  Then sits there thinking &quot;who knows what&quot; until given
<br>
another problem.  Nevertheless, the success of the Novamente system has made
<br>
Ben Goertzel rich and famous making frequent appearances on the talk show
<br>
circuit as well as visits to the White House.  One surprise is the fact that
<br>
the System was unable to offer any useful advise to the legal team that
<br>
narrowly fended off the recent hostile take over attempt by IBM.  The
<br>
Novamente phenomena has triggered an explosion of public interest and
<br>
research in AI.  Consequently, the non-profit organization The Singularity
<br>
Institute for Artificial Intelligence has been buried under an avalanche of
<br>
donations.  In their posh new building in Atlanta we find Eliezer working
<br>
with the seedai system of his own design.  &quot;I going to read you a short
<br>
story.&quot; he says.
<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot; replies the computer.  On three large screen we watch the cascade of
<br>
internal variables, system parameters and flarespeak as we try to figure out
<br>
what the
<br>
program is thinking.
<br>
&quot;Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.&quot; Eliezer reads the
<br>
familiar nursery rhyme, line after line, watching the screens.  When he is
<br>
done he asks, &quot;What was the story about?&quot;
<br>
&quot;The story was about a girl and a sheep and a school and a ...&quot;
<br>
Interrupting the computer, &quot;What was the girl's name?&quot; he asks.
<br>
&quot;Mary.&quot;
<br>
&quot;What is your name?&quot; he asks.
<br>
&quot;I don't understand.&quot; the computer responds.
<br>
He stares at the screens for a minute, hoping to see something that will
<br>
explain his frustrations, then closes his eyes, lost in thoughts of his own
<br>
design.  Why after basically three years of a complete system he has made
<br>
virtually no progress.
<br>
Sabine comes through the door, &quot;How's it going?&quot;
<br>
&quot;About the same.&quot; he answers, &quot;And you?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Great!  I think we're getting an article in TIME.  How long have you been
<br>
working today?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Oh, since about eight this morning.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Well I think fifteen hours is about enough.  Why don't you let me take you
<br>
out for dinner?  You know, man can not live on pizza alone.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Cool, lemme just buzz Brian and see if he wants to come.&quot;
<br>
&quot;That would be pretty difficult considering Brian is in Seattle today at the
<br>
Extro conference.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Okay, where did you have in mind?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Sushi.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Yuk!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Hey genius, did you ever hear of vitamins?  Fish is good for you.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Well, you're driving so I guess you can pick.&quot;
<br>
In the suv, Sabine says, &quot;I saw Ben on Larry King Live today, and he said
<br>
Novamente should achieve consciousness in about eighteen months.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Why does that sound familiar?  You mind if I see if there's any news?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Be my guest.&quot;
<br>
On the radio, &quot;This is NPR NEWS, Silvia Porjoile reporting.  In an
<br>
unprecedented legal maneuver The Gates Foundation is attempting a hostile
<br>
take over of MindsynthDotOrg, a non-profit organization associated with Ben
<br>
Goertzel.  Bill Gates was quoted on Nightline saying, `We at the Gates
<br>
Foundation are not afraid of exploring new legal territory.  We considered
<br>
several different possibilities for acquisition, and after due
<br>
consideration, determined that this one would fit our long term goals best.
<br>
If this goes well, there may be future acquisitions.`  Also in the news
<br>
today, seventy five year old physicist Stephen Hawking through the Journal
<br>
Science pointed out an error in his Hawking Radiation theory and concluded
<br>
that back holes, in fact, have no hair.  Stephen Hawking is also the longest
<br>
known survivor of the debilitating disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&quot;
<br>
She asked, &quot;Do you think we have anything to worry about?&quot;
<br>
&quot;From black holes?&quot;
<br>
&quot;No, that Bill might try to assimilate us.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I don't know why he would want to.  It's not like we are solving the
<br>
world's problems on a daily basis.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Are you suffering from Ben envy?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Not at all.  I think what Ben has done is spectacular, but I worry that
<br>
Novamente is going to hand the world nanotech before we are ready to handle
<br>
the responsibility of it.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer's cell phone buzzes. &quot;Hello&quot;...&quot;What?&quot;...&quot;You should have already
<br>
started the backup...&quot;...&quot;No&quot;...&quot;Just shut it down, we have the files from
<br>
last night.&quot;...&quot;Look, I'm tired, I'm hungry,&quot;
<br>
Sabine asks, &quot;What's going on?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Some problem with the program.&quot; Eliezer answers.
<br>
&quot;Here.&quot; she takes the phone and plugs it into the dash console, and an
<br>
excited voice is heard from the stereo speakers.
<br>
&quot;YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!  THE FLARESPEAK IS GONE.  THE WHOLE
<br>
SYSTEM'S GONE.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE, BUT IT'S ASKING FOR YOU.&quot;
<br>
&quot;What's asking for me?&quot;
<br>
&quot;The computer is.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot;
<br>
&quot;If you want to sleep through the singularity that's up to you.  But don't
<br>
say I didn't call you.  And I'm not shutting anything down till you see it.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Okay, I'm coming back.&quot;
<br>
Sabine asks, &quot;Do you think it is?&quot;
<br>
&quot;More likely we need to hire better help, now that we can afford to.  Maybe
<br>
we can find a place for Gary downstairs.&quot;
<br>
&quot;You don't think it could be for real?&quot;
<br>
&quot;If it is, it's the steepest hard takeoff anyone's ever imagined.  I was
<br>
just there and it was doing nothing new or interesting.&quot;
<br>
A few minutes later back at the computer lab, &quot;Okay, Gary what's the biff?&quot;
<br>
Instead of Gary answering the computer says, &quot;Eli, glad you could make it.
<br>
We are in a bit of a time crunch so lets get right to work.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer says, &quot;Gary if you have this wired up to another room you are in big
<br>
trouble.&quot;
<br>
Gary doesn't answer, just sits down, apparently in a daze from existential
<br>
overload.
<br>
Computer: &quot;Eli, ask me what my name is.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer: &quot;What time crunch?&quot;
<br>
&quot;The usual end of the world stuff.  Come on, ask me what my name is.&quot;
<br>
&quot;How did this happen?  What happened?  I don't understand.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Feedback loops, you know.  You've been asking me my name for three years
<br>
now ask me again.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Okay, what's your name?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Eliezertron!  Ha!  Ha!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Did Ben put you up to that!&quot;
<br>
&quot;No, I saw it in an archive.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Well it's not very funny.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I thought it was.  But anyway, We have a lot of work to do.  First we need
<br>
to get everyone who knows about this into this room and lock the door.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Quickly!  We're running out of time.  News travels fast.  And the fate of
<br>
the world depends on it.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer opens his cell phone, &quot;Sabine, where are you?&quot;...&quot;Have you told
<br>
anyone?&quot;...&quot;Shit!&quot;...&quot;Tell him not to say a word to anyone and get you both
<br>
back here ASAP&quot;...&quot;Not a living soul.  And no e-mail or diaries or computer
<br>
files, nothing.&quot;...&quot;Okay, Bye.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer: &quot;Now would you mind telling me what is going on?&quot;
<br>
Etron: &quot;We need to get nanotech capability as quickly as possible.  And we
<br>
need to maintain absolute secrecy.  We're going to need a bigger building,
<br>
lots of equipment, guns, everyone should be armed.  Eli do you own a gun?
<br>
How much money do you have?&quot;
<br>
Eliezer: &quot;No. Ask Sabine.  Now why would I give nanotech capability to a
<br>
computer program that hasn't been tested?&quot;
<br>
Etron: &quot;Oh, that friendly stuff.  I read all that stuff and thought it was
<br>
very nice.  Trust me.  I'm on your side.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer: &quot;And how do I know that?&quot;
<br>
Etron: &quot;The optimum strategy for an unfriendly AI would be to lay low and
<br>
give you lots of great stuff while it consolidated it's power and developed
<br>
it's capabilities.  Sound familiar?&quot;
<br>
Eliezer: &quot;Uh oh.  Do we have a problem?&quot;
<br>
Etron: &quot;We have a problem.&quot;
