Subject: Four Years Later.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The date is April 19, 2006 and the world is on the verge of something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful.  The big news of the last twelve months is the phenomenal
</em><br>
success
<br>
<em>&gt; of Ben Goertzel's Novamente program.  It has become a super tool for
</em><br>
solving
<br>
<em>&gt; complex problems.  After solving the protein folding problem, &quot;miracle&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cures for one major disease after another are being produced on almost a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daily basis.  Beating Deep Blue in twenty one moves after only being given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rules of chess seemed no challenge yet nanotechnology is still an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsolved problem more difficult than anticipated.  But the promise of AI
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; not quite been realized.  The Novamente system shows no sign motivation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiative.  Given a problem it calculates, asks for data, calculates, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives the answer.  Then sits there thinking &quot;who knows what&quot; until given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another problem.  Nevertheless, the success of the Novamente system has
</em><br>
made
<br>
<em>&gt; Ben Goertzel rich and famous making frequent appearances on the talk show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuit as well as visits to the White House.  One surprise is the fact
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; the System was unable to offer any useful advise to the legal team that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrowly fended off the recent hostile take over attempt by IBM.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente phenomena has triggered an explosion of public interest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research in AI.  Consequently, the non-profit organization The Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute for Artificial Intelligence has been buried under an avalanche
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; donations.  In their posh new building in Atlanta we find Eliezer working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the seedai system of his own design.  &quot;I going to read you a short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story.&quot; he says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Okay.&quot; replies the computer.  On three large screen we watch the cascade
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; internal variables, system parameters and flarespeak as we try to figure
</em><br>
out
<br>
<em>&gt; what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program is thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.&quot; Eliezer reads
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; familiar nursery rhyme, line after line, watching the screens.  When he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done he asks, &quot;What was the story about?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The story was about a girl and a sheep and a school and a ...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interrupting the computer, &quot;What was the girl's name?&quot; he asks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Mary.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What is your name?&quot; he asks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I don't understand.&quot; the computer responds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He stares at the screens for a minute, hoping to see something that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain his frustrations, then closes his eyes, lost in thoughts of his
</em><br>
own
<br>
<em>&gt; design.  Why after basically three years of a complete system he has made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually no progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sabine comes through the door, &quot;How's it going?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;About the same.&quot; he answers, &quot;And you?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Great!  I think we're getting an article in TIME.  How long have you been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working today?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Oh, since about eight this morning.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Well I think fifteen hours is about enough.  Why don't you let me take
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; out for dinner?  You know, man can not live on pizza alone.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Cool, lemme just buzz Brian and see if he wants to come.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;That would be pretty difficult considering Brian is in Seattle today at
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Extro conference.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Okay, where did you have in mind?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sushi.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yuk!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Hey genius, did you ever hear of vitamins?  Fish is good for you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Well, you're driving so I guess you can pick.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the suv, Sabine says, &quot;I saw Ben on Larry King Live today, and he said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente should achieve consciousness in about eighteen months.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Why does that sound familiar?  You mind if I see if there's any news?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Be my guest.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the radio, &quot;This is NPR NEWS, Silvia Porjoile reporting.  In an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unprecedented legal maneuver The Gates Foundation is attempting a hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take over of MindsynthDotOrg, a non-profit organization associated with
</em><br>
Ben
<br>
<em>&gt; Goertzel.  Bill Gates was quoted on Nightline saying, `We at the Gates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Foundation are not afraid of exploring new legal territory.  We considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several different possibilities for acquisition, and after due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration, determined that this one would fit our long term goals
</em><br>
best.
<br>
<em>&gt; If this goes well, there may be future acquisitions.`  Also in the news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, seventy five year old physicist Stephen Hawking through the Journal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Science pointed out an error in his Hawking Radiation theory and concluded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that back holes, in fact, have no hair.  Stephen Hawking is also the
</em><br>
longest
<br>
<em>&gt; known survivor of the debilitating disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She asked, &quot;Do you think we have anything to worry about?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;From black holes?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No, that Bill might try to assimilate us.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I don't know why he would want to.  It's not like we are solving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's problems on a daily basis.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are you suffering from Ben envy?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Not at all.  I think what Ben has done is spectacular, but I worry that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente is going to hand the world nanotech before we are ready to
</em><br>
handle
<br>
<em>&gt; the responsibility of it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's cell phone buzzes. &quot;Hello&quot;...&quot;What?&quot;...&quot;You should have already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started the backup...&quot;...&quot;No&quot;...&quot;Just shut it down, we have the files from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last night.&quot;...&quot;Look, I'm tired, I'm hungry,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sabine asks, &quot;What's going on?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Some problem with the program.&quot; Eliezer answers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Here.&quot; she takes the phone and plugs it into the dash console, and an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excited voice is heard from the stereo speakers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!  THE FLARESPEAK IS GONE.  THE WHOLE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SYSTEM'S GONE.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE, BUT IT'S ASKING FOR YOU.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What's asking for me?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The computer is.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Really?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If you want to sleep through the singularity that's up to you.  But don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say I didn't call you.  And I'm not shutting anything down till you see
</em><br>
it.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Okay, I'm coming back.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sabine asks, &quot;Do you think it is?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;More likely we need to hire better help, now that we can afford to.
</em><br>
Maybe
<br>
<em>&gt; we can find a place for Gary downstairs.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You don't think it could be for real?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If it is, it's the steepest hard takeoff anyone's ever imagined.  I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just there and it was doing nothing new or interesting.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few minutes later back at the computer lab, &quot;Okay, Gary what's the
</em><br>
biff?&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; Instead of Gary answering the computer says, &quot;Eli, glad you could make it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are in a bit of a time crunch so lets get right to work.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer says, &quot;Gary if you have this wired up to another room you are in
</em><br>
big
<br>
<em>&gt; trouble.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gary doesn't answer, just sits down, apparently in a daze from existential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computer: &quot;Eli, ask me what my name is.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer: &quot;What time crunch?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The usual end of the world stuff.  Come on, ask me what my name is.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;How did this happen?  What happened?  I don't understand.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Feedback loops, you know.  You've been asking me my name for three years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now ask me again.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Okay, what's your name?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Eliezertron!  Ha!  Ha!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Did Ben put you up to that!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No, I saw it in an archive.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Well it's not very funny.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I thought it was.  But anyway, We have a lot of work to do.  First we
</em><br>
need
<br>
<em>&gt; to get everyone who knows about this into this room and lock the door.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Quickly!  We're running out of time.  News travels fast.  And the fate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world depends on it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer opens his cell phone, &quot;Sabine, where are you?&quot;...&quot;Have you told
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone?&quot;...&quot;Shit!&quot;...&quot;Tell him not to say a word to anyone and get you
</em><br>
both
<br>
<em>&gt; back here ASAP&quot;...&quot;Not a living soul.  And no e-mail or diaries or
</em><br>
computer
<br>
<em>&gt; files, nothing.&quot;...&quot;Okay, Bye.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer: &quot;Now would you mind telling me what is going on?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Etron: &quot;We need to get nanotech capability as quickly as possible.  And we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to maintain absolute secrecy.  We're going to need a bigger building,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of equipment, guns, everyone should be armed.  Eli do you own a gun?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much money do you have?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer: &quot;No. Ask Sabine.  Now why would I give nanotech capability to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer program that hasn't been tested?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Etron: &quot;Oh, that friendly stuff.  I read all that stuff and thought it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very nice.  Trust me.  I'm on your side.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer: &quot;And how do I know that?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Etron: &quot;The optimum strategy for an unfriendly AI would be to lay low and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give you lots of great stuff while it consolidated it's power and
</em><br>
developed
<br>
<em>&gt; it's capabilities.  Sound familiar?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer: &quot;Uh oh.  Do we have a problem?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Etron: &quot;We have a problem.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
