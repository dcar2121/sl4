<p>The reasons that it is so hard for a human to take
<br>
their own life are:
<br>
<p>1) religion : fear that the action will cause an eternity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is worse than the eternity that would follow a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal death.  Even when one considers the chance that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God exists to be very small, or the act of suicide to have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a negative effect on life after death; the time scale of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternity out weights it.
<br>
2) the irreversibility : after killing oneself, one is very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain about the results for ones own emotional state: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no feelings at all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as long as one doesn't take ones life there is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always the small chance that one will ever live to feel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something positive again, to be happy again (becoming happy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE Goal of Life *).  In terms of goals: you will not reach
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANY other goal but end the feelings of misery, while by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staying alive you might reach any other arbitrary goal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(how ever small the chance to reach it might be).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at any point one might seriously consider
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suicide an option but will always take any opportunity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prolong ones life.
<br>
<p>So unless you mean with 'hard coded' the fact that a humans brain
<br>
is goal driven and the goal is set to becoming happy, I would
<br>
still consider it the act of pure reason not to commit suicide.

PS *) Note that I state that *becoming* happy is the Goal of Life
   rather than BEING happy.  The reason for that is that with
   'Goal of Life' I literally mean the reason to STAY alive.
   In other words: even when one is unhappy, but there is still
   a chance that one will become happy in the future, then there
   is a reason to stay alive.  Any life is worth being lived
   as long as there is yet one more moment of happiness to come.
   The above is something I figured out myself (when I was around
   22?), but it might not be complete - I intend to study Eliezers
   FAQ about the Meaning of Life more closely in regard of this
   because it undoubtly cannot be ignored ;).
PS2 I have been suicidal several times in the past, so I have
   first hand experienced how hard it is to take ones life, and
   why I didn't do it.  And of course, why I shouldn't do it ;).
   One of the traps in life is allowing negative emotions to
   become a state of mind (resulting in chronic depressions).
   This is undoubtly a failure in how the human brain works:
   you always want immedeate results - it is very hard to do
   something that doesn't have immedeate results, or even makes
   things worse at first - even when you know that it is for
   the better on the long run.
