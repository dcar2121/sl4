<p>
<em>&gt; The most straightforward mathematical definition is &quot;brevity of program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size&quot;, but as I state explicitly, another valuable definition is &quot;brevity 
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; runtime&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Not in the stuff I'm reading... maybe one of your other works? Anyway,
<br>
brevity of program size is a special case of brevity of runtime, not the
<br>
other way around. This should become clear shortly...
<br>
***
<br>
I discussed this stuff in The STructure of Intelligence in 1993. I guess I 
<br>
should be more general about it in the Novamente book.
<br>
Neither brevity of prog. size nor brevity of runtime are special cases of 
<br>
each other, actually. Both are special cases of the general notion of 
<br>
&quot;simplicity measure&quot; though.
<br>
***
<br>
<em>&gt; -- similarity defined relative to the knowledge base K defined by the 
</em><br>
system
<br>
<em>&gt; in question
</em><br>
<p>(Not &quot;similarity&quot; defined relative to the knowledge base K - what would 
<br>
that
<br>
mean? - but &quot;similarity&quot; defined relative to a goal-oriented role. That's
<br>
why you need a surrounding AI for the definition to make sense.)
<br>
***
<br>
But a given AI may have many different goals. In each goal, in each 
<br>
context, there may be a different goal &amp; context - dependent similarity 
<br>
measure. This is true. Then the notion of pattern can be applied especially 
<br>
in the context of that goal/context pair.
<br>
***
<br>
I think it makes a big difference, in practice, whether you call what 
<br>
you're
<br>
looking for &quot;simplicity&quot; or &quot;useful complexity&quot;. It makes a big difference
<br>
whether you're looking for a &quot;representation as something simpler&quot; or
<br>
&quot;complexity that renders a problem tractable&quot;. It makes a big difference
<br>
whether you're looking for &quot;similarity&quot;, what I would call a correspondence
<br>
mapping, or for &quot;utility&quot; in a goal context. These concepts may be related
<br>
mathematically but their intuitive surface manifestations are different. So
<br>
psychologically there is a definite difference, one that IMHO shows a 
<br>
strong
<br>
surface correspondence with our respective beliefs about how AI should be
<br>
pursued.
<br>
***
<br>
I disagree, I think you read way too much into a difference in verbiage. 
<br>
The fact that I use a language of &quot;representation&quot; in defining pattern 
<br>
doesn't say anything about the relevanct of goals and contexts to 
<br>
Novamente.
<br>
I settled on that language in 1990 or so and it may say a little more about 
<br>
my frame of mind then than about my frame of mind now, also.
<br>
***
<br>
How can we mathematically define tractability? It will come as no surprise
<br>
to any reader of DGI that I want to define it in terms of fitness
<br>
landscapes. Suppose that a system S is at a point P within a landscape L,
<br>
and you want to get from P to Q. What is the distance between P and Q? One
<br>
way is to define &quot;distance&quot; as inversely proportional to the probability of
<br>
system S taking the step to Q from P. Another way is to define distance as
<br>
the amount of computing power that needs to be expended to get from P to Q. 
<br>
***
<br>
But this latter definition is just the algorithmic infomration of Q 
<br>
relative to P, where you use both program size &amp; runtime to gauge 
<br>
simplicity. You're just giving a new word, &quot;tractability&quot;, to something 
<br>
quite familiar.
<br>
It's fine if you like your choice of word better, but a new name doesn't 
<br>
make it a new concept!!
<br>
it's not MY original concept either. I think William Bennett from IBM in 
<br>
the 1970's was the one who started using runtime complexity along with 
<br>
prog. length in this context
<br>
**
<br>
&quot;Useful complexity&quot;, or complexity that contributes to tractability, is a
<br>
pattern that, when added to the system S, tends to decrease the distance
<br>
between P and Q. If the pattern decreases the distance between a very broad
<br>
range of Ps and Qs, then the pattern might be said to have something to do
<br>
with &quot;general intelligence&quot;, as above.
<br>
**
<br>
I( P | Q and R) &lt; I(P|Q)
<br>
***
<br>
But I will say that when you look at AI from this perspective, it does shed
<br>
another spotlight on why AI projects tend to fail. The tractability of the
<br>
problem is merely the zeroth step. The manageability of the problem space
<br>
is the first derivative. The manageability of the expertise space is the
<br>
second derivative. Coding an AI, or an AI modifying itself, is the third
<br>
derivative. Strongly recursive seed AI is the fourth derivative. If all
<br>
you see of that is the immediate problem, the zeroth derivative, and you
<br>
write some piece of code that solves it directly, then naturally you're
<br>
going to do a comical bounce off the problem of Real AI - like backing up,
<br>
getting a good wind, and running headlong into a thirty-mile wall of rubber
<br>
cement.
<br>
***
<br>
It seems very clear to me that what you are doing is attaching a different 
<br>
verbiage to some old &amp; familiar ideas.
<br>
If you &amp; others find your new verbiage more intuitive, that's great. But 
<br>
formally, these ideas are nothing new really. They're there in my 1993 book 
<br>
and they're there in various papers from the alg. inf. theory literature 
<br>
from the 70's and 80's.
<br>
However, I think the ideas are correct, so I'm not going to complain too 
<br>
much ;-&gt;
