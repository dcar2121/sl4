<em>&gt; Good luck, but while I can't speak for Ben, my advice to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take his attention for granted - he's doing you a favor if he listens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your ideas, you're not doing him a favor by sharing them.
</em><br>
<p>My view is a little different.  I don't think of either sharing or listening
<br>
in terms of &quot;doing favors.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am grateful to people who've read what I've written, though; and I also
<br>
think some of my books have done others favors, in a sense, by waking them
<br>
up to aspects of science or reality that they previously only dimly
<br>
suspected.
<br>
<p>My favorite experience like this was as follows.  When I left Western
<br>
Australia for the US in 1997, I left a terrible mess in the house I'd been
<br>
renting.  I got an e-mail about 6 months later from the guy who'd moved into
<br>
the house after I'd moved out.  He said that, among all the mess, he'd found
<br>
a manuscript of mine in the house -- it was a draft version of &quot;The
<br>
Unification of Science and Spirit,&quot; which is on my website and which I'm
<br>
really not very happy with (maybe I'll rewrite it one day).  He said it had
<br>
totally changed his life and opened his mind up to new perspectives on
<br>
himself and the world.  This kind of muted my  mild guilt about having left
<br>
behind a trashed house ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Anyway, I generally enjoy dialogues with others: for the intrinsic
<br>
(hardwired?) pleasure of communicating with others, for what I learn from
<br>
them, and for what I learn myself from formulating my ideas for others'
<br>
digestion.
<br>
<p>However, of course, some dialogues are more useful &amp; productive than others.
<br>
Most intellectual dialogues I have seem to thin out after a few months,
<br>
unless there is some common work project involved providing new meat for
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>Our dialogue, Eliezer, is one of a handful of exceptions I've experienced:
<br>
we're not working together on a project, and yet our dialogue has not yet
<br>
become boring ;).  I suppose this is because we're working in parallel on
<br>
related projects, so we are both continually making new discoveries
<br>
enriching our own perspectives.
