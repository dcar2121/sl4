<p>That is correct, I have not given any argument actually.
<br>
But neither have you.  Nevertheless, all we can argue about
<br>
is the likelihood and since you already say that you acknowledge
<br>
the possibility - that is enough for me.  Hopefully you agree
<br>
with me then that staying in control should constantly be the
<br>
highest priority and never we should take a risk that we'd
<br>
create a intelligence greater than ours that might choose to
<br>
exterminate us.  With this in mind I think that especially
<br>
the first AI must operate in a very controlled environment,
<br>
until we learn more about the goals and desires or &quot;instincts&quot;
<br>
of the beings we created.
<br>
<p>Finally, I do have a little argument to add, but choose to first
<br>
post my introductory mail ;).
<br>
<p>I think that an Artificial Intelligence will have to be, just like
<br>
humans, &quot;goal driven&quot;.  Otherwise we can not speak of 'intelligence'
<br>
(correct me if I am wrong there).
<br>
<p>With &quot;goal driven&quot; I mean that a human seeks satisfaction of a
<br>
desire, by achieving a goal.  Psychologist have divided humans
<br>
in a bunch of groups where it comes to what drives a human being.
<br>
One of them is &quot;security&quot; (without doubt my drive too).
<br>
Example: I seek security - therefore I study, get a job and get
<br>
lots of money that I safe and keep on my bank account.  Also,
<br>
I wanted security and because was hurt often in normal social
<br>
contacts I started an electronics hobby and became a radio pirate:
<br>
six years of my life my social contact have been anonymously
<br>
with only audio as contact - and that has worked for me very
<br>
well (I was a popular guy on the radio, unlike at school).
<br>
Later I was using IRC and I wanted to chat in a safe environment,
<br>
because I needed security and ONLY because of that drive, I've
<br>
improved the IRC protocol and as such made it impossible to take
<br>
over channels anymore (I designed 'ircu', the ircd that is still
<br>
being used on undernet IRC (when I first went there it had 10
<br>
users, now it has 80,000)). etc.
<br>
<p>Roughly spoken, the thought process involved in order to achieve
<br>
a goal works as follows:
<br>
<p>Random generator --filter--&gt; neural network to figure out --&gt; expected result -\
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of actions                 what ones expects to be the                        \__ comparation --&gt; feedback
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result                                             /                      |
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^                                 goal -/                       |
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`---------------------------------------------------------------'
<br>
<p>And this doesn't work 'discreate', there is no 'clock pulse',
<br>
it works like the feedback of an OpAmp (electronics), or
<br>
like solving a non-lineair differential equation.  That is
<br>
what our brain is very good at: solving non-lineair equations.
<br>
<p>Of course, the above is VERY incomplete and not the subject
<br>
of discussion.  I just try to make a point here:
<br>
If an AI will work in this way, and the 'goal' we set it
<br>
will be to build an even faster brain, then what will happen
<br>
when it considers being terminated prematurely?
<br>
It would immedeately conclude that if its existence would
<br>
end then it would *certainly* not be able to achieve its goal.
<br>
Therefore, independant of the goal is has, it will consider
<br>
surviving to be the highest priority and might chose to put
<br>
most time into securing of its own continuation.
