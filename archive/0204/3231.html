Here's a list of 'Sins' from my a2i2 Project FAQ
<br>
<a href="http://www.optimal.org/a2i2/projectFAQ.htm">http://www.optimal.org/a2i2/projectFAQ.htm</a>
<br>
<p>They add up....
<br>
<p>Peter
<br>
<p><p><p>Why is there so little progress in (workable) AGI models and systems?
<br>
<p>·        See: ‘*Why are so few researchers pursuing Real AI?’
<br>
<p>·        The importance of general intelligence is not appreciated
<br>
<p>·        Poor epistemology (grounding, f&amp;s, concepts, context, etc. –
<br>
leading to: embedding, vector encoding, activation spreading, multi-sense,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p>·        Poor understanding of key concepts – getting stuck on:
<br>
consciousness, volition, meaning, representation/ world-model, emotions,
<br>
common-sense
<br>
<p>·        Poor understanding of ‘intelligence’ - knowledge (Cyc) Vs two-way
<br>
interactive, adaptive learning – also, importance of abstract cognition
<br>
<p>·        Not appreciating the central importance of patterns – especially
<br>
dynamic ones (entities, attributes, concepts, actions, thoughts, etc.)
<br>
<p>·        Too much focus on copying/ reverse-engineering the brain –
<br>
biological feasibility
<br>
<p>·        Too much focus on high-level abilities (logic, language,
<br>
creativity, etc.)
<br>
<p>·        Performance expectations too high for any specific functionality
<br>
(vision, speech, etc.)
<br>
<p>·        Schism between traditionalists &amp; connectionists – False dichotomy:
<br>
symbol/ schema Vs pattern/ incomprehensible
<br>
<p>·        Undue focus on evolutionary &amp; agent systems (Society of Mind)
<br>
<p>·        Getting stuck on custom (NN and/ or robotics) hardware in the early
<br>
stages (CAM, Cog)
<br>
<p>·        Over-estimate of hardware &amp; software needed (Seed AI, minimal AGI,
<br>
limited motor-sensory, NN without paying NN price)
<br>
<p>·        Under-researched areas: Incremental, real-time, unsupervised/
<br>
self-supervised learning (Vs backprop!) – Self-tuning: bottom up &amp; top-down
<br>
(data &amp; emotions/ goal/ meta-cognitive driven) – Dynamic NN topologies –
<br>
Dynamical, interactive, adaptive AGI systems – Combining the best from NN,
<br>
traditional AI, fuzzy, etc.
<br>
<p><p><p>Why are so few researchers pursuing Real AI?
<br>
<p>Basic division - *
<br>
<p>·        Many don’t believe that human-level AGI is possible at all
<br>
<p>·        Others think it will happen anyway. Sometime. Lots of people are
<br>
working on it. Eventually it will all come together.
<br>
<p>More specific reasons for not focusing on ‘Real AI’
<br>
<p>·        They don’t believe that ‘general intelligence’ is a valid concept
<br>
<p>·        They don’t believe that AGI can be achieved within their lifetime –
<br>
the time is not ripe!
<br>
<p>·        They don’t believe that ‘general intelligence’ is the best approach
<br>
to achieving ‘AI’
<br>
<p>·        They don’t see why it’s so important – don’t consider Seed AI
<br>
benefits
<br>
<p>·        They don’t know how to do it (no model) – intimidated!
<br>
<p>·        They are trying to reverse engineer the brain - one function at a
<br>
time
<br>
<p>·        They are focusing all of their attention on one (or a few) aspects
<br>
of intelligence – not the whole picture
<br>
<p>·        They tried in their youth (15 - 30 years ago) and failed - now,
<br>
‘conclude’ that it can’t be done
<br>
<p>·        They can get quicker results (financial and other) pursuing
<br>
specialized AI
<br>
<p>·        They get little academic respect/ support/ funding
<br>
<p>·        They are afraid of it
<br>
<p>All of the above combine to create a dynamic where Real AI is not
<br>
‘fashionable’, further reducing the number of people drawn into it!
