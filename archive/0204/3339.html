</em><br>
<p><p>How do you figure that exactly?  Past geological evidence did

not have our pertubations as part of temperature shifts.  I am 
<br>
not at all sure that we will not manage to create a heat and

ozone-depletion run-away a bit different than what has happened 
<br>
in the past.  Also, in the past we did not have very significant 
<br>
major population centers on the coast where they would be wiped 
<br>
out by an significant rise in the level of the oceans.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As far as these others:  There is a big difference between 'possible' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'real danger'.  At the rate tech is advancing, if a rock doesn't blam us in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the next 30 years, then it's not a threat; before that time, it's irrational
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p><p>Actually, if we mapped the heavens a bit more as far as likely 
<br>
rocks go, there is a very good chance we could do something 
<br>
about anything that looks too dangerous long before 30 years 
<br>
from now.  Why take a risk that is not that expensive to 
<br>
evaluate the chances of more thoroughly?  I consider it 
<br>
irresponsible that we don't bother to finish mapping these things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Nuclear exchange?  Between whom?  The only other country with enough nukes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to threaten a worldwide catastrophe is Russia, and the possibility of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange between us and them is remote.  Certainly, other countries have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some, and others will have them in the future; but a few detonations -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tragic though that may be - does not a racial wipeout make.  You need a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than any of these countries have - or will have presingularity - for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any real danger of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think it is so terribly remote at all.  We didn't 
<br>
exactly rush in to offer any real aid when Russia stopped being 
<br>
a threat.  As a result (and also for many other reasons) the 
<br>
country is a huge mess and many of its people are in very dire 
<br>
straits.  This is a bad combination with a lot of major weaponry 
<br>
around.  Also there is the possibility of these weapons being 
<br>
captured by others besides their original owners that is not 
<br>
sufficiently accounted for and protected against imho.  Lastly, 
<br>
at the pace the US is threatening various countries it is not at 
<br>
all impossible that the rest of the world will eventually come 
<br>
to see us as a dangerous threat.
<br>
<p>But I will concede that a biological war is much more likely a 
<br>
threat at this time (until nanotech is available).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The world is also a bit hotter and the ozone hole is relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;new on that timescale. Way too much of our human resources are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;undereducated, undernourished and so on to be of maximum benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to themselves and all of us.  Most of our intelligence, energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and resources is used in the goal of accumulating more monetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tokens than all those others one is in competition with.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;current scarcity based model imho, can lead to not much better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;even in the face of real physical and information abundance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those are - in themselves - not very good things, but they hardly constitute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an 'Eve of Destruction' scenario.  I think you're being self-indulgent - as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many moderns are - who are still in a paleolithic mindset, looking around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for threats from the predators and worrying about whether the crops will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flooded out or dry up and blow away and all those other threats our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestors had to face just to survive.  (Someone should write a book called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _The Maladapted Mind_ showing how many of our ancient adapted mentality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of step with the modern society.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I think you are grossly out of line to call someone you don't 
<br>
really know &quot;self-indulgent&quot; with so little evidence.  I am 
<br>
quite used to thinking with new and likely soon to be realities 
<br>
firmly in mind.  I dare say that I am better at it than most.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Well we do have a rabid evangelical at the head of Justice, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;president who many will argue was not duly elected and who does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not read his briefing papers generally but has them read to him,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a cabinet full of relics from 10-20 years ago administration,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;increasing attacks on human rights and security of person and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;effects, a much larger percentage of people in jail than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;other nation, a press that is overly-homogenized and sanitized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and a wacky notion of never ending war againt &quot;the Evil Ones&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you advocate just turning the other cheek to those responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 911, but I do not.  So you disagree with - or don't like - whose in office.
</em><br>
<p><p>Huh?  I said nothing at all about &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; in 
<br>
the above.  Are you actually responding to what I wrote?  A 
<br>
never-ending war that is by definition not capable of completion 
<br>
is certainly not the only alternative to &quot;turning the other 
<br>
cheek&quot;.  The war as defined by President Bush is a huge danger 
<br>
to the freedoms and well-being of ourselves and is a danger to 
<br>
all the world.  It is a simplistic rabid response to situations 
<br>
with very complex causes.  It cannot work to end terror.  It is 
<br>
mostly likely to create vastly more of it including terrorizing 
<br>
our own citizens by their government for their supposed 
<br>
&quot;security&quot;.
<br>
<p>I not only don't like Bush.  I considering him an incompetent 
<br>
scoundrel who stole the Presidency.  The scoundrels he has put 
<br>
into his cabinet are truly deserving of the word &quot;evil&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are forces militating against the extremes these people *might* in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their heart of hearts want to go to that do not exist in dictatorships.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what checks and balances are for.  They work pretty well, overall; so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your unrealistically extrapolating what some of these people *might*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to do into actual actions that won't happen under our system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>In case you haven't noticed, Bush and his cronies give the bird 
<br>
to &quot;checks and balances&quot;.  Our system of government?  You mean 
<br>
the one that has just released the CIA to practice assasinations 
<br>
again? The one that has combined the FBI, CIA and local law 
<br>
enforcement along with military &quot;aid&quot; to their efforts to spy on 
<br>
the American people and arrest any of us they consider offensive 
<br>
with hardly any judicial oversight?  Please wake up and smell 
<br>
the coffee.  We are in considerable danger.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The media is a helluva lot bigger than the big media companies (I guess)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're thinking of.  I can get news from all over the world, so can anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else with an account.  So even if you are correct, it is immaterial.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is more than just the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p>True, but it is pretty damn worrisome when I can't get remotely 
<br>
balanced reporting in American media without going to the 
<br>
&quot;underground&quot; press or to foreign sources.  Exactly how long do 
<br>
you think it will be before this government finds a pretext to 
<br>
shut down some of this access?  As it is they can watch every 
<br>
click you make and have proposed various mandatory filters on 
<br>
any public access points the government contributes money to.
<br>
<p>No the world is not just the US.  Unfortunately, some of those 
<br>
currently in power do not seem to really appreciate this.  That 
<br>
we are the &quot;only superpower&quot; is, imho,  going to their heads.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;We have forces working hard to kill the power of nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;limitless access to information and computational capability. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;yes, imho, this country could very quickly go to the dogs.  Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it be like Lebanon or Iraq?  Dunno.  But if it doesn't change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;its course where it ends up will almost certainly not be pretty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are always opposing forces in 'life, the universe, and everything'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is:  Which direction is the tide flowing?  I think the tide is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flowing toward a positive future, and it only gets more powerful with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing time.  Some people want to control information or resources for
</em><br>
<p><p>I have very little evidence that the tide is currently moving to 
<br>
a positive future so I don't think I can afford to just ride the 
<br>
tide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; their own selfish ends; they always have.  They'll either realize which way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wind (changing metaphors in midstream, here) is blowing and tack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordingly, or get smashed against the shoals of history.  The collapse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Soviet Union is only the most prominent recent example of this.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list could be expanded at great length.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>And it would be meaningless to expand an argument like this to 
<br>
great lenght of course because you haven't really given your 
<br>
evidence for which way the tide is moving.  I think it is far 
<br>
from inevitable at this point that it is moving in the direction 
<br>
we wish it to.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Change to what?  Everybody wants changes of some kind or another.  I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some things to change, as well.  The difference between us is that I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have apocoliptic visions if things don't turn out the way I'd prefer.  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's where you need to get your energy from to move forward.  If so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's unfortunate.  But I don't feel a threat of doom hanging over me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivate me to act.  I think that's a sad way to live if that's the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>So, are you acting at full power to insure your dreams come to 
<br>
pass in any case or do you believe that things going as you wish 
<br>
is inevitable?  I used to think that way more.  But while I was 
<br>
thinking that way a lot of things in the US and the world were 
<br>
done in ways that are not at all inline with where I hope we 
<br>
arrive.  Things that I might have had a small hand in seeing 
<br>
done differently.  I feel more than a little guilt for some of 
<br>
the places I was asleep at the wheel dreaming. If there was one 
<br>
thing that 9-11 did it was to wake me up from the assumption 
<br>
that things were headed in the right direction. Watching the 
<br>
various reactions since has taught me that there is a lot of 
<br>
work to be done, much of it on ourselves, in order to hope for a 
<br>
good outcome.  Even with our best efforts I don't think that 
<br>
success is by any means assured.
<br>
<p>Instead of accusing me of being apocalyptic or &quot;self-indulgent&quot; 
<br>
perhaps you should pause to wonder if I haven't noticed a few 
<br>
things and connected them that you have not yet noticed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If people do not invest in Singularity it will not happen or we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will not survive it.  Why?  Because without investment in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;benefits of increasing techological prowess and direction toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the goals that truly lead to abundance AND greater effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intelligence, we could easily degenerate socially and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;politically to the point where a deadly war or getting caught by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;some other tragedy is quite likely before the point of no return
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to Singularity is acheived.  If we are together enough on a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;footing to keep advancing to the point of no return then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;escalation of ultra-high-tech weaponry will very likely finish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;us off before we pass Singularity.  Our weapons and their brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;may survive us but I doubt we will survive them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I've already said, I don't believe any of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Unless you can absolutely guarantee that it is not so then I 
<br>
suggest you reconsider and work to assure it does not come to pass.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;So I would advise people to work toward Singularity and toward a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;state of psychology and sociology geared toward abundance and .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;producing an unlimited future.  I would advise everyone to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;toward it as if your life and the life and destiny of the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;human race depends on it.  Because it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Really?  Do you think we can stand still where we are 
<br>
indefinitely in terms of our ability to comprehend and solve our 
<br>
many problems and issues?  Do you think that without 
<br>
significantly more wisdom and effective intelligence we can 
<br>
manage to continue existing long with even current challenges? 
<br>
Do you think that without this increase we could deal 
<br>
non-catastrophically with nanotech?   If so, I honestly wish you 
<br>
a lot of luck and I most fervently hope not too many agree with you.
