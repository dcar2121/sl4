</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Actually, apart from the singularity (which was a new idea to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;me recently), I've always been convinced that humanity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;die unless we manage to get away from this planet and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;colonize other planets.  If not because there is a high risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of putting ALL our genes (and everything we every accomplished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on one planet together with atom bombs and polution, or because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;soon we'll run out of materials, energy and destroy our environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;behond the point where we can survive, then because the sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will burn up (or explode) in the end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's several billion years from now, and I think we'll be able to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, or be long gone before then.  The rest of this is just bogus.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Huh?  That climate change is a threat is not bogus. Nor is the 
<br>
danger inherent in a full atomic exchange (which is still 
<br>
unfortunately possible), or wreaking the ozone layer and 
<br>
overeating the planet, or being whacked by a couple of 
<br>
kilometers of nickel-iron meteor.  All of these and more are a 
<br>
real danger as long as we are on one planet and at our present 
<br>
level of effective intelligence.  If we develop nanotech at our 
<br>
present level of effective intelligence and wisdom there is also 
<br>
quite considerable threat along with promise.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If you look at the way the whole industry has evolved till now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;then it isn't reasonable to expect we will change anything until it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is too late (poisoned atmosphere, more humans then the earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and feed and a civilisation that is fragile and will break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;down totally when we don't even get MORE people, MORE pollution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and MORE raw materials; which is impossible at some point).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The atmosphere is a lot cleaner now than it was even 20, let alone 50 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago.  The population in the developed world is already below replacement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level, and the rest of the world is showing signs of leveling off as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said, bogus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>The world is also a bit hotter and the ozone hole is relatively 
<br>
new on that timescale. Way too much of our human resources are 
<br>
undereducated, undernourished and so on to be of maximum benefit 
<br>
to themselves and all of us.  Most of our intelligence, energy 
<br>
and resources is used in the goal of accumulating more monetary 
<br>
tokens than all those others one is in competition with.  The 
<br>
current scarcity based model imho, can lead to not much better 
<br>
even in the face of real physical and information abundance.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Whether you like it or not, the progress that humanity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;making (and is needed for the Singularity), like the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;market (and needed research fundings) and internet is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to fall down when America, or Europe or Japan etc turns into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;an area like Libanon or Irak.  Humanity is constantly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;edge of Not Making It.  Perhaps there will not be total self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;destruction, but surely we won't get another chance to colonize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;other planets, or initiate the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.s. turning into something like Lebanon or Iraq?  Where's your evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this nutty statement?  Yes, nutty.  I stand by my description.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Well we do have a rabid evangelical at the head of Justice, a 
<br>
president who many will argue was not duly elected and who does 
<br>
not read his briefing papers generally but has them read to him, 
<br>
a cabinet full of relics from 10-20 years ago administration, 
<br>
increasing attacks on human rights and security of person and 
<br>
effects, a much larger percentage of people in jail than any 
<br>
other nation, a press that is overly-homogenized and sanitized 
<br>
and a wacky notion of never ending war againt &quot;the Evil Ones&quot;. 
<br>
We have forces working hard to kill the power of nearly 
<br>
limitless access to information and computational capability. So 
<br>
yes, imho, this country could very quickly go to the dogs.  Will 
<br>
it be like Lebanon or Iraq?  Dunno.  But if it doesn't change 
<br>
its course where it ends up will almost certainly not be pretty.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Intelligent people realize this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mean that anyone who doesn't see things the way you do isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Some react with depression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Some react by starting to party and drink alcohol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Some react by putting all their energy into initiating the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never said, nor would I say, that people should not invest their energies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in advancing the singularity.  (Although I don't think it will really affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the arrival date one iota.)  I was simply asking Eliezer why he thought so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much effort was necessary to advance something that is already advancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite rapidly, and why he seemed to think humanity was toast if it didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>If people do not invest in Singularity it will not happen or we 
<br>
will not survive it.  Why?  Because without investment in the 
<br>
benefits of increasing techological prowess and direction toward 
<br>
the goals that truly lead to abundance AND greater effective 
<br>
intelligence, we could easily degenerate socially and 
<br>
politically to the point where a deadly war or getting caught by 
<br>
some other tragedy is quite likely before the point of no return 
<br>
to Singularity is acheived.  If we are together enough on a war 
<br>
footing to keep advancing to the point of no return then the 
<br>
escalation of ultra-high-tech weaponry will very likely finish 
<br>
us off before we pass Singularity.  Our weapons and their brains 
<br>
may survive us but I doubt we will survive them.
<br>
<p>So I would advise people to work toward Singularity and toward a 
<br>
state of psychology and sociology geared toward abundance and 
<br>
producing an unlimited future.  I would advise everyone to work 
<br>
toward it as if your life and the life and destiny of the entire 
<br>
human race depends on it.  Because it does.
