Subject: Re: Different View of IA
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, here I am, in the ancestoral environment.  I'm amongst a tribe of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 150 humans.  They live close together and can spy on each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly easily.  While a few can hide a little, human societies work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you can't go against society without some consequences, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's always someone sticking his or her nose into someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business.  One day Unk is caught not sharing the chicken he caught.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, everyone knows that Unk's family has gone without meet for a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks, so they let this pass.  A few days later, he catches another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chicken and again shares none of it.  When he does this the third time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are pissed.  The solution:  beat him.  Maybe rape his wife and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill one of his children, too.  Unk is upset and he fights a few of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbors and manages to bloody them a little.  After that Unk is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human and mostly gets along in society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now we take the Way Back Machine into the future (yes, we're going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negatively backwards):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, here I am in the year 2015 where nanotech spy technology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere.  Just yesterday Knu (the great great great ... great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grandson of Unk--unless of course the village had managed to get his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wife pregnant that time Unk did not share his chicken) was caught by his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbors cracking the encryption on a DVC (digital video cube) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching every Inspector Clouseau film without paying $5 a minute to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MPAA like all other good, god-fearing people do.  Since the MPAA doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know about this, his neighbors kindly decide to inform them.  With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; press of a button, the MPAA sends out nanobots to Knu's home and has it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquidated.  Literally.  Knu, soaking wet and pissed, is still fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable, unlike his long dead relative Unk who was badly bruised and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only able to throw a punch or two before a fight was over.  Using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembler at the nearby Kinko's, Knu builds and sends out some nanobots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to liquidate this neighbors houses to get revenge.  But, as it turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, Knu is not the best programmer, so his nanobots accidently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquidate the Earth.  The dolphins enjoy all the extra space (now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're really thanking humans for all the fish :-P) but humans are dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or drowning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Back in the e-mail I'm writing right now:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, as we see, humans don't really change, just the technology does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently, humans with technology that can destroy the world are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous.  It's mostly through luck that we have managed not to nuke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves out of existence or back to the stone age.  One day someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with nuclear weapons or nanotech or something is going to probably kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything on Earth.  For many of us, the push to reach the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as quickly as possible is that the longer we wait the more likely it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we'll be caught on Earth when someone decides to blow it up.
</em><br>
<p><p>Wow!  He cites a (probable) past scenario, and then creates a wholly
<br>
conjectural future scenario to show that humans do not change.  Anybody can
<br>
prove anything with that kind of reasoning - making up any future
<br>
occurrences one needs to fit the preconclusion.
