<p>I think this territory is more or less covered in:

<p><a href="http://intelligence.org/CFAI/policy.html">http://intelligence.org/CFAI/policy.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you see yourself as the potential savior of mankind a la Leto Atriades II in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I've noticed that people tend to ignore my guidance and go horribly
<br>
astray in any case.  Don't mind me, I'll just sit here quietly developing a
<br>
Cassandra complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, what evidence do you have for this belief?  Have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written up your case for the necessity for this project to save mankind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere?  Point me to it so I can read it and respond intelligently.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a post of yours from back in July of 2002 in which you seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stating that the death of humanity is the only alternative to the successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completion of your project, (I will be happy to repost it here or send it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you if you like).  I guess I should have asked then, but I was busy with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things and let it drop.  But your current post has brought it back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my attention, so I'm asking.  If you think I might have the perception that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have messianic tendencies, you're right.  What's the deal?
</em><br>
<p>*Shrug.*  It's not my job to be messianic, and it's even less my job to be
<br>
non-messianic.  I want to accomplish the largest possible amount of good
<br>
with my life.  In a pre-Singularity era, that means doing something that
<br>
relates to the Singularity, because those are the largest stakes currently
<br>
on the table.  If I find a $1000 bill lying in the street, I'll pick it up. 
<br>
If I find an opportunity to bring the Singularity nearer or make it safer,
<br>
I'll take it.  I do see what looks like such an opportunity and I am taking
<br>
it.  That's all there is to it.  It doesn't take any complex hypotheses
<br>
about my psychology.  I suppose it takes more knowledge than usual to see
<br>
that the situation really is that simple, but it doesn't take anything
<br>
besides that.
