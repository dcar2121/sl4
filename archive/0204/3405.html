<p>Of course I'm a complete armchair (less than that really :-) quantum

&quot;this world&quot;-centric. Reminds me of the whole Aristotle thing. If
<br>
communications across worlds is possible, then shouldn't we already
<br>
have been contacted by now? Because if there are an infinite number

of worlds, some Damien out there should have already convinced someone
<br>
to run this experiment, right?

Right, Brian. If Damien's experiment works in any universe, then we should
expect that it has already been tried in some. Why? Just the Copernican
assumption that we are not the center of the solar system, or the universe,
or anything else. The odds are that we are just a median intelligent species
in a median universe.
If the experiment has been tried in some universes and if a) it succeeded in
creating seed AI's; and if b) those AI's communicate with other universes,
then I would expect that c) the AI's would consist of a range of types
(let's say, for simplicity, that the range extends from &quot;Friendly&quot; to &quot;Evil&quot;
with many in between). Communicating with one another in different
universes, they would quickly size one another up and form associations
based on their orientation (Friendly, Evil or neutrals who may take sides
under certain circumstances). They would then proceed to struggle for cosmic
supremacy.
Quite a Manichean picture, eh? AI gods at war across all possible space-time
continuums.
Should we become part of this?
Could we avoid it?
What evidence would we look for to determine if it has already happened?
P.S.-- I read Damien's story &quot;Infinite Monkey&quot; just last year and wondered
then if anyone would attempt something like the experiment he has now
formally proposed.

Michael LaTorra
