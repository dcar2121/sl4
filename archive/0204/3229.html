<p>Aaargh.  Can we put this particular track of the conversation on temporary
<br>
hold until I finish proofreading the second and almost certainly final draft
<br>
of &quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot;, which should be Any Day
<br>
Now?
<br>
<p>But for the record, the top three Deadly Sins are:
<br>
<p>1)  Solving problems with code;
<br>
2)  Hardwiring what should be learned;
<br>
3)  Physics envy (&quot;using only one idea&quot; comes under this heading).
<br>
<p>Number one, in particular, may strike some people as an odd thing to say -
<br>
so a quote:
<br>
<p>**
<br>
<p>Programming is the art of translating a human's mental model of a 
<br>
problem-solution into a computer program; that is, the art of 
<br>
translating thoughts into code.  Programming inherently violates the 
<br>
levels of organization; it leads directly into all the pitfalls of 
<br>
classical AI.  The underlying low-level processes that implement 
<br>
intelligence are of a fundamentally different character than 
<br>
high-level intelligence itself.  When we translate our thoughts 
<br>
about a problem into code, we are establishing a correspondence 
<br>
between code and the high-level content of our minds, not a 
<br>
correspondence between code and the dynamic process of a human 
<br>
mind.  In ordinary programming, the task is to get a computer to 
<br>
solve a specific problem; it may be an &quot;interesting&quot; problem, with a 
<br>
very large domain, but it will still be a specific problem.  The 
<br>
problem is solved by taking the human thought process that would be 
<br>
used to solve an instance of the problem, and translating that 
<br>
thought process into code that can also solve instances of the 
<br>
problem.  Programmers are humans who have learned the art of 
<br>
inventing thought processes, called &quot;algorithms&quot;, that rely only on 
<br>
capabilities that an ordinary computer possesses.
<br>
<p>The reflexes learned by a good, artistic programmer represent a 
<br>
fundamental danger when embarking on a general AI project.  
<br>
Programmers are trained to solve problems, and trying to create 
<br>
general AI means solving the programming problem of creating a mind 
<br>
that can, among other things, solve problems.  There is the danger 
<br>
of a short-circuit, of misinterpreting the problem task as writing 
<br>
code that directly solves some specific challenge posed to the mind, 
<br>
instead of building a mind that can solve the challenge with 
<br>
higher-level intelligence.
<br>
<p>**
