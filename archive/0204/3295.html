I've always been convinced that
<br>
<em>&gt; humanity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die unless we manage to get away from this planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonize other planets.  If not because there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of putting ALL our genes (and everything we every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on one planet together with atom bombs and polution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon we'll run out of materials, energy and destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the point where we can survive
</em><br>
<p>There are several flaws in the above thinking.
<br>
(1) most of the atomic bombs are already mounted
<br>
on rockets.  What makes you think they won't follow
<br>
you to other planets?
<br>
(2) the materials of which the Earth is composed
<br>
aren't 'used up'.  Aside from the small amount
<br>
converted in nuclear reaction, atoms are forever.
<br>
I like to think of landfills as future resource
<br>
mines we haven't figured out how to use effectively
<br>
yet, kind of like mineral reserves that are not
<br>
economic to mine at the present time.
<br>
(3) even the most heavily polluted places on
<br>
Earth are easier to colonize than any planet.
<br>
Take a good look at the Moon.  Nature bombed it
<br>
for 500 million years, there's no atmosphere or
<br>
biological materials, and has a higher radiation
<br>
environment than downtown Hiroshima the day after
<br>
we bombed it.
<br>
(4) The Earth isn't a closed system from an energy
<br>
standpoint, so we can't 'run out' of that either,
<br>
at least until the Sun dies.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;then because
<br>
<em>&gt; the sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will burn up (or explode) in the end.
</em><br>
<p>Left to itself (which won't happen if the Singularity
<br>
does), the Sun will last ~5 billion more years and
<br>
end up as a red dwarf.  It won't go boom.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
it isn't reasonable to expect we will change
<br>
<em>&gt; anything until it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too late (poisoned atmosphere, more humans then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and feed and a civilisation that is fragile and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down totally when we don't even get MORE people,
</em><br>
<p>Poulation growth is slowing:
<br>
<a href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/img/worldgr.gif">http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/img/worldgr.gif</a>
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
when America, or Europe or Japan etc
<br>
<em>&gt; turns into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an area like Libanon or Irak.  
</em><br>
<p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
<br>
250 years ago, the trend has been for 'developed'
<br>
areas to spread.  The drivers have been the search
<br>
for cheap labor and the spread of literacy.
<br>
<p><p>The world view you have of impending doom and
<br>
gloom started with the Club of Rome's &quot;Limits
<br>
to Growth&quot; study.  They used computer models
<br>
to project where society was going.  There were
<br>
two critical flaws in their study, though.
<br>
one was the assumption of constant technology 
<br>
over time spans of a century, which is clearly
<br>
wrong.  The other was to treat the Earth as
<br>
a closed system, which it is not as long as
<br>
the Sun shines.  So cheer up.
