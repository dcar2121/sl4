<p>I shouldn't get involved I think ;), but I can't resist...
<br>
<p>I play chess an aweful lot, and have analysed (as usual)
<br>
the way of thinking that a human uses (as opposed to brute
<br>
force).  The essention of &quot;strategy&quot; is this: taking those
<br>
actions that MAXIMIZE the CHANCE that you will be able to
<br>
achieve a (sub) goal (make progress thus) in the future,
<br>
WITHOUT seeing immedeate or concrete advantages.
<br>
<p>For the more mathematical impaired: consider chess and assume
<br>
you and your opponent can only think precisely 5 moves ahead.
<br>
Then after every move a large ammount of positions &quot;emmerge
<br>
from the fog&quot; that makes up the exponentional growing tree
<br>
of possibilities after the fifth move.  All we can talk about
<br>
is the CHANCE to suddenly SEE how to gain profit (or just make
<br>
progress); strategy is purely a statistically matter: your
<br>
chance to win is proportional to the ratio of the number of
<br>
positions you can 'choose' from divided by the number of positions
<br>
your opponent can 'choose' from.  EVERY strategic advantage in
<br>
chess (and all other strategy games for that matter) is based
<br>
on this [mobility of the pieces (more choices to pick from results
<br>
in more positions that come out of the fog to choose from),
<br>
getting more space (ie controlling the center): more space means
<br>
more mobility but also more correlation between the pieces
<br>
(and correlation is important) etc etc.  I am should not give
<br>
in to the urge to give chess lessons here heheh. ]
<br>
<p>One thing that your discussion makes me think of most is
<br>
a king attack (a very clear, short-term goal): if you start a
<br>
king attack it is often 'all or nothing', mostly meaning that
<br>
you don't yet see how it will end: you just want to maximize
<br>
the chances to get there.  In order to achieve that you have
<br>
to use as many pieces as possible (well, more than your opponent,
<br>
in chess everything is relative; for example, I often start a
<br>
king attack at the moment my opponent did eat a pawn with his
<br>
queen on the other side of the board - his queen is then temporarily
<br>
&quot;out of the game&quot; making me relatively MUCH stronger on the king-side).
<br>
The reason that you need as many pieces as possible is on one hand
<br>
to eliminate your oppents possibility to choose the path of exchange:
<br>
you need to end up with at least two pieces to give mate (in most cases)
<br>
so you need two more pieces (locally) then your opponent; by cutting
<br>
of the paths of exchange you are once again limiting the choices of
<br>
your oppent and thus decreasing his chances. But at least as important
<br>
is the fact that two pieces with each 4 choices are stronger then one
<br>
piece with 8 choices: you can only pick one of the 8 choices and
<br>
destroy all other 7 at the moment you pick one. While with two pieces
<br>
you only destroy 4 and keep half of the original choices.  Of course
<br>
there will be new choices after moving a piece, but after 5 moves (as
<br>
far as you can 'look') that averages out and two pieces will be twice
<br>
as valuable as one piece.
<br>
<p>Ok, sorry for the long introduction, but I needed it to make
<br>
my statement.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you are both right.  But, Eliezer says:
<br>
I am not going to start a king attack without first maximizing
<br>
my chances - an excellent strategic approach.  While Ben says:
<br>
if you don't start a king attack until you increased your
<br>
chances till the level you aim for, you will never start it.
<br>
Now Ben is right too because we are talking about *chances*,
<br>
and with Bens approach (starting with volunteers) there is
<br>
also a chance that he will succeed, although smaller than
<br>
with the approach that Eliezer aims for.
<br>
<p>I think that the best thing to do is to do both: At least Ben
<br>
starts, and if he fails then we still have Eliezer who might
<br>
get funding in the future and then can make an attempt with
<br>
more chance for success.  It would not make sense to both start
<br>
looking for funding or both start to look for volunteers and
<br>
try it like that.
