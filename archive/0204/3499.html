<p>Damien Broderick replied:
<br>
Agreed. However Greg's sequel was not to THE CITY AND THE STARS, but to the
<br>
simpler novella that had preceded it by a decade, `Against the Fall of
<br>
Night'. (Novella and novel were, however, structurally equivalent, with the
<br>
same outcome.)
<br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
Oh, right, I got them confused. I read both works when I was younger, and
<br>
then re-read THE CITY AND THE STARS more than once since then. Thanks for
<br>
the correction.
<br>
<p>Damien:
<br>
I blame myself for this disaster; had I been a bit quicker
<br>
off the mark, none of this would have happened.
<br>
You'll find in Clarke's introduction to their joint volume that I'd sought
<br>
his permission to sequel CITY AND THE STARS around the same time, but had
<br>
been pipped at the post by Gregory (whose credentials, after all, were
<br>
better than mine; he's a professor of physics with expertise in the
<br>
mathematics of closed spacetimes). Later, I asked Arthur if I could do it
<br>
*right*, now (his commentary suggests that I might be allowed to take my
<br>
own shot at the novel in another decade, which has now come and gone);
<br>
alas, his ferocious agent refuses to let me through the door.
<br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
Too bad you didn't get to do the new version, Damien. Unfortunate timing.
<br>
Is there anything we can do to convince Sir Arthur to give you the go ahead
<br>
now? A letter-writing campaign, perhaps? I fear that due to his advanced
<br>
age, Sir Arthur might not be around too much longer to give his blessing to
<br>
such a project. And I have no idea how the executors of his literary estate
<br>
might feel about the idea.
<br>
<p>Damien:
<br>
I suppose the sf Greg who came closest to the pure Singularity quill is
<br>
Greg Bear, in BLOOD MUSIC.
<br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
Yes, I agree that Bear's BLOOD MUSIC bio/nano Singularity was very well
<br>
done.
