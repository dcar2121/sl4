</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I want ice cream&quot; and what the concept structure does internally

aside

when I

</em><br>
<p>I think that it is a mistake to believe that you can actually &quot;want ice
<br>
cream&quot; at lower levels of cognition.
<br>
<p>The wanting of &quot;ice cream&quot; can just be a conceptual interpretation of a
<br>
specific lower-level biological desire.  All the evidence suggests that
<br>
most nutritional desires are realized in the thalamus very precisely in
<br>
term of sugar/sweets, fat, liquid, etc....  As has been shown the
<br>
thalamus can influence the brain reward system of the NAc/VTA.  This
<br>
modulation can make concepts that are associated with fulfillment of
<br>
specific needs more desirable.  Soon as the motivational system starts
<br>
to bias towards specific thoughts it doesn't take too long for us to get
<br>
on to thinking in that area.  These thoughts can also be triggered by
<br>
&quot;not feeling well&quot; which in turn results in a conscious &quot;search&quot; for
<br>
plausible causes.  Such a conscious search of plausible causes usually
<br>
results in our realization that we want a specific thing because
<br>
thinking about it seems &quot;right&quot; as a result of the motivation/reward
<br>
bias.  As we know the NAc/VTA system can play a role in modulating
<br>
attention in regards to predicted rewards (via NAc-&gt;VTA-&gt;PFC
<br>
projections) and thus this may explain why such desires seem to
<br>
monopolize our attention sometimes.
<br>
<p>VTA: ventral tegmental system
<br>
NAc: nucleus accumbens
<br>
PFC: prefrontal cortex
<br>
DA: dopamine
<br>
<p>Also, I must add that sometimes the desire for ice cream can arise
<br>
without any underlying biological need.  Such a desire could be
<br>
triggered by an activation of the brain reward system directly by the
<br>
concept (if thought or seen, etc...) if it has been previously resulted
<br>
in &quot;pleasure&quot; (actual or vicarious) (realized as DA release in the NAc).
<br>
In that case we can view the desire as resulting from basically
<br>
reinforcement learning or in some cases conditioning.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But looking at how concepts are triggered by internal vocalizations:  I
<br>
believe that the internal vocalizations are interpreted by the standard
<br>
linguistic interpretation &quot;modules&quot; in and around Wernicke's area.
<br>
(Again I am just repeating from Levelt's work.)  Like speech from
<br>
external sources, this internally generated speech triggers, as a
<br>
product of its interpretation, various &quot;concepts&quot;.  Most importantly,
<br>
these concepts triggered during the interpretation do not have to
<br>
correspond to the concepts that were responsible for the construction of
<br>
the speech -- this is the neat &quot;feature&quot; that makes this mechanism to
<br>
useful in thought.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Does this concept of &quot;internal narrative&quot; resemble Daniel Dennett's
<br>
concept of &quot;Cartesian Theater&quot;?
<br>
<p>I don't think I answered that question well.  I guess I still do not
<br>
totally understand what you are getting at.
