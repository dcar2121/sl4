<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps a simple faq with definitions of key term for new comers would be
</em><br>
useful and easier to update.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Check Gordon Worley's page... I'm under the
<br>
impression that it's quite accessible and was setup for that very purpose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Similarly, there are constraints on which futures can be envisioned
</em><br>
under
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain background assumptions; it isn't all just magic.  (&quot;Magic&quot; tends
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occupy a certain balance between anthropomorphic characteristics and
</em><br>
minor
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; departures; a Singularity envisioned as magic will be too
</em><br>
anthropomorphic.)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand the context of this statement. If you
</em><br>
<p><p>Assuming a certain set of initial conditions, the future is not like a
<br>
lottery. The set of initial condition places limits on what type of future
<br>
is likely to 'happen'.
<br>
A Singularity envisioned as magic is a Singularity seen in human terms.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Am I getting confused between the definition of a recursive self-improving
</em><br>
system and seed Ai, are they the same? Here is a question that will dispel
<br>
my confusion, would a seed AI given the goal of adding two numbers in the
<br>
most optimal way, change itself to a simple adding program? OR does the
<br>
definition of SeedAi require friendlyness or other goals. I am also under
<br>
the impression that the AI could choose to commit suicide(say if it knew it
<br>
would do more harm than good), which might means it might not grow to
<br>
transhuman levels, is this right? Is the need to go to transhuman levels
<br>
embeded in the goal? I was confused by reading Ben Goertzel's websites about
<br>
his own view of Ai, which doesn't specify the friendliness of the goal, but
<br>
talks about SeedAI. Whatever, in the future I shall say recursively
<br>
self-improving system, instead of seed ai. If that is okay?
<br>
<p>ONE of the characteristics of a seed AI is that it is a self-improving
<br>
system. A seed AI given the goal of adding two numbers would NOT change
<br>
itself in an adding program. From that very question, I believe that you do
<br>
need to read a bit more background material...... I'll give you the same
<br>
answer I gave to Jean Nguyen:
<br>
<p>I recommend reading ALL of the archives  located at:
<br>
<a href="http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/">http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/</a>
<br>
<p><p>PS: Off course reading GISAI and CFAI located at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/index.html">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/index.html</a>
<br>
&amp;
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/GISAI/index.html">http://www.intelligence.org/GISAI/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>should definitely address a lot of issues and answer a lot of questions.
<br>
<p><p>PS: Gordon Worley's page is at:
<br>
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sing_rc/">http://homepage.mac.com/sing_rc/</a>

<p><p>&lt;rest of message was deleted&gt;

<p>Most kind regards,
