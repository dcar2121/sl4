</em><br>
<p>LOGI!  Now why didn't I think of that instead of LoOiGI, which was so
<br>
dreadful that I had to replace it with DGI in the URL?  Oh well...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Are you envisioning a GAI that essentially has a

</em><br>
<p>Roughly.  I think there may be profound reasons why code is inherently less
<br>
amenable to &quot;modalitization&quot; than vision, but humans with *no* codic
<br>
modality at all probably aren't optimal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Am I understanding that right? If so won't this thing be... well..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profoundly Alien?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Not that I'm implying malevolent...just..well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  alien.)  Granted I'm talking out of a clinical background here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Imagining something, with the general intelligence of.. oh say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a chimp, with that architecture which is analagous to monkey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visual cortex as functions for working/functioning in an
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate with evolutionarily-derived biological infrahumans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is bad enough and they &quot;grok&quot; the same environment we do.
</em><br>
<p>Biological infrahumans (what a lovely term!) aren't adapted to linguistic
<br>
communication, period - see Terrence Deacon's &quot;The Symbolic Species&quot;.  The
<br>
difficulty with communicating with chimps is not (just) that they are
<br>
infrahuman in general intelligence, but that they lack the cognitive
<br>
architecture for linguistic communication and deliberation.
<br>
<p>Communicating across a different modality set isn't where the real Alien
<br>
aspects come from, I think.  A human might never be able to understand the
<br>
code the AI writes, but hopefully the AI will still be able to describe, in
<br>
abstract terms, the module's overall purpose.  Programmers can communicate
<br>
with nonprogrammers what a module does, even if they can't communicate how
<br>
it works.  If we're lucky it will turn out that Real Programmers can
<br>
communicate with the human poseurs.
<br>
<p>I think that different modalities will actually turn out to be relatively
<br>
small sources of Alienness compared to, for example, using much smaller
<br>
concepts in longer serial chains of deliberation.  I think that
<br>
communication between humans is profoundly based on a shared understanding
<br>
of what is &quot;obvious&quot; in a deliberation sequence, and that it may turn out to
<br>
be extremely difficult for either humans or infrahuman AIs to figure out
<br>
what is &quot;obvious&quot; to the other, or at least figure it out fast enough for
<br>
realtime communication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Has it occured to you that it might take a &quot;transhuman&quot; AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to carry on a &quot;human-level&quot; conversation with you?
</em><br>
<p>I think a human-equivalent AI should be defined as one which, in carrying on
<br>
a conversation, shocks you with its brilliance at least as often as it
<br>
shocks you with its stupidity.  This is because I don't think there's much
<br>
chance of a human balance of domain competencies.  An AI that *never* sounds
<br>
stupid is probably going to be a transhuman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming it could somehow be motivated to try?
</em><br>
<p>Seems like a pretty straightforward subgoal of Friendliness to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would such an entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be likely to have an ego or &quot;sense of self&quot; as we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it?
</em><br>
<p>Ego, no; self, yes, but certainly not as we understand it.  Introspection,
<br>
goals, and social modeling will all be profoundly different, not just from
<br>
the human design, but from any evolved design.
<br>
<p>Hope you find this reassuring...
