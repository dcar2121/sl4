Hi,
<br>
<p>Just in case anyone on this list actually believes an evil Novamente is
<br>
going to conquer the world in the next couple years (or hours ;), I guess I
<br>
should make some cautionary remarks...
<br>
<p>If things work out well, I think it's plausible we'll have the current
<br>
Novamente design *completely implemented* in 18 months or so.  It could end
<br>
up taking double that long, however, for a couple reasons: team members
<br>
spending nearly all their team working on practical applications of the
<br>
partially-complete system; or unforeseen difficulties in &quot;tuning&quot; (i.e.
<br>
getting to actually function as intended) various system components.
<br>
<p>What we will have then is, hopefully, not just a bunch of AI code, but a
<br>
baby mind.  Teaching this baby mind anything may take a long time.  And the
<br>
teaching process may reveal significant design shortcomings, leading to more
<br>
&amp; more work.  It is rather hard to predict how time-consuming the teaching
<br>
of a baby digital mind will be, since no one has yet seriously attempted
<br>
such a thing.
<br>
<p>I do believe we're actually on the path to creating a seed AI.  Of those who
<br>
are familiar with the system design, some agree with this assessment and
<br>
some disagree.  (The members of the Novamente engineering team are on the
<br>
&quot;agree&quot; side, not surprisingly; the Webmind folks who were more skeptical
<br>
moved on to other things after the paychecks stopped coming in!) Right now
<br>
there is no strong proof that we're on the right track, so we're going to a
<br>
large extent on our collective intuition.  Our practical experimentation
<br>
with Webmind was mainly been in the vein of &quot;datamining&quot;, not in the vein of
<br>
teaching an autonomous system how to cooperatively experience the world.
<br>
The same is true of Novamente, so far.  We are naturally very eager to get
<br>
to the &quot;baby mind&quot; phase, but there's still a bunch of implementation in the
<br>
way.  We view pursuing these datamining apps (currently in the
<br>
bioinformatics domain), not only as a way to generate revenue and as a
<br>
service to the world, but also as a good way to tune many of the system's
<br>
cognition algorithms on tasks that are difficult, but easier than autonomous
<br>
experiential interactive learning.
<br>
<p>As Novamente is being coded for efficiency in a very aggressive way, I'm
<br>
fairly confident that this time around, when we do complete the
<br>
implementation, we'll have a system that can be tested and taught.  The
<br>
Webmind AI Engine was much more complete than Novamente is now, when Webmind
<br>
Inc. folded in March 2001, but its inefficiencies were such that its most
<br>
advanced intended abilities could not be pragmatically tested in a really
<br>
significant way.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
