<p>
Before posting more I'd like to give a short
<br>
introduction of myself.
<br>
<p>I am what you could consider a typical hacker
<br>
(in the correct meaning of the word): I program
<br>
12 hours/day 7 days/week... at least, I did
<br>
until I got RSI (Repitive Stress Injury).
<br>
Because now I cannot type anymore all day, I
<br>
have been reading here and there and as such
<br>
stumbled over this transhuman stuff.
<br>
<p>I subscribed to this mailinglist because I am
<br>
interested in the institute and would like to
<br>
know what you are doing.  I expected that the
<br>
main activity is designing an AI, or at least
<br>
discuss how that needs to designed, so that we'll
<br>
be ready once the hardware is.
<br>
<p>It is my hope that I might be able to help,
<br>
not only because I've two decades of programming
<br>
experience but mostly because of this rather unique
<br>
characteristic of me: I am aware of a great part
<br>
of my subconscious.  This and other deviations
<br>
from 'normal' people haven't made my life very
<br>
easy; I've been seeing psychologists because of
<br>
all kinds of problems ever since the age of twelve,
<br>
and I am still seeing one now, at age 37.
<br>
<p>Although it has been clear since I was still very
<br>
young that I had a very high IQ, nobody every
<br>
understood how I experienced the world - and mutually,
<br>
I never understood why others reacted as they
<br>
did.  The diagnosis made when I was 20 was that
<br>
I had something &quot;related to autism&quot;, which pretty
<br>
correct also in regard to the fact that I experience
<br>
&quot;reality&quot; in such a different way, that others
<br>
including the psychologist, never could comprehend
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>By far my strongest points are abstract comprehension
<br>
(thinking about infinite dimensions and non-lineair
<br>
associations as conceptual objects comes natural to
<br>
me) and analytic insight.  It was only at the age
<br>
of 18 however that I first understood the concept of
<br>
emotions (and that other people actually used them
<br>
as part of the decision making) and made a start with
<br>
trying to analyse human relationships and social
<br>
interaction, by far the hardest problem I ever set
<br>
my mind to.  In the meantime my own emotions fought
<br>
to get into balance with my rational side and I
<br>
started to study them in full, too.  I didn't understand
<br>
them at that time however (that is, I didn't understand
<br>
were they came from).  Unlike subconscious reasoning,
<br>
emotions come from so deep that it often isn't clear
<br>
why you feel them.  Especially in that early time.
<br>
<p>One emotion that started to especially puzzle me was
<br>
a feeling of lonelyness.  It was only at the age of 26
<br>
that I finally cracked the reason behind that feeling:
<br>
then I finally realized that I was aware of 'thoughts'
<br>
that could not be expressed in words - moreover, they
<br>
took about 80% of my &quot;perception&quot; (for me, I discovered,
<br>
my internal thought processes were so real and _present_
<br>
that they were more important then for instance visual
<br>
perception - or better, I first realized that this was
<br>
NOT the case for other people.  In other words, the
<br>
largest part of my &quot;world&quot; could not be communicated.
<br>
What I needed in order to liberate me from my burning
<br>
desire for contact with other human beings turned out
<br>
to be telepathy, because there was no other way to
<br>
exchange the thoughts that I was aware of.  However,
<br>
that was only the start.  Finally I could put my finger
<br>
on the awareness of these thoughts and start to study
<br>
them (and analyse them) in more detail.  In the Netherlands
<br>
we have a saying: &quot;Not seeing the forest through the trees&quot;
<br>
and that was how I felt; I'd always been aware of these
<br>
(subconscious) thoughts, I just didn't SEE them because
<br>
they had been such a natural presence all my life.
<br>
<p>For a few years I analysed my own thought processes,
<br>
trying desperately to understand myself in order to
<br>
overcome my psychological problems as well as from the
<br>
desire to communicate about it with others.
<br>
<p>The result of all these circumstances,
<br>
1) Being more aware of my subconscious thoughts than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my surroundings.
<br>
2) Being highly gifted (IQ in the 'genious' regions)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with analytic insight.
<br>
3) Actually being able to finally (after 8 years!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put my finger on this special awareness, and
<br>
4) Not being TOO crazy so that I still had a chance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to figure out how to communicate about it with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.
<br>
makes me a rather unique specimen of humanity: I know
<br>
how humans think.
<br>
<p>Hopefully now you will understand that when I read about
<br>
the Institute and assumed that here a real effort is
<br>
being made to simulate human thinking in a future AI,
<br>
I had the feeling I just HAD to join to see if I could
<br>
be of assistance with designing it.
