<p>
Actually, apart from the singularity (which was a new idea to
<br>
me recently), I've always been convinced that humanity will
<br>
die unless we manage to get away from this planet and
<br>
colonize other planets.  If not because there is a high risk
<br>
of putting ALL our genes (and everything we every accomplished)
<br>
on one planet together with atom bombs and polution, or because
<br>
soon we'll run out of materials, energy and destroy our environment
<br>
behond the point where we can survive, then because the sun
<br>
will burn up (or explode) in the end.
<br>
<p>If you look at the way the whole industry has evolved till now
<br>
then it isn't reasonable to expect we will change anything until it
<br>
is too late (poisoned atmosphere, more humans then the earth
<br>
and feed and a civilisation that is fragile and will break
<br>
down totally when we don't even get MORE people, MORE pollution
<br>
and MORE raw materials; which is impossible at some point).
<br>
<p>Whether you like it or not, the progress that humanity is
<br>
making (and is needed for the Singularity), like the computer
<br>
market (and needed research fundings) and internet is going
<br>
to fall down when America, or Europe or Japan etc turns into
<br>
an area like Libanon or Irak.  Humanity is constantly on the
<br>
edge of Not Making It.  Perhaps there will not be total self-
<br>
destruction, but surely we won't get another chance to colonize
<br>
other planets, or initiate the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Intelligent people realize this.
<br>
<p>Some react with depression.
<br>
Some react by starting to party and drink alcohol.
<br>
Some react by putting all their energy into initiating the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Buy us some time Evan and use some Love and Understanding
<br>
in your life - that way the next World War might be delayed
<br>
a bit.
