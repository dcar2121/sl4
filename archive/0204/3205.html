Hi Carlo,
<br>
<p>The people on this list are not cooperatively engaged in a concrete attempt
<br>
to create a &quot;real AI&quot; together.
<br>
<p>Discussion on the list tends to involve more general issues.
<br>
<p>However, some of us on the list are individually or as a group engaged in
<br>
such concrete efforts.
<br>
<p>For example:
<br>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky, the list owner, is in the &quot;design phase&quot; of his own
<br>
Singularity-focused real AI implementation efforts; and I believe he is not
<br>
at this point recruiting programmers to help him out.
<br>
<p>Peter Voss, another list member, is in &quot;early implementation phase&quot; of his
<br>
AI system (developed via his startup Adaptive Intelligence Inc.); he is
<br>
recruiting programmers but *I think* only those who live in LA or are wiling
<br>
to relocate.
<br>
<p>And, I and the rest of my &quot;Novamente AI team&quot; are in the midst of the
<br>
implementation phase in our own attempt to make a real AI and bring about
<br>
the Singularity.  If you are interested in potentially joining our effort,
<br>
please e-mail me offlist and we can discuss it.  I believe we are further
<br>
along than any other team in the world pursuing a comparable project.
<br>
Though of course it's possible we are further along in the wrong direction
<br>
;) ... the proof is in the pudding and ours is still brewing!!
<br>
<p>There is no Website on Novamente up yet, but www.novamente.net contains
<br>
links to some info on my previous AI project, the Webmind AI Engine.
<br>
<p>yours,
<br>
Ben Goertzel

<em>&gt; Subject: Introducing myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before posting more I'd like to give a short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduction of myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am what you could consider a typical hacker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in the correct meaning of the word): I program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 hours/day 7 days/week... at least, I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until I got RSI (Repitive Stress Injury).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because now I cannot type anymore all day, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been reading here and there and as such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stumbled over this transhuman stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I subscribed to this mailinglist because I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in the institute and would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what you are doing.  I expected that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main activity is designing an AI, or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss how that needs to designed, so that we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be ready once the hardware is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is my hope that I might be able to help,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only because I've two decades of programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience but mostly because of this rather unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristic of me: I am aware of a great part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my subconscious.  This and other deviations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from 'normal' people haven't made my life very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy; I've been seeing psychologists because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all kinds of problems ever since the age of twelve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I am still seeing one now, at age 37.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although it has been clear since I was still very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young that I had a very high IQ, nobody every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood how I experienced the world - and mutually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never understood why others reacted as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did.  The diagnosis made when I was 20 was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had something &quot;related to autism&quot;, which pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct also in regard to the fact that I experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;reality&quot; in such a different way, that others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the psychologist, never could comprehend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By far my strongest points are abstract comprehension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thinking about infinite dimensions and non-lineair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associations as conceptual objects comes natural to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me) and analytic insight.  It was only at the age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 18 however that I first understood the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions (and that other people actually used them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as part of the decision making) and made a start with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to analyse human relationships and social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction, by far the hardest problem I ever set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my mind to.  In the meantime my own emotions fought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get into balance with my rational side and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started to study them in full, too.  I didn't understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them at that time however (that is, I didn't understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were they came from).  Unlike subconscious reasoning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions come from so deep that it often isn't clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why you feel them.  Especially in that early time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One emotion that started to especially puzzle me was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a feeling of lonelyness.  It was only at the age of 26
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I finally cracked the reason behind that feeling:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I finally realized that I was aware of 'thoughts'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could not be expressed in words - moreover, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took about 80% of my &quot;perception&quot; (for me, I discovered,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my internal thought processes were so real and _present_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they were more important then for instance visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception - or better, I first realized that this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT the case for other people.  In other words, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest part of my &quot;world&quot; could not be communicated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I needed in order to liberate me from my burning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire for contact with other human beings turned out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be telepathy, because there was no other way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange the thoughts that I was aware of.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was only the start.  Finally I could put my finger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the awareness of these thoughts and start to study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them (and analyse them) in more detail.  In the Netherlands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have a saying: &quot;Not seeing the forest through the trees&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that was how I felt; I'd always been aware of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (subconscious) thoughts, I just didn't SEE them because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they had been such a natural presence all my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a few years I analysed my own thought processes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying desperately to understand myself in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome my psychological problems as well as from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to communicate about it with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The result of all these circumstances,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Being more aware of my subconscious thoughts than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of my surroundings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Being highly gifted (IQ in the 'genious' regions)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    with analytic insight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Actually being able to finally (after 8 years!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    put my finger on this special awareness, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Not being TOO crazy so that I still had a chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to figure out how to communicate about it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes me a rather unique specimen of humanity: I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how humans think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully now you will understand that when I read about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Institute and assumed that here a real effort is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being made to simulate human thinking in a future AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had the feeling I just HAD to join to see if I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be of assistance with designing it.
