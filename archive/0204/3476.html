<p>Unfortunately, Egan seems unwilling - or unable? - to make a real break with
<br>
the known.  ...
<br>
This isn't just a problem for Egan. Benford's _Sailing Bright Eternity_ is
<br>
the most disappointing book I have ever read.  ...
<br>
<p><p>Mike LaTorra: Egan does seems to be unusually cautious when it comes to the
<br>
question of greater-than-human intelligence and the Singularity. His only
<br>
statement on this (so far as I know) is what he has put into the mouths of
<br>
his fictional characters.
<br>
<p>Not so with Benford, however, who wrote an essay on this point a few years
<br>
ago (published in Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, if I recall correctly). Benford
<br>
criticized science fiction novels that end with what he termed a
<br>
&quot;transcendental blowout.&quot; He mentioned specific works, including Clarke's
<br>
CHILDHOOD'S END.
<br>
<p>Then, not long after writing those words (perhaps even coincident with
<br>
them), he got Clarke's permission to re-write and extend the storyline in
<br>
Clarke's THE CITY AND THE STARS. I had read the original many years ago and
<br>
absolutely loved it. I read Benford's version and was revolted.
<br>
<p><p>*** WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! re: THE CITY AND THE STARS / both versions ***
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>In Clarke's THE CITY AND THE STARS original, the main character/hero Alvin
<br>
leaves earth's high-tech city, Diaspar, in which he had been born, and the
<br>
bucolic community, Lys, which he had discovered (the cities having broken
<br>
communication with one another ages earlier). He learns that the story he
<br>
had been told about mankind nearly being exterminated by aliens was a myth
<br>
designed to keep people from following the majority of humans into deep
<br>
space. Alvin finds a spaceship and flies off in pursuit of the majority of
<br>
humanity who had gone off toward some mysterious cosmic goal.
<br>
<p>In his version, Benford turns back from Clarke's cosmic conclusion (which
<br>
hinted at some kind of transcension for the majority of mankind). Clarke's
<br>
nearly mystical conclusion was, one might say from Benford's perspective, a
<br>
&quot;god too big.&quot; In place of that, Benford literally creates a small,
<br>
intelligent, four-legged creature who is, in my opinion, a &quot;god too small.&quot;
<br>
And I mean &quot;god&quot; literally here because that is what this little fur ball
<br>
claims to be at the end of Benford's version. Very UNinspiring. Very
<br>
UNtranscendent. Ecology and its balancing were the purview of this little
<br>
godling. Although that ecology had been developed to include a kind of space
<br>
elevator and some interplanetary craft, it was still somehow too cozy, too
<br>
conservative, too small and too bland. No one had become transhuman,
<br>
post-human or superintelligent. Everyone had become stultified and boring.
