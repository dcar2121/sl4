a mildly successful way for a meme to continue to propagate, since it

the meme that was so great.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I doubt this.  Let's jump in the Way Back Machine to see why ...
<br>
<p>So, here I am, in the ancestoral environment.  I'm amongst a tribe of 
<br>
about 150 humans.  They live close together and can spy on each other 
<br>
fairly easily.  While a few can hide a little, human societies work 
<br>
because you can't go against society without some consequences, so 
<br>
there's always someone sticking his or her nose into someone else's 
<br>
business.  One day Unk is caught not sharing the chicken he caught.  
<br>
Well, everyone knows that Unk's family has gone without meet for a few 
<br>
weeks, so they let this pass.  A few days later, he catches another 
<br>
chicken and again shares none of it.  When he does this the third time, 
<br>
people are pissed.  The solution:  beat him.  Maybe rape his wife and 
<br>
kill one of his children, too.  Unk is upset and he fights a few of his 
<br>
neighbors and manages to bloody them a little.  After that Unk is a good 
<br>
human and mostly gets along in society.
<br>
<p>Now we take the Way Back Machine into the future (yes, we're going 
<br>
negatively backwards):
<br>
<p>So, here I am in the year 2015 where nanotech spy technology is 
<br>
everywhere.  Just yesterday Knu (the great great great ... great 
<br>
grandson of Unk--unless of course the village had managed to get his 
<br>
wife pregnant that time Unk did not share his chicken) was caught by his 
<br>
neighbors cracking the encryption on a DVC (digital video cube) and 
<br>
watching every Inspector Clouseau film without paying $5 a minute to the 
<br>
MPAA like all other good, god-fearing people do.  Since the MPAA doesn't 
<br>
know about this, his neighbors kindly decide to inform them.  With the 
<br>
press of a button, the MPAA sends out nanobots to Knu's home and has it 
<br>
liquidated.  Literally.  Knu, soaking wet and pissed, is still fully 
<br>
capable, unlike his long dead relative Unk who was badly bruised and 
<br>
only able to throw a punch or two before a fight was over.  Using the 
<br>
assembler at the nearby Kinko's, Knu builds and sends out some nanobots 
<br>
to liquidate this neighbors houses to get revenge.  But, as it turns 
<br>
out, Knu is not the best programmer, so his nanobots accidently 
<br>
liquidate the Earth.  The dolphins enjoy all the extra space (now 
<br>
they're really thanking humans for all the fish :-P) but humans are dead 
<br>
or drowning.
<br>
<p>Back in the e-mail I'm writing right now:
<br>
<p>So, as we see, humans don't really change, just the technology does.  
<br>
Consequently, humans with technology that can destroy the world are very 
<br>
dangerous.  It's mostly through luck that we have managed not to nuke 
<br>
ourselves out of existence or back to the stone age.  One day someone 
<br>
with nuclear weapons or nanotech or something is going to probably kill 
<br>
everything on Earth.  For many of us, the push to reach the Singularity 
<br>
as quickly as possible is that the longer we wait the more likely it is 
<br>
that we'll be caught on Earth when someone decides to blow it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Side note. Has there been any thought about going towards a standard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; units way of mesuring intelligence. For example a Super Intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be a Mega-intellignce. Meaning 1 million times more intelligent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the average human being. Then a whole new world of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exa-intelligences etc would be available, prehuman could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deci-intelligent or centi :) Or is this just a silly idea.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's not completely silly, but the problem is finding some way of 
<br>
measuring intelligence.  What kind of tool are you going to use to tell 
<br>
me the intelligence of one human?  What other units is intelligence 
<br>
defined in (you have to have some standard to measure against)?  While 
<br>
it may be possible to do intelligence ratings, there isn't a clear way 
<br>
to do it right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will have to read Vinge, you can't get him on the high street over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, although you can get Zindell. Strange isn't it.
</em><br>
<p>/A Fire upon the Deep/ and /A Deepness in the Sky/ share the cynical 
<br>
view that I have for humanities future if it continues at its current 
<br>
level of intelligence with bigger and badder toys.  While fiction is 
<br>
just that, I think Vinge illustrates an important, observable fact about 
<br>
intelligence and its technological limits.
