<em>&gt; Having read some of the archives this list seems very hostile to any memes that try to suggest any other scenario than Friendly Ai/sysop. I had hoped that this would be a place for all future shock. But it doesn't seem to be. For example I haven't found a single thread that has been fully discussing a different way to the singularity apart from sysop. Any threads that have been started are all destroyed by the sysop memes, they are not given constructive criticism. This is what I feel, I may be wrong.
</em><br>
<p>It may be that the &quot;sysop&quot; meme, or more properly the &quot;intelligent
<br>
substrate&quot;/&quot;singleton&quot; family of memes, is killing off other ideas simply
<br>
because more work has gone into visualizing intelligent substrate
<br>
scenarios.  Hopefully this is not the case and the intelligent substrate
<br>
scenarios are winning because they are, in fact, the best ideas discussed so
<br>
far on SL4.  If not, eventually someone will come along with an idea that,
<br>
being stronger, kills and devours the intelligent substrate scenarios.
<br>
<p>But SL4 tends to be a place for people with fully developed arguments to
<br>
test those arguments against the strongest criticism available, not a place
<br>
where weak new ideas are nurtured in the light of approval.  There are other
<br>
mailing lists for that.  Weak ideas here tend to be killed off instantly,
<br>
not because the list members are intolerant of any ideas except the one idea
<br>
they hold, but because we have had a lot of experience in detecting weak
<br>
ideas.  I find that this is a frequent point of confusion with people who
<br>
are used to an environment where all ideas are equally plausible because the
<br>
state of knowledge is insufficiently advanced to rule out ideas that seem
<br>
initially attractive.  Usually &quot;futurism&quot; is like this.  People just make up
<br>
whatever scenario appeals to them, because nobody knows enough to rule
<br>
anything out.  At least that's the way it is at cocktail parties or random
<br>
online IRC channels when the topic drifts to futurism.  In such forums, if
<br>
someone doesn't like your idea, it may be because that person is intolerant
<br>
of any ideas except their own.
<br>
<p>On SL4, speculation about futurism has gotten a lot farther than it has in
<br>
other forums.  I don't need to believe that mine is the one true way to
<br>
shoot down a wide range of constructs that would seem superficially
<br>
plausible on a random IRC channel.  We know about more constraints.  Now it
<br>
may be that eventually someone will come along who knows about even more
<br>
constraints, and that my own ideas will be either destroyed or devoured. 
<br>
But such is life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
