<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I'm not expecting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;next&quot; world war.  I do not believe we are always on the verge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it, or at the edge of a precipice, or any other doom clichae - eve of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destruction, gotta get that one in.  I recognize problems, but my
</em><br>
outlook
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isn't the bleak one you seem to have.  If I was really that down on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future, I would have packed it in decades ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that we do not have an adequate knowledge base to make
</em><br>
sound
<br>
<em>&gt; rational judgments about such things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do not have a knowledge base about past technological civilizations,
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; which we can induce the probability of the human race ruining itself via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nukes, biological warfare, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, I think, anyone's opinion on such matters is bound to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective and philosophical than empirical &amp; objective.
</em><br>
<p><p>That's fine.  I can buy that.  But when I asked Eliezer why he believed we
<br>
were toast if his project didn't come off, he sent me to Friendly AI, which
<br>
doesn't contain an answer to the question.  If he just believes it because
<br>
his gut tells him, then why doesn't he just say so?
<br>
<p>I *don't* believe it.  But I freely admit my biases.  I don't believe it
<br>
partly because I see evidence that modern societies are more dynamic, stable
<br>
and resourceful than past ones.  True, we have more deadly weapons, and
<br>
individuals are relatively more powerful than they've ever been; and they
<br>
will become increasingly so as time goes on.  But the system' of society as
<br>
a whole is also more able to handle such threats better than past societies
<br>
were.  I think the history of computer viruses is a good example:  They are
<br>
much easier to write than ever before, and more people are writing them and
<br>
there are far more opportunities for them to spread than ever before.  But
<br>
the damage they do proportional to the size of the internet is relatively
<br>
slight compared with the *relative* damage of, say, the internet worm that
<br>
that guy Morris put out back in '88 or '89.  The knowledge to protect and
<br>
defend against such things has grown faster than the damage a small group or
<br>
individual can do.
<br>
<p>I think the same case can be made for such things as nanocomputers, among
<br>
other things.  The more people who have knowledge of these things and how
<br>
they work, the harder it will be for some rogue(s) to create something that
<br>
can wreak real havoc..
<br>
<p>But aside from that, I simply believe WITHOUT PROOF that we are unlikely.
<br>
Perhaps I simply do not want to believe that we would be so unfortunate, or
<br>
stupid, or apathetic to cause all of humanity to be wiped out.  I admit
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>But my viewpoint is at least *partly* based on what I consider evidence..  I
<br>
recognize that others come to different conclusions.  But it is not ALL just
<br>
gut feeling.  I certainly see the *possibility* of any number of catelysims,
<br>
but possibility and likelyhood are two very different things.  If Eliezer
<br>
has evidence for his view that death is the alternative to his seed AI
<br>
project, and it isn't JUST gut feeling, he hasn't been forthcoming with it
<br>
so far.
<br>
<p>Hey, I was just asking.
