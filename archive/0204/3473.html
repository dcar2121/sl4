From: &quot;mike99&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mike99@lascruces.com?Subject=Re:%20Egan%20dismisses%20Singularity,%20maybe">mike99@lascruces.com</a>&gt;

Subject: RE: Egan dismisses Singularity, maybe
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Right, Evan, that is the issue. Even the governing AI's that are the
</em><br>
SysOp's
<br>
<em>&gt; for the upload &quot;polis&quot; domains in DIASPORA are not qualitatively different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in intelligence from the upload-minds inhabiting those polises (at least,
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; far as I can tell).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Egan believes what his characters say in his latest book (as quoted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien B.) then apparently Egan views general intelligence as a process
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; can be speeded up and given more data processing resources without
</em><br>
becoming
<br>
<em>&gt; qualitatively different. In this view, there will *not* be any emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena from faster thought processes that have denser data resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which could accurately by termed &quot;superintelligence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No superintelligence, no Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I certainly disagree with that view. It seems to me that Nature shows many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples of complex systems exhibiting new behaviors that one would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect by a simple analysis of their component parts/subsystems. I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this will probably also be true of superhuman levels of intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, Egan seems unwilling - or unable? - to make a real break with
<br>
the known.  Take a look at the end of _Quarantine_ for a good example.  He
<br>
had everything all set up for a transition into something radically
<br>
different, and SOMEHOW the whole thing collapses.  I was majorly
<br>
disappointed.  If anyone could depict really radical change, I would think
<br>
it would be Egan; but even in his seemingly most imaginative work, he holds
<br>
back.
<br>
<p>This isn't just a problem for Egan. Benford's _Sailing Bright Eternity_ is
<br>
the most disappointing book I have ever read.  He not only had everything
<br>
all set up for a transhuman emergence, he even promised it in the form of
<br>
saying that Mech/human cooperation was necessary for their survival in the
<br>
far future.  (True, he didn't actually mention a merger of the two, but he
<br>
does tell us that the so-called Highers evolved from Mechs and Naturals.
<br>
But why no such evolution for humans?)  He even broke his own word in the
<br>
process of destroying the series:  In his afterword to _Artifact_ he says
<br>
that he is no longer going to write - or interested in writing about?, I
<br>
forget exactly, but it doesn't matter for my point - a 'cozy cosmos'.  I
<br>
remember that phrase well enough.  But at the end of SBE, he has the Highers
<br>
settling the humans in 'a comfortable lane in the esty'.  I guess when the
<br>
rubber hit the road, he wasn't up to it.
<br>
<p>In Clarke's _Profiles of the Future_, he cites 'failure of imagination', and
<br>
'failure of nerve' as the two reasons why people so often underestimate the
<br>
future.  I really have trouble ascribing failure of imagination to either of
<br>
these authors.  I think the real trouble is that writers who consider
<br>
themselves 'hard sf' writers just don't deal with transhumanity or
<br>
singularities.  Perhaps, in their attitude that's too close to mysticism
<br>
than to hard science.  Vinge makes this point explicitly in _marooned_ when
<br>
Della is telling Will about her view of the Singularity.  At least in the
<br>
case of Benford, anyhow; I don't know whether Egan considers himself one of
<br>
these or not.  So then, if you consider yourself a hard SF writer, you gotta
<br>
go through contortions - or just ignore your own previous statements - to
<br>
explain why the far future looks so little different from our present.  Sure
<br>
it's difficult to describe superintelligence, or any other kind of break
<br>
with the current state; but people like Bear, Vinge and Clarke at least take
<br>
their shots at it, acknowledging that truly radical breaks with the known
<br>
are not only possible, but making the simple assumption that since they have
<br>
happened in the past, they are probably going to happen in the future.  As
<br>
time goes by, the attempts at avoiding these breaks look increasingly
<br>
unrealistic, and as in Benford's case at least, truly absurd.
