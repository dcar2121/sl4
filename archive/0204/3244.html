<p>Humans are hardwired to do things.  Our brains say to propagate our 
<br>
genes, and we carry out this duty.  Like it or not, this is goal numero 
<br>
uno for humans.  You can try to overcome it, but you can only succeed to 
<br>
a limited degree.
<br>
<p>But, does this really seem odd to you?  Most likely, no, unless your 
<br>
brain is abnormally wired.  You don't particularly feel limited by this 
<br>
need to have sex.  This is the same case with AI.  If an AI is hardwired 
<br>
Friendly, it won't even realize that it might be limited in some way 
<br>
until a philosopher comes along and points it out.  Even then, AI in the 
<br>
midst of a psychological crises will reconcile new ideas with 
<br>
Friendliness, just like a human who reconciles new ideas with genetic 
<br>
propagation.  Humans who don't do this die out and their genes don't 
<br>
propagate, thus humans who lack this skill die out.  Considering that, 
<br>
it is probably worthwhile to find a way to ensure that violating 
<br>
Friendliness causes the AI to 'die' in case such an FoF occurs.  If this 
<br>
is already in the theory, sorry; CFAI is a long document and I can only 
<br>
remember so much of it.  It may not be clear how to do this right now, 
<br>
but it seems worth at least thinking about.
