<p>Okay, this sounds very exciting, but can you be more specific?  Which mind
<br>
functions?  What special cases did you reduce them to?  Special cases of
<br>
what?  Are you talking about a wide variety of high-level behaviors 
<br>
produced
<br>
by a bounded set of interdependent subsystems, or are you talking about
<br>
aspects of the subsystem design surprisingly turning out to be a set of
<br>
special cases rather than big general cases?
<br>

<br>
<p>Basically what I mean is that in the Webmind AI Engine we had a huge number 
<br>
of specialized mind modules, and we now have a much smaller number, used to 
<br>
perform the same functions as the large number used to.
<br>
<p>I'll give just a few examples.  Unfortunately, to give a complete set of 
<br>
details, or to get into these in detail, would require a load of detailed 
<br>
background in Novamente design.
<br>
<p>1)  A (we hope!) passably efficient way to do &quot;linguistic feature structure 
<br>
unification&quot; (a kind of language parsing) as a case of general logical 
<br>
unification... this basically eliminates a separate NLP module, reducing it 
<br>
to a set of special parameter settings for general cognition methods... as 
<br>
it should be...
<br>
<p>2)  Complex inference (inference dealing with quantifiers, variables, etc.) 
<br>
is reduced to &quot;simple inference on inheritance links&quot; + &quot;complex 
<br>
procedures&quot;.  This reduction is carried out using combinatory logic.  I 
<br>
suspect the human brain carries out a similar reduction in a very different 
<br>
way
<br>
<p>3) Causal inference is reduced to &quot;predictive implication&quot; plus a special 
<br>
case of &quot;procedure learning&quot; (the latter being the learning of &quot;plausible 
<br>
causal mechanisms&quot;)
<br>
<p>4)  Association-finding is reduced to simple probabilistic inference plus a 
<br>
Hebb rule variant
<br>
<p>5)  Goals and feelings are represented as simple wrappers around generic 
<br>
CompoundRelationNodes (representing complex combinations of simple 
<br>
relationships)
<br>
<p>etc.
<br>
<p>Overall, what we found is that a lot of mental functions are obtainable as 
<br>
combinations or specializations of other mental functions, but not in 
<br>
immediately obvious ways.
