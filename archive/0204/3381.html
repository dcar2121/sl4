Daniel Amit's book on Neural Networks (I forget the title) is a very good 
<br>
overview of the scope of work in Hopfield nets.  There has been a lot of 
<br>
neat stuff done using asymmetric weights, temporal learning, and so forth.
<br>
<p>I don't think there is a standard opinion on the biological relevance of 
<br>
these models.  There are advocates and there are detractors.  My own view 
<br>
is that they are a good conceptual model of how the brain probably stores 
<br>
*some types of memories*.  But when you get into the storage of temporal 
<br>
sequences of events and so forth, the details of attractor neural nets (the 
<br>
other term for hopfield nets) get awfully nasty, and one starts to wonder 
<br>
if there's not a better way.
<br>
<p>An interesting, too little known variation on this theme is Mikhail Zak's 
<br>
work on &quot;terminal chaos.&quot;  He has made some interesting attractor neural 
<br>
net models using equations with mathematical singularities in them, 
<br>
achieving some favorable practical results in various experiments...
<br>
<p>One fact, from an AI engineering point of view, is that hopfield nets are a 
<br>
very inefficient way to store memories.  The standard symmetric-weight 
<br>
hopfield net stores at most .14n floats worth of  memory using n*n neural 
<br>
net links.  Furthermore the networks fill up with memories very quickly, 
<br>
and then can't learn anything more.  If you put caps on the link weights, 
<br>
you can get a network that continually forgets old memories when its memory 
<br>
gets full, so it can learn new things.  But then the memory capacity goes 
<br>
down to .05n.   Some good results can be obtained with sparse (not fully 
<br>
connected) networks -- Youlian Troyanov and I did some experiments on this 
<br>
in 1998 -- but the bottom line is this is not an efficient way to store 
<br>
information.   So even if it is roughly analogous to how the brain stores 
<br>
some kinds of memories, it is in my view only an appropriate approach in 
<br>
cases where one has a HELL of a lot of memory to waste storing information 
<br>
redundantly...
<br>
<p>The question with such memory schemes is always whether cognitive 
<br>
processing is accelerated enough to compensate for the waste of space.  Are 
<br>
we just making a time-space tradeoff, and is it a good one?  In the case of 
<br>
hopfield nets I don't think there is any adequate compensating cognitive 
<br>
advantage however.  One can do partial matching of memories nicely in a 
<br>
hopfield net, but there are more efficient ways to do that on a digital 
<br>
computer, without so much redundancy of storage.
<br>
<p>This sort of reasoning is why we wound up not using attractor neural net 
<br>
type knowledge representation in Novamente, although we use NN-style 
<br>
dynamics for some other purposes (for adaptively allocating the system's 
<br>
attention)

Subject:	Hopfield networks as a model of memory?
<br>
<p>Eliezer and I discussed how neural networks could &quot;recognize&quot; a
<br>
previously learned stimulus.  We both sort of agreed that &quot;resonance&quot;
<br>
was a commonly proposed description for this computation but we sort of
<br>
left it there without getting any more specific.  Anyways, I writing up
<br>
an assignment for a 4th year AI class and I came across Hopfield
<br>
networks -- I would suggest that these networks are probably pretty
<br>
decent models, in the abstract sense, of how our neural networks
<br>
recognize objects.
<br>
<p>I must admit that I only have the chapter on &quot;Associative Memory&quot; from
<br>
the fairly standard text &quot;Intro to The Theory of Neural Computation&quot; to
<br>
work from at the moment.
<br>
<p>What is the standard opinion in more learned circles about this neural
<br>
network's similarity to the biological processes?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
