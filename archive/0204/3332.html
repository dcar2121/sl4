</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's several billion years from now, and I think we'll be able to

handle

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  That climate change is a threat is not bogus. Nor is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger inherent in a full atomic exchange (which is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately possible), or wreaking the ozone layer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overeating the planet, or being whacked by a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kilometers of nickel-iron meteor.  All of these and more are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real danger as long as we are on one planet and at our present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of effective intelligence.  If we develop nanotech at our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present level of effective intelligence and wisdom there is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite considerable threat along with promise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The fact that the climate is warming is not bogus, but the climate change is
<br>
a threat is.  It comes about from the generalized fear of change that is a
<br>
part of many people's outlook.  The geological shows that a warmer Earth
<br>
than the one we have now is far from a threat..
<br>
<p>As far as these others:  There is a big difference between 'possible' and
<br>
'real danger'.  At the rate tech is advancing, if a rock doesn't blam us in
<br>
the next 30 years, then it's not a threat; before that time, it's irrational
<br>
to worry about something we are in no position to deal with.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Nuclear exchange?  Between whom?  The only other country with enough nukes
<br>
to threaten a worldwide catastrophe is Russia, and the possibility of an
<br>
exchange between us and them is remote.  Certainly, other countries have
<br>
some, and others will have them in the future; but a few detonations -
<br>
tragic though that may be - does not a racial wipeout make.  You need a lot
<br>
more than any of these countries have - or will have presingularity - for
<br>
any real danger of that.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;If you look at the way the whole industry has evolved till now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;then it isn't reasonable to expect we will change anything until it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;is too late (poisoned atmosphere, more humans then the earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;and feed and a civilisation that is fragile and will break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;down totally when we don't even get MORE people, MORE pollution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;and MORE raw materials; which is impossible at some point).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The atmosphere is a lot cleaner now than it was even 20, let alone 50
</em><br>
years
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ago.  The population in the developed world is already below replacement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level, and the rest of the world is showing signs of leveling off as
</em><br>
well.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I said, bogus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world is also a bit hotter and the ozone hole is relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new on that timescale. Way too much of our human resources are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undereducated, undernourished and so on to be of maximum benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to themselves and all of us.  Most of our intelligence, energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and resources is used in the goal of accumulating more monetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tokens than all those others one is in competition with.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current scarcity based model imho, can lead to not much better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even in the face of real physical and information abundance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Those are - in themselves - not very good things, but they hardly constitute
<br>
an 'Eve of Destruction' scenario.  I think you're being self-indulgent - as
<br>
many moderns are - who are still in a paleolithic mindset, looking around
<br>
for threats from the predators and worrying about whether the crops will be
<br>
flooded out or dry up and blow away and all those other threats our
<br>
ancestors had to face just to survive.  (Someone should write a book called
<br>
_The Maladapted Mind_ showing how many of our ancient adapted mentality is
<br>
out of step with the modern society.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether you like it or not, the progress that humanity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;making (and is needed for the Singularity), like the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;market (and needed research fundings) and internet is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;to fall down when America, or Europe or Japan etc turns into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;an area like Libanon or Irak.  Humanity is constantly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;edge of Not Making It.  Perhaps there will not be total self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;destruction, but surely we won't get another chance to colonize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;other planets, or initiate the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; U.s. turning into something like Lebanon or Iraq?  Where's your evidence
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this nutty statement?  Yes, nutty.  I stand by my description.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well we do have a rabid evangelical at the head of Justice, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president who many will argue was not duly elected and who does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not read his briefing papers generally but has them read to him,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cabinet full of relics from 10-20 years ago administration,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing attacks on human rights and security of person and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects, a much larger percentage of people in jail than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other nation, a press that is overly-homogenized and sanitized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a wacky notion of never ending war againt &quot;the Evil Ones&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you advocate just turning the other cheek to those responsible for
<br>
911, but I do not.  So you disagree with - or don't like - whose in office.
<br>
There are forces militating against the extremes these people *might* in
<br>
their heart of hearts want to go to that do not exist in dictatorships.
<br>
That's what checks and balances are for.  They work pretty well, overall; so
<br>
I think your unrealistically extrapolating what some of these people *might*
<br>
like to do into actual actions that won't happen under our system of
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>The media is a helluva lot bigger than the big media companies (I guess)
<br>
you're thinking of.  I can get news from all over the world, so can anyone
<br>
else with an account.  So even if you are correct, it is immaterial.  The
<br>
world is more than just the U.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have forces working hard to kill the power of nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitless access to information and computational capability. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, imho, this country could very quickly go to the dogs.  Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it be like Lebanon or Iraq?  Dunno.  But if it doesn't change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its course where it ends up will almost certainly not be pretty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are always opposing forces in 'life, the universe, and everything'.
<br>
The question is:  Which direction is the tide flowing?  I think the tide is
<br>
flowing toward a positive future, and it only gets more powerful with
<br>
passing time.  Some people want to control information or resources for
<br>
their own selfish ends; they always have.  They'll either realize which way
<br>
the wind (changing metaphors in midstream, here) is blowing and tack
<br>
accordingly, or get smashed against the shoals of history.  The collapse of
<br>
the Soviet Union is only the most prominent recent example of this.  The
<br>
list could be expanded at great length.
<br>
<p>Change to what?  Everybody wants changes of some kind or another.  I want
<br>
some things to change, as well.  The difference between us is that I do not
<br>
have apocoliptic visions if things don't turn out the way I'd prefer.  Maybe
<br>
that's where you need to get your energy from to move forward.  If so,
<br>
that's unfortunate.  But I don't feel a threat of doom hanging over me to
<br>
motivate me to act.  I think that's a sad way to live if that's the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Intelligent people realize this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You mean that anyone who doesn't see things the way you do isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Some react with depression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Some react by starting to party and drink alcohol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Some react by putting all their energy into initiating the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I never said, nor would I say, that people should not invest their
</em><br>
energies
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in advancing the singularity.  (Although I don't think it will really
</em><br>
affect
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the arrival date one iota.)  I was simply asking Eliezer why he thought
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much effort was necessary to advance something that is already advancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quite rapidly, and why he seemed to think humanity was toast if it
</em><br>
didn't
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; come off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If people do not invest in Singularity it will not happen or we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not survive it.  Why?  Because without investment in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits of increasing techological prowess and direction toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goals that truly lead to abundance AND greater effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, we could easily degenerate socially and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically to the point where a deadly war or getting caught by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other tragedy is quite likely before the point of no return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Singularity is acheived.  If we are together enough on a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; footing to keep advancing to the point of no return then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escalation of ultra-high-tech weaponry will very likely finish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us off before we pass Singularity.  Our weapons and their brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may survive us but I doubt we will survive them.
</em><br>
<p>As I've already said, I don't believe any of this
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I would advise people to work toward Singularity and toward a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of psychology and sociology geared toward abundance and .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing an unlimited future.  I would advise everyone to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward it as if your life and the life and destiny of the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human race depends on it.  Because it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No, it doesn't
