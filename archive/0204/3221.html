</em><br>
<p>Okay, this sounds very exciting, but can you be more specific?  Which mind
<br>
functions?  What special cases did you reduce them to?  Special cases of
<br>
what?  Are you talking about a wide variety of high-level behaviors produced
<br>
by a bounded set of interdependent subsystems, or are you talking about
<br>
aspects of the subsystem design surprisingly turning out to be a set of
<br>
special cases rather than big general cases?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, I agree, creating Real AI is not easy.  But this year it feels easier

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente design.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, it's easier for you to go down the current path you're going.  Where
<br>
is that path leading?  How far are you currently along that path?  From what
<br>
I've seen so far you seem to think that this is the path leading directly to
<br>
Real AI.  But I'm no longer sure what you mean by Real AI.  Obviously Real
<br>
AI includes something that a human would intuitively recognize as a person,
<br>
but what else does it include for you?  Does it include everything that I
<br>
would call &quot;a functioning deliberative supersystem&quot;?  Because I would
<br>
consider that the first grand milestone, or epoch, not the last one.
<br>
<p>I realize that I have no code, but I have put my design online and let
<br>
people judge it, with another major update coming Extremely Soon Now.  I
<br>
haven't seen your design yet, I haven't seen your code, I haven't heard any
<br>
walkthrough &quot;AI stories&quot;, and I haven't heard any reports of what it is
<br>
exactly that Webmind or Novamente do - except for text categorization and
<br>
stock market observation and so on, which you could be accomplishing in any
<br>
number of ways aside from what I would regard as &quot;Real AI&quot;.  Sure, having
<br>
led an AI project gives you a lot of credibility, but there still comes a
<br>
point when I want to have some specific knowledge to reason on when I'm
<br>
trying to figure out how far you've gotten.  I can see that you've gotten
<br>
over the Deadly Sin of AI in which you only use one idea, but there are
<br>
other Deadly Sins.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand that your opinions on this topic are strongly felt and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons underlying them.  But the fact is, you have never led an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all-in-one-place development team, *nor* a substantial broadly-distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development team.  This doesn't mean your intuitions are wrong, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it does give me less inclination to accept them.
</em><br>
<p>Ben, why would I rely only on my own intuitions in a case where it's easy to
<br>
just ask people?  I've checked with people who have more software
<br>
development experience.  I checked with *you*, remember?  You said that
<br>
while you started Webmind Inc. believing in distributed development and had
<br>
people scattered all over the place, if you wanted to do it all over you'd
<br>
rather have had everyone in one place.  If you've changed your mind since
<br>
then, I'll take that into consideration, but I will not actually change my
<br>
current plan, because all the *other* experienced software developers I've
<br>
talked to about this have said:  &quot;Yeah, if you want to take a serious shot
<br>
at this you'd better have full-time people on-location, it's not realistic
<br>
otherwise.&quot;
