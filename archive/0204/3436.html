<p>
I must say that I am rather disappointed in Egan's apparent attitude toward
<br>
super-intelligence and the Singularity. Yet, I can't say that I am totally
<br>
surprised by it either. As Eliezer has pointed out in the past, the sentient
<br>
uploads in Egan's novels all seem curiously unenhanced in terms of
<br>
intellectual level. Oh, sure, they live/process at very high speeds (about
<br>
1,000 times human normal in &quot;Diaspora&quot;) but their intellectual quality is
<br>
otherwise within the normal human range. A human IQ equivalent of, say, 200
<br>
may be great and wonderful. But where are the IQ 2000 intellects? Does Egan
<br>
believe that a) such a level is unattainable, or b) faster thinking equals
<br>
greater intelligence?

<em>&gt; It's a capital mistake to confuse a writer with the fiction, let alone one

</em><br>
<em>&gt; LADDER. I'm still reading the book, so for all I know there's a fullblown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike before the end, but I was struck by how Egan's moderately posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figures are placed 20,000 years hence with no mention of anyone having

<em>&gt; ==========
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; `What do you think you're going to find in there [a new region of altered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spacetime]? Some great shining light of transcendence?'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         `Hardly.' _Transcendence_ was a content-free word left over from
</em><br>
religion,
<br>
<em>&gt; but in some moribund planetary cultures it had come to refer to a mythical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of mental restructuring that would result in vastly greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence and a boundless cornucopia of hazy superpowers--if only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details could be perfected, preferably by someone else. It was probably an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appealing notion if you were so lazy that you'd never actually learnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything about the universe you inhabited, and couldn't quite conceive of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting in the effort to do so; this magical cargo of transmogrification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was sure to come along eventually and render the need superfluous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Tchicaya said, `I already possess general intelligence, thanks. I
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt; need anything more.' It was a rigorous result in information theory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once you learn in a sufficiently flexible manner--something humanity had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieved in the Bronze Age--the only limits you faced were speed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage; all other structural changes were just a matter of style.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ==================================
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer S. Yudkowsky replied:
<br>
<p>... However, Tchicaya's tone sounds too harsh to be just patching up a plot
<br>
hole.  I strongly suspect that Violet Mosala of &quot;Distress&quot; is standing in
<br>
for Greg Egan when she attacks pseudoscience, and Tchicaya in the quoted
<br>
passage sounds a lot like Violet Mosala.  I think Greg Egan probably
<br>
believes what's written above - although, since Amazon still says &quot;Schild's
<br>
Ladder&quot; isn't available in the US, all I know about the entire novel is the
<br>
one paragraph Damien posted.  But it does seem consistent with the picture
<br>
painted in &quot;Diaspora&quot;, or for that matter Peer carving table legs in
<br>
&quot;Permutation City&quot;.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>So, even in terms of what we can figure out today, I would have to say that
<br>
Tchicaya is, in all probability, flat wrong, and that this probably reflects
<br>
an identical mistake by Egan.
