<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the Fermi Paradox is perfectly obvious.  Certain places in
<br>
the universe have conditions which are conducive to the development of
<br>
pre-intelligent biotic life.  This pre-intelligent life sometimes if many
<br>
factors are within limits generate self modifying psuedo intelligence-like
<br>
structures.  These structures logically evolve to the creation of actual
<br>
intelligences.  True intelligence is defined as completely self aware and
<br>
self modifying systems.  The form of this pre-intelligent life is DNA based.
<br>
The form of this true intelligence is nanotechnologically based.  The whole
<br>
point of Fermi's use of propulsion measurements was to show that we are very
<br>
likely in the light cones of many true intelligent civilizations.  And with
<br>
current speculations on more advanced propulsion systems and any reasonable
<br>
estimates on the probable development of civilizations in other systems the
<br>
argument becomes stronger.  Even with the little we know about the
<br>
capabilities of full nanotech we understand that the equivalent functional
<br>
substrate of a nanotech body compared to a DNA body is thousands of times
<br>
smaller.  And without(and because of) the limitations of biologically
<br>
evolved brains true intelligence is beyond our comprehension.  Therefore,
<br>
the answer is perfectly obvious.  They are here.  They are watching this
<br>
experiment to see what kind of intelligence evolves here.  At our
<br>
pre-intelligent stage there is no one here worth talking to.  They are
<br>
butterflies.  Ever notice how some butterflies are easy to catch while
<br>
others always stay out of reach?  The different species represent the
<br>
different civilizations of origin.  Watch the skies.  Beware of butterflies.
