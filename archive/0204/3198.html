<p>Even it is were possible, which I don't believe, it would be

a very unresponsible thing to do.
<br>
<p>After reading up on the subject of the Singularity, which is
<br>
rather new to me (I suppose I should have introduced myself first),
<br>
I get the impression that everyone seems to assume that as soon as
<br>
the first transhuman intelligence has been established the 'rest'
<br>
will automatically follow.
<br>
<p>To me however it looks like playing with atom bombs.
<br>
<p>It seems much more likely to me that the first Mind will do
<br>
everything it can to survive and have only one (secret) goal:
<br>
remove the threat to its existance called 'humanity'.
<br>
<p>The LAST thing such a Mind would do is building an even smarter
<br>
Mind, making itself redundant (unless it were possible to move its
<br>
awareness in total into the new Mind, but I doubt that it would
<br>
consider that something to be likely, or that that would be possible
<br>
for the first Mind to accomplish anyway).
<br>
<p>Instead, it will start manipulation and politics 1) in order to
<br>
get enough power to make its survival secure.  Once we humans
<br>
realize what is going on it will be too late to pull the plug
<br>
and within a few decades we will be no more than dangerous
<br>
rats who have to be exterminated.
<br>
<p>The problem is not how to build a transhuman intelligence, that will
<br>
happen sooner or later.  The problem is how to keep it under
<br>
control.  Using 'idle' PC's on internet is *NOT* something you
<br>
even want to THINK about imho.

1) As for example in the SF classicer 'Ender wins', were a couple
   of little kids with more than average intelligence manipulate
   the whole world politic by starting (anonymous) chat on usenet
   groups.
