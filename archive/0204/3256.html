Subject: Re: Reverse shock level

<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I think &quot;the singularity&quot; will either be some totally arbitrary mile
</em><br>
posts,
<br>
<em>&gt; which in retrospect will appear small, or some phantom image in front of
</em><br>
us
<br>
<em>&gt; that we'll continually redefine as &quot;now plus a little more&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Singularity will be when we can extend our lives indefinitely.
<br>
(See explaination below).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel I've wasted years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>(Sigh)  Me too.
<br>
Let's not waste any more of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you shake a blind spot?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you ever sat up straight and realized you've been hunched over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your keyboard in an uncomfortable position for who knows how long, leaning
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; you monitor for no apparent reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not a blind spot, it is *focusing* on a task.  I understand this
<br>
well.  I *know* I have a limited intellect (that really bugs me), but my one
<br>
advantage over others that seem smarter than I is: persistence.  I can get
<br>
more done, in less time, than almost anyone I know (admittedly not a whole
<br>
lot of people), because I focus on the task at hand, and I stick with it
<br>
until it is done.  The really annoying part is: I only have a limited number
<br>
of years to focus on a infinite number of fantastic things this universe
<br>
dishes up.
<br>
<p>I want more time!
<br>
<p>If I had an unlimited amount of life time, then I am *certain* that I
<br>
personally could deliver to you a fully transhuman AI, and complete suites
<br>
of Nanotech tools. But my time is limited... I just am not smart enough to
<br>
do it in a ~50 year effective span of regular-human-thinking-time.
<br>
Currently we all have to make do with one lump of neurons each, a lump that
<br>
will eventually stop working.  Hopefully, by working in teams, we can
<br>
contribute enough focused-thinking to reach the Singularity before many more
<br>
of us kick the bucket.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, this is one area that AI, even pre-human AI, will really shine
<br>
in: focusing on a problem, and hammering away at it until it is solved... as
<br>
has been pointed out by several others.
<br>
<p>Keep focusing, polysync.  Focusing helps get you where you want to be.
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames.
