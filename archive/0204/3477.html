<p>Agreed. However Greg's sequel was not to THE CITY AND THE STARS, but to the
<br>
simpler novella that had preceded it by a decade, `Against the Fall of
<br>
Night'. (Novella and novel were, however, structurally equivalent, with the
<br>
same outcome.) I blame myself for this disaster; had I been a bit quicker
<br>
off the mark, none of this would have happened. 
<br>
<p>You'll find in Clarke's introduction to their joint volume that I'd sought
<br>
his permission to sequel CITY AND THE STARS around the same time, but had
<br>
been pipped at the post by Gregory (whose credentials, after all, were
<br>
better than mine; he's a professor of physics with expertise in the
<br>
mathematics of closed spacetimes). Later, I asked Arthur if I could do it
<br>
*right*, now (his commentary suggests that I might be allowed to take my
<br>
own shot at the novel in another decade, which has now come and gone);
<br>
alas, his ferocious agent refuses to let me through the door.
<br>
<p>Anyway, Benford is in my debt (our debt, arguably) for another reason; I
<br>
know him slightly, and when he was in Oz a couple of years ago he read THE
<br>
SPIKE and strongly recommended it to the New York publisher who then
<br>
brought out the revised, updated edition. So when it comes to the
<br>
Singularity posit *in the real world*, Greg is not altogether agin it.
<br>
<p>I suppose the sf Greg who came closest to the pure Singularity quill is
<br>
Greg Bear, in BLOOD MUSIC.
