Hi. About me... I was born and live in the Uk. I am studying Machine Learning and Adaptive Computing for a Masters at uni (UWE, if you are interested).
<br>
<p>I tend to get interested in everything to start with then slowly wittle the ideas/subjects down to those that I think are most important. My current phase of wittling has got to something that looks like the singularity, but has a slightly different signature. As such I am working on my own adaptive system (think a combination of Tierra, Pushpop GP, some of learning classsifier systems with a healthy dose of No free Lunch Theorems thrown in, all of these can be found by google). I shall not bore you with that until I get some interesting results, I am doing it for a dissertation so it will have to be finished reasonably soon.
<br>
<p>How does my view of the great change in the future differ from the majority of singularity views that I have read so far? Mainly due to that after the singularity I see nothing that looks like an individual human. I'm assuming everybody who is reading this has read some of Principia Cybernetica; what I think will happen is the completion of the meta-system transition started when societies formed, resulting in many humans forming one being(this would probably require genetic engineering of humans as well).
<br>
<p>So even if the singularity happens before I die, 'I' don't expect to exist after it as I was before. In some senses I will be dead or cease to exist. In other senses parts of the thoughts I bring to this entity will shape other thoughts and live on this way for a lot longer. This I view as the time when Memes take over completely from genes as the information that gets passed down. (Note that it is possible for a gene to sort of become a meme). Will this be utopia? I don't know.
<br>
<p>So why do I think this will happen. Mainly because of the growth of Intelligence Augmentation (which is what I am working on rather than AI, I think I have the easier task) from mobile phones to computers, this trend seems to be growing. Individuals can act more and more as groups, more and more of the time.  
<br>
<p>I don't seek to challenge other peoples view of the singularity, just to add another voice and see what the consensus comes up with.
<br>
<p>My shock level has yet to be decided, I'll see if I get shocked by anything on this mail list:)
<br>
