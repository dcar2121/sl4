<p>Machines Are Filling In for Troops
<br>
<p>By JAMES DAO and ANDREW C. REVKIN
<br>
<p>ASHINGTON — From Homer to Hemingway, Sun Tzu to Churchill, humans have 
<br>
been fascinated by the violence and plotting, the heroism and sacrifice, 
<br>
the epic theater of what Dryden called &quot;the trade of kings&quot; — war.
<br>
<p>But the Pentagon, energized by successes in Afghanistan, is moving ever 
<br>
closer to draining the human drama from the battlefield and replacing it 
<br>
with a ballet of machines.
<br>
<p>Rapid advances in technology have brought an array of sensors, vehicles 
<br>
and weapons that can be operated by remote control or are totally 
<br>
autonomous. Within a decade, those machines will be able to perform many 
<br>
of the most dangerous, strenuous or boring tasks now assigned to people, 
<br>
military planners say, paving the way for a fundamental change in warfare.
<br>
<p>Already, autonomous sentinels on the ground, in the air and in orbit are 
<br>
probing the battlefield with heat detectors, radar, cameras, microphones 
<br>
and other devices. Some can reveal decoys and pierce camouflage, darkness 
<br>
and bad weather.
<br>
<p>In years to come, once targets are found, chances are good that they will 
<br>
be destroyed by weapons from pilotless vehicles that can distinguish 
<br>
friends from foes without consulting humans.
<br>
<p>The rapid shift away from people — what the Pentagon calls manned units — 
<br>
to automation has several goals.
<br>
<p>Many new devices will be much smaller and lighter, making them cheaper, 
<br>
more fuel efficient and easier to move, advocates contend. And because of 
<br>
their unlimited attention spans, machines should do better at tedious, 
<br>
time-consuming tasks that human warriors loathe, like standing guard or 
<br>
monitoring mountain passes.
<br>
<p>But most important, many officials say, remote technology can shield and 
<br>
aid the the flesh-and-blood soldier.
<br>
<p>&quot;We seem as a society, thank God, very averse to taking casualties,&quot; said 
<br>
Dr. Gervasio Prado, the president of SenTech, a Massachusetts company 
<br>
refining book-size robotic sentinels that can be sprinkled on battlefields 
<br>
to listen for enemy vehicles.
<br>
<p>&quot;We'll continue putting as much effort as possible into keeping the humans 
<br>
in a safe location and do this dirty job remotely,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>In the short run, soldiers, pilots and sailors will still be essential 
<br>
components of any battle, military planners say. This will be particularly 
<br>
true in urban settings, where buildings, tunnels and people create 
<br>
confusing obstacles that no machine will be able to skirt for years to 
<br>
come.
<br>
<p>But over time, experts largely agree, remote-sensing and piloting 
<br>
technologies will produce the biggest change in warfare in generations.
<br>
<p>By 2020 or earlier, if the Pentagon and its many supporters in Congress 
<br>
and the White House have their way, pilotless planes and driverless 
<br>
buggies will direct remote-controlled bombers toward targets; pilotless 
<br>
helicopters will coordinate driverless convoys, and unmanned submarines 
<br>
will clear mines and launch cruise missiles.
<br>
<p>&quot;The promise is enormous,&quot; said Dr. M. Franklin Rose, an electrical 
<br>
engineer who is leading a study of driverless ground vehicles being done 
<br>
for the Army by the Board on Army Science and Technology of the National 
<br>
Academy of Sciences. &quot;Robotics can do three things for the future army: 
<br>
keep soldiers out of harm's way, do the laborious and boring tasks and 
<br>
keep going long after a soldier is exhausted. And they have no fear, at 
<br>
least in current embodiments.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some simple devices, like infrared and night-vision scopes, are available 
<br>
to enemies as well. But no country or terrorist group will have the 
<br>
ability any time soon to deploy these systems so widely and deeply in its 
<br>
forces, many military analysts say.
<br>
<p>It is a dream long in the making that has been stunningly accelerated by 
<br>
the war in Afghanistan. There, several pilotless surveillance aircraft 
<br>
turned in unexpectedly strong performances, including the Air Force's 
<br>
Predator and its missile-toting cousin from the Central Intelligence 
<br>
Agency. They piped streaming video of Taliban and Qaeda movements to 
<br>
command posts in Saudi Arabia and the Pentagon, where commanders could 
<br>
then call almost immediate air strikes.
<br>
<p>As a result, the Pentagon has requested $1.1 billion, an increase of 
<br>
nearly $150 million, in the 2003 budget to accelerate development of the 
<br>
Predator, Global Hawk and other pilotless planes.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why send a marine into harm's way when you can send an $8,000 vehicle 
<br>
instead?&quot; said Brig. Gen. Douglas V. O'Dell, commander of the Fourth 
<br>
Marine Expeditionary Brigade, referring to the Marines' new pilotless 
<br>
aircraft, the Dragon Fly.
<br>
<p>Today's advances in military technology are the result of an effort to 
<br>
extending forces' ability to see over the foxhole rim, the next ridge or 
<br>
across a national border and to speed the application of deadly force.
<br>
<p>In Vietnam, troops dropped battery-powered listening devices, designed to 
<br>
track submarines, into the forest along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and 
<br>
broadcast the sounds of activity below to crews in planes circling above. 
<br>
The Pentagon also used remotely piloted surveillance drones, including 
<br>
ones armed with Maverick missiles, in Vietnam. But crude technology and 
<br>
limited range discouraged further development.
<br>
<p>But the 1990's saw leaps in computer and sensor technology that reignited 
<br>
interest in remote controlled weapons. In Bosnia, the military tried an 
<br>
Army drone called the Hunter; in Kosovo, it first deployed the Predator. 
<br>
By the time American warplanes began attacking Afghanistan, the Air Force 
<br>
had learned out how link the Predator's cameras to video screens on AC-130 
<br>
gunships, aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea and the Combined Air 
<br>
Operation Command Center in Saudi Arabia.
<br>
<p>A few years ago, listening devices, called unattended ground sensors, 
<br>
weighed 30 pounds and were lugged into enemy territory by troops. Now they 
<br>
weigh three pounds. One model is designed to be dropped from aircraft. The 
<br>
sturdy sensors detect vibrations and sounds. Using a computerized library 
<br>
of the distinctive noises produced by a host of enemy engines, tank treads 
<br>
and the like, they recognize passers-by.
<br>
<p>The next step will be to integrate data from the unattended sensors with 
<br>
information flowing from high-flying drones or satellites, said Dr. Prado, 
<br>
whose company builds the listening devices.
<br>
<p>By using different sensors to scour the same landscape and comparing the 
<br>
information, it will be easier to unmask decoys or camouflaged weapons, 
<br>
officials say. As recently as the Kosovo bombing campaign, decoys 
<br>
regularly fooled American bombers.
<br>
<p>Leading the Pentagon's remote-control warfare effort is the Defense 
<br>
Advanced Research Projects Agency, which operates out of Northern 
<br>
Virginia. The agency is working with Boeing to developed the X-45 unmanned 
<br>
combat air vehicle. The 30- foot-long windowless planes look like flying 
<br>
&quot;W's&quot; and will carry up to 12 250-pound bombs. In their initial 
<br>
deployments, as early as 2007, they will be used to attack radar and 
<br>
antiaircraft installations.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon estimates that pilotless aircraft will cost less than half as 
<br>
much as piloted fighter jets like the F-15 or F-18, largely because they 
<br>
lack humans.
<br>
<p>At first, the aircraft will be programmed to ask human controllers for 
<br>
permission to bomb targets. By 2010, the Pentagon envisions that the X-45 
<br>
will independently attack targets in designated &quot;kill boxes.&quot; Then, &quot;If 
<br>
the aircraft sees a target that matches its memory, it hits it and tells 
<br>
the humans about it later,&quot; said Col. Michael Leahy of the Air Force, the 
<br>
program director.
<br>
<p>The research agency and the Army are also working on the Future Combat 
<br>
System, a network of pilotless and piloted aircraft, transport vehicles 
<br>
and artillery pieces linked by high-speed communications.
<br>
<p>The goal is to make the Army lighter and more nimble. Pilotless vehicles 
<br>
are expected to play a central role. Small hovering drones would peek over 
<br>
ridgetops, while unoccupied helicopters would watch troop movements. 
<br>
Closest to deployment is an all-terrain vehicle programmed to follow a 
<br>
soldier, hauling weapons and other gear.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon already has the Hornet, essentially a land mine with a 
<br>
100-yard reach. When it hears an approaching vehicle, it launches a device 
<br>
into the air that uses a heat sensor to direct a potent projectile down at 
<br>
the target.
<br>
<p>Miniaturization is a keystone. Another goal is a &quot;microair vehicle&quot; less 
<br>
than nine inches long that can be carried in a backpack and, when 
<br>
launched, will send images from tiny heat sensors and cameras.
<br>
<p>There are many technological and strategic hurdles. First, drones like the 
<br>
Predator require humans to do almost all their thinking. Having unoccupied 
<br>
vehicles accomplish the sophisticated maneuvers envisioned by Pentagon 
<br>
planners will require much greater autonomy, and more powerful artificial 
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>&quot;Flying a Global Hawk from California to Australia, impressive as that is, 
<br>
is not as hard as driving an unmanned ground vehicle from here to the 
<br>
Capitol,&quot; said Dr. E. Allen Adler, director of the tactical technology 
<br>
office at the advanced projects agency, whose office is about five miles 
<br>
from Capitol Hill.
<br>
<p>Second, the armed services have not begun adjusting their strategies to 
<br>
incorporate robotic vehicles. That will take years of study and training, 
<br>
experts and commanders say.
<br>
<p>&quot;The real challenge is to mix man and machines,&quot; said Colonel Leahy, 
<br>
program director for the pilotless fighter. &quot;It will be a loose ballet at 
<br>
first. But eventually, the systems will be linked to each other, sharing 
<br>
information and deciding among them who has the best shot.&quot;
<br>
<p>Third, Afghanistan did little to educate the Pentagon on how a more 
<br>
capable military rival might adjust to unmanned systems. The Taliban never 
<br>
learned how to shoot down a Predator, but Saddam Hussein's troops may have 
<br>
bagged at least two last year over southern Iraq. A sophisticated foe 
<br>
might disarm, destroy or confuse pilotless aircraft, rendering them 
<br>
useless or even turning them against American forces.
<br>
<p>Finally, debate persists over just how much the military should rely on 
<br>
machines. Most military experts still say the human brain remains the most 
<br>
effective weapon.
<br>
<p>&quot;The onboard logic of unmanned combat aerial vehicles will not begin to 
<br>
approach the computational capacity of human brains, making them highly 
<br>
vulnerable to attacks by manned aircraft,&quot; Loren B. Thompson, chief 
<br>
operating officer for the Lexington Institute, which studies military 
<br>
issues, testified before the Senate last week.
<br>
<p>In the end, said Dr. Rose, the electrical engineer assessing ground 
<br>
vehicles, the biggest challenge will be to design the technology so that 
<br>
to the fighter it becomes an invisible, almost subconscious, extension of 
<br>
the eyes, ears or trigger finger. That will take another generation, he 
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Already, so many of these young soldiers grew up on video games and 
<br>
computers,&quot; he said. &quot;They grew up trusting machines.&quot;
<br>
<p>Eventually, he said, the new weapons and sensors will slide into the ethos 
<br>
of war just like the autopilot, which was once disparaged by aviators as 
<br>
&quot;Iron Mike&quot; but is now a standard part of airplane cockpits.
<br>
<p>&quot;But it'll still be 20 or 25 years up the road before we get to the point 
<br>
where you regard `Iron Mike' as a member of your squad as opposed to a 
<br>
nuisance,&quot; Dr. Rose said.
