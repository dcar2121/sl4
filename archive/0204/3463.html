<p>According to recent data, universe is 13 billion years old, give or take
<br>
100 megayears. You need high abundancies of heavier elements to generate
<br>
life, and life is vulnerable enough so that it couldn't have arisen at
<br>
high absolute luminance. Also, it wouldn't be able to evolve to higher
<br>
life if there were high-luminosity flashes.  The global environment has
<br>
been more or less favourable to life only in the last few billion years.
<br>
Plus, at least in one instance life needed several billion years to arrive
<br>
at a useful level of intelligence, and it is not at all obvious that this
<br>
must always be the case, trend in co-evolution driven cerebralization
<br>
nonwithstanding.
<br>
<p>So the bound on the aperture of an average civilization's lightcone is a 
<br>
lot lower than your 0..15 GYr figure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; B) Conditions only became favorable to civilizations recently. (i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2nd generation stars required to create suitable planets).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that's only part of the problem. Nearby supernova are out, as
<br>
well as other high-energy events, including those on galactic scale (a
<br>
quasar flareup in the center of ours would kill us). Giant impact are out
<br>
(impact of a few 100 km large rock would wipe all higher life). Extreme
<br>
climatic excursions driven by intrinsic nonlinearities, minor changes in
<br>
solar constant, etc. etc.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; C) Civilizations don't survive at a high tech level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long enough to fill the universe.
</em><br>
<p>The vulnerability window for that has hardly opened, and is about to close 
<br>
in a few decades, when we start colonizing the local solar system, and go 
<br>
beyond. As soon as the pioneers are on the cruise you can't really revoke 
<br>
them, nor kill them.
<br>
<p>As soon as you're outside of your gravity well you're essentially
<br>
unkillable by a rather large number of event classes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; D) Civilizations don't stay in a form we can observe.
</em><br>
<p>All of them? Probabilistically rather improbable, unless the total number 
<br>
of them is very low.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; E) Civilizations have been observed, but we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize them as such.
</em><br>
<p>People have been looking at natural phenomena, but all of them appear 
<br>
natural. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; F) The fraction of civilizations that is expansionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is low.
</em><br>
<p>An interesting question is whether there is a common pattern for all 
<br>
cultures resulting in a single bottleneck, or each developmental path is 
<br>
unique.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There may be additional hypotheses I haven't listed, or some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination of them may be the right answer.
</em><br>
<p>The question flares up every few months on diverse lists. The online
<br>
archives are lousy with such discussions.
