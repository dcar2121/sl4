<p>'Flesh and Machines': The Future of Robotics
<br>
By DICK TERESI
<br>
April 14, 2002
<br>
<p>In 1982 I was sitting in my office trying to convince a British biologist of
<br>
the sobriety of the science magazine I edited when my publisher, a woman
<br>
wearing a sheer silk scarf in lieu of a blouse, burst in with a large,
<br>
flatulent dog on a leash. ''I want you to clone Grundy,'' she said,
<br>
indicating the Rhodesian Ridgeback. By way of compliance, I wrote ''Clone
<br>
Grundy'' on my desk calendar. She spun and left. The biologist had just
<br>
recovered from this interruption when the publisher burst in again. ''Forget
<br>
Grundy,'' she said. ''I want you to clone Bob.'' Bob was her husband and the
<br>
owner of the magazine. I crossed out ''Grundy,'' wrote in ''Bob.''
<br>
<p>Twenty years later, cloning human embryos is almost routine, though it
<br>
remains unethical to apply the technology to magazine publishers. So when
<br>
Rodney A. Brooks, director of the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,
<br>
tells me that in 20 more years we will have robots with feelings and
<br>
consciousness, I'm not going to argue with him.
<br>
<p>''Flesh and Machines: How Robots Will Change Us'' is a short, stimulating
<br>
book written by one of the major players in the field -- perhaps the major
<br>
player -- about the state of robotics and its short-term future. It also
<br>
offers surprisingly deep glimpses into what it is to be human. Brooks
<br>
appears to have gained a boundless appreciation for human beings by
<br>
attempting to copy them.
<br>
<p>Traditionally, robots have been built with three loops: a perception
<br>
circuit, an action circuit and a ''cognition box'' to provide a worldview
<br>
and to mediate between sensors and motors. Brooks challenged this model by
<br>
eliminating the cognition box. At a talk, he drew diagrams of bigger boxes
<br>
for perception and action -- based on the portion of animal brains devoted
<br>
to each -- and made them overlap. He then ''put cognition in a little
<br>
cartoon cloud representing the thoughts of an external observer of the
<br>
complete system of the robot -- world, perception and action.''
<br>
<p>This was radical thought, if not outright heresy. As it turned out, Brooks's
<br>
robots didn't need a brain to exhibit intimations of consciousness. The key,
<br>
he writes, is to get the robot to react to its sensors quickly. Take
<br>
Genghis, Brooks's six-legged robot. It is outfitted with six pyroelectric
<br>
sensors, identical to motion sensors that turn on the lights in your
<br>
driveway. In Genghis, the sensors are tuned to the infrared band emitted by
<br>
the warm bodies of all mammals, and connected to the robot's motors. If a
<br>
mammal, say a human, passes in front of Genghis, it moves toward the
<br>
infrared radiation. When the mammal stops, Genghis stops. To observers, it
<br>
appears Genghis is stalking prey. But stalking implies intent, and Genghis
<br>
has none. When Brooks pointed the sensors backward, Genghis walked away from
<br>
mammals. Genghis has no internal notion of forward or backward.
<br>
<p>Brooks takes issue with the robotics pioneer Marvin Minsky, who has
<br>
concentrated on cognition and has belittled the problem of seeing, since
<br>
''even stupid people could do it well,'' in Brooks's words. From a robotics
<br>
point of view, he suspects that playing chess and solving algebra problems
<br>
might be easier to fabricate than visually distinguishing ''between a coffee
<br>
cup and a chair'' or walking around obstacles, things that a 4-year-old
<br>
child can do. He believes that so-called higher functions derive from the
<br>
ability ''to see, walk, navigate and judge.''
<br>
<p>Brooks gives us a tour of the marvels of the human vision system and the
<br>
difficulties in building them into a robot. One of his brainstorms was
<br>
figuring out how to make his robots negotiate a crowded room. He realized
<br>
that a robot did not need an ability to avoid obstacles, but could be
<br>
programmed ''to seek paths through empty space.'' Zen Buddhist monks spend
<br>
several lifetimes learning to grasp the void. Brooks's robots do it as soon
<br>
as they are switched on.
<br>
<p>His book is full of surprises. Given Genghis's illusory stalking and
<br>
Brooks's now famous statement that we ''overanthropomorphize humans,'' I
<br>
assumed he was galloping toward the conclusion that consciousness does not
<br>
exist. But no. He says consciousness may be ''the result of simple mindless
<br>
activities coupled together.'' Our senses and muscles are part of who we
<br>
are.
<br>
<p>Brooks doesn't paint a bright line between conscious and unconscious, but
<br>
implies a continuum of conscious behavior from nuts and bolts to humans,
<br>
just as we infer increasing consciousness from lobsters (O.K. to throw in
<br>
boiling water) to dogs (non-boilable companions) to chimps (almost human).
<br>
When the chess-playing computer Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov, he said it
<br>
played as if it ''had a plan.'' But Deep Blue was qualitatively no different
<br>
from chess computers of the 1960's; it was just much faster.
<br>
<p>Brooks predicts that we will soon see an explosion of humanoid robots
<br>
(first, probably, as house servants) and that we will award them human
<br>
rights. He is a persuasive writer, but I worry about his marriage. He cites
<br>
his ''darling wife, Janet Sonenberg,'' in the acknowledgments, then says
<br>
later that a human is ''a big bag of skin full of biomolecules.'' Good luck,
<br>
Ms. Sonenberg.
<br>
<p>He is no historian. He finds robotlike machines in antiquity and the
<br>
Renaissance, but denies there was any technology in the Middle Ages. In
<br>
fact, the Byzantine Empire and the medieval Islamic world were in love with
<br>
technology. Tenth-century Baghdad boasted animatronic amusement parks with
<br>
singing birds and roaring lions. One of Brooks's themes is that we will
<br>
accept robots when we give up the notion of man's specialness, and he trots
<br>
out the old saw that the first step came with Copernicus: ''The church could
<br>
not accept that the terra firma on which mankind stood could not be the
<br>
center of the universe.'' In truth, the church placed the earth at the
<br>
center only in the sense that a drain is at the center of a sink: the
<br>
detritus gathers there. The intellectual historian Anthony Grafton says hell
<br>
was the center of the universe, with the earth circumscribing it. God was
<br>
way up above. He was special, not man. You could look it up.
<br>
<p>Otherwise, Brooks is thoughtful. He acknowledges the theoretical obstacles
<br>
to building robots as smart as their creators. Still, I envision a future
<br>
civilization of intelligent robots. They will engage in endless debates over
<br>
their origin and the means of their evolution: Natural selection?
<br>
Lamarckism? Random drift? A few rusty, gray-bolted robot priests will ignore
<br>
all this, chanting two words under their breath: ''Rodney Brooks, Rodney
<br>
Brooks, Rodney Brooks. . . .''
<br>
