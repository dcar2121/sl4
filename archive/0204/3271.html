</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, sorry.
</em><br>
<p>*confused*.  What are you sorry for?
<br>
Anyway - I don't believe you believe that.  Naturally all humans are
<br>
basically the same and we (you and I) experience and 'feel' the same.
<br>
That I consider an axioma :/
<br>
<p>Instead you should have concluded that I left things out and (over)
<br>
simplified things.  I'll try to point out the essention of my remark
<br>
below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that &quot;pleasure&quot; is a natural language term that covers a variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of different things.
</em><br>
<p>That is an understatement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, we can average all these things together to come up with a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;weighted-average pleasure indicator&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in reality the weights in the average shift over time according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical fluctuations in the brain, induced by environmental &amp; social &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional factors, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also we seek pleasure over many different time scales, and this causes a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of confusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What it comes down to is, at times the human urge for sex seems rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncorrelated from the human urge for pleasure....  People will seek sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes, even when greater amounts of pleasure would likely be achieved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other ways.
</em><br>
<p>But not as a result of being hardwired to seek sex.  The actions needed
<br>
to start having sex (including social contacts) are WAY to complex to be
<br>
something hardwired.
<br>
<p>Our brain is a neural network, it learns by means of feedback.
<br>
The input exists of possible actions, memories and associations, the likelihood
<br>
of correctness of assumptions being made and the evaluation of the whole
<br>
situation as perceived by our preceptions.  The output of the neural network
<br>
correspond to our decision(s) to do or not do the action on the input.
<br>
The learning process means that levels the triggered certain neurons to fire
<br>
or not will be changed in a way that either we will do the same thing again
<br>
in comparable situation (with the same input) or not.
<br>
<p>What I tried to point out is that when we feel something like &quot;pleasure&quot; or
<br>
&quot;happiness&quot; then what actually is happening that the path that our neurons
<br>
just took are strengthened, and it will be more likely that we will do the
<br>
same again next time.  That &quot;pleasure&quot; in itself is a very complex and multi-
<br>
dimensional feedback wasn't relevant imho; yet you seem to have understood
<br>
that I said that &quot;pleasure&quot; is a single bit, or just simple one dimensionial
<br>
'value' - no way!
<br>
<p>Imho, sex is the result of instinct: imagining to be close to someone feels
<br>
&quot;good&quot; (that is hardwired).  BECAUSE it feels good our reasoning kicks in
<br>
trying to figure out how to do that again.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<em>&gt; The point of all this is: I still think that humans have much more complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivational hardwiring than can be simply explained by positing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;happiness&quot; hardwired goal, with hardwired connections between other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subgoals (e.g. sex) and the happiness goal.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I said that &quot;becoming happy is the goal of life&quot;, but then I meant
<br>
&quot;having happy moments is a reason to live&quot;.
<br>
<p>But if we look at how precisely the mind works, then - in the context of
<br>
&quot;goal driven&quot; as used in an earlier post - happiness is not a 'goal' but
<br>
state of mind (feeling) that corresponds to positive feedback to our
<br>
neurons.  As a result our goals will automatically become those things
<br>
that will again cause &quot;happiness&quot;, but the goal that you set yourself
<br>
has more relationship with the Real World then just having the feeling.
<br>
<p>Example: &quot;random&quot; action: injecting drugs --&gt; extreme pleasure.
<br>
Result: goal is set to &quot;inject drugs again&quot;, which together with
<br>
reasoning leads to: get more drugs... get money... steal... figure out
<br>
how to steal without getting caught etc.  The extreme pleasure itself
<br>
is NOT the goal that is hardwired however, if it was then we'd all
<br>
try drug the first time we hear about it, but we don't because our
<br>
neurons have not yet been burned-in; before the actual _experience_
<br>
of happiness is it easy not to do it.
<br>
[The funny thing is that happiness *is* nothing more then a state of
<br>
mind in the most literal sense: there is absolutely no reason needed
<br>
to feel happy. As a matter of fact, I taught myself where the trigger
<br>
is to feel happy and use it to suppress upcoming anxiety attacks.
<br>
Being constantly in this state of mind is also called 'enlightment',
<br>
see for example Buddhism.  Happiness is triggered however in certain
<br>
hardwired cases, among which _relief_ of misery (discomfort, pain, stress).]
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>Just a question... isn't it more logical to first write an AI
<br>
that is as smart as a mouse or something stupid like that?
