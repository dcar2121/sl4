<br>
Okay, it's easier for you to go down the current path you're going.  Where
<br>
is that path leading?  How far are you currently along that path?
<br>
***
<br>
<p>I break our progress down into 3 phases
<br>
<p>Phase 1: Implementation
<br>
<p>Phase 2: Basic teaching (via experiential interaction in a shared 
<br>
perceivable/manipulable environment)
<br>
<p>Phase 3: Significant self-modification of learning mechanisms &amp; data 
<br>
structures
<br>
<p>We are currently about 1/3 of the way through Phase 1, I'm afraid.
<br>
<p>With the Webmind AI Engine we got about 80% of the way through Phase 1 and 
<br>
did some experiments in Phase 2, but the other 20% of Phase 1 was 
<br>
unfeasible in the framework we had at that point.   I believe we have 
<br>
solved those problems and that the completion of Phase 1 now is &quot;just&quot; a 
<br>
matter of implementation and testing and detailed software design based on 
<br>
our completed mathematical/high-level software design.  (And, lest someone 
<br>
get excited: When I say &quot;mathematical&quot; I do not mean that we have proved 
<br>
the system will work mathematically, just that some key parts of the design 
<br>
are formulated in terms of equations.)
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;From what
<br>
I've seen so far you seem to think that this is the path leading directly 
<br>
to
<br>
Real AI.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>I think it is *a* path leading directly toward Real AI.  I am sure there 
<br>
are many other paths too.  For instance, in my recent paper Hebbian Logic, 
<br>
which I sent you, I sketched a possible alternate path.
<br>
<p>***
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm no longer sure what you mean by Real AI.  Obviously Real
<br>
AI includes something that a human would intuitively recognize as a person,
<br>
but what else does it include for you?  Does it include everything that I
<br>
would call &quot;a functioning deliberative supersystem&quot;?  Because I would
<br>
consider that the first grand milestone, or epoch, not the last one.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>Eli, a search for &quot;deliberative supersystem&quot; on Google does not turn 
<br>
anything up.  So I suspect this is not a phrase you have used in your 
<br>
online writings.  If you will define it for me I'm willing to discuss it 
<br>
with me.
<br>
<p>Based on my intuitive interpretation of the phrase, I would say: Yes, I 
<br>
intend to create a functioning deliberative supersystem.  (Wearing a tight 
<br>
blue uniform like Superman if you like, to show off its hunky little buns 
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>I think that I have clarified my goals for you many times.  First a 
<br>
roughly-human-equivalent intelligence that can be taught and conversed 
<br>
with, then (growing out of this) a self-modifying intelligence that can 
<br>
bootstrap its way to tremendously superhuman intelligence.  If successful, 
<br>
this will lead either to the Singularity or -- perhaps, I hope not! -- to a 
<br>
system that understands the hidden obstacles to the Singularity that we 
<br>
stupid humans are missing...
<br>
<p>I don't use the same exact vocabulary as you to describe my long-term 
<br>
project goals, but I should think that by now you'd understand them 
<br>
qualitatively.
<br>
<p>***
<br>
I realize that I have no code, but I have put my design online and let
<br>
people judge it, with another major update coming Extremely Soon Now.  I
<br>
haven't seen your design yet, I haven't seen your code,
<br>
***
<br>
<p>You have put nothing online that I would consider a concrete AI design.  A 
<br>
lot of interesting ideas, to be sure, though.
<br>
<p>I don't think your online writings are any more explicit than my various 
<br>
online and published articles on Webmind.  (For instance, the chapter on 
<br>
Webmind AI Engine in my latest book CREATING INTERNET INTELLIGENCE).
<br>
<p>As for seeing my design, as you know, we're currently dickering over the 
<br>
details of the nondisclosure agreement.  So if you really want to see it, 
<br>
you probably will get to soon.  I look forward to hearing your detailed 
<br>
critiques.
<br>
<p><p>**
<br>
&nbsp;I haven't heard any reports of what it is
<br>
exactly that Webmind or Novamente do - except for text categorization and
<br>
stock market observation and so on, which you could be accomplishing in any
<br>
number of ways aside from what I would regard as &quot;Real AI&quot;.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>In fact, these practical functions of Webmind Inc. products *were* achieved 
<br>
using relatively simple algorithms, not using &quot;general intelligence.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;These simple algorithms were inspired by our work on general intelligence, 
<br>
however.
<br>
<p><p>***
<br>
&nbsp;I can see that you've gotten
<br>
over the Deadly Sin of AI in which you only use one idea, but there are
<br>
other Deadly Sins.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>Would you favor us with a list of the &quot;N Deadly Sins of AI According to 
<br>
Eliezer&quot;  ?
<br>
<p>Sins that merely cause severe illness rather than death may also be 
<br>
included.
