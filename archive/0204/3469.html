<p>Assuming, for the sake of argument, it was true. It took about 4 billion

<p>Or it is extremely hard to do; we don't know. Anthropic principle again.

If there are other instances of life in this solar system not derived from

a common source you have a cause, not before. This measurement is

perfectly biased.

<p><em>&gt; Fermi Paradox becomes relevant to the Singularity

<p>Would suffice to find life on Mars or Europa, which is not derived from a

common source with us. Unlikely, though: this dish is too 
<br>
crosscontaminated.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This makes the 'high tech doesn't last long enough'

<p>Can't quite believe we nuke us before we get into space. That window is

closing.
