it really taxes the (human) mind when trying to analyze how this would

work in excruciating detail.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Association-finding is reduced to simple probabilistic inference plus a

<em>&gt; Hebb rule variant
</em><br>
<p><p>These are all essentially reducible to the same structure, though with

slightly different traversal behaviors.  Doing the work to support one

<em>&gt; Overall, what we found is that a lot of mental functions are obtainable as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combinations or specializations of other mental functions, but not in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately obvious ways.
</em><br>
<p><p>The &quot;not in immediately obvious ways&quot; is a killer. Part of this is
<br>
because people frequently define intelligence in terms of peculiar
<br>
behaviors that human minds tend to exhibit that may or may not be
<br>
relevant to the actual problem. The &quot;yeah, but can it do &lt;insert some
<br>
quirky human characteristic&gt;?&quot; question can be a problematic one, and
<br>
often requires more a lot more thought than the question may merit
<br>
simply because that is how people relate to &quot;intelligence&quot;. There are
<br>
still a couple things that I would rather prove by doing rather than
<br>
completely verifying on paper first.
<br>
<p>If we consider the human brain as a model, it is clear that limited
<br>
specialization of functionality at the lower levels must be true, at
<br>
least in the sense that it is one way to do it.  The human mind is an
<br>
extraordinarily complex construct built upon a very small number of
<br>
primitives. I don't think the primitives themselves are particularly
<br>
important beyond the fact that they can be put together efficiently to
<br>
support the basic functional structures.
<br>
<p>I've been meaning to provide substantially more documentation for a
<br>
number of things, but these days I don't have time to provide much
<br>
written documentation for anything beyond the code I write (code is
<br>
self-documenting, right? :-) for my own engineering team, never mind the
<br>
rest of the world. Operating a startup has never been conducive to
<br>
having lots of free time... :-)
<br>
