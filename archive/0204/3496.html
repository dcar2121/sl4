</em><br>
<p>Well, here's my take on the matters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1.)     Will there be punishments for past crimes?  What is the fate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death row inmates at the time of the Singularity?  What about people not yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught?  What about terrorists?  Will there be a final day of reckoning?
</em><br>
<p>Punishments are irrelevant when future crimes can be stopped without
<br>
them, as there is, in my view, no inherent value in causing involuntary
<br>
harm to anyone. I do hope the posthuman world is rid of such petty
<br>
revenge. (Of course, one can choose to shun such people if one likes.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.)    Will people be protected from their own ignorance?  What about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children?  What about babies?  What about parental control?
</em><br>
<p>The ignorance question is a hard one, as drawing the line between
<br>
persuasion and mind-control is difficult when talking about trans- and
<br>
posthumans dealing with humans. As for babies and children, they should
<br>
be treated consistently with the answer given below to question 3.
<br>
Parental control as such should be abolished when talking about beings
<br>
with citizenship rights. In your later mail you indicate that you fear
<br>
that irrevocable accidental harm may come to younger beings if such
<br>
controls are not in place, but in my view, if such accidents are still
<br>
possible, it's not much of a post-Singularity world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.)    Is the &quot;common good&quot; going to include only humans?  All intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life?  How do you define intelligent?  Animals?  Trees?  All life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Parasites?  Ebola?
</em><br>
<p>Well, assuming that the transition guide is non-specist, which is a
<br>
requirement anyway for properly dealing with possible alien cultures as
<br>
well as other species here on Earth, I'd trust ver (more so than any
<br>
human) to make the right, or at least consistent, call on these
<br>
questions based on any individual creature's cognitive abilities.
<br>
<p>Personally I do hope that any being capable of having subjectively
<br>
valued conscious experiences (qualia) will have some rights. As for now,
<br>
I am a vegan to minimize any excess risk of violations of such rights
<br>
brought about by my own actions, but I don't pretend to know where the
<br>
actual line lies.
<br>
