<p>
This is a request for pointers to previous thinking
<br>
on the relationship of the 'Fermi Paradox' to the
<br>
Singularity, in the form of books, articles, URL's
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>For those not familiar with it, the 'Fermi Paradox'
<br>
is named after Enrico Fermi, one of the physicists
<br>
who worked on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s.
<br>
Fermi started with the fact that nuclear reactions
<br>
have energies about one million times that of
<br>
chemical reactions.  Since the energy required to
<br>
get a particular velocity goes as 1/2 mass x velocity
<br>
squared, a vehicle propelled by nuclear power
<br>
should be able to reach speeds about 1000 times
<br>
that of a vehicle propelled by chemical power.
<br>
<p>Chemical rockets have a characteristic velocity
<br>
of ~3 km/s, so nuclear vehicles should be able
<br>
to travel at ~3,000 km/s, or about 1% of lightspeed.
<br>
The Milky Way galaxy is about 100,000 light-years
<br>
across, so it would take about 10 million years
<br>
to go from one end to the other at that speed.
<br>
But the Milky Way is about 1000 times older than
<br>
that.  If there is another intelligent, expansive
<br>
civilization in the galaxy, they should have been
<br>
here by now.  We see no evidence of such, thus
<br>
thus the paradox.
<br>
<p>Progress in technology since the 1940's added to
<br>
a future Singularity only make the paradox more
<br>
pressing.  Today we can envision matter-antimatter
<br>
propulsion that has a characteristic velocity
<br>
near lightspeed.  Instead of a generation ship
<br>
taking hundreds of years between stars (at 0.01c),
<br>
we can envision a much smaller automated probe
<br>
travelling at near lightspeed.  On arrival it
<br>
builds an infrastructure capable of receiving
<br>
AIs, which can be transmitted at lightspeed itself.
<br>
<p>Therefore an expansive post-Singularity civilization
<br>
may grow at near lightspeed.  Given enough of a
<br>
headstart in time, it could fill a significant 
<br>
portion of the universe by now.  But still we
<br>
see no evidence of such.  The possible solutions
<br>
to the paradox from Fermi's original question can
<br>
be extended to the present day considering the
<br>
Singularity.
