<p>Well, what you're not taking into account here is that everybody has a mind.
<br>
Introspective psychology IS a valuable source of information about the
<br>
nature of mind and intelligence, and it's a source that everyone has access
<br>
to.
<br>
<p>Hence, I'd expect the average person's insights on the nature of mind &amp;
<br>
intelligence to be worth at least a little bit more than their insights on
<br>
quarks or quasars.
<br>
<p>Now, I don't believe that introspection alone is enough to guide anyone (no
<br>
matter how smart, or how introspectively acute) to a quality theory of AI.
<br>
<p>However, I think that if one is purely concerned with the theory of mind on
<br>
an abstract level, and not with issues of bridging the physical &amp; mental
<br>
realms, then introspection can actually carry one pretty far.
<br>
<p>Evidence of this is provided in the psychological theories of the medieval
<br>
Buddhists.  There's a great book called Buddhist Logic, by a Russian named
<br>
Th. Stcherbatsksy (sp?), summarizing the thinking of two 14'th century
<br>
theorists named Dharmakirti &amp; Dignaga.  These guys had a pretty damned good
<br>
cognitive science theory, based solely on the distillation of centuries of
<br>
introspective reports.  Honestly, I find their view of the mind more
<br>
convincing than that of most modern cognitive science thinkers, in spite of
<br>
the greater empirical-science foundation that the latter have had for their
<br>
work.  (Of course, I also find the Buddhist Logic work erroneous and/or
<br>
annoying in some aspects.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm rather impressed that the non-armchair variety of AI philosophers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who'd bloodied their noses countless number of times, still haven't lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conviction that they know how to do it.
</em><br>
<p>Imagine achieving Real AI as climbing to the top of a very tall peak.
<br>
<p>Imagine that, not so long ago, our Intrepid Explorer climbed VERY CLOSE to
<br>
the peak, but ran into a dead end.
<br>
<p>However, on the way up, he saw another, slightly different route, that
<br>
looked pretty good.
<br>
<p>But he couldn't follow the alternate route at the time -- he would have had
<br>
to backtrack a while... he needed more supplies... and then there was that
<br>
damned twisted ankle.
<br>
<p>So now he's going back up to try the slightly different route that appeared
<br>
to him to be clear.  But of course, he can't say it's clear with 100%
<br>
confidence -- there could be some hidden pitfall along the new route, that
<br>
wasn't visible from his prior perspective....  But he must be a bit of a
<br>
loony optimist masochist in the first place, or he wouldn't be climbing
<br>
mountains and twisting ankles, he'd be sitting at home watching some other
<br>
asshole do it on TV, like everyone else ;)
