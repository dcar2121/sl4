they're on their way, but why should they have waited? Crush them when

<p>Damien Broderick&quot;
<br>
<p><p>For those that don't know the Journal of Evolution and Technology is having
<br>
a symposium on &quot;Practical Cosmology&quot; in June in case anyone would like to
<br>
write a paper.  The paper I am writing (or should be writing) has to do
<br>
with the idea that part of the explanation for the Fermi paradox might lie
<br>
in the idea of a &quot;missing science&quot;. The idea is that the history of the
<br>
universe has seen emergent entities and associated sciences: chemical
<br>
phenomena emerge from physical phenomena, biological phenomena from
<br>
chemical, psychological from biological. Has this process stopped or is it
<br>
continuing? Might a new level of organization X emerge from the
<br>
psychological level with a corresponding science X? I am thinking of course
<br>
of something like the singularity. Think of it this way. Suppose a group of
<br>
scientists arrived in a space ship just as our solar system was forming. The
<br>
physicists would be gainfully employed but there would not be much for the
<br>
other scientists to do. Eventually the chemists would have something to
<br>
investigate and, after the earth had been in existence for about a billion
<br>
years (give or take) biologists would have a subject matter to investigate.
<br>
Of course it would be a long time before the psychologists, sociologists,
<br>
economists etc. had something to study. Will the singularity mean the
<br>
formation of a new level of organization akin to the emergence of biological
<br>
or chemical phenomena from a physical basis? If so, then the explanation of
<br>
the Fermi paradox may well lie at this level of organization and be
<br>
uncognizable by us. Of course this is just a conjecture. The way to test it
<br>
is to initiate the singularity. On a practical level this means that the
<br>
best means to make progress on the Fermi paradox may lie in spending dollars
<br>
on singularity research as opposed to any other means. Imagine, for example,
<br>
if the resources that went into launching and maintaining the Hubble
<br>
telescope were directed instead to singularity research! If the
<br>
'transcendental science' conjecture is correct then all our attempts to
<br>
solve the Fermi paradox might be in vain. It may be that the most effective
<br>
(and safest) way to investigate the nature and limits of our universe is to
<br>
first investigate the nature and limits of our minds.
<br>
<p>Relatedly, while writing this I realized that a small but illuminating paper
<br>
might be
<br>
written on the idea of a &quot;Fermi Equation&quot;. The idea of course is an equation
<br>
like the &quot;Drake Equation&quot; but with a difference. Here is a very rough stab
<br>
at it:
<br>
<p><p>The Fermi Equation
<br>
<p><p>N = N* fp ne fl fi fm fd
<br>
<p><p>N: The number of civilizations that launch spaceships (or probes) that reach
<br>
Earth by
<br>
April 2002.
<br>
<p>N*: Number of stars that our within traveling distance of the earth. (See
<br>
below)).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;fp: represents the fraction of stars that have planets around them.
<br>
<p>ne: represents the number of planets per star that are capable of sustaining
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>fl is the fraction of planets in ne where life evolves
<br>
<p>fi is the fraction of fl where intelligent life evolves
<br>
<p>fm is the fraction of fi that have the technical means to launch spaceships
<br>
capable of reaching earth.
<br>
<p>fd is fraction of fm that have the desire to launch spaceships to reach
<br>
earth.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Where are the colonizers, the explorers, and the solarformers? An answer to
<br>
this must invoke a bottleneck explanation. Somewhere in the evolution of
<br>
inorganic matter to a technologically advanced civilization there is at
<br>
least one bottleneck that is not immediately obvious, for if it were obvious
<br>
there would be no Fermi Paradox. (See Brin's &quot;The Great Silence&quot; and R.
<br>
Hanson's &quot;The Great Filter&quot;). Bottlenecks can be broken down into one of
<br>
the parameters of the Fermi Equation. The bottleneck then will be
<br>
attributable to an associated science. For convenience sake we will use
<br>
three divisions: The natural sciences (physics, chemistry, and cosmology,),
<br>
the biological sciences (botany, zoology, genetics, etc.) and the social
<br>
sciences (economics, psychology, sociology). Let us then look at each of the
<br>
variables:
<br>
<p>N = 0 We have not been visited by aliens.
<br>
<p><p><p>N* = Number of stars that our within traveling distance of the earth. (See
<br>
below)
<br>
<p><p><p>fp Clearly a bottleneck could be attributable to a lack of planets available
<br>
for life to develop on. The discovery of a number of large planets has
<br>
assuaged fears that solar systems with planets might be a rarity.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>Ne: It is obviously possible that a significant bottleneck may be discovered
<br>
here at some point, for example, many of the planets that have been
<br>
discovered thus far are large and in close orbits to their suns suggesting
<br>
that it might be difficult for earth-sized e planets to establish themselves
<br>
in the appropriate orbital radius. However, nothing so far says that we
<br>
should expect that fp is zero, indeed, quite the opposite.
<br>
<p><p><p>fl:  the process of getting life started is very difficult   (blame it on
<br>
biology)
<br>
<p><p><p>fi:  the process of getting intelligence started is very difficult. (blame
<br>
it on psychology)
<br>
<p><p><p>fm: the technical means to master space travel is much harder than it looks,
<br>
or there is a Galactic club that forbids travel to undeveloped planets like
<br>
earth. (Blame it on sociology).
<br>
<p><p>fd: Perhaps many species have the means to travel to earth but none have the
<br>
desire. (Economics? Sociology? Psychology?)
<br>
<p><p>Re: N* Originally thinking of just
<br>
following
<br>
Tipler in his paper on the Fermi paradox to get the numbers for N* but I
<br>
realized that Tipler made a huge
<br>
assumption in limiting N* the stars of this galaxy, about 200 billion.
<br>
Tipler calculates very
<br>
conservatively that it would take 300 million years to colonize the entire
<br>
galaxy. But what is to say that there cannot be intergalactic travel? If we
<br>
figure that older civilizations might have had say a five billion year head
<br>
start then N* must be &quot;astronomical&quot; (as it were) in size.  To figure it out
<br>
we would
<br>
need an estimate of a reasonable maximum speed that a spaceship (or one of
<br>
Tipler's Von Neumann probes) could travel. Whatever N* turns out to be it
<br>
will be huge, which means that
<br>
at least one of the other variables in the Fermi equation must be pretty
<br>
small indeed. The problem of course is the &quot;just one problem&quot;. It would take
<br>
only a single civilization to pass through the bottle neck and colonize the
<br>
universe (given enough time). I think that our universe is still a &quot;buyers
<br>
market&quot; should seem as perplexing as if one discovered life on a planet
<br>
(like ours) confined to a single continent.
