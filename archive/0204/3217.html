<p>Well, you've told me a bunch of times that you don't think I understand how
<br>
difficult AI is.  Hopefully you will not be offended if I say the same in
<br>
return; I have looked upon the functional decomposition of intelligence and
<br>
I don't think you realize how huge it is.  I know that you think it is a lot
<br>
larger now than you used to think when Webmind was getting started, and that
<br>
therefore you *think* you have learned how huge intelligence is, but I don't
<br>
think you've seen all of the challenge or even most of it.
<br>
<p>This is humanity's last software project.  It is one that has defeated some
<br>
very smart people for fifty years, and I haven't yet seen anything that
<br>
indicates Novamente has overcome it.  This software project *is* *the*
<br>
*Singularity* and it would be foolhardy to expect it to be easy.  It would
<br>
be foolhardy to expect to crack the barrier if we hit it with anything less
<br>
than full force.  It is *disrespect for the job* to start out by saying,
<br>
&quot;And let's do this on a part-time volunteer basis with F2F contact once a
<br>
month,&quot; instead of &quot;If the programmers were all MARRIED it might still not
<br>
be enough; the least we can do is all work out of the same office.&quot;  I
<br>
showed up for the Singularity.  I am willing to give it my best shot.  If I
<br>
am expected to do it on my own without funding, then I'm sorry, but I'm just
<br>
not that good, and that you suggest it makes me wonder if we're really
<br>
talking about the same goal.  I'd love to finish up in five years, but if it
<br>
takes twenty years then I will be here twenty years from now.  My
<br>
understanding has improved to the point where I now think I can see how to
<br>
create seed AI with one midsized nonprofit, instead of a Manhattan Project
<br>
or industrywide effort as I once thought, but to carry out the Singularity
<br>
as a one-man job or with a part-time volunteer crew is still unreasonable.
