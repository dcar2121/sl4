<p>We might, but we're the perfectly biased sample of one -- the essence of
<br>
antropic effect. As such we can't extrapolate anything from our properties
<br>
save the trivial fact of our existance, unless we can observe a second
<br>
instance, or (better) several. The other outcome (there are no others) is
<br>
by far preferrable, since requiring less assumptions about properties of
<br>
those others. Nonexistance is a very simple property in contrast to many
<br>
special requirements which would also make to fit the data (indicating
<br>
undenaturated wilderness).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; since I also think it sounds a little to good to be true.

<p>My personal impression of Egan's work is profound emotional coldness. I
<br>
suspected him of Asperberger's, but a reliable source indicated he has a
<br>
normal social life. His physics is breezy, but considerable less breezy
<br>
than Neal Stephenson's, but his extrapolations of basic technologies look
<br>
like pure personal sentiment.

<p>If we will have evidence of nonexpansive spacefaring others, we'll know
<br>
that Darwin-driven expansion is avoidable (the only mechanism I can think
<br>
of is singleton control, and singleton scenarios have very large
<br>
problems). In absence of hard data, we must assume expansion.

<p>Yes, I thought that's what I said. With the exception that exploration and
<br>
expansion are the same things, and metabolism of an advanced culture has
<br>
signatures detectable over mega light years (large patches of colonized
<br>
substrate, giga light years, but you can't observe these because deep
<br>
field is equivalent to young universe). Stealthy exploration=being nice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; paradox.
