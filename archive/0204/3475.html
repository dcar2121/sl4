evan noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;In Clarke's _Profiles of the Future_, he cites 'failure of imagination', 
<br>
and
<br>
'failure of nerve' as the two reasons why people so often underestimate the
<br>
future.  I really have trouble ascribing failure of imagination to either of
<br>
these authors.  I think the real trouble is that writers who consider
<br>
themselves 'hard sf' writers just don't deal with transhumanity or
<br>
singularities.  Perhaps, in their attitude that's too close to mysticism
<br>
than to hard science.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Clarke has had to re-evaluate his estimation of technical progress, 
<br>
downwards, more the revising upwards. Now will computer technology, form a 
<br>
cascade effect, such as nuclear weaponry did from theories in 1905- to 
<br>
detonation in 1945? Its quite possible, given the prodigiousness of computer 
<br>
technology. Will that cascade effect really be a singularity? Given the 
<br>
example of nuclear power, it made highly effective weapons, but as power 
<br>
sources, it seems less adaptable to human needs, in the mixmaster society we 
<br>
all must live in. Also the economics are a bit expensive.
<br>
<p>Rocketry seems to be a similar example, where it experienced a mighty 
<br>
growth-spurt, only to appear to have plateau-ed for quite a while. Again, 
<br>
will computer technology also reach a plateau before singularity? My opinion 
<br>
is that modern tech will certainly continue to produce amazing inventions, 
<br>
however, typically, we are on a road that has more stop signs, then 
<br>
superhighways. My opinion only.
