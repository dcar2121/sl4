<em>&gt; Let's say you believe in many worlds and you are offered the chance to run a simulation of your brain in a plausible, deterministic simulated world such that the simulation would predict your behavior in the real world in every case where the model agrees with reality. You know that the model is not entirely accurate because your simulation will be immortal, although the details of what that entails have not been specified. At the instant you flip the switch to start the simulation, you will be vaporized. Will you (not should you) flip the switch?

<p>Yes: it's the same as ordinary life, when your previous self
<br>
disappears utterly from the universe as soon as the moment passes.
