<p>
The coherence problem will be a practical one - does the extrapolated
<br>
volition of humanity converge under realistic constraints and models?
<br>
We'll need more theory to solve that issue.
<br>
<p>My objection has always been to the &quot;extrapolated&quot; aspects of it. It
<br>
seems entirely credible that a CEV constructed from me would conclude
<br>
that humanity should be killed off for some reason. I wouldn't follow
<br>
it down this path, and I don't see why I should.
<br>
<p>Most CEV advocates claim that simple caveats like &quot;don't kill off all
<br>
humans&quot; should be added. Eliezer mentioned a &quot;final judge&quot; which would
<br>
decide whether to implement the CEV or not, a conceptually similar
<br>
idea (though in practice much better).
<br>
<p>But if the CEV, in theory, can reach the &quot;wrong&quot; decision in ways we
<br>
can guard against, it can also reach the &quot;wrong&quot; decision in ways that
<br>
we cannot imagine. If I were an advanced AI, I could certainly come up
<br>
with a model of CEV which sounds irresistible when presented, but is
<br>
actually terminaly flawed (from the human perspective). How can we be
<br>
confident that the CEV will not converge on such a model? What is the
<br>
size of such models in potential CEV space? And why should we trust a
<br>
CEV any more than we trust a random friendly-looking AI?
<br>
<p>NB: Obviously, I don't object to medium distance CEV's:
<br>
Medium distance: An extrapolated volition that would require extended
<br>
education and argument before it became massively obvious in
<br>
retrospect.
<br>
Only to large distance ones:
<br>
Long distance: An extrapolated volition your present-day self finds
<br>
incomprehensible; not outrageous or annoying, but blankly
<br>
incomprehensible.
<br>
