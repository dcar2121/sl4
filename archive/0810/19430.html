Just in case we do, deep down, want to kill all humans. Perhaps we should add a hardcoded caveat to the friendliness function, that puts all basline, pre-posthuman, homo sapiens off limits to the AGI god's meddling. Let the Amish live whatever happens.

<p>Even if it did for sure completely rule out killing everyone as the actual
<br>
extrapolated volition, it is still possible it would choose to use all of
<br>
our atoms to build its cognitive horsepower simply because we are the
<br>
closest matter available,
<br>
<p>It's not like the AI has a utility function of &quot;compute CEV&quot; and then
<br>
suddenly swaps to a utility function of &quot;implement CEV&quot;, which is what
<br>
you're describing.  &quot;compute CEV&quot; is a subgoal of &quot;implement CEV&quot; from
<br>
the beginning.  An *extremely* fuzzy picture of what people want, the
<br>
sort you could get from browsing the Internet, would tell you that you
<br>
shouldn't kill them to compute what they want.
<br>
<p>and every planck unit of time in a
<br>
post-singularity world might have to be treated with care as it has vastly
<br>
more expected utility than our current meat-world (let's say 3^^^^3 utils).
<br>
<p>3^^^3 can't happen given known physics.
<br>
<p>I think it's extraordinarily more likely that a superintelligence will
<br>
discover a road to infinite time and computation than that it will
<br>
discover a finite computation in which Planck-time increments make
<br>
exponential differences to the final total.
<br>
<p>You're presuming that even in this case, we probably wouldn't-want to
<br>
be killed off.  I might even agree.  Hence CEV.  Anyway, the way I
<br>
proposed structuring it, nothing that killed off humanity could happen
<br>
until the AI was essentially sure, not just suspicious subject to
<br>
later resolution, that this is what we wanted - that was part of the
<br>
point of computing &quot;spread&quot; and not just summing up expected
<br>
utilities.  There's other issues having to do with Pascal's Wager that
<br>
I'm not going into here, but google Pascal's Mugging.
