<em>&gt; Let us say you believe in many worlds and you had been offered the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you wouldn't know you had been uploaded.
</em><br>
<p>By this you mean that there's no possible indeterminism in the
<br>
simulation. This is quite difficult (I don't even think this is
<br>
feasible) to achieve, because you need to forbid any IO, no
<br>
concurrency (all the simulator code must be single-threaded), assume
<br>
perfect hardware (no possible failures), use a deterministic seed for
<br>
the PRNG, find a PRNG that is random enough, etc..
<br>
<p>If we are assuming many worlds, there's no way these assumptions can
<br>
be held. For example, the choice of seed is fundamental, but different
<br>
worlds will use different choices of PRNG. Even if all the other
<br>
assumptions hold this alone will cause many simulated worlds to exist.
<br>
Also many world imply that the choice of one world going to upload is
<br>
irrelevant, in other branches you won't upload, all is accounted for
<br>
in the many worlds, there's no loss of branches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming you value the lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people you will never encounter, should you upload?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll give an argument for why you shouldn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More people will live if you upload. Your eyes are single photon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detectors, so sooner or later you will get split into different people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that follow different lives. You will have sex at different times, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different children will be conceived, due to different sperm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fertilising eggs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the the deterministic sim, you would be in a single world line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (albeit it much thicker). So should you have a child it would only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one child. Of course there is the miniscule possibility of arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum changes, leading to any possible world, if mangled worlds is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right they won't exist for long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in some senses you are condemning your many possible future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children to non-existance if you upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thoughts? It seems to me to be mixing up the first person view and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laplacian demon view, which I think is a mistake. But other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might find it interesting.
