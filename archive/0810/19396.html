A belated response to an interesting thread:

<p><em>&gt; Putting aside the issue of superrationality for now, I wonder if anyone

</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other's source code (beyond &quot;we don't know what SIs might be capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of, so we can't rule it out&quot;)?
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't have a certain answer. You have a prover agent P who's trying to
<br>
prove to an observer agent O that P's source code has goal G. To be more
<br>
precise, O and P each start controlling their own region of space. P wants
<br>
to prove that P's region of space is controlled by an agent that wants to
<br>
achieve G.
<br>
<p>Maybe O asks to send a set of probes into P's space that will &quot;sample&quot;
<br>
random regions of P's spacetime and confirm that they're occupied by mini
<br>
AGI's that are actively enforcing G. O would worry that P might rewrite the
<br>
probes with &quot;everything checks out great&quot; data before allowing the probes to
<br>
return to O, so O would have to somehow ensure that the probes' integrity is
<br>
maintained while outside the space that O controls. Perhaps the probes could
<br>
contain a secret key that self-destructs (is impossible to read) if the
<br>
probe is tampered with; if a probe comes back without the same secret key
<br>
then O would know P destroyed the probe and constructed a fake copy loaded
<br>
with false observations. Not sure how you could create such a probe; maybe
<br>
quantum no-cloning theorems could be of assistance in constructing it.
<br>
<p>If there is a benefit to smuggling weaponry into your rival's space, then P
<br>
might want to audit that the probes are harmless before allowing them into
<br>
his space. That part seems easier; even if there isn't a way to scan a probe
<br>
for weaponry without threatening its secret, probably you could still use
<br>
fancy cryptographic tricks so that P can scan and blow up probes #5, 6, and
<br>
17, and then prove afterwards to O that P's decision to blow up those
<br>
particular probes was pre-determined, and therefore that those probes
<br>
weren't blown up because those particular probes stumbled upon Something
<br>
They Weren't Supposed To See.
<br>
<p>Once O verifies that X percent of P's space is filled with G-friendly
<br>
nano-AI's, then O probably won't worry that some anti-G time-bomb is hiding
<br>
in some corner of P's space, since the rest of the G-friendly mini-AI's
<br>
wouldn't *want* such a time bomb to continue existing and would search for
<br>
and destroy such a time bomb if there was a chance of it existing.
