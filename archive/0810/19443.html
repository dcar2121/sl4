</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree with that - if a CEV is meant to be incomprehensible to us,
<br>
how are we going to decide the interface between many differing CEV's?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The whole
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the wisdom and foresight of a pack of mortal programmers thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with their own tiny brains at the uttermost dawn of time.
</em><br>
<p>I fear the strain may be inevitable, in some form or other, and that
<br>
the CEV is an invalid shortcut. That said, it's most attractive aspect
<br>
is precisely its universality, as you mentioned there; that a bunch of
<br>
evil programmers (ie those I don't agree with) couls implement it as
<br>
easily as a bunch of &quot;good&quot; one.
