<p>
The darkness of the room was carefully controlled, mingling zones of
<br>
absolute black with roving rays of lights that occasionally
<br>
illuminated the nightmarish instruments. They never lingered too long,
<br>
leaving the man unable to distinguish anything but a series of
<br>
impressions: sharp blades, serated edges, gleaming wires, hideous
<br>
creatures made of levers and chains.
<br>
<p>Then, a sudden spotlight, as the torturer entered the room. Lit in the
<br>
glare, the torturer greated his victim with a smile, took off his
<br>
white gloves, and said in a warm friendly voice: &quot;Well, we better get
<br>
started, shouldn't we? You have any initial preferences -
<br>
electrocution or the rack?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; begged the man, desperately. Fear overwhelmed him, rendering
<br>
him incapable of speech, and fear also granted him a crystal clear
<br>
lucidity. Floating between these two extreemes, he was just about
<br>
coherent at the moment. &quot;Please! What are doing to me?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Torturing you for fifty years,&quot; the torturer answered, looking at his
<br>
watch. &quot;You're only waisting your own time in asking questions, you
<br>
know. I can stay here for centuries, and any time you waste now will
<br>
just get added on at the end.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Torturing for fifty years?!?!? But why!??!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, it's quite simple. There is a mailing list called SL4, and they
<br>
like to test out philosophical ideas. When talking about morality and
<br>
ethics, their standard &quot;worst case scenario&quot; is having someone
<br>
tortured for fifty years. A reasonable amount of time, I feel.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Reasonable?!?!?!?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, they use a metric system, and know that people's life
<br>
expectancy is in the 70s or 80s, so quite reasonable.&quot; He looked at
<br>
his watch again. &quot;Do you want a cup of tea, while I warm up the
<br>
instruments?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But why me?&quot;, the man begged plaintively.
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't take it personally; you are just a random litterary creation,
<br>
created simply for the purpose of suffering. I bet you don't even have
<br>
a name.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I do! I'm called... Roger.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;You just made that up. You don't even have any discernable features,
<br>
up until the moment where they become relevant to the reader.&quot;
<br>
<p>The man nervously passed a trembling three-fingered hand through his
<br>
thin black hair, and fixed his imploring brown eyes on the torturer.
<br>
&quot;Can you please... not do it?&quot;
<br>
<p>The torturer shrugged apologetically. &quot;Sorry, I'm as constrained by
<br>
the philosophical example as you are. I don't have much personality to
<br>
speak of - it's an interesting fact that SL4 examples look at the
<br>
tortured in great details, but don't care much about the mind of the
<br>
torturer.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What's this philosophical example, then? What is it that's causing me
<br>
to suffer so?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a bit complicated,&quot; the torturer answered. &quot;It's one of those
<br>
conversations where everyone is talking past each other and no-one
<br>
actually listens. The exchange has got so convoluted that you are
<br>
being tortured to undermine a tiny facet of an irrelevant argument.&quot;
<br>
<p>The man lay there, fear and despair mounting each other within him
<br>
until they reached unimaginably high summits.
<br>
<p>&quot;You know what's funny, though?&quot; asked the torturer with a wide grin.
<br>
Receiving no answer, he continued: &quot;The example is flawed! You getting
<br>
tortured does not actually make the point the author is trying to
<br>
make! It's completely useless. Within a few hours, fifty people will
<br>
point out the flaw, and the author will retract his example, or more
<br>
likely, just forget about it. Your pain is worthless.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;At least the torturing will stop in a few hours, then?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid that, as a literary figure, you can get fifty years of
<br>
torture within a single sentence. And the torture will be duplicated
<br>
exactly every time someone new reads the sentence - a few hundred
<br>
times, at least. Though one of the SL4 debates is whether that counts
<br>
as you being tortured a hundred times or only once; we'll just have to
<br>
see, won't we. It'll be fun!&quot;
<br>
<p>The kettle beeped, signifying that the tea was ready; then the
<br>
electrodes beeped, signifying that the various implements of agony
<br>
were also ready.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now where was I?&quot;, the torturer wondered. &quot;Ah yes, electrocution or
<br>
the rack...&quot; An smile of innnocent joy crossed his lips. &quot;Why not try
<br>
both?&quot;
