Actually, I'm not talking about individual volition. I'm talking about
<br>
self-organizing clusters of coherent extrapolated volition. At the
<br>
moment, it seems like Eliezer is willing to concede failure of CEV
<br>
altogether if it fails to converge on one consensus (his Final Judge
<br>
comments), and other parts of CEV.html. I'm just asking why not
<br>
empirically determine the optimal number of CEVs, and follow them all?
<br>
<p>If anything, it would be safer to pursue 10 well-fitted CEVs than
<br>
shoehorning humanity into 1 kinda-fitting CEV. The objection seems to be
<br>
lack of lateral mobility and conflict between factions. Well, having
<br>
just one CEV means 0 lateral mobility to any other model. As for
<br>
conflict, we seem to be assuming some scarce quantity to have conflicts
<br>
*about*. Why would this be a valid assumption in the long term? Is there
<br>
any reason the FAI can't ultimately build planets/dyson
<br>
spheres/simulation spaces to accomodate as many diverging humanities as
<br>
necessary?
<br>
<p>I suspect that, like most of us Western intellectuals, Eliezer has a
<br>
'Universalist' bias. I.e. diversity and &quot;getting along with each other&quot;
<br>
takes on an axiomatic value regardless of the actual impact this has on
<br>
the species (which, I might add, has spent most of its history living in
<br>
relatively small and relatively interrelated groups). For this reason, I
<br>
expect the initial implementation of CEV to be wrong, and hope that at
<br>
least the self-correcting functionality works properly. Hopefully the
<br>
Universalist bias will  not infect the CEV to the point where it
<br>
propagates through the self-correction cycle itself.
<br>
<p>It would be useful to find a way to replace these places in the equation
<br>
currently occupied by 'hope' with 'likelihood'.
