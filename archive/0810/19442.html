<p>
I was VERY happy to see this post in the Transhumanism 2 comment
<br>
thread. It validates all the time we spend defending our ideas in
<br>
public fora:
<br>
<p>&quot;Prior to reading this debate, I assumed, somewhat complacently, that
<br>
transhumanists were indeed a bunch of technophilic fanatics and
<br>
utopians.
<br>
<p>I have to say, however, that most of the posts from the transhumanists
<br>
in this debate were very impressive and well-reasoned. It was,
<br>
instead, the counter-posts which appeared to be largely abusive and
<br>
dismissive.
<br>
<p>I remain in doubt about the wisdom of transhumanism, but I also wonder
<br>
about the honesty of those who attack them. As the transhumanists
<br>
point out, they are advocating meliorism, not utopianism, yet they
<br>
continue to be mis-represented as utopians. That type of
<br>
mis-representation sets the alarm bells ringing, and I wonder how many
<br>
of those who oppose transhumanism do so because they believe that the
<br>
only type of salvation is religious salvation.&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a very interesting blog post on Transhumanism Rising, author Bryan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Appleyard (How to Live Forever or Die Trying) concedes that &quot;What I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like about transhumanists is their naked, unapologetic radicalism…
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they simply ask, what's so great about human life as it now is?…
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism is a coming thing, a future faith&quot;. But the tone of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article is mostly negative: &quot;their technophilia is oppressive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naive. Much of the magazine [H+] is just gadgetry with attitude.&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He also says: &quot;What I don't like about transhumanists is the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they simply refuse to understand certain arguments of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents&quot;. He may have a point here, but I don't &quot;refuse&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand their arguments - I just don't understand them. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand why disease should be better than health, and death should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be better than life. I simply don't understand it. I have seen loved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones dying, and I can tell you that death is ugly. You know that too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is understandable that previous generations, unable to imagine life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension and immortality technologies, forced themselves to accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death (if you cannot escape something, you'd better like it). But we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are beginning to see that aging and death are engineering problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waiting for engineering solutions. In reply Appleyard quotes Leon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kass, Francis Fukuyama and Bill McKibben, who &quot;have attacked this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea, arguing, in essence, that death is an essential aspect of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity&quot;. This is, to say it in good Latin, BULLSHIT. I consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curiosity, kindness and love for others, and appreciation of beauty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and art, as essential aspects of our humanity. NOT DEATH.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to say that Appleyard makes an effort to be as fair and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective as possible given his bias, and that the comment thread is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprisingly interesting, with a mix of declared transhumanists, rabid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-transhumanists, and neutral interested observers. I especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liked the comment of the reader who, referring to Appleyard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhortation &quot;It's time to burnish your best pro-death arguments&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replied &quot;Hey, didn't Auschwitz already make that argument about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convincingly as it can be made?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a followup post on Transhumanism 2 Appleyard concedes that &quot;Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating power to transform the world will, inevitably, give us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the power to transform ourselves. All sorts of enhancements will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur, not least enormously increased life span. This may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible but there are good reasons for thinking it will be.&quot;. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, prehaps surprised by the transhumanist-friendly attidude of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readers of the first post, he repeats easy and dull non-arguments like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;this is, in part, a consumerist idea - you buy medical immortality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much as you would buy a pair of shoes.&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disgusting, isn't it. Buying life as easily and affordably like buying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a pair of shoes. It this an outrageous insult to the holiness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering and the tragically beautiful mistery of death? Perhaps, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is precisely what I want: to give everyone on the planet easy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affordable access to more health, more life and, why not, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness. This is what transhumanism is about.
