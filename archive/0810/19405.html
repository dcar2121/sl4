Evil bastard you are.
<br>
<p>We should upload and torture some copies of you.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; An: <a href="mailto:sl4@sl4.org?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Victims%20of%20SL4">sl4@sl4.org</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Betreff: [sl4] Victims of SL4
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The darkness of the room was carefully controlled, mingling zones of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute black with roving rays of lights that occasionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illuminated the nightmarish instruments. They never lingered too long,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving the man unable to distinguish anything but a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressions: sharp blades, serated edges, gleaming wires, hideous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures made of levers and chains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, a sudden spotlight, as the torturer entered the room. Lit in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glare, the torturer greated his victim with a smile, took off his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white gloves, and said in a warm friendly voice: &quot;Well, we better get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started, shouldn't we? You have any initial preferences -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrocution or the rack?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Wait,&quot; begged the man, desperately. Fear overwhelmed him, rendering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him incapable of speech, and fear also granted him a crystal clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lucidity. Floating between these two extreemes, he was just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coherent at the moment. &quot;Please! What are doing to me?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Torturing you for fifty years,&quot; the torturer answered, looking at his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watch. &quot;You're only waisting your own time in asking questions, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know. I can stay here for centuries, and any time you waste now will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just get added on at the end.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Torturing for fifty years?!?!? But why!??!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Well, it's quite simple. There is a mailing list called SL4, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to test out philosophical ideas. When talking about morality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics, their standard &quot;worst case scenario&quot; is having someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured for fifty years. A reasonable amount of time, I feel.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Reasonable?!?!?!?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Well, they use a metric system, and know that people's life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectancy is in the 70s or 80s, so quite reasonable.&quot; He looked at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his watch again. &quot;Do you want a cup of tea, while I warm up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instruments?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;But why me?&quot;, the man begged plaintively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Don't take it personally; you are just a random litterary creation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created simply for the purpose of suffering. I bet you don't even have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a name.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I do! I'm called... Roger.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You just made that up. You don't even have any discernable features,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up until the moment where they become relevant to the reader.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The man nervously passed a trembling three-fingered hand through his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thin black hair, and fixed his imploring brown eyes on the torturer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Can you please... not do it?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The torturer shrugged apologetically. &quot;Sorry, I'm as constrained by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the philosophical example as you are. I don't have much personality to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak of - it's an interesting fact that SL4 examples look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured in great details, but don't care much about the mind of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torturer.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What's this philosophical example, then? What is it that's causing me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to suffer so?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's a bit complicated,&quot; the torturer answered. &quot;It's one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversations where everyone is talking past each other and no-one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually listens. The exchange has got so convoluted that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being tortured to undermine a tiny facet of an irrelevant argument.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The man lay there, fear and despair mounting each other within him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until they reached unimaginably high summits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You know what's funny, though?&quot; asked the torturer with a wide grin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Receiving no answer, he continued: &quot;The example is flawed! You getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured does not actually make the point the author is trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make! It's completely useless. Within a few hours, fifty people will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out the flaw, and the author will retract his example, or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely, just forget about it. Your pain is worthless.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;At least the torturing will stop in a few hours, then?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I'm afraid that, as a literary figure, you can get fifty years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torture within a single sentence. And the torture will be duplicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly every time someone new reads the sentence - a few hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times, at least. Though one of the SL4 debates is whether that counts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you being tortured a hundred times or only once; we'll just have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see, won't we. It'll be fun!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The kettle beeped, signifying that the tea was ready; then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrodes beeped, signifying that the various implements of agony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were also ready.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Now where was I?&quot;, the torturer wondered. &quot;Ah yes, electrocution or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rack...&quot; An smile of innnocent joy crossed his lips. &quot;Why not try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both?&quot;
</em><br>
