<em>&gt; Let us say you believe in many worlds and you had been offered the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum randomness would be generated by PRNG. It would be so good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you wouldn't know you had been uploaded. Assuming you value the lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people you will never encounter, should you upload?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll give an argument for why you shouldn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More people will live if you upload. Your eyes are single photon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detectors, so sooner or later you will get split into different people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that follow different lives. You will have sex at different times, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different children will be conceived, due to different sperm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fertilising eggs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the the deterministic sim, you would be in a single world line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (albeit it much thicker). So should you have a child it would only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one child. Of course there is the minuscule possibility of arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum changes, leading to any possible world, if mangled worlds is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right they won't exist for long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in some senses you are condemning your many possible future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children to non-existence if you upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thoughts? It seems to me to be mixing up the first person view and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laplacian demon view, which I think is a mistake. But other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might find it interesting.
</em><br>

<p>I'm going to echo Matt here: it doesn't matter which you pick.
<br>
<p>The situations pre-supposes Many Worlds, yes? So, because you've been
<br>
given a binary choice, there are two universes proceeding forth*. Both
<br>
alternatives happen - the Will who refuses goes on to do all the stuff
<br>
you mention, and the Will who is destroyed for an upload goes on to do
<br>
all the simulated stuff. It all comes out the same. Suppose somehow
<br>
both Wills choose not to be simulated - how is this sensible? The two
<br>
branches are identical. So what if there are 2 identical branches
<br>
where Will refuses and is instantly vaporized by a gas explosion, a
<br>
crashing air-liner, and a train jumping the rails? They're the same
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>If you're going to continue in this vein, I think you would need to
<br>
invoke probabilities or something, and say that the simulation choice
<br>
is immoral because it lowers how *many* branches all those potential
<br>
entities will pop up in. You can't argue that it's immoral because
<br>
they may not show up period.
<br>
<p>* Let's assume you chose based on the decay of an atom. But even if
<br>
you specify that one is choosing based just on normal mental
<br>
decision-making, I think we can trace it all back to some quantum
<br>
event. I hope it's not controversial to argue that if it can happen,
<br>
in MW it does.
