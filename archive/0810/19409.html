<em>&gt; Hey, you're only telling one side of the story!  Where are my 3^^^3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descriptions of people getting dust specks in their eyes?
</em><br>
<p><p>Elbert Smith, assistant Sheriff for the third dragon cavalry division
<br>
of the Peace Corps of the planet Eridan, took a moment to pause from
<br>
itemising the beauty of his face and his wife's face (he needed that
<br>
info to complete his tax forms) and glanced across at the snivelling
<br>
prisoner locked away in the Great Outdoors. It had taken many years of
<br>
his life - plus a few extra years he had got from a local time
<br>
merchant, in exchange for turning a blind eye to the local Paradox
<br>
trade - to catch the Eternal Sniveller, but it was finally done.
<br>
<p>His chest swelled with pride, so he took it out and installed a new
<br>
chest. As he did so, some mote of dust danced into his eye, and he
<br>
blinked it away. He then returned to his tax forms, taking out an
<br>
official purple-and-green-poke-a-dot crayon...
<br>
<p><p>Ulurgh Magu, caveman of the Arketh tribe, greeted the rising sun with
<br>
a groan, a rubbed his neck, above the scar left by an old stone
<br>
discus...
<br>
<p><p><p>Elbert Smith: Hey wait a moment! What happened to me? Why are you
<br>
suddenly on to this Ulurgh Magu guy?
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: I'm afraid the rest of you is not important. You are
<br>
another philosophical example, and you only exist to get a dust speck
<br>
in your eyes.
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: What?! What about my wife? The Dragon Cavalry? That
<br>
wierd 'Great Outdoors'? The Eternal Sniveller? My tax returns? Me
<br>
installing a new chest?
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: Just background detail to flesh out your character.
<br>
It's just enough to make you feel real, so that people empathise with
<br>
you. Now, moving on, I have another 3^^^3 - 1 of these descriptions to
<br>
write...
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: My entire existence is only background story to me
<br>
getting a speck of dust in my eye?
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: Yep! And your life is now officially over. Now,
<br>
Ulurgh Magu was...
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: Wait just a moment. You're going to end my life, just so
<br>
you can write 3^^^3 - 1 other brief stories? That's going to take
<br>
forever!
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: Well, maybe I can do a few crowd scenes... a
<br>
minimalist dust storm in an arab village, and everyone gets a dust
<br>
speck at once... lots of space-arabs available in fictional space...
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: Even if your &quot;villages&quot; have a population of billions
<br>
upon billions, it will still take you forever. I propose you a deal!
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: Such as...?
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: You want to have these 3^^^3 - 1 stories written, and I
<br>
want to survive, yeah?
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: Yes...
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: So just task me with doing the work; I'll get to live a
<br>
long, long time, until it's all ended, and you get to avoid effort.
<br>
<p>Stuart Armstrong: Hum... Ok then! But I warn you, writing 3^^^3 - 1
<br>
character snippets is heavy work! How you going to handle it?
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: Easy! Ulurgh Magu, come here.
<br>
<p>Ulurgh Magu: Urg?
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: I want you to do something for me. Writing some stuff.
<br>
Now, it may take some time. A rather brutally massive amount of time,
<br>
in fact. Warn me when it's done...
<br>
<p>Ulurgh Magu: Urga-gu?
<br>
<p>Elbert Smith: Yes, of course you can subcontract the writing to your
<br>
own characters as well...
