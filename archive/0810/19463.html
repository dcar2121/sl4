<em>&gt;&gt; * Let's assume you chose based on the decay of an atom. But even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you specify that one is choosing based just on normal mental

<em>&gt;&gt; decision-making, I think we can trace it all back to some quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; event. I hope it's not controversial to argue that if it can happen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in MW it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Preference for thicker worlds is implicit in any thought of preference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in decision making in MW.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you don't think it makes a difference morally what you chose, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a choice to do good at all? Why should we blame someone for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing someone, if it was going to happen anyway? We just happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in the world where he did it.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly do follow this line of thought, and I have always had
<br>
trouble seeing how one can be moral in a MW.
<br>
<p>But even with thickness, I'm not sure it works. Yes, perhaps I chose
<br>
to spare that man's life, but wouldn't as many versions of me have
<br>
also chosen to kill him in myriads of ways? How can my choice to be
<br>
moral have affected 'thickness' of happier branches of the MW, given
<br>
its timelessness and determinism? Can I be sure that thicknesses do
<br>
indeed vary - clearly in a MW with an infinite number of branches
<br>
every thickness is the same as the others, but even if I assume a MW
<br>
with a finite number of branches, aren't there more branches where
<br>
everybody does immoral things or die horribly (because there are so
<br>
many more ways to be immoral or to be dead than to be moral or alive)?
<br>
For that matter, what that it matter if thicknesses are changing for
<br>
the better? We are products of our unique contingent path through the
<br>
MW - we're not taking a airplane flight above the MW &amp; parachuting
<br>
into some random branch after a lifetime of good works. Assuming
<br>
ourselves to be a random observer may be useful for Rawls thinking
<br>
about ideal forms of governance or Bostrom working on knotty
<br>
probability questions, but I don't see the connection to this sort of
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mangled worlds, <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/mangledworlds.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/mangledworlds.html</a>, might also
</em><br>
