Flooded by transhumanist-friendly comments to the first blog post,
<br>
Appleyard has written a second blog post:
<br>
<a href="http://www.bryanappleyard.com/blog/2008/10/transhumanism-2.php">http://www.bryanappleyard.com/blog/2008/10/transhumanism-2.php</a>
<br>
<p>Let's show him that he will not run away from us so easily!
<br>
<p>My comments - links in

<a href="http://transumanar.com/index.php/site/transhumanism_rising/">http://transumanar.com/index.php/site/transhumanism_rising/</a>
<br>
<p>In a very interesting blog post on Transhumanism Rising, author Bryan
<br>
Appleyard (How to Live Forever or Die Trying) concedes that &quot;What I
<br>
like about transhumanists is their naked, unapologetic radicalism…
<br>
they simply ask, what's so great about human life as it now is?…
<br>
transhumanism is a coming thing, a future faith&quot;. But the tone of the
<br>
article is mostly negative: &quot;their technophilia is oppressive and
<br>
naive. Much of the magazine [H+] is just gadgetry with attitude.&quot;.
<br>
<p>He also says: &quot;What I don't like about transhumanists is the fact that
<br>
they simply refuse to understand certain arguments of their
<br>
opponents&quot;. He may have a point here, but I don't &quot;refuse&quot; to
<br>
understand their arguments - I just don't understand them. I don't
<br>
understand why disease should be better than health, and death should
<br>
be better than life. I simply don't understand it. I have seen loved
<br>
ones dying, and I can tell you that death is ugly. You know that too.
<br>
It is understandable that previous generations, unable to imagine life
<br>
extension and immortality technologies, forced themselves to accept
<br>
death (if you cannot escape something, you'd better like it). But we
<br>
are beginning to see that aging and death are engineering problems
<br>
waiting for engineering solutions. In reply Appleyard quotes Leon
<br>
Kass, Francis Fukuyama and Bill McKibben, who &quot;have attacked this
<br>
idea, arguing, in essence, that death is an essential aspect of our
<br>
humanity&quot;. This is, to say it in good Latin, BULLSHIT. I consider
<br>
curiosity, kindness and love for others, and appreciation of beauty
<br>
and art, as essential aspects of our humanity. NOT DEATH.
<br>
<p>I have to say that Appleyard makes an effort to be as fair and
<br>
objective as possible given his bias, and that the comment thread is
<br>
surprisingly interesting, with a mix of declared transhumanists, rabid
<br>
anti-transhumanists, and neutral interested observers. I especially
<br>
liked the comment of the reader who, referring to Appleyard
<br>
exhortation &quot;It's time to burnish your best pro-death arguments&quot;,
<br>
replied &quot;Hey, didn't Auschwitz already make that argument about as
<br>
convincingly as it can be made?&quot;.
<br>
<p>In a followup post on Transhumanism 2 Appleyard concedes that &quot;Our
<br>
accelerating power to transform the world will, inevitably, give us
<br>
the power to transform ourselves. All sorts of enhancements will
<br>
occur, not least enormously increased life span. This may not be
<br>
possible but there are good reasons for thinking it will be.&quot;. But
<br>
then, prehaps surprised by the transhumanist-friendly attidude of many
<br>
readers of the first post, he repeats easy and dull non-arguments like
<br>
&quot;this is, in part, a consumerist idea - you buy medical immortality
<br>
much as you would buy a pair of shoes.&quot;.
<br>
<p>Disgusting, isn't it. Buying life as easily and affordably like buying
<br>
a pair of shoes. It this an outrageous insult to the holiness of
<br>
suffering and the tragically beautiful mistery of death? Perhaps, but
<br>
this is precisely what I want: to give everyone on the planet easy and
<br>
affordable access to more health, more life and, why not, more
<br>
happiness. This is what transhumanism is about.
