<p>
Let us say you believe in many worlds and you had been offered the
<br>
chance to upload into a deterministic simulation to live forever, any
<br>
quantum randomness would be generated by PRNG. It would be so good,
<br>
you wouldn't know you had been uploaded. Assuming you value the lives
<br>
of people you will never encounter, should you upload?
<br>
<p>I'll give an argument for why you shouldn't.
<br>
<p>More people will live if you upload. Your eyes are single photon
<br>
detectors, so sooner or later you will get split into different people
<br>
that follow different lives. You will have sex at different times, and
<br>
different children will be conceived, due to different sperm
<br>
fertilising eggs.
<br>
<p>In the the deterministic sim, you would be in a single world line
<br>
(albeit it much thicker). So should you have a child it would only be
<br>
one child. Of course there is the miniscule possibility of arbitrary
<br>
quantum changes, leading to any possible world, if mangled worlds is
<br>
right they won't exist for long.
<br>
<p>So in some senses you are condemning your many possible future
<br>
children to non-existance if you upload.
<br>
<p>Thoughts? It seems to me to be mixing up the first person view and the
<br>
laplacian demon view, which I think is a mistake. But other people
<br>
might find it interesting.
