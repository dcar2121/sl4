I think a 'grey goo'-like situation is possible with AI, call it a 'chrome army' scenario if you like. Truely smart weapons would be truely terrifying, and probably unstoppable (with the exception of having a nanotech defence).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My book on the situation has been that AI that's dumb enough to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;willing tool will, indeed, have military applications.  Virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything does.  I don't think those military applications are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extreme as to grant an unbeatable advantage in war, especially if both
</em><br>
<p>'dumb enough to be a willing tool' assumes a well-balanced mind. An AI
<br>
with modified (or hard coded) motivation can be a smart killing
<br>
machine. Even a genius can be a serial killer.
<br>
<p>I don't know about you but I can think of some pretty extreme military
<br>
applications. Intelligent machine guns with legs, mass produced by the
<br>
thousands, air dropped into a country. You wouldn't stand a chance.
<br>
I'm sure Saddam Hussein could think of something even cheaper to
<br>
build.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;sides have the AI.  And there's no intrinsic imbalance between offense
</em><br>
<p>If both sides have AI then it would give the other side a chance, but
<br>
it isn't like a nuclear Mutual Assured Destruction arms race whereby
<br>
the stick just gets bigger. AI can be subtle and surprising. How would
<br>
you combat a swarm of robot insects without being prepared? I haven't
<br>
even thought about the possibilities of self-replicating macro/micro
<br>
robots.
<br>
<p>Also how can we be sure that AI is shared anyway?, what if the US
<br>
military comes up with it first? or just takes a promising open-source
<br>
effort and completes it ahead of us?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and defense.  In information warfare, for example, an ounce of defensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI will probably turn out to be worth a pound of offensive AI.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand your argument here. You mention there's no
<br>
imbalance, then give me an imbalanced example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Genuine AI might seriously exacerbate the nanotechnology problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however.  As it is, we're likely to see giant, unwieldy vats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;synthesizing diamondoid fighter jets years before we have to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actual goo.  AI could seriously compress that time period.
</em><br>
<p>I don't claim to fully understand the low-level chemistry. I hope
<br>
nanotech is naturally limited by lack of fuel/material in the same way
<br>
fire is. However bacteria seem to grow everywhere on earth.
<br>
<p>Smart nanotech would be unimaginably powerful. Singularity type stuff
<br>
indeed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't really see a feasible alternative, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So as you can imagine I'm a little concerned at the idea of open source AI. This possible scenario is not mentioned anywhere on the website. As the #1 rule is 'Don't fry the planet' I think it deserves some attention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'll join in a sigh to the general sentiment.  Ultraproductivity kicking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hell out of the economy, military applications of everything...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accelerating the future is like tap-dancing through a minefield.  Around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the most you can do is hope to accelerate the defensive, social, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cushioning aspects of a technology ahead of the offensive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destabilizing, and sudden-shock aspects.  A tradition going back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Drexler and hypertext.
</em><br>
<p>You're probably right on that last point. Maybe a push to make AI more
<br>
open will help level the playing field.
<br>
<p>I also think we should encourage researchers not to patent their
<br>
designs, unless it's to reserve the right for everyone to build it. 
<br>
There's no such thing as a just monopoly.
