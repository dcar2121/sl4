<p>Patrick McCuller: Tuesday 22-Feb-00
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm nitpicking today.
</em><br>
<p>So long as you don't eat any.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In his book 'The Age of Spiritual Machines', Kurzweil makes a pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good case that Moore's law describes a curve that describes the amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of computational power available for fixed money at any given time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He fits Moore's law onto a graph going back a century, to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers and so on.  There are - I don't have the book to reference -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least three paradigm shifts.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, but that's taking a long-term view over the shallow end of the curve,
<br>
it's not too shocking that a chaotic factor might fit in with the underlying
<br>
trend there, but as the technology accelerates, I suspect the random/chaotic
<br>
nature of the shifts will start to cause more deviation.  Does the arrival
<br>
of the Internet fit into the curve?  What about SETI@home?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Pain is any sensory qualia that induces a feeling of suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Suffering is something else entirely, and it is quite separate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Minds can suffer without pain, (Although human minds tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experience hallucinatory pain as a result of such suffering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; another result of our long and messy evolution) and they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experience pain without suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This leaves open the possibility that suffering is itself qualia.
</em><br>
<p>This is real nature-of-existence stuff, isn't it?
<br>
<p>Hmm.  The difference between bain and suffering is that pain is a
<br>
sense between body and mind, whereas suffering is something that can
<br>
happen internally.  Indeed, deprive a mind entirely of sensory qualia
<br>
and they will suffer as a direct result, and probably go quite mad,
<br>
even cease to be a mind at all.
<br>
<p>I suppose it is a qualia in itself, but not of quite the same form
<br>
as 'green', for example.  'Green' is one qualia through which the
<br>
sense of sight is experienced directly, while 'suffering' is one
<br>
through which the mind directly experiences its own state.
<br>
<p>Does this suggest that only a self aware mind can suffer?
<br>
(Accepting that 'self aware' is a property with fuzzy edges)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I probably can't accurately predict what would be lethal to a post-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity being, but I'm certain lethal events would exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore an awareness of injury and physical danger will be a part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any long-lived intelligent being, whatever the qualia involved.
</em><br>
<p>True enough.  Minds must be able to learn, therefore able to change,
<br>
and so they will always be ultimately mortal.  Does awareness of danger
<br>
have to come as a direct sense, though, or is it enough to be able to
<br>
look at something through pure information senses and think 'I don't
<br>
intend to do that, because I would die'?  It should be easy enough to
<br>
protect children and animals from accidentally falling into black holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think what you're describing is called the soul making theodicy,
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a high school rock band. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Martin's 'Atheism: A Philosophical Justification' makes the case that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering isn't necessary to build character or to motivate desires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He postulates that even in a world free from pain, people can still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generous with time or love.  And even if there is no suffering, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must always be a happiness gradient - you could always be happier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world could always be better.
</em><br>
<p>But just to play god's advocate, is the zero point on the happiness
<br>
gradient absolute, or will an individual always acclimatise to their
<br>
life so that one end of their range of feeling is always experienced
<br>
as personal grief, and the other as joy?  Is suffering really nothing
<br>
more than the gut knowledge that you could be happier than you are?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That doesn't sound right..  If someone opened up my brain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intentionally damaged my cognitive processes I'd certainly call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that grievous assault, but torture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Messing with cognitive processes can be torture. Imagine total paranoia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine having panphobia or even panophobia! Imagine having Capgras'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; syndrome or even Cotard's syndrome.
</em><br>
<p>Happily beyond my powers of visualisation..  I take the point.
<br>
Randomly crosswiring any mind is likely to hurt it horrifically.
<br>
On the question of causing accidental suffering, the waters get
<br>
very murky indeed.  I'd say that the risks you take with another's
<br>
well being are at the core of the matter, not the outcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Perhaps torture is the act of forcing an experience on a creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; against its will, with the intent to cause suffering.  That way it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; doesn't matter what pain and suffering actually mean from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; victim's perspective, it is the intent to cause it that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the act one of torture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The victim's perspective has to be a part of it, otherwise torture can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a victimless crime, which I don't believe in for all sorts of moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons.  (The victim's perspective can't be the entire matter either.)
</em><br>
<p>A victimless crime, just because an attempt to torture happens to fail?
<br>
I don't know about that..  If someone tries to punch me in the face,
<br>
I consider that to be an assault irrespective of how well they actually
<br>
manage to aim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Though even arguing this opens up huge avenues.  For instance, it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be possible to kill someone without their experiencing pain - or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything at all.  Sudden enough death would preclude any kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realization.  This wouldn't be torture, but it would still be wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Seperate issue, I think.  If you don't own your own existence,
<br>
to continue or terminate it as you will, then what can you own?
<br>
<p>That said, I have killed animals to end pointless suffering.
<br>
Sometimes you can't know the right thing to do, and you just
<br>
have to guess.  I hope I never have to choose for a friend,
<br>
but I'd make a judgement and live with it.  I'd rather get
<br>
it wrong than refuse to think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a feeling the whole thing is semantics.
</em><br>
<p>Possibly.  I think we both know torture when we see it,
<br>
but we are set up for empathy with human beings and cute
<br>
furry animals, not machines.  We may need a system of
<br>
ethics built from cold hard logic before long.
