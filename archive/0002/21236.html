<p>I'm responding to a digest message through the onelist web site, so this may 
<br>
mess up any kind of thread tracking your mailer may be doing. Sorry.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Message: 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Date: Thu, 10 Feb 2000 22:50:08 +0000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   From: Marc Forrester &lt;A1200@xxxxx.xx.xx.xx&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Subject: Abandon Ship
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What we want and what the military want are two different things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That doesn't mean they're mutually exclusive.  We can't design them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be 'good', or rather we can, but they could easily be changed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think any militaries want AI as intelligent as themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyway.  They want loyal, obedient animal-like minds with blinding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reaction speed and instincts hard-wired into their missile racks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Scary stuff, certainly, but not apocalyptically so.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;My understanding of the reason the military in the US put so much money in AI 
<br>
research decades ago was not for the purposes of developing smarter weapons or 
<br>
meaner soldiers, but rather for the purpose of creating superior intelligence 
<br>
analysis agents. 'Intelligence' in this sense meaning spy stuff, satellite 
<br>
photes, etc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The reason for this is that it takes a great deal of training and a special 
<br>
kind of knack for a human to decide whether a satellite photograph has a 
<br>
concealed tank in it, or how many soldiers are in a bunker, and so on. This 
<br>
skill and related skills are expensive and so the 'MI' gained from it is 
<br>
thereby expensive. Automating some or all of these tasks would be, they 
<br>
reasoned, in the long term more cost efficient.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;There are more examples, like monitoring intercepted radio and phone traffic. 
<br>
For instance, if during a stalemate situation (the cold war in Germany in the 
<br>
70s, the Chinese vs. Taiwan, etc.) someone happened to notice that a general's 
<br>
wife is burning up the phone lines looking for her husband, you might 
<br>
(possibly) conclude that the brass have been sequestered prior to a sneak 
<br>
attack (which I've been told is likely, though I can't quote my source).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Military people might be very happy to put up with an AI 'smart' in the sense 
<br>
of the ability to track disparate data over huge spectra and draw MI 
<br>
conclusions from them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;That's not to say that the militaries of the world won't think up all kinds of 
<br>
ways to use AI to kill people. I'm only speaking historically.
