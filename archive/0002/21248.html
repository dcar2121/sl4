<p><em>&gt; Because Norn, Aibo and Catz personalities are mostly made of cute graphics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sampled sound effects, with a net connecting it all together that you
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; sketch on a sheet of A4 with a big thick pen.  They're about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious as moss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aren't they?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was thinking more in terms of something that could actually deal with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated 3D world that it could see, feel and hear, something that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn a basic symbolic language just from exposure, like chimpanzees with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sign language.  Still, as Patrick points out, the implications of Norn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torture pages are frankly hideous.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though honestly I had no real experience with this sort of thing. So this
<br>
weekend I boght Creatures 3 and played with it for a few hours.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the graphics are beautiful and compelling. The game is divided into
<br>
several large scrollable areas, called Terrariums. Each contains a 'home'
<br>
ecology with a number of interesting critters, most of which are bugs or
<br>
ground life. They seem to have some kind of simple ecosystem going, an
<br>
observation supported by observed predation and lifecycles. Also, there are
<br>
tools you can use to reintroduce most of the critters should they get
<br>
themselves extinct.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evocative background music and rich sound effects (I'm not trying to
<br>
get you to buy this game, really) combined with the graphics and continuous
<br>
motion (there are hundreds of living things in each area) make for a truly
<br>
believable environment. I was expecting to be fooled; I was fooled anyway.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting critters are the ones with 'digital dna'. They've got a
<br>
genome of unknown (to me) but apparently significant complexity that can
<br>
mutate from generation to generation, has crossovers during conception, etc.
<br>
Their genetic makeup controls how quickly they learn, how healthy they are
<br>
(there are several dimensions to health), how tough they are, how soon they
<br>
reach sexual maturity, how long they live (Norns seem to live about seven
<br>
hours) and other factors I haven't discovered yet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Norns communicate using a very simple English. You can't teach them any
<br>
other language. You can teach them yourself by example or with the help an
<br>
automated instruction machine. The automated machine won't do your job for
<br>
you though. To make sure a baby Norn will follow your instructions in
<br>
critical moments (such as during a Grendel attack) you've got to spend time
<br>
with them, pointing out the names of things, and discouraging them from
<br>
wandering too far. From what I can see, subadult Norns will try almost any
<br>
action with any object, and tend to either repeat later if it had a positive
<br>
effect, or tend not to repeat it later if it had a negative effect
<br>
(including you slapping it.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critters have at least a few senses - smell, sight, touch, taste, and
<br>
hearing. I'm not sure about the complexity of hearing, touch, and taste. I
<br>
don't think there is much to them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get to name each Norn.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norns are on the whole cute, cuddly, friendly happy critters that like to
<br>
play together and usually smile a lot. But it was only after the third
<br>
generation of these things came around that I began to get deep empathy for
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They interact. They make observations - such as 'Zeek hungry for starch' -
<br>
and give each other suggestions based on their experience. They tell each
<br>
other how they feel, such as loving or disliking. They make mistakes. They
<br>
play with toys together (ie bouncing a ball). They usually wander around in
<br>
groups, but sometimes alone. If a baby Norn leaves the area, an adult will
<br>
often follow it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When adolescent Fooby one died, I was genuinely sad.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had originally wanted to see how it felt to slap a Norn around; I don't
<br>
have the heart to try it.
