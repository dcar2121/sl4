From: Marc Forrester &lt;<a href="mailto:A1200@mharr.f9.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20[SL4]%20JOIN:%20Dale%20Johnstone">A1200@mharr.f9.co.uk</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Hi, my name is Dale Johnstone, I'm a software developer from the UK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been programming for about 17 years.  Worked mainly in the games
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry, but I've always had my eye on AI.
</em><br>
<p>Greets.  Marc Forrester, Transhumanist, and as yet inexperienced
<br>
information technician.  (Database setup, rescuing files from obscure
<br>
and inappropriate formats, straight programming where necessary.)
<br>
<p>Here's my take, FWIW:  I don't doubt that some idiots somewhere are
<br>
even now working on insane and/or low-intelligence AI for military
<br>
and other, more sinister purposes.  I've no idea what will result.
<br>
<p>An AI equivalent of grey goo is a disturbing idea, but it's not as
<br>
flat out terrifying as the nanotech and biotech dangers, they don't
<br>
have to be any more intelligent than smallpox to destroy our world.
<br>
Combined nanotech and AI in one weapon doesn't bear thinking about.
<br>
<p>AI developed by military 'thinkers' will likely not be developed to
<br>
match human intelligence, let alone exceed it.  It will probably have
<br>
irrational drives that limit its potential, and it will certainly not
<br>
be intentionally given the ability to redesign itself at will.
<br>
<p>AI developed by Singularitarians will be entirely the opposite,
<br>
and so would not be easy to cripple for use as a military or state
<br>
slave machine.  Some 'authority' may very well seize the project,
<br>
but the big advantage of open source is that they can't destroy
<br>
the original, so they'd be competing with free Singularitarians
<br>
elsewhere in the world, trying to reverse engineer a project
<br>
designed by saner, smarter people than themselves and pervert
<br>
it to the antithesis of its original design.
<br>
<p>Chances of success?
<br>
<p>I think there is far more danger in not acting, or acting in a
<br>
slow and secretive manner, than there is in the old forces of the
<br>
dark ages hitching a ride in our slipstream.  If we act fast now,
<br>
we can change the rules from under them.  They will not adapt.
