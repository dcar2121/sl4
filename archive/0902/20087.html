You seem to be announcing yourself as the kind of person that can't even 
<br>
be trusted by himself.  I don't think I'd do it the first time, so I 
<br>
doubt I'd ever get used to it.  (Yes, I can imagine extraordinary 
<br>
circumstances that would compel me to use such a machine.  I would 
<br>
strive strongly to avoid them.  That's the kind of situation where I'd 
<br>
consider killing someone else to be self-defense.
