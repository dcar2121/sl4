<em>&gt; Let me say explicitly again: There is no magical consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfer. I feel like you're putting words in my mouth, or maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're arguing against someone else.

<em>&gt; Suppose a weather simulation can produce images that can fool people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have seen weather. Should you base your strategy against global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warming on that weather simulation? I think the answer is no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Experts might be fooled by the images as well, but if they compare the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations' internal data structures and algorithms to real-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurements and understanding of weather processes and say &quot;Yes, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think this is a faithful simulation.&quot; then we might reasonably base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our global warming strategy on the simulation.
</em><br>
<p>If what you care about is real weather, it doesn't matter if a given
<br>
simulation can fool everyone in existence. On the other hand, weather
<br>
simulation may happen to be something you genuinely care about, the
<br>
same way you care about real weather. If you care about an upload the
<br>
same way you care about a person it's an upload of, for all intents
<br>
and purposes you may consider that upload to really be that person,
<br>
even if you can tell the difference somehow. Maybe the upload will
<br>
have worse or better memory, or speech, and you'll be able to tell. On
<br>
the other hand, if you don't care about the thing that acts
<br>
indistinguishably from a real person, the thing is not really that
<br>
person. It may be possible to have this kind of distinction, for
<br>
example in the second case the indistinguishable performance may be
<br>
some kind of act, lacking all the deeper properties of the person you
<br>
care about.
