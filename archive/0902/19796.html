</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone, anyone, to death *HAS* to be considered unethical. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It doesn't matter whether it's you or not.
</em><br>
<p>How fast do you have to be crushed to death before teleportation becomes ethical?
<br>
<p>Oops, wrong question...
<br>
<p>How fast do you have to be crushed to death before 51% of the population considers teleportation to be ethical?
<br>
<p>Suppose for US$100 you can buy a ticket that will instantly take you any place in the world. You have done this hundreds of times without incident. Now a new option is available. For an extra fee, you are offered the &quot;painless&quot; option, where the booth is filled with a narcotic knockout gas before you are slowly* crushed to death over a 24 hour period behind soundproofed walls. What is the maximum amount you would pay for this option?
<br>
<p>*It has to be slow because the teleportation industry saves money by using a smaller motor with a low gear ratio.
