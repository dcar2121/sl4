Yes, it was intended to answer a question.
<br>
<p>I studied a bit of linguistics quite a long time ago.  Should is to 
<br>
shall as will is to would as ought is to owe as might is to may.  Duty 
<br>
and morality are separate concepts from these.  First Subjunctive is 
<br>
dead in English, and these words are commonly used in relatively 
<br>
standard ways, so I think we can rely on this distinction.  (P.S.:  Note 
<br>
that &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; tend to be used differently in different social 
<br>
classes.  But in my usage a parent would say to a child &quot;You will do 
<br>
that!&quot;, not &quot;You shall do that!&quot;.  Will is more denotative of prediction 
<br>
and shall is more denotative of personal intention.  [I.e., parent to 
<br>
child &quot;You will do that because I shall force you do.])
<br>
N.B.:  This distinction is futher blurred by the &quot;'ll&quot; construct, and in 
<br>
&quot;I'll&quot;, which hides whether it's will or shall that's being elided.  
<br>
This can cause should and would to be blurred between shall and will, as 
<br>
the language has play in that area.
<br>
<p>The thing is, language is all about patterns.  Classical logic was 
<br>
basically a formalization of Attic Greek linguistic rules.  (Symbolic 
<br>
logic is almost a separate beast entirely, owing it's rules to a 
<br>
combination of mathematics and convenience.)  Duty comes from a set of 
<br>
abstract rules having to do with how a noble person should act.  (Conan 
<br>
Doyle wrote a piece where he used an older meaning of the word with the 
<br>
spelling, I think, of &quot;devoiur&quot;.  Not quite the same word, but 
<br>
definitely connected.  I think the work was &quot;The White Company&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Morality is quite a bit more complex.  It's meaning seems to shift 
<br>
constantly.  There was a time only a few decades ago when it seemed to 
<br>
only be used in the context of sex.  And nobody defined what they meant 
<br>
when they talked about it.  (Well, some people said &quot;conventional 
<br>
morality&quot; or &quot;traditional morality&quot;, which seems to mean &quot;the way they 
<br>
did things without being embarrassed when and where I was growing up&quot;.)  
<br>
The problem comes with the entanglement between morals and ethics.  They 
<br>
clearly don't cover quite the same ground, but there doesn't seem to be 
<br>
any agreement as to precisely what each means.  And some people seem to 
<br>
distinguish the words(concepts) in a way opposite to the way others do.  
<br>
Which would you use to describe why cannibalism was wrong?  Or would you 
<br>
avoid using both of them?
