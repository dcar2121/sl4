As far as I can tell, Dr. Mahoney never seems to come right out and
<br>
say &quot;I think we should strive to avoid developing upload technology.&quot;
<br>
but that's the general gist of his posts on this topic. He has
<br>
fatalistic predictions that striving to avoid this technology will
<br>
fail. However, we can set those (positive) claims aside while we
<br>
discuss what we humans SHOULD do (normative).

<p>You imply that people who advocate uploading technologies would put a
<br>
perfectly viable human into a &quot;recycling vat&quot; (presumed fatal). This
<br>
is a red herring and a straw man. Some people are advocating
<br>
destructive uploading technologies. However, the people who advocate
<br>
uploading technologies would agree; a non-destructive scan followed by
<br>
murder of the person scanned is reprehensible.
<br>
<p>The actual scenario looks more like this: Due to illness and/or old
<br>
age, someone is destructively uploaded. They are frozen and then
<br>
sliced thinly in order for the scanning process to take place. There
<br>
isn't a non-destructive technology available, nor does this process,
<br>
in course of operation, produce any viable physical human who is then
<br>
murdered.

<em>&gt;We sincerely want to believe that our consciousness transfers to the machine that imitates us.
</em><br>
<p>Let me propose a couple of thought experiments for the mailing list to consider.
<br>
<p>1. A group of scientists, the &quot;Consortium for Continuous
<br>
Consciousness&quot; campaigns for the legalization of amphetamines and
<br>
rapid research of permanent anti-sleep drugs. Because of their
<br>
research into the underlying biology of sleep, they believe that
<br>
consciousness does not in any real, physical, sense &quot;transfer&quot; from
<br>
one episode of wakefulness through sleep to the next episode of
<br>
wakefulness. A CCC rep tells you &quot;Science has discovered that people
<br>
just go out like a candle at a specific point in the sleep process.
<br>
Claims that you will be magically teleported forward in time to the
<br>
entity that wakes up is merely your fear of death talking.&quot; My
<br>
question is: Could a discovery in the biology of sleep cause you to
<br>
consider sleep to be morally equivalent to death?
<br>
<p>2. Cellphone use is discovered to cause a mutation. Children who are
<br>
born of parents who used cellphones will have the mutation, and they
<br>
will be mutually infertile with children born of parents who did not
<br>
use cellphones. This is a human speciation event. Should we write
<br>
special laws allowing the humans to kill, modify, enslave and torture
<br>
the mutated humans? Does your opinion change if, due to widespread
<br>
cellphone use, humans are endangered and may eventually become
<br>
extinct, replaced entirely by mutated humans?
<br>
<p>My point for thought experiment 1 is that we do have a model for
<br>
'uploading'. Every day, we take all our goals, knowledge, and
<br>
memories, and entrust them to a future proxy, a different
<br>
consciousness. As far as science understands the process, no
<br>
additional, nonphysical entity, besides the brain connections and
<br>
chemical gradients moves from &quot;yesterday's self&quot; to &quot;today's self&quot;.
<br>
And yet we go to sleep every day. Taking one's goals, knowledge and
<br>
memories and entrusting them to a FAITHFUL proxy is a reasonable
<br>
action to take, even if you are fully aware that there will be no
<br>
additional &quot;consciousness transfer&quot;.
<br>
<p>My point for throught experiment 2 is that condoning murder and
<br>
torture of beings very structurally similar to humans, based only on a
<br>
narrow technical definition of &quot;species&quot; is an incredibly radical
<br>
position. I invite Dr. Mahoney to state explicitly: &quot;It is wrong to
<br>
murder, enslave, or torture humans. It is also wrong to murder,
<br>
enslave, or torture entities which are very structurally similar to
<br>
humans, even if they are technically mutually infertile and therefore
<br>
a different species.&quot;
