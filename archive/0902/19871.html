<p><p>I suppose I should have clarified-- I made the assumption in the experiment
<br>
itself, that it only referred to non-baryonic teleportation. Though I
<br>
suppose that this is orthogonal to the central issue, which, as I take it,
<br>
&nbsp;is I think the contention that no two real-universe systems are isomorphic
<br>
down to an arbitrary level of specificity, with the caveat that two given
<br>
abstractions can be isomorphic, but their real-universe representations in
<br>
an underlying substrate will not be. I think you're claiming that such
<br>
isomorphism is possible in the real universe, I am claiming that it isn't.
<br>
I think we both operate under a realist framework here, so lets discuss this
<br>
specifically.  Discussion about souls and what not is quite
<br>
adjunct/peripheral!
