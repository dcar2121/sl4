Me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you and the original were facing each other an equal distance from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the center of a symmetrical room then you two would be receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; identical input and thus act identically; and if I switched your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; position no outside observer could tell the difference objectively, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you couldn't tell the difference subjectively. So I conclude it makes no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; difference.

<br>
<em>&gt; The fact that it's not true (viz classical chaos or quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decoherence) 
</em><br>
<p>Chaos is an interesting phenomenon but it does no apply to all complex
<br>
things; generally small changes in starting conditions change one pseudo
<br>
random pattern into a very different pseudo random pattern. It is much
<br>
less a factor if logic is involved and probably intelligence in general.
<br>
For example, calculating the first million digits of Pi is quite
<br>
complex, and if just one digit in the sequence is wrong subsequent
<br>
digits will be wrong too, but 2 computers will almost always produce the
<br>
exact same sequence even if they operated at slightly different
<br>
temperatures or even if they were made by different manufactures. It’s
<br>
hard to believe that if a nat farted in your third grade classroom you
<br>
would have a different political philosophy today; I think it would take
<br>
a very long time for chaos alone to make minds diverge.
<br>
<p>And if you insist that for you to survive every atom in your body must
<br>
be identical down to the quantum level and every particle in those atoms
<br>
be entangled in just the same way then you die and a new being is born
<br>
about a million times a nanosecond. That really doesn’t seem like a
<br>
fruitful way to look at the
<br>
matter to me.
