<br>
<p><em>&gt; It [arithmetic] is also highly goal oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the outcome converges on a single pattern.
</em><br>
<p>But evolution must also have built our minds with one goal in mind,
<br>
survival. I concede that there is only one correct answer in arithmetic
<br>
and there is more than one way to survive; but there are VASTLY more
<br>
ways to die than to live, so our minds can’t be anyway near as sensitive
<br>
about trivial changes in initial conditions as the weather is. And by
<br>
the way, although weather is subject to chaos I very much doubt that
<br>
climate is. 
<br>
<p>I also think one of the most important things about intelligence is
<br>
knowing what to forget; this is true for us and will even be true of a
<br>
Jupiter Brain. If every little thing we observe were put into our very
<br>
fastest memory location (it wouldn’t hurt much if it were stored in the
<br>
equivalent of a cheap hard disk even if we’ll probably never look at it)
<br>
then our mind would get bogged down in minutiae. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If we extend the metaphor of the identical room a bit however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lets say we have two identical copies of a single individual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to your criteria of identical-- with respect to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical  arrangement of molecules, but not identical to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum level. We put them in two separate but identical rooms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ask them to draw random lines on a page for 10 hours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will their lines be completely identical?
</em><br>
<p>Nobody knows, but for my thought experiment to be valid they’d only have
<br>
to be the same right now, not for 10 hours. How long is now? About a
<br>
second, perhaps two. And I don’t think personal identity is an all or
<br>
nothing matter; if one of them drew a line that was 2% steeper than the
<br>
other I don’t think it would be proof they are completely separate
<br>
individuals.
