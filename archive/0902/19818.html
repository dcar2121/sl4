<p>
A rather fun speculation (I've had it several times myself - and I've
<br>
wondered if central symmetry of replective symmetry would be more fun.
<br>
Verdict: replective symmetry, because of how it would feel like to
<br>
touch the &quot;mirror plane&quot;: there is no real mirror, but every time you
<br>
touch it, and every breath you take, colids with its equivalent on the
<br>
other side and is reflected).
<br>
<p>But in practice, irrelevant, as quantum and chaos effects will soon
<br>
break down the symmetry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They are identical and both received the same input, so they would both
</em><br>
do the same thing, they would both point at Stuart Armstrong.
<br>
<p>No, they would both point at themselves. Similalrly, if I gave one a
<br>
choice - who would for prefer to die: yourself or the other copy - he
<br>
would choose to live and let the other copy die.
<br>
<p>But all this is actually word chopping - if you want, you can decree
<br>
that they are the same person. This doesn't fit with our standard
<br>
definition of being the same person - they won't share experiences,
<br>
will have different trajectories in life, will probably pursue
<br>
different careers, develop different opinions, will give themselves
<br>
precedence over their copies and may end up hating each other. So
<br>
being called &quot;the same person&quot; streches the definition of &quot;same
<br>
person&quot; to breaking point.

<em>&gt;&gt; you just poke your would-be exact copy. Thats it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As both of you are identical you both decide to poke each other and both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive a poke in the ribs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all observers in the world may share the same belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are indeed the same person, based on their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perceptions and on the fact that they share the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; characteristics. But this ignore the simple fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the person in question is an observer also, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; DO NOT agree on the fact that they are the same person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But they don't disagree. You are the copy and are standing an equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance from the center of a cylindrically symmetrical room with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original. I now use a Star Trek brand transporter to instantly exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your position with the original, or if you prefer I leave your bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone and just exchange the two brains. There is no way subjectively you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the original would notice that anything had happened,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and objective outside observers would not notice anything had happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either. There would not even be a way to tell if the machine was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually working, I could be lying about having a transporter. Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cares?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If objectively it makes no difference and subjectively if makes no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference then I can only conclude it  makes no difference. There are 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies in that room but only one you.
