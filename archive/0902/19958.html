<em>&gt; &gt; We both agree that quantum procedures interact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classical procedures all the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No we don't agree on that. If quantum uncertainty and chaos interacted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with computers &quot;all the time&quot; the machines would be useless
</em><br>
<p><p>yes. of course.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; because even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with identical input you'd get different output all the time; if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want random output there is no need to go to all the trouble of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an electronic computer, a roulette wheel will work fine.
</em><br>
<p><p>haha. true enough.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes there are some complex systems, like the weather, where the flap of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a butterfly's wings could cause a tornado a year later,
</em><br>
<p><p>correct. But this is more a product of chaos, rather than quantum
<br>
uncertainty. Though I'm sure the latter has a role to play as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; but computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were designed not to be that sensitive or they wouldn't be much good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, certainly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; evolution must have done the same thing with our brains of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they wouldn't be much good either.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Perhaps, but this is where we disagree. I would argue that we make constant
<br>
use of random background noise. If we were to come up with the solution to a
<br>
simple mathematical problem, 15 + 7 +2.5 + 3.5 + 8. Then I agree with you
<br>
that regardless of the background noise, we would probably come up with the
<br>
same answer. There is constant error and consistency checking going on here.
<br>
Its also highly goal oriented so the outcome converges on a single pattern.
<br>
<p>If we extend the metaphor of the identical room a bit however, and lets say
<br>
we have two identical copies of a single individual, according to your
<br>
criteria of identical-- with respect to their classical arrangement of
<br>
molecules, but not identical to a quantum level. We put them in two separate
<br>
but identical rooms, and ask them to draw random lines on a page for 10
<br>
hours. Will their lines be completely identical? In this scenario, there is
<br>
no error/consistency checking, it is less goal oriented.
<br>
<p>Of course my intuition says there will be discernible differences between
<br>
the output. However if you're not convinced, then lets say that in one room,
<br>
we up the temperature 1/100th of a degrees-- will there be a discernible
<br>
difference in the output then? How about 1/10th of a degree? 2 degrees? At
<br>
what point will there be discernible output? I'm sure we both agree that
<br>
there will be different output if there is a 10 degree difference in
<br>
temperature in the room. HOWEVER, if we both give them the mathematical
<br>
question above, they will likely give the same answer, even with a
<br>
difference in temperature in the room.
<br>
<p>Human behaviour is made up of different processes, not all of them are
<br>
directly analogous to the discrete precise computing that we're used to in
<br>
our machines.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; now even the room must be quantum perfect?!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So even though the being's senses are too course to see any difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the room if there is any difference in the room at all the being will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be different even though he sees no difference, hears no difference,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smells no difference, tastes no difference and feels no different. Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you really are talking voodoo; and I don't believe the above reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why you deduced the two are different, rather you decided the two are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different and then looked for a reason to defend your opinion. I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it must be so because the reasons you give are so weak they wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince anyone unless they already believed it.
