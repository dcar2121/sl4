<br>
<p><em>&gt; Much more disturbing would be if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic value of standard humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dropped to near subsistence levels 
</em><br>
<p>After the Singularity the economic value of meat people would be zero,
<br>
well OK maybe they’d have a slight nostalgic value to some Jupiter
<br>
Brains of a sentimental disposition; but the point is that if you refuse
<br>
to upgrade your continuing existence will be entirely dependent on the
<br>
kindness of strangers. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; this would effectively force all humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload in order to survive. That might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad enough, but it could get worse
</em><br>
<p>Personally I find nothing bad about that, I’d upload in a heartbeat if I
<br>
could, but there is no disputing matters of taste. If you don’t wish to
<br>
upgrade then don’t. Oblivion awaits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm interested in looking at other alternatives, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that do not involve effectively coerced uploading.
</em><br>
<p>I’m not interested in that, but as I said before there is no disputing
<br>
matters of taste.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the value of an object is not only in its physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties, but also in the manner in which it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructed, then there may be hope for standard humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to continue to compete economically in an uploaded world.
</em><br>
<p>But as that belief is an inherently irrational idea it seems unlikely to
<br>
last for long in the brutal meme war of survival of the fittest, which
<br>
is one of the very few things that will not change even after the
<br>
Singularity. I really don’t think a Jupiter Brain will give a damn if
<br>
something is hand made or not. I’m very far from a Jupiter Brain but
<br>
even I know that’s dumb.
