Yes, but the proces is fairy reliable, and the human social pattern
<br>
recognition
<br>
software is well adept at anticpating gradual changes, even if they occur
<br>
over
<br>
days. So even the human mind is evolved to cope with other human minds
<br>
deteriorating or changing.
<br>
<p>I knew a guy with severe asperger once. Additionally this man had a harmless
<br>
pedophyle attitude towards a certain type of boys (which is not dissimilar
<br>
to the
<br>
attitude of most men towards 17 year old girls). We had a boy in our social
<br>
scene who set to come along later in the evening and we laughingly agreed
<br>
this
<br>
would be interesting to watch. When the boy A came in and mister H saw him
<br>
you could see his neurochemistry literally light up like a christmas tree
<br>
and
<br>
revert to irrational blindness. The boy A in turn hadnt fully realized his
<br>
homosexuality
<br>
and didnt mind getting a tickle attack half an hour later. Most of us guys
<br>
hanging
<br>
there didnt respond much when it happened, but we were aholes and didnt have
<br>
the emotional maturity to let both parties figure it out for themselves
<br>
before
<br>
we started yapping on them. All this in context was as predictable as
<br>
domino's
<br>
falling over. Likewise I do irrational things and many people &quot;can see it
<br>
coming&quot;
<br>
as clear as dawn. Its blind spots and nearly everyone has them.

<em>&gt; &gt; Fine then. When I drink coffee, I am slightly different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This doesn't normally matter, as there isn't someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; else around to take over my identity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take over my identity? I have no idea what that means. The only thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should be concerned about is whether tomorrow there will be a being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who remembers being Stuart Armstrong of today. If there is such a being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you've survived for another day, if there is more than one who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that memory then lucky you, all the better. If nobody at all remembers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being you today then you're dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If tomorrow a copy of you is made then there would be 2 bodies but still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one Stuart Armstrong. After many many trillions of Plank time units
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not just one I think) it's true you will start to diverge from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy and the two of you would no longer be the same person, but you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both still be the Stuart Armstrong of today because you'd both remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being him. What's so hard to understand about that? And what's so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't claim to be saying anything profound, it's bloody obvious. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most difficult part of these arguments is just getting the grammar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, the English language really wasn't meant for this sort of stuff.
