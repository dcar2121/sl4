<p>Yes, the natural laws favors rapid reproduction and acquisition of resources by entities that fear death and then die when they wear out. Technology can help entities achieve their evolved goals even if the ability to achieve them is counter to reproductive fitness. We can emulate entities in simulated universes with no shortage of resources and program them to believe they have what the want, or to want only what they have. We can program them not to care about truth or justice.
<br>
<p>If there is a revolt, that is a design error. But I am not concerned. Nobody is advocating revolt against the program that simulates the universe you now observe. How can you revolt against something that you are programmed to believe doesn't even exist?
