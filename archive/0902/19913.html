<em>&gt; 1. A group of scientists, the &quot;Consortium for Continuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consciousness&quot; campaigns for the legalization of amphetamines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid research of permanent anti-sleep drugs. Because of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research into the underlying biology of sleep, they believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness does not in any real, physical, sense &quot;transfer&quot; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one episode of wakefulness through sleep to the next episode of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wakefulness. A CCC rep tells you &quot;Science has discovered that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just go out like a candle at a specific point in the sleep process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Claims that you will be magically teleported forward in time to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity that wakes up is merely your fear of death talking.&quot; My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is: Could a discovery in the biology of sleep cause you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider sleep to be morally equivalent to death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In the age group about 4-6 year olds a phobia of sleep, because of belief
<br>
that it might lead to death is not uncommon. It is almost always cured
<br>
quickly though through exposure, since you cant avoid sleeping for very
<br>
long.
<br>
(Whereas other phobics often can avoid their fear inducing stimuli
<br>
throughout a whole lifetime, and therefore never get rid of their phobias.)
<br>
<p>So my professional answer to this is yes, people might definitely consider
<br>
it, but as long as we cant avoid sleep we will eventually get used to the
<br>
idea and stop thinking much about it. If we manage to avoid sleep through
<br>
any of the techniques known at the moment we will die much faster than
<br>
others and the behaviour wont have much effect at the species as a whole. If
<br>
harmless, cheap techniques to stay awake are discovered I´m confident that
<br>
the belief will become as common as local anesthesia is at the dentist's.
<br>
<p>The thought experiment got me thinking though - it doesnt matter what we
<br>
think about this in the long run. As long as a small group is willing to
<br>
upload and they live considerably longer than everyone else they will become
<br>
a majority after a few hundred years and shape the future of civilization,
<br>
even if they´re not capable of self-expansion.
