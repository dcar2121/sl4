<p>
<em>&gt; In what manner must you die in order for your consciousness to successfully transfer to a machine?
</em><br>
<p>Let me explain my understanding of science's knowledge of
<br>
consciousness. I am not any sort of expert, and my understanding is
<br>
that the experts are still confused. However, the science is clear on
<br>
at least one thing: There is no soul. There is no monad. The pituitary
<br>
gland is not what Decartes hoped. There is no single &quot;seat of
<br>
consciousness&quot; inside the brain which does the experiencing.
<br>
<p>Therefore, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to die and have a soul-like
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; entity &quot;transfer&quot; into a machine. Is that sufficiently
<br>
unambiguous?
<br>
<p>If I understand your position correctly, you argue that the
<br>
first-person experience of a destructive upload (anesthetized, frozen,
<br>
sliced, scanned, simulated) would be exactly like the first-person
<br>
experience of dying (including the part where you don't wake up).
<br>
<p>This is possible. It's also possible that the first-person experience
<br>
of sleep is exactly like the first-person experience of dying
<br>
(including the part where you don't wake up). If you don't believe
<br>
that sleep is sufficient, imagine clinical death. The neurons are not
<br>
firing, the heart is not pumping, the entity that wakes up may be
<br>
substantively different from you due to various kinds of damage. Is a
<br>
doctor who advises someone to undergo clinical death for the purpose
<br>
of surgery doing something equivalent to murder?
<br>
<p>The question is: Even if the first-person experience of a destructive
<br>
upload is identical to death, does that make the process of
<br>
destructive upload morally equivalent to murder? Does it mean that
<br>
murder, enslavement and torture of emulated humans is okay?
<br>
<p>Even if the first-person experience of a destructive upload is
<br>
identical to death, it would be reasonable to entrust one's present
<br>
goals, aspirations and memories to an electronic proxy IF one believes
<br>
that the electronic proxy will behave FAITHFULLY to those goals,
<br>
aspirations and memories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I invite Dr. Mahoney to state explicitly: &quot;It is wrong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; murder, enslave, or torture humans. It is also wrong to murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enslave, or torture entities which are very structurally similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humans, even if they are technically mutually infertile and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a different species.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First answer the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. At what point after conception does life begin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Under what conditions is capital punishment justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Under what conditions is euthanasia justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Which species besides humans should be protected from murder, enslavement, and torture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. What test must a program be able to pass to grant it human rights?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure of your points here, but I trust that you're actually
<br>
going somewhere.
<br>
<p>1. I'm confused. The gametes were alive, the fertilized ovum is still
<br>
alive. Life began some billions of years ago.
<br>
2. I'll defer to society here and say almost never.
<br>
3. Again, society says almost never.
<br>
4. Right now, I think animal abuse is not high on our collective list
<br>
of priorities. But there is an expanding circle, and we may take
<br>
animal abuse more seriously in the future.
<br>
5. I think there's a smooth continuum of possible programs. Even
<br>
though the middle is difficult to classify, there will be clear cases
<br>
where a program is STRUCTURALLY a model of a human, and experts who
<br>
argue convincingly that the program is a FAITHFUL model. Are you
<br>
arguing that because the middle is difficult to classify, these clear
<br>
cases should not be considered moral equivalents to humans? I think
<br>
wikipedia calls this the &quot;continuum fallacy&quot;.
