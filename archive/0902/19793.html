<em>&gt; It doesn't matter one bit what your or my opinion is on this matter, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is one reason why the singularity will not be a cozy time. If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are very very lucky we will be given a choice, upload or die. If we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlucky we will simply die.
</em><br>
<p>Does it ever occure to you to try for anything other than the default option?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You seem rather confident on what a Jupiter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brain will or won't want to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I am rather confident that a Jupiter brain won't be stupid and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we won't be able to outsmart something smarter than we are.
</em><br>
<p>What does smarts have to do with motivation?
<br>
<p>As a kid, I could never outsmart my parents; fortunately, my parents
<br>
were devoted to bringing me up pretty well. They had the brains to do
<br>
all sorts of hideous things to me, but not the motivation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Jupiter brains dedicated singlemindedly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the production of paper-clips are concievable;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But interestingly such a thought would not be conceivable to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jupiter paper clip making machine, in fact such a specialized piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment would be incapable of conceiving of anything. Hard to see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd want to want to call it a brain actually.
</em><br>
<p>Why would it not be able to conceive such a thought - if such thoughts
<br>
helped it create paper-clips more effectively? (which they probably
<br>
would) We've had generals singlemindedly devoted to transforming the
<br>
living soldiers of the enemy side into pieces of dead meat; the
<br>
inability to conceive thoughts would have made them far weaker as
<br>
generals.
<br>
<p>If a jupiter-brain-paperclip-maker started out with no tools or
<br>
instuments of its own, we can at least be sure that it would swiftly
<br>
understand enough human psychology to fool us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Probably for the same reason we don't find human beings taking orders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from sea slugs. Sea slugs are dumb.
</em><br>
