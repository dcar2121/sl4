<em>&gt; If tomorrow a copy of you is made then there would be 2 bodies but still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one Stuart Armstrong. After many many trillions of Plank time units
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not just one I think)
</em><br>
<p>Tsh, one, a trillion... who's counting these things? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's true you will start to diverge from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy and the two of you would no longer be the same person, but you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both still be the Stuart Armstrong of today because you'd both remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being him.
</em><br>
<p>We now agree: they WERE the same person (in the sense that you
<br>
yesterday is the same as you today) but they ARE different people (in
<br>
the sense that two twins are not the same person).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's so hard to understand about that?
</em><br>
<p>About that? Nothing at all. About your extended analogies about copies
<br>
receiving the same input in symetric rooms... those were clear as mud
<br>
in terms of the point they were trying to make.
<br>
<p>Stuart, alpha one
