&lt;<a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Uploads%20coming%20first%20would%20be%20good,%20right?.">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where we get in trouble is to start with the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of consciousness as an axiom. This invariably leads 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to absurdities and paradoxes.
</em><br>
<p>Paradoxes? I can’t think of a single one; odd situations certainly, but
<br>
nothing logically inconsistent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Starting instead with the axiom that we are programmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe in our own consciousness avoids this problem. 
</em><br>
<p>I have no problem with that as an axiom, and there is nothing wrong with
<br>
programming, it often produces true output. If not we wouldn’t have a
<br>
computer industry. Or would you prefer the only alternative, that we
<br>
believed in things at random? 
<br>
<p>Apparently you don’t believe you are conscious, so how did you overcome
<br>
this universal programming; and how (subjectively or objectively, you
<br>
pick) would things be different if you were conscious? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; most people would argue that if you replaced your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons one by one with equivalent circuits until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your whole brain was in silicon, that you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never notice the difference.
</em><br>
<p>And I agree with most people about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that this is somehow different than running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a program that simulates you and then killing the original. 
</em><br>
<p>And I disagree with most people about that, in fact I have nothing but
<br>
contempt for the idea because they never even come close to explaining
<br>
what that “somehow” is. They can’t even coherently explain exactly what
<br>
the hell is so original about the high holy “Original” or exactly what
<br>
is being replaced in the dreaded “Replacement”. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You can't argue that one is conscious and one is not. 
</em><br>
<p>And yet I agree completely with that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; given the source code of a program that allegedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models your brain, could you (rather than an expert)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove it actually does?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
No I can’t prove it, but in real life we can seldom rigorously prove
<br>
anything of life or death importance. I can’t prove the John Clark of
<br>
now successfully modeled the John Clark of 60 seconds ago, I can’t even
<br>
prove that person actually existed way back then; but I have a hunch he
<br>
probably did.
