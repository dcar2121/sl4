JKClark:
<br>
<em>&gt; Your third grade English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teacher got it wrong, Randall Randall is an adjective.
</em><br>
<p>His teacher got it right. As Randall and I pointed out many times to you, 
<br>
anytime there are two things, they are different or otherwise they would be 
<br>
one thing. It's that simple. Simply repeating &quot;I am an adjective&quot; endlessly 
<br>
without any argument is never going to work. Universe doesn't run on 
<br>
adjectives. Physics doesn't govern adjectives. To say, &quot;I am an adjective,&quot; 
<br>
is to say, &quot;The rules of this Universe don't apply to me, which is why I can 
<br>
get away with saying 2=1.&quot;
<br>
