<p>
The best summation of general intelligence that I've heard (and I
<br>
unfortunately do not remember who said this) is that intelligence is the
<br>
innate ability to come to correct conclusions through simple observation
<br>
when others of lesser intelligence would need concrete evidence and
<br>
explanation to come to the same conclusion.
<br>
<p>For example: I work at a convenience story (give me a break, I'm 16), and I
<br>
one day overheard my boss complaining about how impossible it is to win on a
<br>
lottery ticket and how there should be a greater number of prizes available,
<br>
but of less individual stature. The customer that he was talking to informed
<br>
him that the state had previously attempted such a thing and that it didn't
<br>
work out very well because people were far better attracted by a few large
<br>
prizes than a bunch of small ones. My boss was quite surprised and began
<br>
talking about &quot;mindless sheep&quot;, &quot;idiots&quot;, and other nonsense like that. I
<br>
found it hard to believe that this tidbit wasn't common sense. If human
<br>
nature were to ever be defined, such optimistic greediness would certainly
<br>
be in the definition.
<br>
<p>That definition could be applied to most animals, if we were able to really
<br>
get inside of their heads and puzzle out what they were thinking, but I'm
<br>
skeptical that the intelligence of single-celled organisms can be measured
<br>
at all within a species. Some few will have mutations which either improve
<br>
or retard their abilities, but for the most part all are equally adept at
<br>
floating about and consuming whatever they might happen upon.
<br>
<p>But you could perhaps judge the relative 'intelligence' between species of
<br>
microorganisms by their reaction time, sensitivity to light, and such
<br>
things. However, I don't understand what is meant by the assertion that we
<br>
&quot;need&quot; a general idea of intelligence that can be extended across the whole
<br>
spectrum of life and even non-life. I don't think it's relevant to come up
<br>
with a set of factors to measure intelligence by and apply that to every
<br>
single thing on the planet Earth. We'd just end up with some scientific
<br>
mumbo-jumbo that can't be used to predict behavior or do anything that
<br>
intelligence is usually used for. It would just be useless classification,
<br>
which we have plenty of as it is.
