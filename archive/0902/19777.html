<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let's start at creating a VERY robost system where people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inalienable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights. All people. And then link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those inalienable rights to legal tools. And then allow all people, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter how despicable, access to guarantees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume you want one of these rights to be to have kids. Lets say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some people are believing in a meme-set/religion that incites them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a lot of kids, and make sure their kids believe in the same thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldnt this bring us back to your own definition of the distant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past:&quot;The tribe that had a system that allowed them to breed faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally won.&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see your argument and I agree this is a conundrum
<br>
<p>Problem is - NO - I do not want any kids, I have lobbied actively for
<br>
population controls. I am
<br>
squarely for requiring parents, especially in densely populated areas, to
<br>
require a certificate
<br>
or licence to have children, and to use the full force of the state to
<br>
connect consequences to
<br>
the parents having offspring thoughtlessly, including the parents making
<br>
significant investments
<br>
in the children, and having the burder of proof the children are raised
<br>
within the (ever tightening)
<br>
boundaries of society and good citizenship. For parents that get a licence
<br>
and prove they are
<br>
planning for offspring, this burden should be relaxed.
<br>
<p>But even then, I would be in favor of (and support with my single democratic
<br>
vote and right to
<br>
organize in political entities) considering having children and transferring
<br>
inheritable diseases,
<br>
while the parents could reasonably be expceted to know they are (like - a
<br>
gene test costs
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;100$ or euro) having the children would be tantamount to severe physical
<br>
abuse. Parents
<br>
who KNOWINGLY have children that are likely to inherit genetic afflictions
<br>
are to be considered
<br>
guilty of the same, but premeditated. I dont want anyone in a prison for
<br>
such a crime (and I
<br>
am largely against prisons) but I do demand consequences to someone abusing
<br>
someone
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>And yes - I am for limits on growth. I can see getting a license to breed in
<br>
Nebraska (with the
<br>
above caveat - inheritable low cognitive ability is a genetic disorder)
<br>
being a bit easier to
<br>
realise than one in midtown manhattan. I want global populations to decrease
<br>
- and if the
<br>
tools were able to realise this, specifically in the third world.
<br>
<p>And before anyone accuses me of anything - this includes me. I have a
<br>
genetic disease and
<br>
inherited a rather painful combination from both parents. Hence I have
<br>
actively refrained from
<br>
even considering having children because I would consider having offspring
<br>
that potentially have
<br>
the genetic disorder I am suffering from to be physical abuse.
<br>
<p>A tribal procreative model incidentally, has LONG SINCE become outdated.
<br>
Right now I assert
<br>
that a country with a populace breeding beyond cautious replacement levels
<br>
is setting itself up
<br>
for a cataclysmic collapse. That includes many african and middle east
<br>
countries. In a few
<br>
years not even 20% of adult (male!) populations in some of these countries
<br>
will have the means
<br>
to get meaningful employment. I regard this as an unmitigated disaster and I
<br>
am very certain
<br>
these countries will leverage off the cost of their unbridled breeding on
<br>
the rich countries.
