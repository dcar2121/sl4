<p>
Four points:
<br>
<p>1. Magic consciousness transfer.
<br>
<p>Let me say explicitly again: There is no magical consciousness
<br>
transfer. I feel like you're putting words in my mouth, or maybe
<br>
you're arguing against someone else.
<br>
<p>2. The friends and family test.
<br>
<p>Suppose a weather simulation can produce images that can fool people
<br>
who have seen weather. Should you base your strategy against global
<br>
warming on that weather simulation? I think the answer is no.
<br>
<p>Experts might be fooled by the images as well, but if they compare the
<br>
simulations' internal data structures and algorithms to real-world
<br>
measurements and understanding of weather processes and say &quot;Yes, we
<br>
think this is a faithful simulation.&quot; then we might reasonably base
<br>
our global warming strategy on the simulation.
<br>
<p>3. The morality of choosing a compromise.
<br>
<p>You repeatedly equate destructive uploading with a non-destructive
<br>
scan followed by murder. Compare the situation with animal research.
<br>
Suppose a researcher sacrifices animals in order to develop healing
<br>
drugs. Is that researcher equivalent to someone who first observes
<br>
animals to develop healing drugs and then kill the healthy animals
<br>
after they're done? No, the inextricability is relevant. The first
<br>
researcher doesn't have the option of developing the drugs and then
<br>
leaving the animals alive.
<br>
<p>To be completely clear: The difference is that the first person,
<br>
choosing an inextricable compromise, is not as evil as the second
<br>
person, choosing to kill the healthy animals.
<br>
<p>Destructive uploading, as an inextricable technological compromise, is
<br>
likely to be developed before non-destructive uploading. Suppose
<br>
someone is terminally ill during the period of time that destructive
<br>
uploading is available, but not non-destructive uploading. Someone who
<br>
advocates destructive uploading as the best of a collection of bad
<br>
options is not murdering the person. There is an analogy which could
<br>
be drawn, yes. However, &quot;similar&quot; is not the same as &quot;identical&quot;, and
<br>
advocating waiting to die is also similar to murder.
<br>
<p>4. Fatalism.
<br>
<p>You paint an unpleasant possible future, where healthy humans are
<br>
non-destructively scanned, a wand is waved, and then they are
<br>
murdered. Then the (non-faithful) uploads entice the scannee's friends
<br>
and family into uploading too. However, you don't seem to advocate any
<br>
action toward averting this future. Why not?
<br>
<p>For example: Duplication of mature individuals takes some practice to
<br>
think about. We could try to popularize the notion that people ought
<br>
to identify with both future selves. The point would be to make sure
<br>
that people understand that no amount of wand-waving would make the
<br>
murder of the biological self okay.
<br>
<p>We could popularize the idea that there are lots of programs which
<br>
would pass the friends and family test, and yet behave inhumanly in
<br>
some important ways.
<br>
<p>Simple memes started here can easily spread and change the future.
