More to the point, since we started off talking about a transporter, one 
<br>
will be at the destination, and the other will still be at the start.  
<br>
Even if there wasn't this difference, they would instantly start 
<br>
receiving and reacting to different sensory impressions.  The only time 
<br>
the two copies are sufficiently indistinguishable is before the 
<br>
operation (copying) has occurred.  At that point they ARE 
<br>
indistinguishable.  I.e., the self at that time is going to end up in 
<br>
both positions.  To arbitrarily choose one is ... well, I can't perceive 
<br>
any logic behind it.  And I'm not presuming quantum entanglement...I'm 
<br>
merely presuming that all noticeable memories are copied.  (We forget 
<br>
things every day, so I'm not even requiring perfect copies of the memory.)
