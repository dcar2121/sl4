</em><br>
<p>You seem to have read this sentence: &quot;What do we mean by &quot;should&quot;?&quot;
<br>
and attempted to answer it. I apologize for confusing you with my bad
<br>
writing, but I intended the question to be rhetorical. My intent was
<br>
to argue that the precise semantics of &quot;should&quot;, &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;duty&quot;,
<br>
&quot;obligation&quot;, &quot;morality&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot; are NOT important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should is to shall as will is to would as ought is to owe as might is to may.  Duty and morality are separate concepts from these.
</em><br>
<p>In a conversation about a proposed action (murder for the sake of
<br>
cannibalism, for example), all of these are roughly similar:
<br>
<p>You should not kill and eat people because (justification).
<br>
You ought not to kill and eat people because (justification).
<br>
You have a duty to avoid killing and eating people because (justification).
<br>
It is immoral to kill and eat people because (justification).
<br>
It is unethical to to kill and eat people because (justification).
<br>
<p>Splitting hairs about the subtly different historical and linguistic
<br>
connotations of these options is a red herring. We do have commonsense
<br>
understandings of these words, and can use them to attempt to persuade
<br>
one another to action. I was arguing against the tendency on this list
<br>
speak only in descriptions, like this:
<br>
<p>(description of a dystopian future containing cannibalism).
<br>
<p>We are building the future now. Futurists, in addition to trying to
<br>
predict the future, should advocate as clearly as possible the actions
<br>
that they believe would build a good future.
