<p><em>&gt; I find it hard to buy that quantum effects will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not diverge two minds fairly quickly, even if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in a symmetrical room (Which as we've discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be perfectly symmetrical in a real universe).
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This getting rather silly, now even the room must be quantum perfect?!
<br>
Obviously the room only needs to be good enough so that any
<br>
imperfections are below the threshold of unaided human senses to detect.
<br>
And even that is vast overkill. Are you really claiming that you’d be a
<br>
different person today if the bus bench you sat down on just once when
<br>
you were 6 didn’t have that quarter inch scratch in the paint in the
<br>
upper left hand corner?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are two possibilities-- either our brains are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum computers or they're not. The former possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no evidence aside from the odd circumstantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation, so we can ignore it. 
</em><br>
<p>OK fine, then brains more like regular old computers. But if computers
<br>
are that susceptible to chaos why is it that your computer and mine will
<br>
almost always come up with the same sequence of digits when we ask our
<br>
machines to calculate the value of Pi?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if our brain is describable in classic terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is still a fairly chaotic system 
</em><br>
<p>Then why don’t we change our philosophy of life a hundred times a day?
<br>
Why is our personality so stable? Why subjectively do we feel there is a
<br>
“me” if it’s all that ephemeral? I know I've asked a lot of  questions
<br>
but none of them are rhetorical, I’d really like answers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your statement about being reborn a million times a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanosecond is, I'm assuming, tongue in cheek.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, if you’re right then your life expectancy is less that a
<br>
nanosecond. I don’t think you’re right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The information structure doesnt change since you can't destroy information. 
</em><br>
<p>Huh? First you say every time a nat farts a new you is born, then you
<br>
say nothing changes.
