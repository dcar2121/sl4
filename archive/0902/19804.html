OK.  Let me try again in different words.
<br>
&quot;Me&quot; is those things I can exert control over.  When I drive, the car is 
<br>
a part of me.  This is (more or less) confirmed by brain scans.  When a 
<br>
chimpanzee uses a tool, it sees that tool as a part of itself.  In this 
<br>
sense, my near future is also a part of me.  I can control what's going 
<br>
to happen (to some reasonable extent).
<br>
<p>Mine is those things I claim the right to exert control over (to some 
<br>
extent).  (My wife would certainly question my right to exert very much 
<br>
control.  So would my dog, though to a lesser extent.)
<br>
<p>Who I am is not an all-or-nothing kind of relation.  My hand remains my 
<br>
hand, even if I loose it in an accident.  If I'm lucky and quick it can 
<br>
be reattached.
<br>
<p>Therefore, position the &quot;transporter&quot; as described, I (present) would 
<br>
decline to use it because I don't want to be tortured to death.  And, as 
<br>
described, the I before transmission would, indeed, be tortured to 
<br>
death, even though an I would survive that did not experience that.  At 
<br>
the time after the &quot;transport&quot; has occurred, the two entities have 
<br>
become separate.  They no longer experience each other as 
<br>
indistinguishable.  However, before the transport they were 
<br>
indistinguishable, due to identity.
<br>
<p>In the brain scans of animals (and to a much lesser extent of people) 
<br>
tests show that during the use of a tool, the tool is considered a part 
<br>
of the body.  When you feel with a stick, you are feeling with the 
<br>
stick, not with your fingers.  Because that's how the brain records it.  
<br>
At that point the stick is indistinguishable from you.  When you drop 
<br>
it, you also drop the connection.  Then it is seen as separate.
<br>
<p>There's nothing mysterious about it, though I may have explained things 
<br>
poorly.  It's a function of how and what the brain (i.e., the mind 
<br>
operating within the brain) records the stimuli.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Not that I'm helping, because I don't know the answer. Perhaps it is a fault
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at 'indistinguishable'? in any case, I can't be safe to assume that unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we have a good understanding of what the meaning behind &quot;me&quot; is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concepts are definitions, following regularities in the world, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans assign (context-sensitive) instrumental utility to the concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to role of those regularities in overall structure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, from the contexts in which the concepts apply. When we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about &quot;me&quot;, there is instrumental utility attached, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instrumental utility won't translate well to different regularities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or to different contexts in which this regularity is placed. I say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;instrumental&quot; in the sense of being a component in representation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the utility over whole timelines, even though things marked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instrumental this way may be seen as terminal values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the core properties of the concept &quot;me&quot; is that it's singular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at any time). When the concept changes to accommodate the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of multiple people, so should its instrumental utility. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow that when there are multiple identical people, each of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as valuable from your or anyone's perspective as the single original.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe so, maybe not, but no easy answer. We don't need the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of &quot;me&quot;, &quot;me&quot; doesn't apply. We need the understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of values, as applied to the discussed context.
