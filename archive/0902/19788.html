<p>The above message is an example of one-dimensional thinking about
<br>
intelligence. Modeling the differences in capabilities between humans,
<br>
other species, and non-life processes such as evolution by only one
<br>
dimension is probably useful, but I think we (sl4 denizens) do it too
<br>
much.
<br>
<p>It should be easy to imagine two entities which cannot be strictly
<br>
ranked in capability by only one dimension. For example, one entity
<br>
could beat another at chess, while the second could beat the first at
<br>
checkers.
<br>
<p>I would argue that in practice, most (narrow) AI researchers are
<br>
implicitly using mental models of multiple capabilities (and
<br>
capability growth during engineering). These mental models predict
<br>
that turning it off will remain a viable alternative.
<br>
<p>People who believe that hard takeoff of AI is likely, and dangerous,
<br>
are usually using one-dimensional models of capability and capability
<br>
growth.
<br>
<p>I think developing safety protocols for Friendly AGI research means
<br>
(among other things), building explicit (and tested and verified)
<br>
models of capability growth - probably including more than just one
<br>
dimension.
