<p><p>The main reason to care about if something is handmade or not, or a
<br>
rock concert for that matter, is its uniqueness.
<br>
In a virtual reality where everything can be logged and relived
<br>
without loss of sensory input, I agree with you though - there doesnt
<br>
seem to be any point to it at all.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, keeping a few human beings around for nostalgic
<br>
reasons shouldnt cost much, simply because I dont think Earth will be
<br>
very attractive if our civilizations dependance on DNA-based organisms
<br>
ends.
<br>
<p>Personally I´d prefer to be living somewhere else if uploaded - the
<br>
moon, somewhere in the asteroid-belt or in orbit around some planet.
<br>
Main reason being that travel would be cheaper and watching space
<br>
would be much easier.
<br>
<p>Personally I dont believe that biological life on Earth will be
<br>
threatened for economical reasons until the rest of our solar system
<br>
has been turned into computronium.
