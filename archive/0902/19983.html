</em><br>
<p>I am not sure that using the words &quot;volume&quot; and &quot;phase space&quot; are
<br>
enlightening, in this case. Could we not use &quot;difficulty&quot; for &quot;inverse
<br>
volume&quot; and &quot;capability&quot; for &quot;how small a volume in the space of
<br>
possibilities it can steer the future into&quot;?
<br>
<p>To redescribe the Lego model in these words:
<br>
There are two parameters to the model, both functions.
<br>
1. Difficulty of designing a mind of model number x (d(x)).
<br>
2. Capability of a mind of model number x (c(x)).
<br>
At a specific model number (y), if difficulty (d(y)) exceeds
<br>
capability (c(y)), then Lego predicts zero growth of intelligence. If
<br>
capability exceeds difficulty, then Lego predicts growth.
<br>
<p>Substituting simple functions into the parameters, we can see some of
<br>
the possible behaviors that Lego predicts.
<br>
<p>1. Both constant: Either zero growth no matter how much starting
<br>
engineering effort is applied, or continuous growth without need for a
<br>
starting push.
<br>
<p>2. Difficulty constant, Capability linear: There will be a threshold,
<br>
zero growth below the threshold, continuous growth afterward.
<br>
<p>3. Difficulty linear, Capability constant: This is a bit confusing,
<br>
because we have two notions of sophistication, model number, and
<br>
capability. Possibly we take &quot;capability&quot; to mean &quot;capability of doing
<br>
mind design&quot;, and model number to mean &quot;general purpose capability&quot;.
<br>
In this story, the model number grows for a while and then stops.
<br>
<p>4. Difficulty linear, Capability linear: Just like 1, 2, or 3,
<br>
depending on whether the lines are parallel, slope of capability
<br>
exceeds slope of difficulty, or vice versa.
<br>
<p>To get a prediction other than the few that have been mentioned so
<br>
far, we would need to have Capability and Difficulty intersect at two
<br>
points. Then we could have either:
<br>
<p>5. Growth, followed by a region of zero growth, followed by another
<br>
region of growth.
<br>
<p>6. Zero growth, followed by a region of growth up to some limit,
<br>
followed by another region of zero growth.
<br>
<p>I think Lego adds some math to the intuition that &quot;There is some kind
<br>
of intelligence threshold.&quot;. I would expect smooth rising functions
<br>
(to the extent that the model approximates reality at all), and I
<br>
wouldn't expect the curves to wobble back and forth across each other
<br>
in a complicated way, which makes a single threshold seem more likely.
<br>
<p>However, I think the two notions of sophistication is a flaw in the
<br>
model. Possibly the difficulty function could be the difficulty of
<br>
designing a mind with capability x, rather than the difficulty of
<br>
designing a mind with model number x? I'm not sure how to formalize
<br>
that.
