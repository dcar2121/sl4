<p>
<em>&gt; That's an interesting point. Thank you for the description of Godel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompleteness as &quot;Mathematics is an experimental science.&quot;, it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intriguing way of looking at it.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but it's also false. You can see mathematics as an experimental
<br>
science in some ways, but Godel has nothing to do with it. He
<br>
demonstrates simply that there exists statements in arithmetic that
<br>
cannot be proved or disproved algorithmically; Turign then extends the
<br>
result to show that not only does there exists statements of the above
<br>
type - but that you cannot be sure to identify one if you meet one.
<br>
<p>This has a whole load of philosophical consequences, but bringing in
<br>
experiments to mathematics isn't one of them (in fact it shows that
<br>
certain questions cannot be decided by any experiment). Mathematical
<br>
experiments are a seperate issue, and one that predates Godel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The analogy seems obvious, but why should anyone care? I was trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince people that using moral arguments (normative speech) in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community is a perfectly reasonable (rational) thing to do, if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community has some shared values that the argument can be based on.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. And the main thing that underpins all this is that we might
<br>
agree, in theory, that values are arbitrary, but, in practice, our
<br>
values are very very close together. That's why we can have
<br>
constructive arguments; the tension is that it is not clear to people
<br>
(especially at the beggining of an argument) what differences come
<br>
from slight differences in values and what comes from major
<br>
differences in understanding of the consequences.
<br>
<p>That's why is and ought are so mixed up in standard discourse, and why
<br>
we should try and keep them seperated even when doing &quot;ought&quot; type
<br>
arguments. (there's also a certain cowardice behind the distinction -
<br>
presenting &quot;is&quot; type arguments means you don't take risks by putting
<br>
forwards your values and having arguments about them, and you can
<br>
always take refuge by saying that you are simply considering options
<br>
or possibilities).
