<em>&gt; Well, since English is not my native language, and typing anything really

</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion is exactly the same as mine. He managed to express incredibly well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his viewpoint on this subject, and since we think the same, I've decided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I could be more successful using his terms than my own. His name is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Jackson, and he usually posts on another list I lurk. So here we go:
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your quote of Jackson on most parts, but I think you both miss
<br>
two important points:
<br>
<p>1. Subjectively all living things are not of equal value.
<br>
I value any human being more than a potato.
<br>
I value any of you who participate on this list more than a person that i
<br>
have never had any contact with at all.
<br>
I value my family more than any of you.
<br>
<p>Now, if a copy could be made of myself, through uploading or any other means
<br>
- that new identity will know me better than anyone and i will know it/him
<br>
equally well. Our opinions will be the same regarding every subject and I
<br>
think the value of this new identity for me will be equally valuable as my
<br>
closest family, probably even more so (in the sense that I´d rather
<br>
testament everything to him than to anyone else).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this perspective uploading becomes meaningful, but not risk-free and
</em><br>
not something worth sacrificing everything else for.
<br>
<p>2. I *believe* the continuation of self to be an illusion. I am not the same
<br>
person now that i was a second ago. The only thing that connects us is my
<br>
current memory of being that person one second ago.
<br>
If I am copied perfectly, both the resulting versions will be new and none
<br>
of them will be a continuation of my old self, they will only have that
<br>
memory.
<br>
This is just a belief, and not a particularly strong one, in my current
<br>
version of self. Right now I wouldnt sacrifice my life for an &quot;eternal&quot;
<br>
upload.
