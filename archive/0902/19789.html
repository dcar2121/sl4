Why in the world &quot;slowly&quot;?  Unless there's some required reason, then 
<br>
any device that slowly tortures someone, anyone, to death *HAS* to be 
<br>
considered unethical.   It doesn't matter whether it's you or not.
<br>
<p>P.S.:  From my point of view, all sufficiently indistinguishable 
<br>
versions of myself are me.  Note that before I enter the transporter, 
<br>
both resulting copies will be &quot;me&quot;.  Afterwards, each of them will be me 
<br>
to itself, and the other will not.  But the other will be an &quot;extremely 
<br>
close blood relation&quot;...closer than either a parent or a sib.   Me is 
<br>
the entity that can control the peripherals that I can control.  An 
<br>
example might be a hand, but it might also be a car that I'm driving.  
<br>
(If I can't control it, I'm not driving it.)  This is (part of) the 
<br>
basis of the phantom limb problem.
