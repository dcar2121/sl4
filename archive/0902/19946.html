<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, it was intended to answer a question.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to have read this sentence: &quot;What do we mean by &quot;should&quot;?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and attempted to answer it. I apologize for confusing you with my bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing, but I intended the question to be rhetorical. My intent was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to argue that the precise semantics of &quot;should&quot;, &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;duty&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;obligation&quot;, &quot;morality&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot; are NOT important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Should is to shall as will is to would as ought is to owe as might is to may.  Duty and morality are separate concepts from these.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a conversation about a proposed action (murder for the sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannibalism, for example), all of these are roughly similar:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should not kill and eat people because (justification).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Statement of negative intention (somehow converted into second person)
<br>
<em>&gt; You ought not to kill and eat people because (justification).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Statement of debt or obligation.
<br>
<em>&gt; You have a duty to avoid killing and eating people because (justification).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Statement of honor.
<br>
<em>&gt; It is immoral to kill and eat people because (justification).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Statement of tradition?
<br>
<em>&gt; It is unethical to to kill and eat people because (justification).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Statement of social cohesion?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . .
<br>
No, they aren't equivalent.  There are large areas of overlap, but they 
<br>
aren't equivalent.  (OTOH, you are the one who added killing.  Some 
<br>
instances of cannibalism, perhaps most, were ritualistic funerals.)
<br>
<p>Additionally, each of those justifications would be different, with 
<br>
differing logical consequences.  (Also note that I wouldn't say &quot;You 
<br>
should not...&quot;, but only either &quot;I should not...&quot;  or &quot;One should 
<br>
not...&quot;.  To me the first form has a very unclear meaning.)
<br>
<em>&gt; Splitting hairs about the subtly different historical and linguistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotations of these options is a red herring. We do have commonsense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandings of these words, and can use them to attempt to persuade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one another to action. I was arguing against the tendency on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak only in descriptions, like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (description of a dystopian future containing cannibalism).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
I was actually thinking of various past cultures that practiced, or were 
<br>
reputed to practice, one or another form of cannibalism.
<br>
<em>&gt; We are building the future now. Futurists, in addition to trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict the future, should advocate as clearly as possible the actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they believe would build a good future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Johnicholas
</em><br>
If we want the future that we build to have any chance of enduring, then 
<br>
we need to be clear about our foundational concepts.  Blurring 
<br>
distinctions is an invitation false reasoning.  So it's important that 
<br>
the language used to describe it be unambiguous.  This is very 
<br>
difficult.  It's probably impossible.  But one can attempt to minimize 
<br>
the ambiguity while still retaining sufficient generality to apply to 
<br>
actual circumstances.
