<p>
Uploading, though nice, seems to have some unpleasant consequences
<br>
(either to those left behind, or through mass-copying). When told
<br>
about these consequences, a general cry goes up from some source (that
<br>
source being StrawMan(TM), the target of arguments since time
<br>
imemorial; but also some genuine sources as well):
<br>
&quot;Let's ban that type of behaviour!&quot;
<br>
<p>Then others point out that, realistically, it's not going to be
<br>
possible to ban that behaviour - it will be unenforecable, because
<br>
that behaviour is easy, and people will want to do it. The next cry
<br>
will probably then be:
<br>
&quot;Then let's ban uploading!&quot;
<br>
<p>But there is another alternative, since uploading is a unique
<br>
technology: since it aims to reproduce the desires and thoughts of the
<br>
uploady, there will probably be the possibility of changing those
<br>
desires and thoughts in the upload - enough to make the 'nasty' types
<br>
of behaviours rare (thus allowing a light legal restrictions on top,
<br>
that should be enforceable). This might be easier to justify if the
<br>
thoughts and desires of an uploader need to be changed anyway, to deal
<br>
with the completely new environment they find themselves in.
<br>
<p>The example that I was thinking of was making uploads value standard
<br>
human produced goods (see previous posts), or wanting to avoid being
<br>
duplicated, but there are others ideas too.
<br>
<p>Lots of fun questions possible then! Here are a few:
<br>
<p>1) What sort of mental changes to uploads might be useful to forstall
<br>
certain problems?
<br>
2) Would this actually work?
<br>
3) How would you, personally feel if this was the only upload option -
<br>
either through government fiat or corporate requirements?
<br>
4) What sort of restrictions would you be prepared to accept, and
<br>
still upload - either for a non-destructive, or a destructive upload?
<br>
