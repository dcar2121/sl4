<p>
Let me make an analogy between mathematics and ethics. Many objects in
<br>
mathematics (e.g. matroids, vector spaces, the natural numbers) have
<br>
many alternative axiomatizations. Foundations-of-mathematics
<br>
researchers create and offer different possible systems.
<br>
Zermelo-Frankel set theory is a powerful contender, but there are many
<br>
alternatives that are argued to be more elegant, to be more relevant
<br>
to mathematical intuition, or to avoid various confusing features.
<br>
<p>If the foundations are actively being worked on, does that instability
<br>
ripple upward into other mathematician's work? Do topologists say &quot;I
<br>
wish those foundations researchers would quit changing the definition
<br>
of a vector space!&quot;? No. There is a social consensus of mathematical
<br>
facts. Axiomatizations that lead to a novel conclusion contradicting
<br>
that consensus (e.g. &quot;1=0&quot;) are tossed out as unacceptable.
<br>
<p>The foundations of ethics and morality are not entirely pinned down.
<br>
Philosophers publish papers in these areas all the time. Despite this
<br>
instability, we can make judgments like: &quot;It is right, correct,
<br>
appropriate, moral, and ethical to rescue a person from death by an
<br>
oncoming train.&quot;. There is a social consensus of ethical judgments.
<br>
<p>Just like the many alternative definitions of a vector space, there
<br>
are many possible justifications for why it is appropriate to rescue a
<br>
person from death. You could justify it as an axiomatic moral duty.
<br>
You could justify it as useful to the continuance of the species, if
<br>
you thought the continuance of the species was morally axiomatic. You
<br>
could justify it as maximizing total happiness, if you thought that
<br>
was morally axiomatic.
<br>
<p>When you are taking actions or advocating for actions you are doing
<br>
APPLIED ethics, similar to the working mathematician.
<br>
<p>&quot;Should I (donate/volunteer/study neuroimaging) for the sake of
<br>
helping to build 'upload' technology? Or should I
<br>
(donate/volunteer/study AGI) for the sake of helping to build Friendly
<br>
AI technology? What about the RepRap?&quot;
<br>
<p>The most stable justifications for these actions are commonsense
<br>
morality from the social consensus, NOT foundational axioms of ethics.

</em><br>
<p>I agree, we need to compromise between foundational precision and generality.

<p>I agree, justifications will have to bottom out somewhere.
