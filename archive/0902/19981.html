2009/2/16 Dimitry Volfson &lt;<a href="mailto:dvolfson@juno.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20normative%20language%20is%20rational">dvolfson@juno.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is still rational - if the weighting does not come out of thin air. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can connect your actions (maybe contributing money to an ad campaign to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop the death penalty) to your scheme - which also does not come out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thin air, but through consideration of what exists in the real world. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly, relating your experience of the real world to another person, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recalibrate their weighting schemes; -- persuasion.
</em><br>
<p>But in the end peoples' reasons might only seem good reasons to
<br>
themselves, not to anyone else. I might understand that the murderer
<br>
did it because he thought it was OK to kill, and I might even
<br>
understand what life experiences or peculiarity of neurophysiology led
<br>
to this belief, but that doesn't mean I think his views are right or
<br>
rational; and he thinks the same about my views on the subject. We end
<br>
up just having to agree to disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rational and Absolutely Right, are not the same things. For the most part we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot know what is absolutely right.
</em><br>
<p>I would say there is no such thing as Absolutely Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider again the simple idea of 1 + 1 = 2. It does not come from thin air,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor is it the only possible scheme. Arithmetic is about counting. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to know how many marbles you will count if you place one marble on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground and then place another marble on the ground, then 1 + 1 = 2 is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful shortcut to actually moving the physical marbles and then proceeding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to count them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if you want to know how many molecules you have as a result of combining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X-number of molecules of type A, with Y-number of molecules of type B; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arithmetic does not usually hold; 1 + 1 = 1 (or even 2 + 2 = 1) may be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct answer, the correct shortcut scheme.
</em><br>
<p>The difference is that in scientific discourse the axioms themselves
<br>
are not usually at issue, and if they are they aren't really axioms.
<br>
There's not a lot of point in my criticising your statements about
<br>
chemistry on the grounds that when you say &quot;carbon&quot;, I understand that
<br>
as referring to the element with seven protons, not six. If indeed we
<br>
realised that our use of language differed in this way we could
<br>
quickly clear up the misunderstanding and either reach agreement or
<br>
else disagree on a matter of fact, not definition: &quot;*given* that
<br>
carbon is the sixth element, then propane molecules have three carbon
<br>
atoms&quot;. But the same process in ethics or aesthetics may yield vacuous
<br>
results: &quot;*given* that capital punishment is wrong under any
<br>
circumstances, then it is wrong to execute mass murderers&quot;.
