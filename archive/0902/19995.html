Oh man, I have some really really old #sl4 logs, really really old as in
<br>
2002, I'm looking at them right now and see Justin and me on there... heh,
<br>
yes, this period of time is super-nostalgic in the extreme.  This is my
<br>
childhood right here.
<br>
<p>Oct 17 20:47&lt;observer&gt;    I thought of an idea that might be worthwhile for
<br>
a Singularity fanfic.
<br>
Oct 17 20:48&lt;outlawpoet&gt;    singularity Fanfic?
<br>
Oct 17 20:49&lt;outlawpoet&gt;    doesn't there have to be an original work of
<br>
fiction for fanfiction to be possible?
<br>
Oct 17 20:49&lt;ChrisRovner&gt;    There is, afaik
<br>
Oct 17 20:51&lt;ChrisRovner&gt;    So what's your idea?
<br>
Oct 17 20:51&lt;observer&gt;    How about a story describing a future in which the
<br>
US government, in an alliance with Microsoft, was capable of monitoring
<br>
(almost) all the computers in the world, and where AI was outlawed, and
<br>
Eliezer led a rebel group of Singularitarians who planned to code a seed AI
<br>
using illegal, homemade computers, built from spare parts.
<br>
Oct 17 20:51&lt;mjr&gt;    sure
<br>
Oct 17 20:52&lt;outlawpoet&gt;    heh
<br>
Oct 17 20:52&lt;outlawpoet&gt;    you should probably use a generic lead character
<br>
rather than &quot;Eliezer with a capital E&quot;
<br>
<p>Oct 19 08:30&lt;MichaelA&gt;    why is everyone so interested in a conversation
<br>
about God?
<br>
Oct 19 08:30&lt;MichaelA&gt;    I wonder
<br>
<p>Oct 22 02:57&lt;MichaelA&gt;    Hm, so what sort of things were accomplished in
<br>
the past week?
<br>
Oct 22 02:59&lt;ChrisRovner&gt;    Not much, that I know. That's a good question.
<br>
I think I should be asking it more often
<br>
Oct 22 02:59&lt;MichaelA&gt;    Yep
<br>
Oct 22 02:59&lt;MichaelA&gt;    In fact, I could ask &quot;what sort of things were
<br>
accomplished in the past year&quot;
<br>
Oct 22 02:59&lt;MichaelA&gt;    I've been a &quot;Singularitarian&quot; for a year
<br>
Oct 22 02:59&lt;MichaelA&gt;    Very little has been accomplished
<br>
<p>Wow, I sound like sort of a bitch.  Seriously though, I don't want my
<br>
teenagehood splattered everywhere... I'll send a few logs to Bryan and if
<br>
anyone else is *really* interested (preferably if you were there) I may
<br>
send, but there's really not that much of interest on there except inside
<br>
jokes.
<br>
<p>If anyone that was there really wants me to keep the logs to myself, then I
<br>
let me know and I'll respect your wishes... btw I know someone out there has
<br>
ALL the logs, don't they?
<br>
