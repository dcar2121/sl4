<p><em>&gt; You assume both would decide poke each other simultaneously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what by no means is a must be. But oh, fair enough, lets proceed. 
</em><br>
<p>No, let’s not proceed. If they’re identical then they act the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you could easily distinguish yourself from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other copy simply by poking it 
</em><br>
<p>That is a brilliant idea, and the fellow standing before you who looks
<br>
just like you would have the exact same brilliant idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i can prove their inequality simply by interfering in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experiment and poking one of them and observing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the other felt the poking. 
</em><br>
<p>You’ve proved nothing. If you poke one and not the other then they are
<br>
no longer identical and will have diverged into different people,
<br>
although both would have an equal right to call themselves Filipe
<br>
Sobreira.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; both actually CAN NOT be identical, since [blah blah] quantum uncertainties
</em><br>
<p>If your theory of personal identity is so delicate that quantum
<br>
uncertainties will disrupt it then you should never drink a cup of
<br>
coffee because it will turn you into another person; it will certainly
<br>
change you far more than quantum uncertainties will.
<br>
<p>It’s interesting that in all these discussions everybody insists there
<br>
is a huge difference between the sacred high holy ORIGINAL and a copy,
<br>
even though the scientific method can detect no difference and the
<br>
parties in question can’t even tell subjectively if they’ve switched
<br>
positions or not.
