<p>
What do we mean by &quot;should&quot;? I'm not a philosopher of deontic logic,
<br>
and I'm not going to try to write down any formalization of the
<br>
concept. I don't think it's necessary or important for the moment.
<br>
<p>If I advocate for some action, like so:
<br>
&quot;I think we should (donate to the Methuselah Foundation's M prize).&quot;
<br>
I think everyone on this list understands, in a commonsense way, what
<br>
I am trying to communicate.
<br>
<p>I hope that everyone also agrees that the future is not written. We
<br>
can build it. Even if there are opposing forces and success is not
<br>
guaranteed, we should strive to a better future.
<br>
<p>Suppose that someone else on the list argues &quot;No, we should not
<br>
(donate to the M prize).&quot; and then I ask &quot;Why shouldn't we?&quot;, and they
<br>
respond &quot;(Donating to Friendly AGI research) has a better
<br>
(cost/benefit ratio).&quot; At this point we're engaging in dialog. There
<br>
is communication happening.
<br>
<p>Claiming at this point &quot;Normative language is not falsifiable.&quot; shifts
<br>
the topic from (the M prize) to the philosophy of deontic logic. This
<br>
is the red herring fallacy. Regardless of the philosophers, we do have
<br>
a working ability to advocate actions to other people, and understand
<br>
when someone else is advocating an action to us.
<br>
<p>There is NO SPECIAL BONUS for carefully avoiding the words &quot;ought&quot;,
<br>
&quot;should&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; in your writing. If you create a rhetorical
<br>
fantasy of a possible future depicting torture and death, readers will
<br>
easily connect the dots and understand the normative message &quot;We
<br>
should strive to avoid this future.&quot;. Despite the grammar, you are
<br>
still engaging in normative dialog, and advocating for actions.
<br>
<p>My point is: eschew obfuscation. Use normative grammar to advocate for actions.
<br>
<p>Johnicholas
