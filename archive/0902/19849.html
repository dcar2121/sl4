<p><em>&gt; The atoms themselves weren't teleported, only their states 
</em><br>
<p>And here we have it, “only their [quantum] states” moved not “The atoms
<br>
themselves”. That last is a revealing phrase, even in the absence
<br>
quantum states you think all atoms have a unique property that no other
<br>
atom has, even though the scientific method can not detect it. There is
<br>
a word for that mysterious property but I can’t seem to remember it
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p>You were going on and on about quantum states and entanglement and how
<br>
that is the reason 2 atoms are not the same, but when I give an example
<br>
where every last one of those states are transferred it’s still not good
<br>
enough for you, “something” is still missing. Of course you don’t say
<br>
what that “something” is. Now I remember the word I couldn’t think of
<br>
before, it’s “soul”. 
<br>
<p>Yep, it could only be the atom’s soul. I don’t believe in souls, not for
<br>
atoms and not for me. After your above remark you have no business
<br>
bringing up quantum states as any objection to my ideas because clearly
<br>
that is not the root of your disagreement. I very much doubt any
<br>
rational idea is at the root of it. 
<br>
I think this is the final proof that people don’t study physics and from
<br>
that deduce that uploading and spare copies won’t work, rather they
<br>
decide that they won’t work and only then look for reasons to support
<br>
their view and of course ignore reasons that show that view to be
<br>
nonsense.
<br>
<p>Please explain how the universe would be one bit different if the “atoms
<br>
themselves” had been teleported and not just (JUST?!) their states.
<br>
Not the atoms themselves, what a load of crap!
