<p><em>&gt; In every example given I can prove by a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind experiment that they are not the same. 
</em><br>
<p>Good God man, you’re still not talking about that stupid poke business
<br>
are you? If you decide to poke the original the original will decide to
<br>
poke you; and if a third party pokes one and not the other then they are
<br>
no longer identical and will have diverged. What more do we need to say
<br>
about the science of pokes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If i change an atom for another identical one in a molecule,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the molecule would still be the same based on its properties,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value and utility, but I can easily observe that the atom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is not the same as the one in the molecule
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Once upon a time there was an atom of hydrogen named Bob. Bob and a few
<br>
billion of his hydrogen friends were cooled down colder and colder until
<br>
they formed a Bose-Einstein condensate. After they warmed up again all
<br>
the King’s horses and all the King’s men couldn’t pick out which one was
<br>
Bob again. And neither could God, and neither could you.
