<em>&gt; If your theory of personal identity is so delicate that quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainties will disrupt it then you should never drink a cup of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coffee because it will turn you into another person; it will certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change you far more than quantum uncertainties will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's interesting that in all these discussions everybody insists there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a huge difference between the sacred high holy ORIGINAL and a copy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though the scientific method can detect no difference and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parties in question can't even tell subjectively if they've switched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions or not.
</em><br>
<p>Aha! Here it looks like we're getting close to the nub of the problem
<br>
(sorry, missed this post earlier). I finally see where you're coming
<br>
from.
<br>
<p>I do not see any difference between the original and the copy, just
<br>
through the fact that one is the original and the other is the copy (I
<br>
definetly see no reason to prefer one over the other).
<br>
<p>But first, I note that you've changed your definition: you initially
<br>
said that the two copies were the idistinguishable, so they are both
<br>
the same person. But chaos (you don't even need quantum) means that
<br>
the two copies are distinguishable, so now you seem to have shifted
<br>
the identity criteria to &quot;you could easily have ended up as either one
<br>
of them&quot;.
<br>
<p>Fine then. When I drink coffee, I am slightly different. This doesn't
<br>
normally matter, as there isn't someone else around to take over my
<br>
identity.
<br>
<p>But now there are two copies of Stuart Armstrong, both of them subtely
<br>
differrent people, and this difference will only grow with time. Two
<br>
possible branches of my future co-exist together. I see no reason to
<br>
decree that one of them is original, and the other is not; I similarly
<br>
see no reason to decree that two diverging entities that don't share
<br>
emotions or sensations are the same person. Instead, we will call
<br>
ourselves Suart Armstrong Alpha and Stuart Armstrong One, and go on
<br>
our merry ways (first fighting each other over our wife).
<br>
<p><p>Stuart Armstrong Alpha One
