<em>&gt;&gt; We might agree on all the facts, but weight the facts differently - based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; personal experiences that have calibrated our weighting schemes. If we give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; weight to all salient aspects the same as each other, such as reduction of

<em>&gt;&gt; murder rate and value of retribution to the victims' friends and family,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then we will come to the same conclusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is the point: the weighting I give to the facts depends on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience and brain makeup, as for example does my preference for tea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or coffee. There is no objective morality to which we can appeal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine the &quot;correct&quot; weighting.
</em><br>
It is still rational - if the weighting does not come out of thin air. 
<br>
And you can connect your actions (maybe contributing money to an ad 
<br>
campaign to stop the death penalty) to your scheme - which also does not 
<br>
come out of thin air, but through consideration of what exists in the 
<br>
real world. And possibly, relating your experience of the real world to 
<br>
another person, can recalibrate their weighting schemes; -- persuasion.
<br>
<p>Rational and Absolutely Right, are not the same things. For the most 
<br>
part we cannot know what is absolutely right.
<br>
<p>Consider again the simple idea of 1 + 1 = 2. It does not come from thin 
<br>
air, nor is it the only possible scheme. Arithmetic is about counting. 
<br>
If you want to know how many marbles you will count if you place one 
<br>
marble on the ground and then place another marble on the ground, then 1 
<br>
+ 1 = 2 is a useful shortcut to actually moving the physical marbles and 
<br>
then proceeding to count them.
<br>
<p>But if you want to know how many molecules you have as a result of 
<br>
combining X-number of molecules of type A, with Y-number of molecules of 
<br>
type B; then arithmetic does not usually hold; 1 + 1 = 1 (or even 2 + 2 
<br>
= 1) may be the correct answer, the correct shortcut scheme.
