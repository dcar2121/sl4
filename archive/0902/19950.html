</em><br>
<p>Yes. The reason being is related to the complexity of the underlying system.
<br>
We both agree that quantum procedures interact with classical procedures all
<br>
the time. Given a self contained environment, the total information
<br>
complexity required to completely describe the state of the self contained
<br>
environment cannot decrease over time. Now, a qubit describing the vector of
<br>
a ball moving through space is no different in terms of complexity than the
<br>
qubit describing an electron's vector. Given that there are constant
<br>
interactions at all levels happening all the time, a significant amount of
<br>
information passes back and forth between 'classical' and 'quantum' levels
<br>
of interaction. I concede that what constitutes a classical level and a
<br>
quantum level is somewhat arbitrary, and we cannot be sure of the bandwidth
<br>
of information exchange between the two levels, but I will operate under the
<br>
(I believe fairly reasonable) assumption that it isn't insignificant and has
<br>
an upper bound of the total complexity of the classical system.  If the room
<br>
is not quantum perfect, it will diverge quickly.
<br>
<p>This is directly related to a simulated environment, i.e. the connection
<br>
with uploads. Even though our brains may be describable in terms of a
<br>
classical computational system, the potential trajectories of a simulated
<br>
vs. a non-simulated individual in a simulated vs. non-simulated environment
<br>
will be drastically different unless the simulated environment contains
<br>
quantum information. Not including such represents a drastic reduction in
<br>
complexity, and the 'experience' will be qualitatively different, among
<br>
other things.
