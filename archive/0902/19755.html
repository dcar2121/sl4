<p>
The recent exchenge on uploads has got me thinking (and worrying)
<br>
about this possibility.
<br>
<p>The first objection to slavery is that the coercive elements keep
<br>
wages and conditions for slaves far below what they should be; the
<br>
second objection is that these wages and conditions are appalling.
<br>
<p>It should be relatively easy to avoid the first problem in a world
<br>
full of uploads - general free market paradigms should be easy to
<br>
implement and defend.
<br>
<p>Much more disturbing would be if the economic value of standard humans
<br>
dropped to near subsistence levels (quite likely to happen). Then the
<br>
everyday experience of standard humans would mimic slavey; this would
<br>
effectively force all humans to upload in order to survive.
<br>
<p>That might be bad enough, but it could get worse - if the economic
<br>
return on improving an upload is higher than uploading a standard
<br>
human, uploading may become unaffordable. (think of this as working at
<br>
the sweatshop rather than living on the garbbage heap - but with the
<br>
provisio that never ever will you or any of your descendants be able
<br>
to aspire to more than working at the sweatshop).
<br>
<p>A rather obvious solution would be to implement simply enforceable
<br>
laws making uploading universally available, but I'm interested in
<br>
looking at other alternatives, that do not involve effectively coerced
<br>
uploading.
<br>
<p>One interesting alternative is to look at modified utility functions.
<br>
If the value of an object is not only in its physical properties, but
<br>
also in the manner in which it was constructed, then there may be hope
<br>
for standard humans to continue to compete economically in an uploaded
<br>
world. We have some examples of this today - concerts (especially rock
<br>
concerts) where the performers do not do anything more than sing their
<br>
usual songs in a more noisy environment. Yet the joint experience of
<br>
seeing the actual performer makes this an economically viable set-up.
<br>
<p>Similarly, we have some fair-trade products. No matter how imperfect
<br>
and distorting the whole system is, it is based around one significant
<br>
fact: people are willing to pay more for something based on how it was
<br>
produced. Can we harness this urge for uploads?
<br>
<p>Compelling every upload to change their utility function would be
<br>
unduly coercive; but there could be a posibility to subsidise or
<br>
encourage &quot;ethical uploads&quot;, which changes the uploads' utility
<br>
functions slightly so that they place greater economic value on
<br>
standard human produced goods. Since we are working on the assumption
<br>
that uploads' productivity will dwarf the possible economic output of
<br>
standard humans, it would not take many of these &quot;ethical uploads&quot; to
<br>
ensure the viability of standard humans - and the competitive
<br>
disadvantage of &quot;ethical uploads&quot; would be correspondingly small.
<br>
