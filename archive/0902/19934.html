<p>
Although I dont currently agree with John K Clarke's view I suddenly had a
<br>
minor epiphany.
<br>
<p>I think its fairly accepted that languages form the way we think.
<br>
Trying to imagine that several persons all are one is like saying &quot;We are
<br>
me&quot; or &quot;All of them are him&quot; which is a syntactic error and really hard for
<br>
our brains to cope with.
<br>
Maybe we should add some new pronouns to our language to be able to discuss
<br>
it further?
<br>
Something like a new personal pronoun group in between 1st and 2nd persona,
<br>
used for talking about or to members of the same clone group as yourself.
<br>
<p>What do you think?
