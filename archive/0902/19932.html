I had to look up deontic logic to even know what it is.
<br>
I´ve studied linguistics for about a year though and the definitions of
<br>
&quot;normative&quot; varies from discipline to discipline which might cause some
<br>
confusion.
<br>
<p>Here is my take according to the linguistic definitions I´ve learned:
<br>
<p>1. (The kind you describe) is what plans would make the best possible
<br>
outcome in the future, which I find constructive. I would´t like to call
<br>
this normative language. The actual discussion you describe (which is the
<br>
important point) _describes_ probable outcomes for the future. Shouldnt it
<br>
be called descriptive then? In linguistics the opposing terms are normative
<br>
and descriptive..
<br>
<p>2. Describe how things _ought_ to be _right now_ and decide that one way is
<br>
right while all others are wrong.
<br>
&nbsp;(ie It´s vulgar to spell behaviour or armour without a u.
<br>
Christians/Moslems are good, moslems/christians/all others are evil.)
<br>
Imho normative language(according to my defintion) doesnt have much use
<br>
outside of oppression and wartime propaganda.
<br>
You might say that the following sentence is normative: &quot;You should use
<br>
punctuation, avoid long sentences and start each new sentence with a capital
<br>
letter.&quot;
<br>
Writing it in a descriptive way where you show both action and consequence
<br>
will be somewhat longer, but less provocative and have a higher chance of
<br>
invoking change in the one you're talking to, for example:
<br>
&quot;If you dont use punctuation and avoid long sentences, your text will
<br>
be more difficult to understand and less people will bother to read it.&quot;

<em>&gt; What do we mean by &quot;should&quot;? I'm not a philosopher of deontic logic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm not going to try to write down any formalization of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept. I don't think it's necessary or important for the moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I advocate for some action, like so:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I think we should (donate to the Methuselah Foundation's M prize).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think everyone on this list understands, in a commonsense way, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am trying to communicate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope that everyone also agrees that the future is not written. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can build it. Even if there are opposing forces and success is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed, we should strive to a better future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that someone else on the list argues &quot;No, we should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (donate to the M prize).&quot; and then I ask &quot;Why shouldn't we?&quot;, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond &quot;(Donating to Friendly AGI research) has a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cost/benefit ratio).&quot; At this point we're engaging in dialog. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is communication happening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Claiming at this point &quot;Normative language is not falsifiable.&quot; shifts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the topic from (the M prize) to the philosophy of deontic logic. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the red herring fallacy. Regardless of the philosophers, we do have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a working ability to advocate actions to other people, and understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when someone else is advocating an action to us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is NO SPECIAL BONUS for carefully avoiding the words &quot;ought&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;should&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; in your writing. If you create a rhetorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantasy of a possible future depicting torture and death, readers will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily connect the dots and understand the normative message &quot;We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should strive to avoid this future.&quot;. Despite the grammar, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still engaging in normative dialog, and advocating for actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point is: eschew obfuscation. Use normative grammar to advocate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions.
