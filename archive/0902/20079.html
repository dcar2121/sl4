<p>
Thanks, Joshua.
<br>
<p>I've been writing up a research proposal following a visit to IDSIA,
<br>
and the conclusions I have come to are that:
<br>
<p>(1)  Previous work within academia has failed to deliver because of
<br>
various social factors related to the warping influence that the
<br>
prospect of AGI has on the human mind, overconfidence, giving up, etc.
<br>
<p>(2) we are fairly fortunate that this is the case, because no previous
<br>
projects had a Friendliness strategy, so if they had worked we might
<br>
well all be dead...
<br>
<p>(3) Today there are about 100 people in the world working on AGI in a
<br>
vaguely serious way, as far as I can tell, and we shouldn't hold our
<br>
breath for AGI any time soon unless much more good quality research is
<br>
done. The number of implemented systems numbers about, well,
<br>
scratching the bottom of the barrel here, 4 that I can think of.
<br>
(Novamente, NARS, SOAR, ACT-R). For comparison, in my day job CS
<br>
research, there are about 50 implemented ontology mapping systems...
<br>
<p>(4) This might be a good thing, because most of the people working in
<br>
AGI *STILL* don't have friendliness as a priority. The number of
<br>
people working on friendly AI (which I would define loosely as AGI
<br>
with human friendliness as an overriding consideration) in the world
<br>
is probably less than 20.
<br>
<p>(5) It can't go on like this forever. At some point, we are going to
<br>
have to make things ship-shape in AGI, which means taking AGI from
<br>
email lists back into CS departments, and taking friendliness very
<br>
seriously. Some people (Vassar!) seem to think that the 20-or-so can
<br>
do the job on their own, and I doubt this. But on the other hand,
<br>
convincing mainstream academia to take FAI seriously is a very hard
<br>
problem too, though it brings with it a hefty advantage: academia has
<br>
lots of good people and lots of money.
<br>
<p>Given the situation at the moment, I think that we are in for a long
<br>
fight if we are to get the high quality community, the level of
<br>
funding and manpower and the required farsightedness to bring about an
<br>
FAI. At some point, Eliezer made a comment on OB saying that the
<br>
people down in the AGI &quot;dungeon&quot; today weren't down there because they
<br>
were really good and they wanted a really tough problem to attack, but
<br>
because they were too stupid/too overconfident to see how hard the
<br>
problem actually is. Yes, I agree. It is a shame that this, the most
<br>
important scientific problem ever, is getting such little attention,
<br>
whilst talent and funding is thrown into black holes like ... black
<br>
hole research.

<br>
<em>&gt; There has been little research into the theory of intelligence-in-general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (non-anthropomorphic general intelligence) and recursive decision theory. (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know of the work of SIAI affiliates and  Schmidhueber-Hutter-Legg. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's more, I'd appreciate bibliography.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adding an incremental contribution to the limited existing work (which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how most science is done), would be valuable in its own right and as a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of raising the profile of this area in academia. Depending on how far you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go, this would not be revealing secrets, although I suppose that just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing the size of the field could be a risk..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If done right, the research could be connected to  some existing field, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least to the point where publication is possible.

<em>&gt;&gt; Since I've been lurking in the h+/AGI community for a while without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reading SL4, I'd like to know what the general opinion of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; community is on FAI development within, or in collaboration with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mainstream of academia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Now, the current situation is that there is at least a conference on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; general intelligence, and a very small community of researchers doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; research on the subject of general AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; One way to hasten the development of FAI is for me to seek to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; research within academia. A disadvantage of this strategy is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; academia is an open community, and anyone can potentially look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; results that the field is producing and use them to create uFAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Eliezer has outlined some other problems with academia in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; following SL4 post:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0410/10071.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0410/10071.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Another possibility is for SIAI to seek to keep the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; aspects of AGI development mostly secret.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is SIAI adopting this mode of operation (i.e. internal research)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This has the disadvantage that a small community of researchers will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be less creative and more susceptible to groupthink than the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; international research community. &quot;Closed innovation&quot; vs. &quot;Closed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; innovation&quot; comes to mind here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Now, I'm at a stage where I need to decide to what to do with my life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so a bit of advice on this would be appreciated. Perhaps the list has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; already discussed similar issues (&quot;I want to help out with FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; research, what do I do?&quot; etc)
</em><br>
