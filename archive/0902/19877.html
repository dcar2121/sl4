<p><em>&gt; Isn't x a complex number, and the probability is the square of the

</em><br>
<p>I’m not following you. The quantum wave function is the square root of a
<br>
probability and being a square root means it can and does have negative
<br>
terms in it and even imaginary terms, and that means the quantum wave
<br>
function is not a scalar like simple probability but a vector with an
<br>
intensity and a direction, and that means you can not just add up 2
<br>
independent probabilities to figure the probability both will happen the
<br>
way we usually do, and that means two very different wave functions can
<br>
yield the same probabilities, and that means we can't do things the way
<br>
&quot;common sense&quot; would dictate. And that's why the quantum world is so
<br>
weird.
