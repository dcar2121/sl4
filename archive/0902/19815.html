&nbsp;precludes them to share all the other properties (unless you assume all their particles in quantum entanglement, but this is precluded mainly by the uncertainty principle) they don't even are physically identical. This what you wrote in the last paragraph is kinda circular argument, and really does not make any point, in my humble opinion. There are two bodies in the room and two person, and this could easily be tested and proved.

&quot;Adtollite portas principes vestras 
Et elevamini portae aeternali 
Et introibit rex gloriae. 
Quis est iste rex gloriae?&quot; 
(Psalm 23(24):7–8a)
