<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; My claim is I think we should consider the expert

<em>&gt; This isn't clear. If it models how clouds change accurately enough I would

<em>&gt; Weather Watch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Think of neural nets. They don't have separate variables for separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures, and they don't have intelligible internal workings. But if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; train one well enough, it produces reasonable results without having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate variables that we have decided are good descriptors. Like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I want to be able to understand my models, but I don't think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligibility as an essential property of a model.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, an expert could extract an implicitly encoded temperature from
<br>
only images of clouds. Forrest Mims seems capable:
<br>
<a href="http://sunandsky.org/">http://sunandsky.org/</a>
<br>
<p>Yes, it is possible to build faithful models that have confusingly
<br>
different internal workings. (Of course, there is some explanation for
<br>
why the model is faithful. If we knew that explanation, then they
<br>
would be intelligible internal workings.)
<br>
<p>Lest we get confused, let me recap. We're talking about criteria for
<br>
how one might determine that an emulation is a faithful emulation.
<br>
<p>Dr. Mahoney pointed out that it might be possible to build a computer
<br>
program from only the public record that emulates a person
<br>
sufficiently well to convince their friends and family. My worry was
<br>
the claim that &quot;good enough to fool your friends and family&quot; was the
<br>
only, or primary, criterion for fidelity.
<br>
<p>The weather metaphor goes like this:
<br>
<p>wet weather : emulated weather :: wetware humans : emulated humans
<br>
<p>The point of making the weather metaphor was to claim that we wouldn't
<br>
use the &quot;friends and family criterion&quot; as the only, or primary,
<br>
criterion for whether to trust a weather simulation. We would also use
<br>
experts. If we're interested in simulating never-before-seen
<br>
situations such as extreme global warming, then the experts (at least
<br>
in the near term) need to see the construction in order to argue that
<br>
the results of the simulation are correct by construction.
<br>
<p>Johnicholas
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
<p>Though it might be possible to build a faithful emulation of a human
<br>
from only the public record, I don't think it's likely to happen soon.
<br>
Let me try to convince you of that, using two points:
<br>
1. A faithful emulation should act correctly even in quite extreme,
<br>
never-before-encountered situations. Your friends and family haven't
<br>
seen you in these situations, and lots of different behaviors would be
<br>
plausible.
<br>
2. A faithful emulation should enact firm plans and intentions that
<br>
you made immediately before uploading. Guessing those plans and
<br>
intentions based on the public record might be possible, but I think
<br>
it would be quite difficult.
