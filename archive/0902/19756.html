<p>
Stuart Armstrong has anticipated most of my points, but to reiterate:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly what would be competent to keep faster thinking humans under its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thumb?
</em><br>
Society as a whole, including other emulated humans. It is entirely
<br>
possible for inegalitarian societies to be stable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is to prevent them taking their brain power elsewhere or selling their talents for a much better price?
</em><br>
Being poor and worried for my continued existence, competing with a
<br>
large number of near-identical copies of myself for minimal wages
<br>
doesn't sound fun to me - even if I'm selling my brain power at the
<br>
best price available.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The owner of the substrate rules?
</em><br>
Yes. Access to the lowest levels of reality, the unsimulated levels,
<br>
is privileged. In a conflict between levels, &quot;low ground&quot; has a huge
<br>
advantage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What keeps that owner in business if in competition with smarter/faster intelligences?
</em><br>
Nothing. Therefore, the standard would collapse towards running more
<br>
copies of the most successful intelligences. If you're not the most
<br>
successful, then you may not have enough resources to continue
<br>
running. If you happen to be one of those most successful
<br>
intelligences, you can expect to become average when you
<br>
start competing with variants of yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A body can be enslaved.  It is much more difficult to enslave a mind and still get full productivity from it.
</em><br>
Some technologies centralize power, making inegalitarian societies
<br>
more likely. I think that uploading is a centralizing technology;
<br>
specifically, the &quot;low ground&quot; is centralizing. The economics
<br>
unpleasantnesses might be solvable with some sort of &quot;right to life,
<br>
liberty, pursuit of happiness&quot; extended to emulated humans. After all,
<br>
there aren't very many pure capitalist societies in the world now.
<br>
However, it would take coordinated action - politics.
<br>
<p>The existing political structure would be divided about rights for
<br>
emulated humans (for example, Matt Mahoney's objections). If emulated
<br>
humans were competing with unemulated humans economically (or were
<br>
projected to compete with unemulated humans) the opposition to rights
<br>
for emulated humans might well be fierce. Even if it were illegal,
<br>
there would be strong incentives to build a computer and exploit
<br>
workers quietly.
