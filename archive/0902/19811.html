&lt;<a href="mailto:randall@randallsquared.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploads%20coming%20first%20would%20be%20good,%20right?.">randall@randallsquared.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;if there are two, then they cannot be the same thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because then there would be ONE, not two.
</em><br>
<p>That sort of arithmetic works really well for nouns, but it doesn’t work
<br>
worth a damn for adjectives;
<br>
there may be two red cars but there is only one red and only one two.
<br>
Your third grade English 
<br>
teacher got it wrong, Randall Randall is an adjective.
<br>
<p>If you insist you are a noun then in a very short time you come to
<br>
absurd conclusions, like every atom in your body somehow has your name
<br>
scratched on it even though the scientific method can’t detect it, and
<br>
every single atom you ate or breathed in your entire life also just
<br>
happened to have your name on it, and for some unexplained reason every
<br>
atom you pissed out did not have you name scratched on it. The only
<br>
other alternative is to stop even pretending to be scientific and become
<br>
a Bible thumper. If you insist
<br>
you are a noun then you can be unscientific or antiscientific, there is
<br>
simply no other alternative.
<br>
<p>I am quite serious, if you take your ideas and the naïve ideas most
<br>
people have about these things as a premise then within an astonishingly
<br>
short chain of reasoning you run into absolute absurdities.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you separate them, and show one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the number 456783221 [blah blah]
</em><br>
<p>As I’ve pointed out 456,783,221 times over the years if you do that then
<br>
the two “identical” copies are no longer identical; one has a memory the
<br>
other does not have with an accompanied physical change in the brain.
