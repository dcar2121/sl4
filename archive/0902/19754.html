<em>&gt;&gt; There are more than one kind of risk. I would rate the risk of tragic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exploitation of the faster-thinking humans as higher than the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tragic exploitation of de novo AGI. The key word being &quot;tragic&quot;. Large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; numbers of really nice people working hard for small rewards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inegalitarian principles systematically built into the physics of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ems world. This seems moderately likely and significantly more tragic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than de novo AGI.

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly what would be competent to keep faster thinking humans under its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thumb?  What is to prevent them taking their brain power elsewhere or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selling their talents for a much better price?    The owner of the substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules?  What keeps that owner in business if in competition with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter/faster intelligences?  What keeps another would be owner from buying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them out if they prove too harsh and thus get less than stellar results form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the uploads?   A body can be enslaved.  It is much more difficult to enslave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mind and still get full productivity from it.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your point entirely. But it is possible that Johnicholas
<br>
is refering to exploitations of faster thinking humans by other faster
<br>
thinking humans. If a small batch of fast thinking humans get slightly
<br>
ahead of others, they might boost themselves forwards even more, and
<br>
possibly capture control of the substrat on which the faster thinking
<br>
humans are based. And then enslaving a mind would not be hard - the
<br>
top fast-humans could easily tell if one of their slaves is
<br>
malignering in their mental outputs.
<br>
<p>And if the gulf in intelligence is sufficiently wide, this slavery
<br>
could even become economically efficient - meaning there would be no
<br>
free market solution to it. As the top fast-humans are also likely to
<br>
capture political power, there would be effectively no solution at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>And as for normal humans... they would get entirely shafted.
