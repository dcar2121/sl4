<em>&gt; His teacher got it right. As Randall and I pointed out many times to you,

<em>&gt; anytime there are two things, they are different or otherwise they would be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to say, &quot;The rules of this Universe don't apply to me, which is why I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get away with saying 2=1.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>How many electrons are there?  One?  More than one?  how can you tell
<br>
them apart?  OK, the one on the left is different from the one on the
<br>
right?  Suppose I say I've rearranged their position, how do you
<br>
verify if I'm lying?  So are they different or are they one?
<br>
<p>I doubt discussing your state of existence as &quot;noun&quot; or &quot;adjective&quot; or
<br>
even &quot;verb&quot; makes any sense.  To say that any of us are an object IN
<br>
the universe or a property OF the universe is mostly just bickering
<br>
over nothing.
