This isn't clear. If it models how clouds change accurately enough I 
<br>
would assert that temperature is implicitly encoded into the model. And 
<br>
if it's accurate *enough*, then it might be a good local model of 
<br>
weather. And if it's accurate ENOUGH, then it might be a reasonable 
<br>
datafeed for your World Weather Watch.
<br>
<p>Think of neural nets. They don't have separate variables for separate 
<br>
measures, and they don't have intelligible internal workings. But if you 
<br>
train one well enough, it produces reasonable results without having the 
<br>
separate variables that we have decided are good descriptors. Like 
<br>
temperature.
<br>
<p>Personally, I want to be able to understand my models, but I don't think 
<br>
of intelligibility as an essential property of a model.
