Actually I do believe that I am conscious (because I am programmed that way) and I also believe that I am not conscious (because there would be absolutely no change in my behavior if I was). I realize that these two positions are inconsistent, and just leave it at that.

<p>Well that's no fun.  Why not try to understand this further and apply your findings to your life approach.   Being one who believes I am conscious (because I was programmed that way) and believes I am conscious (because I do think there would be a difference if I wasn't) I am curious why you avoid this problem.  It seems a man of logic and rigorous pursuit of &quot;truth&quot; or at  least &quot;high probability&quot; would not feel comfortable with this internal state.   Just curious.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Lucas.
