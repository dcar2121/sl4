On Thu, 5 Feb 2009 &quot;Mike Dougherty&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:msd001@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploads%20coming%20first%20would%20be%20good,%20right?.">msd001@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How many electrons are there?  One?  More than one?
</em><br>
<p>I never denied there were 2 bodies in that symmetrical room, but the
<br>
point is they are completely interchangeable with no way to even be sure
<br>
that a change had even happened. There is no change
<br>
objectively and there is no change subjectively. In that regard they are
<br>
just like electrons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how can you tell them apart?  OK, the one on the left is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from the one on the right?  Suppose I say I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rearranged their position, how do you verify if I'm lying?
</em><br>
<p>I can’t tell if you’re lying because I can’t tell them apart. The idea
<br>
was discovered by Liebniz
<br>
about 300 years ago and is called &quot;The Identity of Indiscernibles&quot;.
<br>
Until about 80 years ago it had
<br>
no practical implications because nobody could find two things that were
<br>
identical, but today it leads
<br>
to one of the foundations of modern physics, Exchange Forces. On the
<br>
Extropian List I used nothing but
<br>
The Identity of Indiscernibles and high school algebra to derive The
<br>
Pauli Exclusion Principle; and that is the root of chemistry, and that
<br>
is the root of biology. By the way I’m rather pleased with that
<br>
derivation.
<br>
<p>If you insist that identical things are not interchangeable then throw
<br>
all your physics and chemistry and biology books away, not to mention
<br>
logic.
