<p><em>&gt; you just poke your would-be exact copy. Thats it. 
</em><br>
<p>As both of you are identical you both decide to poke each other and both
<br>
receive a poke in the ribs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; all observers in the world may share the same belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are indeed the same person, based on their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions and on the fact that they share the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics. But this ignore the simple fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the person in question is an observer also, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DO NOT agree on the fact that they are the same person. 
</em><br>
<p>But they don’t disagree. You are the copy and are standing an equal
<br>
distance from the center of a cylindrically symmetrical room with the
<br>
original. I now use a Star Trek brand transporter to instantly exchange
<br>
your position with the original, or if you prefer I leave your bodies
<br>
alone and just exchange the two brains. There is no way subjectively you
<br>
or the original would notice that anything had happened,
<br>
and objective outside observers would not notice anything had happened
<br>
either. There would not even be a way to tell if the machine was
<br>
actually working, I could be lying about having a transporter. Who
<br>
cares? 
<br>
<p>If objectively it makes no difference and subjectively if makes no
<br>
difference then I can only conclude it  makes no difference. There are 2
<br>
bodies in that room but only one you.
