I find it hard to buy that quantum effects will not diverge two minds fairly
<br>
quickly, even if they are in a symmetrical room (Which as we've discussed
<br>
cannot be perfectly symmetrical in a real universe). There are two
<br>
possibilities-- either our brains are quantum computers or they're not. The
<br>
former possibility has no evidence aside from the odd circumstantial
<br>
observation, so we can ignore it. The latter possibility, that our brains do
<br>
not depend at all on any aspect of quantum mechanics and can be described in
<br>
purely classical terms I do take issue with. We require random input.
<br>
Thermodynamic &quot;noise&quot; is omnipresent. Quantum effects affect the precise
<br>
movements of thermodynamic noise in our brains. Even if our brain is
<br>
describable in classic terms, it is still a fairly chaotic system, and small
<br>
changes can affect things in a large way. Besides, add two beings into our
<br>
impossible symmetrical room, and a tiny divergence in motion for example
<br>
will, if the two entities are looking at each other, for example, lead to a
<br>
large discrepancy in input quite quickly-- even if the thermodynamic
<br>
background noise causes our hand to twitch slightly differently, this will
<br>
cause a rapid divergence in input. Especially when the two entities
<br>
communicate. You can't divorce the classical from the quantum.
<br>
<p>Your statement about being reborn a million times a nanosecond is, I'm
<br>
assuming, tongue in cheek. Its the information structure that is important
<br>
(I might even be tempted to say that information is all that exists, but I'm
<br>
not claiming that per se). The information structure doesnt change since you
<br>
can't destroy information. This isn't an essentialist argument, I'm not
<br>
trying to describes the boundaries of a given living entity, but seeing it
<br>
in terms of information might be an interesting approach to try (Hofstadter,
<br>
has an interesting beginnings of such a framework).

<em>&gt; Chaos is an interesting phenomenon but it does no apply to all complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things; generally small changes in starting conditions change one pseudo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random pattern into a very different pseudo random pattern. It is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less a factor if logic is involved and probably intelligence in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, calculating the first million digits of Pi is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex, and if just one digit in the sequence is wrong subsequent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digits will be wrong too, but 2 computers will almost always produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exact same sequence even if they operated at slightly different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperatures or even if they were made by different manufactures. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to believe that if a nat farted in your third grade classroom you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have a different political philosophy today; I think it would take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very long time for chaos alone to make minds diverge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if you insist that for you to survive every atom in your body must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be identical down to the quantum level and every particle in those atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be entangled in just the same way then you die and a new being is born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a million times a nanosecond. That really doesn't seem like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruitful way to look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter to me.
