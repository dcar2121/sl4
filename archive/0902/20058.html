<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My claim is I think we should consider the expert

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This isn't clear. If it models how clouds change accurately enough I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; assert that temperature is implicitly encoded into the model. And if it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accurate *enough*, then it might be a good local model of weather. And if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it's accurate ENOUGH, then it might be a reasonable datafeed for your World
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Weather Watch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Think of neural nets. They don't have separate variables for separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; measures, and they don't have intelligible internal workings. But if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; train one well enough, it produces reasonable results without having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; separate variables that we have decided are good descriptors. Like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; temperature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Personally, I want to be able to understand my models, but I don't think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligibility as an essential property of a model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, an expert could extract an implicitly encoded temperature from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only images of clouds. Forrest Mims seems capable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sunandsky.org/">http://sunandsky.org/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is possible to build faithful models that have confusingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different internal workings. (Of course, there is some explanation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the model is faithful. If we knew that explanation, then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be intelligible internal workings.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lest we get confused, let me recap. We're talking about criteria for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how one might determine that an emulation is a faithful emulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Mahoney pointed out that it might be possible to build a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program from only the public record that emulates a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently well to convince their friends and family. My worry was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the claim that &quot;good enough to fool your friends and family&quot; was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only, or primary, criterion for fidelity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The weather metaphor goes like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wet weather : emulated weather :: wetware humans : emulated humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point of making the weather metaphor was to claim that we wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the &quot;friends and family criterion&quot; as the only, or primary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criterion for whether to trust a weather simulation. We would also use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts. If we're interested in simulating never-before-seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations such as extreme global warming, then the experts (at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the near term) need to see the construction in order to argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the results of the simulation are correct by construction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Johnicholas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though it might be possible to build a faithful emulation of a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from only the public record, I don't think it's likely to happen soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me try to convince you of that, using two points:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. A faithful emulation should act correctly even in quite extreme,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never-before-encountered situations. Your friends and family haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen you in these situations, and lots of different behaviors would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. A faithful emulation should enact firm plans and intentions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you made immediately before uploading. Guessing those plans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentions based on the public record might be possible, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be quite difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
The problem is, basically, that the public record isn't complete 
<br>
enough.  E.g., it's quite possible that model based on clouds appearance 
<br>
would need to model the internal appearance of the clouds to allow 
<br>
accurate projections.  And it's quite probable that any such model would 
<br>
be a lot more computation intensive than one based on a higher level 
<br>
understanding, and explicitly including such things as temperature.
<br>
<p>The problem with your analogy is:  What is the equivalent of looking at 
<br>
the model and deciding that one needs to turn up the thermostat this 
<br>
evening?  I.e., if it's a good weather model, then there is an 
<br>
isomorphism between levels.
<br>
<p>I suppose the question is, basically, are two things which are 
<br>
canonically isomorphic not actually the same thing?  If they are, then 
<br>
the upload IS the person.     Though in that case it becomes a question 
<br>
as to exactly how much of a person needs to be captured.  E.g., is a 
<br>
structure isomorphic to the retina required, or merely something that 
<br>
will appropriately stimulate a simulation of the optic nerves? But how 
<br>
much can you peel off in the name of efficiency and still have the same 
<br>
valid person?
<br>
<p>I tend to believe that canonically isomorphic entities are merely 
<br>
different views of the same underlying entity.  But canonically 
<br>
isomorphic is a very high barrier, and one that's probably unreachable 
<br>
in practice.  So the question becomes &quot;How great a deviation is 
<br>
allowable without considering the entity to be a new person?&quot;
