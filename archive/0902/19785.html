<p>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Ethical, desirable, good: that which increases your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Lutility according to a function inherited from your parents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The utility function has many other aspects to it, far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; beyond parental inheritance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What aspect of your utility/ethics did you decide for yourself, not influenced by your DNA or your childhood upbringing?
</em><br>
<p>Economics, scientific methods, and a whole lot of books shaped my
<br>
thinking in different directions to what my DNA and childhood
<br>
upbringing were pointing. Of course these ideas were &quot;influenced&quot; by
<br>
those other factors, but in such a weak way as to be nearly
<br>
meaningless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you distinguish what is &quot;right&quot; from what you believe is right?
</em><br>
<p>I think your question is meaningless. What do you mean by &quot;right&quot;? You
<br>
seem to be claiming there exists some universal standard of &quot;right&quot;
<br>
that is independent of whether anyone believes in it; fine then, what
<br>
is it? Have you ever been in a situation where you said &quot;most people
<br>
believe that guy did the right thing; I also believed that, and still
<br>
believe it now; however, it was actually the &quot;wrong&quot; thing to do&quot;?
<br>
<p>Put more succinctly, you are asking me how I distinguish between
<br>
something that exists (what I believe is right) from something that
<br>
doesn't (this strange &quot;right&quot;). The distinction is simple: one exists,
<br>
the other doesn't.
<br>
<p>Now, if you're asking how do my conceptions of right change over time
<br>
and my interactations with the world, and whether some concepts are
<br>
more suited to the real world than others, then that is a fascinating
<br>
question, worthy of (several) discussions of its own.
<br>
<p>Stuart
