<em>&gt; &gt; On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Extropian List I used nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Identity of Indiscernibles and high school algebra to derive The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Pauli Exclusion Principle; and that is the root of chemistry, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the root of biology. By the way I'm rather pleased with that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; derivation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds rather impressive - do you still have the derivation? And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions do you put into it - basically how did you distinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bosons (which don't obey the exclusion principle) from fermions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indiscernibles wouldn't be enough.
</em><br>
=========================================
<br>
<em>&gt;From my post to the Extropian list:
</em><br>
<p>In about 1690 the philosopher Leibniz discovered something called &quot;The
<br>
Identity Of Indiscernibles&quot;. He said that things that you can measure
<br>
are
<br>
what's important, and if there is no way to find a difference between
<br>
two
<br>
things then they are identical and switching the position of the objects
<br>
does not change the physical state of the system.
<br>
<p>Leibniz's idea turned out to be very practical, although until the 20th
<br>
century nobody realized it, before that his idea had no observable
<br>
consequences because nobody could find two things that were exactly
<br>
alike. Things changed dramatically when it was discovered
<br>
that atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.
<br>
<p>By using The Identity Of Indiscernibles you can deduce one of the
<br>
foundations of modern physics the fact that there must be two classes of
<br>
particles, bosons like photons and  fermions like electrons, and from 
<br>
there
<br>
you can deduce The Pauli Exclusion Principle, and that is the basis
<br>
of the periodic table of elements, and that is the basis of chemistry, 
<br>
and
<br>
that is the basis of life. If The Identity Of Indiscernibles is wrong
<br>
then
<br>
this entire chain breaks down and you can throw Science into the trash
<br>
can.
<br>
<p>The Schrödinger Wave Equation proved to be enormously  useful in
<br>
accurately
<br>
predicting the results of experiments, and as the name implies it's an
<br>
equation describing the movement of a wave, but embarrassingly it was
<br>
not at
<br>
all clear what it was talking about.
<br>
<p>Exactly what was waving? Schrödinger thought it was a matter wave, but
<br>
that didn't seem right to Max Born. Born reasoned that matter is not
<br>
smeared
<br>
around, only the probability of finding it is. Born was correct,
<br>
whenever an
<br>
electron is detected it always acts like a particle, it makes a dot when
<br>
it
<br>
hit's a phosphorus screen not a smudge, however the probability of
<br>
finding
<br>
that electron does act like a wave so you can't be certain exactly
<br>
where that dot will be. Born showed that it's the square of the wave
<br>
equation that describes the probability, the wave equation itself is
<br>
sort of
<br>
a useful mathematical fiction, like lines of longitude and latitude,
<br>
because
<br>
experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a
<br>
particle, we can only measure the intensity (square) of the wave
<br>
function
<br>
[F(x)]^2 because that's a probability and probability we can measure.
<br>
<p>Let's consider a very simple system with lots of space but only 2
<br>
particles
<br>
in it.  P(x) is the probability of finding two particles x distance
<br>
apart,
<br>
and we know that probability is the square of the wave function,
<br>
so P(x) =[F(x)]^2. Now let's exchange the position of the particles in
<br>
the system, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x but  is
<br>
now x2 - x1 = -x.
<br>
<p>The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the two particles
<br>
are
<br>
the same, no measurable change has been made, no change in probability,
<br>
so
<br>
P(x) = P(-x). Probability is just the square of the wave function so
<br>
[ F(x) ]^2 = [F(-x)]^2 . From this we can tell that the Quantum
<br>
wave function can be  either an even function, F(x) = +F(-x), or an odd
<br>
function, F(x) = -F(-x). Either type of function would work in our
<br>
probability equation because the square of minus 1 is equal to the
<br>
square
<br>
of plus 1. It turns out both solutions have physical significance,
<br>
particles
<br>
with integer spin, bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half
<br>
integer spin, fermions, have odd wave functions.
<br>
<p>We MUST assume that atoms are interchangeable and have no individuality
<br>
or
<br>
modern Physics becomes incomprehensible. If we put two fermions like
<br>
electrons in the same place then the distance between them, x , is zero
<br>
and
<br>
because they must follow the laws of odd wave functions, F(0) = -F(0),
<br>
but
<br>
the only number that is it's own negative is zero so F(0)=0 .
<br>
<p>What this means is that the wave function F(x) goes to zero so of
<br>
course  [F(x)]^2 goes to zero, thus the probability of finding two
<br>
electrons
<br>
in the same spot is zero, and that is The Pauli Exclusion Principle. Two
<br>
identical bosons, like photons of light, can sit on top of each other
<br>
but
<br>
not so for fermions, The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells us that 2
<br>
identical
<br>
electrons can not be in the same orbit in an atom.
<br>
<p>If we didn't know that then we wouldn't understand Chemistry, we
<br>
wouldn't
<br>
know why matter is rigid and not infinitely compressible, and if we
<br>
didn't
<br>
know that atoms are interchangeable we wouldn't understand any of that.
<br>
<p>Bottom line: Atoms have no individuality and If they can't even give
<br>
themselves this property they can't give it to us.
