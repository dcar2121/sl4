<em>&gt; Suppose for US$100 you can buy a ticket that will instantly take you any place in the world. You have done this hundreds of times without incident. Now a new option is available. For an extra fee, you are offered the &quot;painless&quot; option, where the booth is filled with a narcotic knockout gas before you are slowly* crushed to death over a 24 hour period behind soundproofed walls. What is the maximum amount you would pay for this option?

<p>haha... Interesting that the standard fare is instantaneous
<br>
crush-to-death, and for an extra fee I can have the slow
<br>
crush-to-death.
<br>
<p>If my non-self hasn't been bothered by the 100 previous
<br>
clone-crushings, why pay more now?  If the situation is reversed so
<br>
the slow crush-to-death were cheaper, everyone would opt for the
<br>
better value.  Taken to an extreme, the best-value version of
<br>
teleportation probably wouldn't even bother to crush the unteleported
<br>
- you'd just be returned to the street and forced to accept that
<br>
teleportation just doesn't work.  Hey, wait a minute....
