As I mentioned in *this &lt;<a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0902/19805.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0902/19805.html</a>&gt;* thread
<br>
i think an AGI with hardcoded dogmatic rules will have some serious
<br>
drawbacks in the long run. I will try to show an alternative here, that
<br>
still will remain
<br>
friendly to humans.
<br>
<p>I base this on previous work with AIs in gaming theory such as the tit for
<br>
tat tournaments &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Note that the ideas below are rough outlines and that my programming skills
<br>
are rudimentary.
<br>
(Cognivitive-behavioural theory is my field.) My reason for posting this is
<br>
that you hopefully will point out problems/faults that I havent noticed
<br>
myself, and maybe even refer me to similar work that's already been done.
<br>
<p>Now lets start with a lot of simple Ais (semirandom neural networks) in a 2
<br>
dimensional virtual landscape, arranged like a checkerboard (but a lot more
<br>
squares) where each ai take up one randomly assigned slot and can move one
<br>
step at a time in any of the eight directions (like the king in chess).
<br>
The Ais are able to move around freely and detect if they get close to
<br>
another AI. Each AI also has zero points from the start.
<br>
<p>Input channels: direction and distance to nearby Ais, detecting output from
<br>
adjacent Ais, change of current points. They will also be able to recognize
<br>
and remember each individual AI.
<br>
Output channels: movement command, some kind of output, binary string will
<br>
be sufficient.
<br>
<p>Rough outline of points:
<br>
<p>Using a certain amount of cpu will cost 1 point. (To avoid slowing down the
<br>
whole system unnecessarily with meaningless loops.)
<br>
Creating output will cost 10 points.
<br>
<p>Detecting output from adjacent Ais: will give a lot of points 1st time its
<br>
detected from every individual AI, but will decrease rapidly if detected
<br>
from the same AI several times.
<br>
Say 1000 points for the first time, 100 second,10 3rd and 0 for the fourth
<br>
time. The points received will increase by 1 point per turn that no input is
<br>
received from that particular AI.
<br>
<p>Let's take the 10% that reach 100 000 points first and make 10 new versions
<br>
of each with slight variations(through some kind of genetic algorithm). Then
<br>
repeat the experiment for a few generations.
<br>
<p>A behaviour similar to the winners of the tit for tat tournaments can be
<br>
expected to develop.
<br>
It is important that similar rewardsystems are kept throughout the
<br>
development (ie you earn a lot from recieving and only loose a little from
<br>
giving).
<br>
<p>After a while the Ais can be expanded to be more complex and criterias for
<br>
points can be tougher both socially (partial imitation (which is the
<br>
simplest form of empathy behaviouristically speaking),
<br>
linguistically(greeting phrases, farewell phrases, eventually learning
<br>
speech) and spatially (ability to navigate around obstacles and through
<br>
labyrinths, adding more dimensions, manipulating objects etc.)
<br>
<p>When the tasks differs in this way, one thing will remain constant - the AIs
<br>
that keep on doing what they do when they get points will prosper and a
<br>
mechanism for encouragement/happiness has been implemented.
<br>
<p>Eventually it might be possible to introduce them into a virtual world like
<br>
second life and evolve more complex rating systems (ie ratings by human
<br>
avatars, moneys earned, objecs created). After that, anything would be
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>The whole point of this venture is that I believe it will result in a
<br>
social AI that intuitively reacts and thinks in the same way that we do.
<br>
<p>Im looking forward to your criticism.
