Yes, but its not an equivalent problem.
<br>
<p>two one bits are not two hydrogen atoms.
<br>
<p>Two one bits can be thought of as equivalent because they're simply
<br>
abstractions. (unless we want to try to say that the 1 bits that I just read
<br>
in your string of binary digits are both represented by a specific physical
<br>
configuration in my brain somehow-- in which case no, the two one bits are
<br>
not the same). If we want to say that the two hydrogen atoms are also
<br>
abstractions, that would be true, but then we run into circularity problems
<br>
when we say that they're all the same.
<br>
<p>Two hydrogen atoms are similar but not the same at a quantum level.
<br>
<p>I might even take it further and say that its not altogether clear if a
<br>
hydrogen atom exists as a singular discrete entity independently, or if we
<br>
just clasiffy it as a discrete entity due to the way we conceptualize the
<br>
universe. Case in point, I drank a cup of coffee yesterday morning. I also
<br>
drank a cup of coffee the morning before. I dont think however that both
<br>
mornings are equivalent-- one was a friday and I was at work, one was a
<br>
saturday and I wasn't. They are of course both technically mornings I
<br>
suppose.  The point is though that someone who speaks a language other than
<br>
english and lives in a culture that conceptualizes days differently may not
<br>
separate days into mornings, afternoons, and evenings.  --- It may make
<br>
sense to treat all hydrogen atoms as roughly analogous-- but we only do so
<br>
because we care about things like chemistry (though there are isotopes...).
<br>
If we cared more about quantum states for example, lumping all hydrogen
<br>
atoms into a single category may not be the maximally descriptive.
<br>
<p>If we are saying a hydrogen atoms is a hydrogen atom therefore they're the
<br>
same-- it is a valid but circular argument. I'm just pointing out that this
<br>
is never the case in the actual universe. If we are talking about a
<br>
simulated symmetrical room, then yes, its possible that two entities are
<br>
qualitatively identical in the physics of the simulation itself (but their
<br>
representation in the simulating material will NOT be identical for the same
<br>
reason that the two 1 bits I mentioned above are not the same in my brain).
