<p><em>&gt; We both agree that quantum procedures interact with

<br>
No we don’t agree on that. If quantum uncertainty and chaos interacted
<br>
with computers “all the time” the machines would be useless because even
<br>
with identical input you’d get different output all the time; if you
<br>
want random output there is no need to go to all the trouble of making
<br>
an electronic computer, a roulette wheel will work fine.
<br>
<p>Yes there are some complex systems, like the weather, where the flap of
<br>
a butterfly’s wings could cause a tornado a year later, but computers
<br>
were designed not to be that sensitive or they wouldn’t be much good for
<br>
anything; evolution must have done the same thing with our brains of
<br>
they wouldn’t be much good either.
<br>

Me:
<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; now even the room must be quantum perfect?!
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes 
</em><br>
<p>So even though the being’s senses are too course to see any difference
<br>
in the room if there is any difference in the room at all the being will
<br>
be different even though he sees no difference, hears no difference,
<br>
smells no difference, tastes no difference and feels no different. Now
<br>
you really are talking voodoo; and I don’t believe the above reasoning
<br>
is why you deduced the two are different, rather you decided the two are
<br>
different and then looked for a reason to defend your opinion. I think
<br>
it must be so because the reasons you give are so weak they wouldn’t
<br>
convince anyone unless they already believed it.
