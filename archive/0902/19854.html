<p><em>&gt; Fine then. When I drink coffee, I am slightly different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't normally matter, as there isn't someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else around to take over my identity.
</em><br>
<p>Take over my identity? I have no idea what that means. The only thing
<br>
you should be concerned about is whether tomorrow there will be a being
<br>
who remembers being Stuart Armstrong of today. If there is such a being
<br>
then you’ve survived for another day, if there is more than one who has
<br>
that memory then lucky you, all the better. If nobody at all remembers
<br>
being you today then you’re dead.
<br>
<p>If tomorrow a copy of you is made then there would be 2 bodies but still
<br>
only one Stuart Armstrong. After many many trillions of Plank time units
<br>
(not just one I think) it’s true you will start to diverge from your
<br>
copy and the two of you would no longer be the same person, but you’d
<br>
both still be the Stuart Armstrong of today because you’d both remember
<br>
being him. What’s so hard to understand about that? And what’s so
<br>
controversial?
<br>
<p>I don’t claim to be saying anything profound, it’s bloody obvious. The
<br>
most difficult part of these arguments is just getting the grammar
<br>
right, the English language really wasn’t meant for this sort of stuff.
