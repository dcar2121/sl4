<em>&gt; The problem is, basically, that the public record isn't complete enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  E.g., it's quite possible that model based on clouds appearance would need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to model the internal appearance of the clouds to allow accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projections.  And it's quite probable that any such model would be a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more computation intensive than one based on a higher level understanding,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and explicitly including such things as temperature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with your analogy is:  What is the equivalent of looking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model and deciding that one needs to turn up the thermostat this evening?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I.e., if it's a good weather model, then there is an isomorphism between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose the question is, basically, are two things which are canonically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isomorphic not actually the same thing?  If they are, then the upload IS the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.     Though in that case it becomes a question as to exactly how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a person needs to be captured.  E.g., is a structure isomorphic to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retina required, or merely something that will appropriately stimulate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation of the optic nerves? But how much can you peel off in the name of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency and still have the same valid person?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to believe that canonically isomorphic entities are merely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views of the same underlying entity.  But canonically isomorphic is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high barrier, and one that's probably unreachable in practice.  So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question becomes &quot;How great a deviation is allowable without considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity to be a new person?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In weather modeling, you only care about precision of predictions,
<br>
while in person modeling you don't care about precision per se. A
<br>
model can be a person, and &quot;the same&quot; person, without being a very
<br>
accurate down-to-the-tiny-details copy. If a person is slightly drunk,
<br>
haven't slept for 24 hours and got a micro stroke that got him forget
<br>
where he put his keys, it's still the same person. If that damaged
<br>
person somehow recovers, becoming different from before but as removed
<br>
from damaged version as was the undamaged original, it's still
<br>
essentially the same person. You care about caring about that person
<br>
(maybe it's yourself), not about pointless precision. To the extent of
<br>
not forgetting to include this difference in the analogy, the analogy
<br>
holds.
