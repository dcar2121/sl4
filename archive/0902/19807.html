In fact, this is true even of classical information if we assume that we
<br>
have a true state independant of being observed.

<em>&gt;&gt; OK.  Let me try again in different words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Me&quot; is those things I can exert control over.  When I drive, the car is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; part of me.  This is (more or less) confirmed by brain scans.  When a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chimpanzee uses a tool, it sees that tool as a part of itself.  In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sense, my near future is also a part of me.  I can control what's going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happen (to some reasonable extent).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Mine is those things I claim the right to exert control over (to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extent).  (My wife would certainly question my right to exert very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; control.  So would my dog, though to a lesser extent.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Who I am is not an all-or-nothing kind of relation.  My hand remains my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hand, even if I loose it in an accident.  If I'm lucky and quick it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reattached.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Therefore, position the &quot;transporter&quot; as described, I (present) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; decline to use it because I don't want to be tortured to death.  And, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; described, the I before transmission would, indeed, be tortured to death,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even though an I would survive that did not experience that.  At the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; after the &quot;transport&quot; has occurred, the two entities have become separate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  They no longer experience each other as indistinguishable.  However, before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the transport they were indistinguishable, due to identity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In the brain scans of animals (and to a much lesser extent of people)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tests show that during the use of a tool, the tool is considered a part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the body.  When you feel with a stick, you are feeling with the stick, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with your fingers.  Because that's how the brain records it.  At that point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the stick is indistinguishable from you.  When you drop it, you also drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the connection.  Then it is seen as separate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There's nothing mysterious about it, though I may have explained things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; poorly.  It's a function of how and what the brain (i.e., the mind operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; within the brain) records the stimuli.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at 'indistinguishable'? in any case, I can't be safe to assume that

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Concepts are definitions, following regularities in the world, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; humans assign (context-sensitive) instrumental utility to the concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; according to role of those regularities in overall structure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; world, from the contexts in which the concepts apply. When we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about &quot;me&quot;, there is instrumental utility attached, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; instrumental utility won't translate well to different regularities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; or to different contexts in which this regularity is placed. I say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;instrumental&quot; in the sense of being a component in representation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the utility over whole timelines, even though things marked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; instrumental this way may be seen as terminal values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the core properties of the concept &quot;me&quot; is that it's singular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (at any time). When the concept changes to accommodate the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of multiple people, so should its instrumental utility. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; follow that when there are multiple identical people, each of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; as valuable from your or anyone's perspective as the single original.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe so, maybe not, but no easy answer. We don't need the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding of &quot;me&quot;, &quot;me&quot; doesn't apply. We need the understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of values, as applied to the discussed context.
