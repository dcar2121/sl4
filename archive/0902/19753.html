<p>Exactly what would be competent to keep faster thinking humans under its 
<br>
thumb?  What is to prevent them taking their brain power elsewhere or 
<br>
selling their talents for a much better price?    The owner of the 
<br>
substrate rules?  What keeps that owner in business if in competition 
<br>
with smarter/faster intelligences?  What keeps another would be owner 
<br>
from buying them out if they prove too harsh and thus get less than 
<br>
stellar results form the uploads?   A body can be enslaved.  It is much 
<br>
more difficult to enslave a mind and still get full productivity from it.
