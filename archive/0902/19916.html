<em>&gt;&gt; You imply that people who advocate uploading technologies would put a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perfectly viable human into a &quot;recycling vat&quot; (presumed fatal). This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is a red herring and a straw man. Some people are advocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; destructive uploading technologies. However, the people who advocate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; uploading technologies would agree; a non-destructive scan followed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; murder of the person scanned is reprehensible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The actual scenario looks more like this: Due to illness and/or old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; age, someone is destructively uploaded. They are frozen and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sliced thinly in order for the scanning process to take place. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; isn't a non-destructive technology available, nor does this process,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in course of operation, produce any viable physical human who is then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; murdered.
</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what manner must you die in order for your consciousness to successfully transfer to a machine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I invite Dr. Mahoney to state explicitly: &quot;It is wrong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; murder, enslave, or torture humans. It is also wrong to murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enslave, or torture entities which are very structurally similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humans, even if they are technically mutually infertile and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a different species.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First answer the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. At what point after conception does life begin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Life is always present.  Sentience, however, is not.
<br>
<em>&gt; 2. Under what conditions is capital punishment justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
When, in the overwhelming judgement of society, every feasible 
<br>
alternative is worse.  You can't justify it based upon what an entity 
<br>
may have done, only upon what it may reasonably be predicted to do in 
<br>
the future.  Guilt is a useful rule of thumb, but no more.
<br>
<em>&gt; 3. Under what conditions is euthanasia justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
When, in the judgement of the entity involved, every feasible 
<br>
alternative is worse.  This is tricky when the entity is persistently 
<br>
unconscious, but that should still be the test.  The problem then is 
<br>
guessing what said entity would decide, and the large degree of 
<br>
uncertainty inherent in such a decision.
<br>
<em>&gt; 4. Which species besides humans should be protected from murder, enslavement, and torture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Here one needs to carefully define the terms.  All species should be 
<br>
protected from torture.  The other terms... I need careful definition.  
<br>
However, at minimum all sentient species should be protected from all of 
<br>
the above...to greater or lesser degree depending upon their degree of 
<br>
sentience.  Also depending on to what degree they could survive if not 
<br>
held captive.
<br>
<em>&gt; 5. What test must a program be able to pass to grant it human rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
The primary test would be that it should desire human rights.  I'm 
<br>
tempted to say &quot;And express that desire&quot;, but that would imply that if 
<br>
it were stopped from communicating, then it wouldn't deserve the rights, 
<br>
and that's invalid. 
<br>
<em>&gt; -- Matt Mahoney, <a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20'Ethical'%20uploading">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>
</em><br>
<p>That said, it's worth noting that the historical grounds for &quot;human 
<br>
rights&quot; is balance of power.  This is true in all cultures which I have 
<br>
studied.  People are given rights to the extent that they have the power 
<br>
to assert them, and to the extent that it is cheaper for the rulers to 
<br>
grant the rights than to oppress those demanding.  Notice the profound 
<br>
effect the closure of the frontier has had on the US stands towards 
<br>
human rights.  (This is an on-going process with rights increasingly 
<br>
devolving from the citizenry to those running powerful organizations.  
<br>
One can't any longer just leave when things get too bad.)
