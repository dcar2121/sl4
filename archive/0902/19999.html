There have been several references, including to the original
<br>
mechanical Turk, the Singularity and more recently to friendly AI or
<br>
&quot;moral&quot; AI (surprisingly motivated by other AI --another more advanced
<br>
Terminator-- that wants this robots to be enhanced). The show is quite
<br>
good from my point of view. Somehow informed at least. And behind the
<br>
explicit words there is also to think about: the &quot;good&quot; Terminator has
<br>
been developing more human behavior while interacting with this family
<br>
(Sarah and John Connor) after the Connor figured out how to unleash
<br>
the Terminator learning capabilities. There are even suggestions that
<br>
this &quot;good&quot; Terminator (which is a &quot;female&quot;) is &quot;getting in love&quot; with
<br>
John Connor, and the other way around as well, at least it seemed so
<br>
during the first season. As bizarre as that sounds the show has
<br>
managed to present it in a non-trivial somehow clever way. I am
<br>
basically following the show because of these regular flashes of
<br>
intellectual threads from the writers, something missing from most
<br>
(perhaps all) other Sci-FI mediocre TV shows I've seen related to AI
<br>
(e.g. the new Knight Rider which is just crap as most TV).
