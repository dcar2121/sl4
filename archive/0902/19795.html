</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Concepts are definitions, following regularities in the world, and
<br>
humans assign (context-sensitive) instrumental utility to the concepts
<br>
according to role of those regularities in overall structure of the
<br>
world, from the contexts in which the concepts apply. When we are
<br>
talking about &quot;me&quot;, there is instrumental utility attached, and this
<br>
instrumental utility won't translate well to different regularities,
<br>
or to different contexts in which this regularity is placed. I say
<br>
&quot;instrumental&quot; in the sense of being a component in representation of
<br>
the utility over whole timelines, even though things marked
<br>
instrumental this way may be seen as terminal values.
<br>
<p>One of the core properties of the concept &quot;me&quot; is that it's singular
<br>
(at any time). When the concept changes to accommodate the possibility
<br>
of multiple people, so should its instrumental utility. It doesn't
<br>
follow that when there are multiple identical people, each of them is
<br>
as valuable from your or anyone's perspective as the single original.
<br>
Maybe so, maybe not, but no easy answer. We don't need the
<br>
understanding of &quot;me&quot;, &quot;me&quot; doesn't apply. We need the understanding
<br>
of values, as applied to the discussed context.
