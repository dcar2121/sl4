<em>&gt; Let me make an analogy between mathematics and ethics. Many objects in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics (e.g. matroids, vector spaces, the natural numbers) have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many alternative axiomatizations. Foundations-of-mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers create and offer different possible systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zermelo-Frankel set theory is a powerful contender, but there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives that are argued to be more elegant, to be more relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mathematical intuition, or to avoid various confusing features.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the foundations are actively being worked on, does that instability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ripple upward into other mathematician's work? Do topologists say &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish those foundations researchers would quit changing the definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a vector space!&quot;? No. There is a social consensus of mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts. Axiomatizations that lead to a novel conclusion contradicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that consensus (e.g. &quot;1=0&quot;) are tossed out as unacceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The foundations of ethics and morality are not entirely pinned down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Philosophers publish papers in these areas all the time. Despite this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instability, we can make judgments like: &quot;It is right, correct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate, moral, and ethical to rescue a person from death by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oncoming train.&quot;. There is a social consensus of ethical judgments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just like the many alternative definitions of a vector space, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are many possible justifications for why it is appropriate to rescue a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person from death. You could justify it as an axiomatic moral duty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could justify it as useful to the continuance of the species, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you thought the continuance of the species was morally axiomatic. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could justify it as maximizing total happiness, if you thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was morally axiomatic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you are taking actions or advocating for actions you are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; APPLIED ethics, similar to the working mathematician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Should I (donate/volunteer/study neuroimaging) for the sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping to build 'upload' technology? Or should I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (donate/volunteer/study AGI) for the sake of helping to build Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI technology? What about the RepRap?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most stable justifications for these actions are commonsense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality from the social consensus, NOT foundational axioms of ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I call the associated failure mode in AI, following Stuart Russel [1],
<br>
&quot;premature mathematization&quot;, an analogy with infamous &quot;premature
<br>
optimization&quot;. One shouldn't start studying a concept completely
<br>
defined by its foundation, as you are not interested in foundation,
<br>
but rather in the problem that you are trying to solve, which given
<br>
foundation may fail to address. On the other hand, there are many
<br>
expressively complete foundations, modes of thinking about the
<br>
problems, that don't really limit what you can think about, what you
<br>
can model with them. They specify the fundamental rules of the game,
<br>
with which you can construct any game whatsoever. It may be useful to
<br>
study such rules and their consequences with precision, even if you
<br>
don't yet know how to apply them. And so we should study many
<br>
fundamental technical (mathematical) fields, even where we don't know
<br>
how to apply them to FAI.
