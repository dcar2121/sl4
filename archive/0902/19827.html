<p>I agree with you.  I rarely insist on anything.

<p>The physical position of two electrons might determine their
<br>
identities by storing this positional metadata outside the electrons
<br>
themselves.  I think this arbitrarily introduces complexity.
<br>
Electrons are identical, they are interchangeable, they affect
<br>
chemistry and biology equally well as any other electron.  If this
<br>
arbitrary additional information is applied to any single electron, it
<br>
would likely need to be applied to every electron.  In that case, the
<br>
electron becomes a fundamentally different entity.  If conversation
<br>
supposes that we can fundamentally alter the entities we are
<br>
discussing, how can we consistently agree on any point?  Discussing
<br>
&quot;identity&quot; as a scientific entity without first proving (and agreeing
<br>
to) basic assumptions is ... groundless and illogical?
