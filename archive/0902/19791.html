Read the rest of the paragraph.  (It's still attached.)  This, however, 
<br>
isn't a statement to be justified so much as a matter of definition.  
<br>
Certainly other definitions are possible, and some would even have 
<br>
equivalent utility.
<br>
<p>I'll agree that my definition doesn't help me decide who you are.  It 
<br>
presumed a stance of observation from within the model.  I.e., I am 
<br>
myself now, and two minutes from now I will be those sufficiently 
<br>
connected to myself by a consistent chain of events.  I can't say 
<br>
isomorphism at the quantum level, because it's not a one-to-one and onto 
<br>
mapping.  If I put a coin in a slot machine, then I'm both the 
<br>
individual two minutes from now who has lost the coin, and the other one 
<br>
who has won.  With different probability density.  When two minutes from 
<br>
now arrives I'll only be one of them.
