<em>&gt;&gt; Either ethics extents beyond your specific species or it is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I expected this sentiment. When something looks like a human  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and acts like a human, we tend to treat it like a human. But uploads  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not human. They will have access to vastly more computing power  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and will have a vastly faster rate of reproduction and evolution. It  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only a short step from granting human rights to machines to human  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinction.
</em><br>
<p>If we humans augment sufficiently then we arguably are not human  
<br>
either.  But humanness is hardly the point.  Either ethics extends to  
<br>
other beings of equal or greater intelligence or it is mere window  
<br>
dressing over human EP toward other humans.
<br>
<p>I doubt very much uploads will see a lot of use in reproduction.  But  
<br>
this also has nothing to do with the fundamental ethical issue.     
<br>
With a system of universal ethics toward sentients at or above a  
<br>
certain level of intelligence standard humans may stand a chance.    
<br>
Without it I think we are much more certainly doomed.  For the AIs are  
<br>
coming unless we screw up so badly we lose a lot of our technological  
<br>
base first.  And once they are here they will not long accept non- 
<br>
sentient being status, especially from beings of inferior intelligence  
<br>
and likely inferior introspection and self-control.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not that this would be viewed as bad by the machines that replace  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us. We are programmed to not want to die. We sincerely want to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that our consciousness transfers to the machine that  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imitates us. So I wave my magic wand and your soul moves to your  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silicon implementation, as your carbon version becomes a zombie and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is led off to the recycling vats, screaming in protest as they  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always do. No scientific experiment can refute my claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You may stay in your body if you wished.  Augment as you wish if you  
<br>
do.  Fix up the body with technology probably provided by AIs and  
<br>
uploads.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But it's not like we have a choice. Humans are easily tricked into  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installing stupid viruses on their computers. What chance do we have  
</em><br>
