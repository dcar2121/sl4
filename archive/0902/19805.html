<p>
I think it is valuable to specify models and make them concrete. Then
<br>
we can ask each other &quot;Are you using THIS mental model? How exactly
<br>
does your mental model differ?&quot;.
<br>
People might, with justification, criticize me for offering models
<br>
which are simplistic. However, I hope this message spurs people to
<br>
offer countermodels in a comparably concrete and specific format.
<br>
<p>1. Here is one model, which you might call &quot;constant capability
<br>
increase per effort&quot;.
<br>
There is one endogenous variable &quot;capability&quot; (c).
<br>
There is one exogenous variable &quot;effort&quot; (e).
<br>
There is one parameter, &quot;capability growth per effort&quot; (cpe).
<br>
The single equation is that the time derivative of capability is
<br>
proportional to effort (D[c]=e * cpe).
<br>
The story for this model is something like: &quot;Once upon a time, there
<br>
was an engineer, and she worked every day on her system. It gradually
<br>
got more and more capable.&quot;
<br>
<p>2. Here is a second model, which you might call &quot;constant capability
<br>
increase per capability&quot;.
<br>
There is one endogenous variable &quot;capability&quot; (c).
<br>
There is one parameter, &quot;capability growth per capability&quot; (cpc).
<br>
The single equation is that the time derivative of capability is
<br>
proportional to capability (D[c]=c * cpc).
<br>
The story for this model is something like: &quot;Once upon a time, a
<br>
system tried to improve itself. It became more and more capable, and
<br>
was able to improve itself faster and faster.&quot;
<br>
<p>3. Here is a third model, which you might call &quot;diminishing capability
<br>
increase per capability&quot;.
<br>
There is one endogenous variable &quot;capability&quot; (c).
<br>
There is one parameter, &quot;capability growth constant&quot; (cgc).
<br>
The single equation is that the time derivative of capability is
<br>
inversely proportional to capability (D[c]=cgc / c).
<br>
The story for this model is something like: &quot;Once upon a time, a
<br>
system tried to improve itself. It became more and more capable, but
<br>
each increment took more and more time.&quot;
<br>
<p>4. You can add the first two models together.
<br>
There is one endogenous variable &quot;capability&quot; (c).
<br>
There is one exogenous variable &quot;effort&quot; (e).
<br>
There are two parameters, &quot;capability growth per effort&quot; (cpe) and
<br>
&quot;capability growth per capability&quot; (cpc).
<br>
The single equation is that the time derivative of capability is the
<br>
sum of two components, one proportional to effort, and one
<br>
proportional to capability (D[c]=e * cpe + c * cpc).
<br>
The story for this model is something like: &quot;Once upon a time, there
<br>
was an engineer, and her system. They worked together on improving the
<br>
system's capabilities, and the system gradually got more and more
<br>
capable, until her improvements were eclipsed by its
<br>
self-improvements.&quot;
<br>
<p>5. You can add a threshold to get a model with linear engineering,
<br>
exponential growth, and a threshold (D[c]=e*cpe + (c&gt;ct?c*cpc:0)).
<br>
There is one endogenous variable &quot;capability&quot; (c).
<br>
There is one exogenous variable &quot;effort&quot; (e).
<br>
There are three parameters, &quot;capability growth per effort&quot; (cpe),
<br>
&quot;capability growth per capability&quot; (cpc), and &quot;capability threshold&quot;
<br>
(ct).
<br>
The single equation is that the time derivative of capability is the
<br>
sum of two components, one proportional to effort, and one which is
<br>
proportional to capability if capability is above the capability
<br>
theshold, and zero otherwise.
<br>
(I think this is what most AGI rhetoric uses.)
<br>
<p>6. This last one takes a bit of motivation. Suppose the system in
<br>
question has two parts, one which is modifiable by the system and one
<br>
which is not. The total capability of the system is a combination of
<br>
the two parts. But the combination is not a simple addition or
<br>
multiplication of figures of merit. Rather, the total capability of
<br>
the system is measured in &quot;speed&quot;, and each &quot;elementary cycle&quot; needs
<br>
to pass through both the modifiable part and the nonmodifiable part.
<br>
There is one endogenous variable &quot;modifiable part's speed&quot; (m).
<br>
There are two parameters, &quot;modifiable part's improvement per
<br>
capability&quot; (mpc), and &quot;nonmodifiable part's speed&quot; (n).
<br>
There are two equations:
<br>
The total capability of the system, the speed, is the inverse of the
<br>
sum of the inverses of the modifiable and nonmodifiable parts' speeds
<br>
(c = 1/((1/n)+(1/m))).
<br>
The time derivative of the modifiable part's speed is proportional to
<br>
the total capability (D[m]=mpc * c).
<br>
<p>Note: ALL of these are one-dimensional models. The world of
<br>
higher-dimensional models (e.g. separate capabilities for chess and
<br>
learning to learn) is entirely open.
