<em>&gt; &gt; That is a question about your belief in consciousness.

<em>&gt; I don't see how that follows.  Why couldn't they both be me?  I, in the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>How is making a copy of yourself and killing one of the copies any different than not making a copy in the first place?
<br>
<p>Yeah I know it seems different. You think you wouldn't step into a teleporter that you know will slowly crush you to death, but after you have done it hundreds of times you will overcome your fear and conclude there is no difference.
