<em>&gt; I'd actually have to disagree with that. This sounds like the old &quot;AI

<p>Second, surely in a conflict between one entity (A), and another
<br>
entity (B), there are various resources that would tip the conflict
<br>
toward one or another direction. Note that I'm being deliberately
<br>
ambiguous as to whether the entities are humans, emulated humans,
<br>
computer programs, or organizations.
<br>
<p>Intelligence and speed of thought are certainly resources that would
<br>
give an advantage to one side over another. Being &quot;lower&quot; would also
<br>
give an advantage.

<p><em>&gt; The risk of slavery to uploads comes from other uploads, not from

</em><br>
<p>As far as I can tell, it's entirely possible that we could have a
<br>
future society where there are a vast number of emulated humans, and
<br>
systematic discrimination against emulated humans. The day-to-day work
<br>
of enforcing the society's rules might be police, just like now.
<br>
Police could have &quot;low ground&quot; advantages like turning people off,
<br>
powerful surveillance, powerful censorship. Even if the individual
<br>
directly enforcing society's (discriminatory) rules is also emulated,
<br>
that doesn't mean that the society as a whole is unstable.
<br>
<p>Revolutions might occur, certainly. But there is no natural law that
<br>
says that truth, justice, and happiness prevail. We need to work
<br>
towards those things continuously. We cannot assume that they will
<br>
come along with new technology.
