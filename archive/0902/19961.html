</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sorry for being unclear. I was referring to the discussion you bring up
<br>
later on.
<br>
&quot;(Donating to Friendly AGI research) has a better (cost/benefit ratio).&quot; is
<br>
a descriptive sentence imo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Imho normative language(according to my defintion) doesnt have much use

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you underestimate the frequency of commonsense language like

</em><br>
<p><p>With your given example I cant see a big difference, since its not a very

charged message. It doesnt really matter if you use your normative question
<br>
or one of these which are more descriptive &quot;Do you want me to buy some
<br>
milk?&quot; or &quot;Are we out of milk?&quot; will both bring the bring a similar respone
<br>
both emotionally and contentwise.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; You make three claims about this &quot;descriptivization&quot; transformation:
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That was on purpose. In situations where it doesnt matter much its offcourse
<br>
better to go for the shortest answer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2. It will be less provocative -- Is this good? We're talking about

</em><br>
<p><p>Imo, yes definitely. Provocation makes people defensive. To change something

permanently its better to give insight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. It will have a higher chance of invoking change in the one you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The third point is the crucial one. Is the transformed normative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message, now grammatically descriptive, more persuasive than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original? I disagree, but I can respect your opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks :) Maybe i was too dogmatic and provocative in my first post.
<br>
There are situations where normative is better, for instance talking to
<br>
someone without the capability or wish to understand (for example to
<br>
children) or in situations where there isnt time for discussions (for
<br>
example at an emergency ward or during a military operation).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think if the group tends to avoid grammatically normative speech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it will drift towards more speculation and prediction and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about concrete actions that we might take now.
</em><br>
<p><p>Definitely, but when/if action starts it will be with a higher motivation
<br>
and last much longer.
<br>
<p>On this list I think we have the time to discuss and there isnt a need for
<br>
immediate action afaik, so I think descriptive will be better in this
<br>
context.
