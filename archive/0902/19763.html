<em>&gt; The first objection to slavery is that the coercive elements keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wages and conditions for slaves far below what they should be; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second objection is that these wages and conditions are appalling.
</em><br>
<p>Ludicrous and either cynical or certifiably naieve. A slave is used for
<br>
anything the owner deems fit, insofar
<br>
human rights considerations in the society would give a damn - and I have
<br>
very very little considerations in
<br>
human empathy in this area. In rome unsatisfying slaves were literally
<br>
killed as fertillizer or sacrifice. In
<br>
the US south they were used in dog fighting, i.e. entertainment. If slaves
<br>
are capable of suffering, the
<br>
device of suffering will be used as motivator. The mere suggestion that an
<br>
artificial and arbitrary contrivance
<br>
people called &quot;the free market&quot; does in any way act to lighten the plight in
<br>
the face deserves a glass of
<br>
ice water in the face. De factor large segments of the third world are
<br>
effectively slaves - they cant escape,
<br>
do not get anything close to adequate pay, are subject to horrid punishment
<br>
and can be mote or less
<br>
forced to work on dehumanizing or extremely dangerous work. In most cases
<br>
most humans in the
<br>
world today are worth less than animals.
<br>
<p>And the capacity to appreciate this in educated first world people pisses me
<br>
seriously off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It should be relatively easy to avoid the first problem in a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full of uploads - general free market paradigms should be easy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement and defend.
</em><br>
<p>No. No no and NO. As I see it right now, a society advanced enough to be
<br>
able to construct machines
<br>
complex enough to emulate uploads is able to arbitrarily create intelligent
<br>
as well as completely reliable
<br>
(something like sigma six) willing servants. In such a world there is ZERO
<br>
demand for uploads, which
<br>
may have their own ideas, may be subject to distraction, which may be
<br>
inefficient. This means that
<br>
a society with current economies and uploads produce either scarce acccess
<br>
to uploading (a portion of
<br>
people die because they do not have resources by which they can buy/earn
<br>
uploading) - or society
<br>
stratifies into uploads with ownership and uploads without. On the long run
<br>
this will either result in
<br>
largescale income redistrubution based on democratic rights (disenfrenchised
<br>
voters, either upload or
<br>
not, consistently voting to increase wellfare type laws) or the
<br>
extermination of the havenots by the haves.
<br>
<p>In the past those who owned could rebel. In a world where those who own can
<br>
create limitless robot
<br>
armies, those who do not own will die, period. UNLESS something radically
<br>
changes in human nature after
<br>
largescale uploading. I am not willing to bet on that. In the past
<br>
socialists could sabotage or strike or
<br>
vote in a leftist government to institute a wellfare state.
<br>
<p>Please let me know where my assumptions are uncertain and if you do, please
<br>
take the effort in making
<br>
absolutely clear why yours are certain, foolproof and utterly, UTTERLY safe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Much more disturbing would be if the economic value of standard humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dropped to near subsistence levels (quite likely to happen). Then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyday experience of standard humans would mimic slavey; this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively force all humans to upload in order to survive.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming uploading is cheap. I can also see billions frozen in cheap dewars,
<br>
with the flimsy excuse they
<br>
will be restored at some later time when resources allow. Maybe a
<br>
preliminary upload to a really big
<br>
USB device to be run when server space is available. Fat chance on either
<br>
happening.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That might be bad enough, but it could get worse - if the economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return on improving an upload is higher than uploading a standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, uploading may become unaffordable. (think of this as working at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sweatshop rather than living on the garbbage heap - but with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provisio that never ever will you or any of your descendants be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to aspire to more than working at the sweatshop).
</em><br>
<p>Some people right now, in Vietnam beg to have nice, comfortable sweatshops.
<br>
People there consider
<br>
sweatshops a rosy dream. That is the situation in a world where the poorest
<br>
can stumble along and if
<br>
they make grotesque authoritarian sacrifices can catch up over a generation
<br>
(China, Spore, etc) - In
<br>
the future that is considered plausible by people here - the richest
<br>
aglomerate increased wealth at a rate
<br>
thousands to xyzillions times faster than the poorest.
<br>
<p>In the distant human past we were limited by breeding rates. The tribe that
<br>
had a system that allowed them to
<br>
breed faster generally won.
<br>
<p>In the less distant past the human groups that could liberate sufficient
<br>
resources to have specialized careers
<br>
tended to winning the game. Societies with mathematicians, bankers,
<br>
soldiers, politicians were more effective
<br>
than societies with less so.
<br>
<p>In the not so distant past the human societies that could effectively
<br>
generate useful memes faster tended to
<br>
be the winners.
<br>
<p>We must AT ANY COST avoid drifting into a world where the winners in the
<br>
race are those who most effectively
<br>
rid themselves of the inefficient parts of the thinking, feeling population.
<br>
I will continue to accuse neocons,
<br>
many conservatives and comparable groups that PRECISELY THIS is what they
<br>
aim for - creating a selection
<br>
mechanism that marginalizes those in society that do not play ball, even if
<br>
the benefit of such atrocity is
<br>
marginal. I mean, if every citizen in the rich world [who could] would all
<br>
cough up a euro a day, hundreds of
<br>
millions in the third world wouldn't have to live on garbage belts, dreaming
<br>
in a stupor for the glorious heaven of
<br>
sweatshops. Yet Neocons (and assorted ideologies) are in the moral sewer to
<br>
consider these gaza-ites
<br>
potential threats to the security etc. - to be fenced in and humanely
<br>
disposed off, in proxy. I.e. you don't
<br>
shove em in incinerators, but &quot;reduce their access to resources they can use
<br>
in acts of terror&quot;. Such as
<br>
fertillizer. Medicine. Food. Machine parts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A rather obvious solution would be to implement simply enforceable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws making uploading universally available, but I'm interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at other alternatives, that do not involve effectively coerced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading.
</em><br>
<p>Let's start at creating a VERY robost system where people have inalienable
<br>
rights. All people. And then link
<br>
those inalienable rights to legal tools. And then allow all people, no
<br>
matter how despicable, access to guarantees.
<br>
I want a world where a somali can sue the community of nations to pay him a
<br>
basic income sufficient to lead
<br>
a life on par with the worst of rich societies --- medication, food, a
<br>
decent house, electricity, internet access,
<br>
clothing, safety, education, information and some entertainment. If that is
<br>
possible, and people reading this
<br>
article, then I will breathe with relief, for we are headed in the right
<br>
direction to making sure I am not ground
<br>
into computronium paste some time in the future because the demons of free
<br>
markets dictate it prudent.
<br>
<p>When every human has rights, we have hope. Right now YOU may be kicked out
<br>
by the pigs one day. In
<br>
other words, some time very soon you will be left dying prematurely because
<br>
of this whole authoritarian
<br>
efficiency rush we have been in for a few centuries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One interesting alternative is to look at modified utility functions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the value of an object is not only in its physical properties, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also in the manner in which it was constructed, then there may be hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for standard humans to continue to compete economically in an uploaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. We have some examples of this today - concerts (especially rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerts) where the performers do not do anything more than sing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual songs in a more noisy environment. Yet the joint experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing the actual performer makes this an economically viable set-up.
</em><br>
<p>Ridiculous. You are listening music or argueing levity when you should be
<br>
argueing life versus death. But
<br>
then again, you life in a rich nation and the pursor is arranging your place
<br>
in the lifeboats while you have a
<br>
brief moment listening to the band to ease your nerves about the titanic
<br>
hitting that awful terrorist iceberg.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, we have some fair-trade products. No matter how imperfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and distorting the whole system is, it is based around one significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact: people are willing to pay more for something based on how it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced. Can we harness this urge for uploads?
</em><br>
<p>There is no demand for anything an upload could ever hope to produce as soon
<br>
as those who have more
<br>
can churn out alternatives to working uploads faster. I am seeing a future
<br>
of extremely dilligent and extremely
<br>
functional C3POs pushing back the margins for less affluent citizens ever
<br>
further, untill someone comes to
<br>
switch off the light.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Compelling every upload to change their utility function would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unduly coercive; but there could be a posibility to subsidise or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage &quot;ethical uploads&quot;, which changes the uploads' utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions slightly so that they place greater economic value on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard human produced goods. Since we are working on the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that uploads' productivity will dwarf the possible economic output of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard humans, it would not take many of these &quot;ethical uploads&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure the viability of standard humans - and the competitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disadvantage of &quot;ethical uploads&quot; would be correspondingly small.
</em><br>
<p>The only utility function I am interested in, before any other, is a vote. A
<br>
vote enforced by all over all. This
<br>
is sacrilege to free market thinkers. But as opposed to free market
<br>
imbeciles, who are in it for only a bigger
<br>
plasma screen and tuition for their kids, I am interested in something far
<br>
more fundamental - the right and
<br>
power to say NO, and FUCK YOU for EVERY human being.... if the evolution of
<br>
society leads me to me
<br>
defaulting on the right to buy server cycles to run my upload. If people are
<br>
slowly and incrementally are
<br>
barred from that, billions will die soon after. And soon in subjective
<br>
upload time might be milliseconds.
