</em><br>
<em>&gt; you computer more than a simulated blizzard; if that was what you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting at then I agree.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe concrete examples are in order?
<br>
<p>Simulation A &quot;FINITE ELEMENT CLOUDS&quot;
<br>
Suppose this simulation predicts the temperature that the temperature
<br>
sensor will read, and the wind speed that the wind-speed sensor will
<br>
read, both accurately. However, people watching the simulation are not
<br>
fooled - they can tell the clouds are blurrier than real clouds.
<br>
<p>Simulation B &quot;ELIZA CLOUDS&quot;
<br>
Suppose this simulation is very pretty, and nonexperts cannot
<br>
distinguish between images of the simulation, and images of real sky.
<br>
However, it doesn't actually have any &quot;temperature&quot; variable inside of
<br>
it, driving the phenomenon, just a big database of how clouds look and
<br>
seem to change.
<br>
<p>My claim is I think we should consider the expert opinion that
<br>
&quot;there's no weather underneath&quot; as relevant in deciding whether to
<br>
base your global warming strategy on the simulation. The
<br>
&quot;indistinguishable in outward behavior to the non-expert eye&quot;
<br>
criterion isn't sufficient.
<br>
<p>Johnicholas
<br>
<p>P.S. Nesov also made a much better argument, more directly regarding
<br>
uploads which were changed by the process.
