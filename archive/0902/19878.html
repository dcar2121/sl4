They're two different issues.
<br>
I am going to be as simple and as succinct as possible:
<br>
<p>Given any arbitrary real-universe system, I posit that there is no other
<br>
real-universe system that is completely isomorphic down to an arbitrary
<br>
level of specificity. Specificity may include information such as
<br>
entanglement, quantum states, etc.
<br>
<p>1) For fermions, Pauli's exclusion principle essentially shows this, so I
<br>
dont know why we're quibbling about atoms. As I've said before, I'm not
<br>
stating there is something inherent in the atoms themselves that makes them
<br>
indistinguishable, only the information regarding their states. As I said in
<br>
my previous post, I mentioned that I operated under the assumption that it
<br>
was the teleportation of non-baryonic matter.
<br>
<p>2) For bosons, while they are, in principle, indistinguishable, my
<br>
contention with the thought experiment that started this discussion was that
<br>
any bosons in question in the thought experiment would still exist not by
<br>
themselves, but in relation to other particles, therefore factors such as
<br>
their vector, position, entangled state, (in fact I believe we ONLY need
<br>
entanglement here to differentiate their individual instantiation, but I'm
<br>
not completely certain) would provide an objective means of distinguishing
<br>
each one from each other.
<br>
<p>In theory we can talk about particles in isolation, but this is only an
<br>
abstraction. Abstractions fail when they do not encapsulate a relevant
<br>
feature of that which they abstract-- in this case, interaction with the
<br>
rest of the universe-- which is why I gave the caveat that while we may have
<br>
a complete isomorphism in a simulation or in an abstraction, that the
<br>
representation of the information in the substrate abstracting it (for
<br>
example, the electrons flowing through the cables in my computer that
<br>
display a 1 and a 0 on my screen) would still be distinguishable for the
<br>
above two reasons.

<em>&gt; &gt; That is incorrect. With complete information

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bullshit, and I didn't just give a thought experiment as an example, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed you an experiment that was actually performed in a lab and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described in one of the most highly regarded science publications on

<em>&gt; this planet. It described how an atom had been teleported over a

<em>&gt; distance of one meter; it demonstrated that nothing in the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method can discern any difference between it and the atom that existed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of a second ago one meter away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You remarked &quot;the atoms themselves weren't teleported&quot;, I guess you
