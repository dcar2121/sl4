Hello,

<em>&gt; (Trying to specify wisdom and implement wisdom capability is going to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricky for sure, but I suspect it's necessary too.)
</em><br>
<p>Wisdom = Experience + Knowledge.
<br>
<p>Knowledge = Information + Memory.
<br>
Experience = Chaordic Awareness + Selective Memory.
<br>
<p>Friendliness = Subjective Need + ???
<br>
<p>Defitinions are hard if we don't relate them to real-life experience.
<br>
<p><p>The most general definition I've found of intelligence:
<br>
<p>&quot;INTELLIGENCE is the Function -through context-related abilities- by
<br>
which existence tries to ensure the fulfillment of its needs.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>The limitations of intelligence should be viewed in the light of it 
<br>
being a &quot;structure&quot; rather than a &quot;system.&quot;
<br>
<p>Please note that SYSTEM and STRUCTURE are not the same, but
<br>
two of the sides of a triangle:
<br>
<p>1) Structure,
<br>
2) System,
<br>
3) Content.
<br>
<p>Systems deprive us of our freedom _by definition_ since systems are,
<br>
basically:
<br>
<p>&quot;The creation of the guidelines of behavior of things and organisms.&quot;
<br>
<p>Structures are more what we need in order to create a working AI (and a 
<br>
working society at large). Structure is:
<br>
<p>&quot;The creation of limits whithin which things and organisms can behave
<br>
freely.&quot;
<br>
<p>But neither structure nor content go a long way without &quot;CONTENT,&quot; the
<br>
third side of that triangle. Content is basically the &quot;reason d'etre&quot;
<br>
for the creation of systems or structures. And you can't have a system
<br>
without a structure, nor a structure without an inner system. Take one 
<br>
side out and you got a serious problem. And this doesn't mean
<br>
that either structure of system are &quot;wrong&quot; per se, rather, that each
<br>
have their purpose and that if you use one in place of the other
<br>
(believing, perhaps, that system and structure are the same thing),
<br>
you get &quot;wrong&quot; results in relation to the _intended_ content.
<br>
<p>&quot;Human Intelligence&quot; at large has three different kinds of intelligence 
<br>
of high order:
<br>
<p>1) Cognitive Intelligence.
<br>
2) Social Intelligence.
<br>
3) Emotional Intelligence.
<br>
<p>You may have people with high cognitive intelligence (130), but their 
<br>
social intelligence may be in the range of 40 9 ... :-) ... ), and their 
<br>
emotional intelligence around 80, which will make them very hard to be 
<br>
around with. &quot;Friendliness&quot; would necessarily have to take these kinds 
<br>
of intelligences in consideration. How do we develop each type? We know 
<br>
quite a bit about IQ, are starting to learn the importance of EQ, but SQ 
<br>
happens to be still a not very much considered area of human understanding.
<br>
<p>Just a side note about intuition, without necessarily entering the realm 
<br>
of ESP:
<br>
<p>&quot;INTUITION is the Ability by which organisms can become -through 
<br>
experience- aware of reality without knowledge or understanding.&quot;
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p><p>Leonardo Wild
<br>
PS: What kind of Social Intelligence can an AI develop to become a FAI? 
<br>
And what should it be friendly towards? What will it need to be &quot;friendly&quot;?
<br>
<p>A certain level of &quot;wisdom&quot;?
