The cost of processing power continues to drop at
<br>
a moderate pace.  Cost has dropped 13%
<br>
in the past seven months and by one third
<br>
in the past year.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I've been tracking the cost of a node in
<br>
a Beowulf-type cluster of commodity computers, where
<br>
the memory is kept at a ratio of 1 byte/flop/sec,
<br>
and storage is 100 bytes/flop/sec.  The best
<br>
cost/performance nodes I have found are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Date    $/Gflop/s
<br>
Nov 01  600
<br>
Jan 02  437
<br>
Mar 02  397
<br>
May 02  319
<br>
Aug 02  272
<br>
Oct 02  244
<br>
May 03  212
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Component prices are obtained from pricewatch.com,
<br>
including shipping but not sales tax.  Current
<br>
configuration is as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Case:       $19  Generic Mid-ATX w/300W power supply
<br>
Motherboard: 47  Biostar M7VIB
<br>
CPU:         59  AMD Athlon XP2000 (1.67 Ghz)
<br>
Memory:     149  4x512MB PC2100 DDR SDRAM
<br>
Storage:    185  100+120 GB EIDE internal Hard Disks
<br>
NIC:         12  4x10/100 Ethernet cards
<br>
Wiring:       4  4x6ft Cat 5 cables w/RJ45 connectors
<br>
Hub:         12  1/3x12 port hub
<br>
<p>Total      $487/node
<br>
<p>AMD processors when used efficiently perform 1.375
<br>
Flop/Hz (3 FPUs @ 2 cycles per calculation -
<br>
overhead), which makes the calculation:
<br>
<p>$487 / (1.67 GHz * 1.375 Flop/Hz) = $212/Gflop/s
<br>
<p>If optimistic estimates of the required computer
<br>
power for human-level AI are correct at 100 TFlop/s,
<br>
it presently costs $21.2M to buy a human's worth
<br>
of computers.  Note that the Red Storm supercomputer
<br>
announced last year will have a much higher unit cost:
<br>
$90M for 40 TFlops.   
<br>
<p>I have estimated an 'economic
<br>
crossover' of $3M for 100 TFlop/s when computers
<br>
become generally cheaper than humans.  This is
<br>
based on a computer being able to put in 5x as
<br>
many productive hours as an average human, a 5 year
<br>
payback time on the hardware, and $120K as the total
<br>
cost per year of a technical professional.  We are
<br>
therefore about 2.8 doublings in performance/$
<br>
away from economic crossover.  At the recent trend
<br>
of cost reduction, 33% per year, that would be
<br>
reached in 58 months, or Mar 2008.
<br>
<p>Economic crossover is not implying we would have 
<br>
human-level AI at that point, but rather that
<br>
skilled human tasks which require lots of processing
<br>
power would be cost-feasible.  In particular, high
<br>
level factory automation should be possible. This
<br>
has implications in the social and economic realms.
<br>
<p>The processing power to run a human-level AI is
<br>
unknown, but is estimated to be in the range of
<br>
100 - 100,000 TFlop/s. Assume the most powerful
<br>
machine available for AI work is in the $3 M price
<br>
range.  Then the expected date of a human-level
<br>
machine is 2008-2025.  The expected date for
<br>
superintelligent machines is 7.5 years later.  This
<br>
is calculated from a human taking about 20 years
<br>
to train.  A machine 8 times faster than a human
<br>
is expected 5 years after a human-equivalent, and
<br>
it would be expected to train in 20/8 = 2.5 years.
<br>
<p>Once superintelligent machines are available, the
<br>
time constant for doubling performance may drop to
<br>
much shorter periods as superintelligent machines
<br>
design their successors ever more rapidly.  This
<br>
singularity may occur in the 2015-2033 time period.
<br>
<p>Labor productivity trends also point to a singularity
<br>
in the ~2020 time period.  From 1992 to 2003, labor
<br>
input in durable goods manufacturing has fallen by 40%
<br>
per unit of output.  Durable goods are defined as
<br>
having a useful life of over a year, as opposed to,
<br>
say food, which gets consumed quickly.  
<br>
<p>The trend predicts highly automated production should
<br>
arrive around 2020.  At some point around then, it
<br>
should be possible to design replicating industrial
<br>
systems, either single factories or networks of
<br>
factories, that can produce copies of themselves
<br>
as well as useful products with little human input.
<br>
Preliminary estimates indicate that these replicating
<br>
factories may have a time to copy themselves on the
<br>
order of 1 year, which is similar to the rate of
<br>
improvement of computer power, and much faster than
<br>
the rates of economic growth we are used to (0-10%per
<br>
year).
