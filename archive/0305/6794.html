<em>&gt; I trust we are talking about very immature AIs here with abnormally 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; notions of how fast a Singularity would ensue from a well constructed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This also assumes that anything much less complex than the AI would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be capable of dependably detecting flaws in its reasoning/motivation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is by no means a given.  I would expect the humans, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augmentation, tools and all to have a very difficult time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding the AI for veyr long even &quot;smeared across time&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>I agree, Samantha.  I am not speaking of an absolutely reliable method, 
<br>
nor yet even necessarily a moderately reliable method.  I am talking about 
<br>
an additional increment of probability that the problem will be detected - 
<br>
a genuine, actual improvement that can be bought if the resources are 
<br>
available.  Therefore, take it if possible.  Actual improvements are very 
<br>
precious because they are not easy to think of.  Small ones, big ones, 
<br>
take 'em all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The flight recorder is not a magical device that automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;notices any humanly conceivable failure of Friendliness before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;can do any harm. The function of the flight recorder is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;solve that problem but to smear that problem across time, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;even if you, as a human, fail to notice the failure at time T+1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with the monitoring technology of time T+1, you can potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;still notice that failure at time T+10 with the monitoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technology of time T+10.  Rather than the young UFAI needing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;conceal its failure only from inexperienced programmers, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mature UFAI being old enough to conceal its failure from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;experienced programmers, the young UFAI must immediately outwit all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;experienced future programmers that will ever go over that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;particular moment of its youth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except of course by then it may well be far too late.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
