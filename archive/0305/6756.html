heh, in regards to the conundrum about why the birds went hay-wire in 
<br>
Hitchcock's film, a great demonstration, as well as a nice scientific 
<br>
explanation, was given in the movie The Core; Something to the effect of 
<br>
having to do with navigation using the earth's magnetic field.   Of course, 
<br>
not everything in the movie was very scientifically accurate, as far as the 
<br>
core of the earth abruptly stopping its orbit, but its a sci-fi movie...ah, 
<br>
the possibilities :-)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Foresight Conference?...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;As for this legendary after-party, I was sadly unable to attend.  --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Durant Schoon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since there were several extropians that attended
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Foresight gathering and the gathering after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that, I will take the liberty to cross-post these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Several questions came up at the post nanoschmooze
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gathering gathering.  At this gathering^2, we had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of people who could name all six flavors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quarks, could write out Bayes law, could program in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything from Fortran to Java, and yet there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some basic questions that eluded us all.  Many of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were on the same lines as the post extro-5 gathering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when we pondered such things as:  if one were in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tank filled with xenon at 215 atmospheres, would one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;float?  What if one injects a sedative into one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carotid artery, and one hemisphere of ones brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is asleep, and one had half an erotic dream, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would happen?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a partial list of this year's imponderables,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plus a few that I simply made up, or that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have asked, had we been inhabiting one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the other many worlds:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the market and google form two members of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holy trinity, what is the third?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why is it that about half the spam today is some prole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who stole a bunch of money in Nigeria and they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give it to me?  Has anyone ever actually fallen for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that silly gag?  Since the Nigerian got my name as someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who is trustworthy, who is it that gave it to them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I want to know who considers *me* trustworthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is the opposite of surreal?  Is it surphony?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps surfake?  Surimaginary?  Or just plain real?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Surreal is kind of unreal, in a way, so the prefix
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sur must mean negative or not or un.  So when someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes a joke that offends or falls flat, could we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that person is surfunny?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How did Palm Pilots get their name?  What has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hand held computing device to do with guiding an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aircraft or ship?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The old movie The Birds caused us no end to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;curiosity.  Many of us have not seen the movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for many years, so our memories are dim, but perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone here can enlighten us.  Clearly Hitchcock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrated sheer genius in making something truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frightening out of something as sur-scary as a flock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of birds with their beaks out of joint.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly was making these birds so crazy?  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they explained it in the movie and we just forgot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What made them chill out in that last scene when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the three (?) people get in a car and drive away?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In that scene where they find the guy dead in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;house, what exactly was the actual cause of death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Did a bunch of birds actually peck him to death?  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that scene I do not recall seeing any bird corpses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the room.  Was it not a quite poor showing, downright
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embarrassing, on the part of the hominid, considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he outweighed each of his opponents by a factor of at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least 20 to 1, not to mention the opposable thumbs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is there anyone here who does not think they could take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a flock of birds in hand to feather combat, assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the battle takes place indoors?  (Come on Beak-boy, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wanna piece of me?)  Could not one surely slay at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a few?  Why was no one in that town armed?  (Hey, Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Feathers, meet Mr. Twelve Gage.)  Could not the NRA use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that as a good reason for every man, woman and child to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pack heat, as a precaution against crazed flocks of birds?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One can never be too careful you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why is it that when extropian/SL4/singularitarian/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanist types gather, people bring *SO MUCH BEER*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and then devour so very little of it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What the helllll did people do before there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computers?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What did we do before there was an internet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What did extropians do before there was google?  Did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we just go around, like, not knowing stuff?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When we get wearable internet connections with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voice interface and fast google connections 24-7,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how are we going to explain to young people how we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever got along without that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do they have crossword puzzles in French?  Do they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a bunch of American words in them?  Still?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why is it, exactly, that sushi is soooo good?  Its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing but a wad of rice and a slice of bait, yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheerfully drive way across town to get some.  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How many jokes are there that start with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;variation of: An engineer, a mathematician and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a physicist go to a {fill in the blank}...  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heard about 800 hundred of them, and we weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even slowing down when the party spontaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gave out.  Why is it that the mathematician always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says something silly and disconnected from reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as we know it?  Are there any of those jokes where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mathematician is the smart guy?  I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Was I imagining it, or was there a spontaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outbreak of niceness on the extropians list?  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I detected it three weeks ago last Tuesday, for several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are there any foods that Homer Simpson does not like?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What would he say as a prefix to that food?  Sur-mmmm?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What happens if an autistic prisoner is sentenced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solitary confinement?  Would she know?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How much power could be saved if the light inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the refrigerator were not left on all the time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why is it that there are so many extropians with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such enormous IQ numbers who cannot deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any mechanical device more complicated than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cerial box?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Was Monte Hall intentionally screwing with people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds all those years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If Ameridebt got some loser's monthly payment cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in half, why didn't he just call them again and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it cut in forth, then an eighth and so on until he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was debt free?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does *anyone* who hangs out on extropians or SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever read actual *fiction*, without the prefix
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How did future fiction ever get the prefix sci to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start with?  Havent we always had science?  Did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inventors of the genre assume we would have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science in the future?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do we call those oddball subcategories of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speculative sci-fi like that show from the 60s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called Wild Wild West, where they had some weird
</em><br>
<em>&gt;futuristic technologies but was actually set in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past?  Is it still science fiction?  For that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter, Star Wars is another good example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How did the diet thread get so huge?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we somehow accidentally discovered a seventh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quark flavor, wont the physicists be majorly screwed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up?  Would they attempt a cover-up?  Would we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it still-more-strange?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cannot book publishers invent a kind of paper that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not get that old book smell when one's text
</em><br>
<em>&gt;books get old?  Would not it be a terrific business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity, to make replicas of old college textbooks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with new paper, so that one is not constantly reminded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that one is way into one's geezerhood?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If Marilyn vos Savant were to get on drugs and lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;her mental focus, would we have to rename her Marilyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vos Stupid?  Or would she become merely vos Normal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SurSavant?  Would anyone have guessed that a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could make a career out of simply understanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian Theorem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Assuming the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanics, how can we be *absolutely sure* that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is one of them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is all the unanswered questions I can recall from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that gathering^2.  If anyone who was there can recall
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others, do post them.  If you have the actual answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to any of these, or even funny suranswers, do post.
