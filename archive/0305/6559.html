<p>Well, it is difficult to make meaningful contributions without resources.
<br>
And like everything else in our society it all has a price, namely
<br>
conformity (or at least an outward appearance). This is not really a bad
<br>
thing, having a regular pay-cheque, support staff and equipment funding
<br>
certainly wouldn't hurt any research effort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that following the typical social forms associated with science can
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Eliezer achieves something really significant in his work, then
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, if Eliezer achieves something really significant, I'm sure he'll be
<br>
given honorary credentials. And I agree with your comments about maverick
<br>
researchers, but they are definately the exception not the rule. I have
<br>
high hopes that Eliezer will achieve his goals, and don't doubt his
<br>
scientific integrity. I *DO* have a problem with how he came across to me
<br>
in his email, it generally irritated me. I just wanted to call attention
<br>
to how that sounded (to me) and what a casual reader might see when
<br>
looking through a googling of Eliezers writings. Perhaps I'm being overly
<br>
sensitive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In many cases &quot;researchers&quot; who are self-described geniuses (or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just more X than most people), dismiss journals because their &quot;peers&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do the reviewing toss their papers (or use them for lining bird
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cages/cleaning up coffee spills). Usually this is followed by the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stalking legitimate researchers to get their ideas heard. This step is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally followed by a restraining order or meds being administered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes the above is marked with statements like &quot;Academics in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; field are filled with anti-knowledge!&quot;, or &quot;Those reviewers aren't smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough to understand my paper!&quot;, or even &quot;There is a conspiracy against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me, my ideas are just too good, and are being suppressed&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jeeez!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I knew a guy like this once (he stalked *me* when I was a prof at UNLV, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the early 90's).  He really didn't have much in common with Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientifically or psychologically or however...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I've seen, I think every academic gets a few of them in a
</em><br>
career. Because of that, it is important to avoid making noises like a
<br>
crackpot, as people who might be very helpful will recognise those signals
<br>
and distance themselves. Being stalked is not a nice thing.
