<em>&gt; having worked as a consultant for the government for a number of years,

<em>&gt; this is just business as usual for NSA.  It is a very expensive but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very secure development process. It is based upon separation and

</em><br>
<p>Overkill?  No, I don't think it's overkill.  I don't think there's any 
<br>
such thing as overkill when it comes to certain problems.  And even if it 
<br>
were, what's wrong with overkill?
<br>
<p>Note one thing, however:  Safety is very, very expensive.
<br>
<p>For example, I would very much like to have guaranteed frame-by-frame 
<br>
reproducibility of AI development.  You develop the AI for a week, 
<br>
recording and timestamping all outside inputs.  Then, when the week is 
<br>
over, you take a snapshot.  Then, on a separate computer, you take last 
<br>
week's snapshot and run it forward, using the timestamped input.  If the 
<br>
final result doesn't match this week's snapshot, start over again from 
<br>
last week.  This guarantees that each and every frame of the AI's 
<br>
existence is available to inspection, even five years later, or for that 
<br>
matter after the Singularity.
<br>
<p>But that would require specific software support, and the software support 
<br>
would be expensive.  At present it seems like no one much cares about the 
<br>
Singularity, so expensive safety options are pretty much out of the 
<br>
question.  Sad.  Pathetic, in fact.  But I can't control humanity's 
<br>
choices, only my own.
<br>
<p>Aside from that, I see at least one major problem with the set of 
<br>
precautions you proposed.  You suggested separation of the system 
<br>
architects from the development environment, which strikes me as both 
<br>
infeasible, and suboptimally safe.  Remember that Friendly AI is much 
<br>
harder as a theoretical problem than as a trust problem.  The theoretical 
<br>
problem is harder because you can't solve it by throwing up security 
<br>
walls.  Security measures are one thing, but anything that actually 
<br>
reduces the ability of the system architects to solve the problem of 
<br>
*building* Friendly AI... no.  You don't have that kind of safety margin; 
<br>
or not knowably so, at any rate.
<br>
<p>That's the problem with outsiders making up security precautions for the 
<br>
project to take; at least one of them will, accidentally, end up ruling 
<br>
out successful Friendliness development.
