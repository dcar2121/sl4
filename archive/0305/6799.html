<p>You shouldn't speculate about my motives.

<p><em>&gt; You mention

</em><br>
<p>Most people are well intentioned. For them the carrot
<br>
is fine. But there are people with a strong commitment
<br>
to implement their bad intentions. For them, the burly
<br>
men (and women) with guns are necessary. I don't envy
<br>
the police their jobs, but would not want to live in a
<br>
society without them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What exact means do you want to use for the purpose of &quot;making things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult&quot;, without interfering with the efforts I described above?
</em><br>
<p>Computing power matters to intelligence, so to develop
<br>
an unsafe AI that is competitive with the smartest safe
<br>
AIs, the developers will need to obtain significant
<br>
computing hardware. This will make them easier to detect.
<br>
They will need a group of highly talented programmers,
<br>
and might be detected through them (outlaw communities
<br>
are riddled with informers). In order to educate their
<br>
AI, they may need significant access to the network and
<br>
the world in general, and be detected through it. They
<br>
may have other resource needs that can be used to detect
<br>
them. The need to keep their resource use hidden will
<br>
weaken their efforts.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, developers of safe AIs will be able
<br>
to get resources openly. If there are regulations
<br>
governing intelligent machines with aggressive
<br>
enforcement, then most wealthy institutions like
<br>
corporations, universities and government will
<br>
cooperate (key word: aggressive enforcement) and
<br>
their large resources will go into safe AIs.
<br>
<p>Of course, these forces are not fool-proof, but they
<br>
will generally favor safe AI development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An approach that slows FAI more than UnFAI, should *not* be tried no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how easy it appears.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It really comes down to who you trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes, it comes down to whether you trust the stick, or the carrot. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer the latter, with only very limited uses for the former, and not when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied to FAI.
</em><br>
<p>I've learned a lot about the effectiveness of the carrot as
<br>
the author of several widely used open source visualization
<br>
systems. The carrot is very effective with well intentioned
<br>
people, which is most people. It is less effective with
<br>
badly intentioned people. We'll need the stick for those
<br>
few people who see the singularity as their tool for world
<br>
domination. History has lots of examples of people with
<br>
bad intentions who get control of large resources. Even
<br>
mildly selfish intentions may cause some powerful people
<br>
to fatally compromise the safety of their AI projects.
