<p>
My proposed solution to friendliness problem.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Note some of you will laugh this off as overkill.  But believe me having
<br>
worked as a 
<br>
consultant for the government for a number of years, this is just
<br>
business as 
<br>
usual for NSA.  It is a very expensive but very secure development
<br>
process.
<br>
It is based upon separation and balance of power.  No one person has the
<br>
access
<br>
and knowledge to compromise the system.  Relationships between team
<br>
members 
<br>
must be prohibited to prevent possibility of collusion.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All FAI project personnel should have security clearances and polygraphs
<br>
to 
<br>
discourage infiltration by Luddites, foreign powers, and megalomaniacs.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Personal spending patterns and life style should be monitored for all
<br>
personnel to 
<br>
ensure large influxes of cash are not originating from unknown sources
<br>
to  
<br>
discourages espionage for profit.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All personnel sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements after
<br>
receiving 
<br>
security training only on their steps of the process.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Design of FAI should be conducted by no less than 3 system architects.
<br>
Programmers receive code specifications, unit test plans from project
<br>
architects.  
<br>
Architectural changes require agreement between all 3 architects. System
<br>
<p>Architects receive NO access to software development environment.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Coding of FAI to be accomplished by no less than 3 programmers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Extensive code review and walk-through required before any code object
<br>
is elevated 
<br>
to test.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All code objects must be checked out and in via a secure version control
<br>
system.  
<br>
Final unit tests at developer level should be conducted for the system
<br>
architects to 
<br>
prove all specifications are met.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A 256 bit checksum (CRC) is then calculated for the code object and
<br>
recorded by project teams 
<br>
and system librarians.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
System librarians have only read access to the development system.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The system librarian then elevates the code to test environment.  A log
<br>
from the production 
<br>
environment that records verified training inputs is replayed to the
<br>
test environment with the 
<br>
new elevated code objects. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Tester and knowledge engineers compare the training results including
<br>
inferences made by the 
<br>
new test FAI to the version currently in production.   All test result
<br>
deviations from production version 
<br>
should be of a positive or neutral nature before test is elevated to
<br>
production.   CRC's are then 
<br>
calculated and compared to vault copies from elevation to test
<br>
environment.  Any deviations 
<br>
indicate a control has been breached and require returning to
<br>
development to revalidate code, reverify 
<br>
CRC and reelevate/test if necessary.  As a final check once smart enough
<br>
the FAI should be given a 
<br>
Multi-Phasic Personality Exam to determine if there any negative
<br>
abnormalities from it's last test.  After 
<br>
testers and knowledge engineers sign off on results.  Code is elevated
<br>
to production.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All validated logs and log results are stored offline as well as on.
<br>
Online logs in both the test and production
<br>
environments must be encrypted to prevent tampering by outside programs.
<br>
Encryption key should be 
<br>
be composed offline and keyed into test and production systems on a
<br>
regular basis.  Past encryption keys  
<br>
remain in the system encrypted themselves for viewing logs created while
<br>
under past keys.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Due to the large size of  logs containing inferences from training data
<br>
it will be necessary for utilities to 
<br>
be written to search logs for key inferences of interest to the
<br>
knowledge engineers.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Knowledge engineers are responsible for creation/encoding of training
<br>
data.  Knowledge engineers should be 
<br>
responsible for seperate knowledge domains once the low level training
<br>
has taken place.  All incorrect inferences
<br>
observed from new training data should be recorded and analyzed with
<br>
help from project architects.  Procject architects
<br>
can help determine if the incorrect inferences are from architecture,
<br>
coding, or insufficient training data to make the 
<br>
correct inferences.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Since all training data is kept in sequence.   The FAI's mental state
<br>
becomes non-monotonic.   The FAI should
<br>
keep a record of all inputs that went into any given inference.  Thereby
<br>
any negative inferences can be eliminated
<br>
by restoring to a point in time prior to that input and  deleting the
<br>
training input that caused the problem or adding 
<br>
a new training input to prevent the negative inference which resulted.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Elevations to production are done weekly with full backups occurring
<br>
immediately before and after.   Backups are 
<br>
stored at two separate secure offsite disaster recovery sites with
<br>
alternating before/after backups trading locations.  
<br>
System managers and database managers should be separate for three
<br>
environments.  They meet to establish 
<br>
standards they all will follow but no person has security
<br>
access/passwords for more than one environment.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
None of the three environments are linked via a network.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All security procedure should be documents and approved by management.
<br>
Actual following of these procedures
<br>
should be physically audited on a regular basis by outside security
<br>
auditors. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A disaster recovery plan should exist at day 1 and be kept up to date
<br>
daily.  Disaster recovery drills should  be
<br>
done on a monthly basis at another secure facility to ensure all three
<br>
environments can be recreated in a minimum of
<br>
time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This high level of supervised learning should be maintained until the
<br>
FAI has established a sufficient moral compass and
<br>
exhibits the same high state moral conviction when presented with sample
<br>
moral dilemmas as those agreed on by project 
<br>
management.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
At that time the production FAI can be exposed to selected outside
<br>
learning sources such as websites, databases, etc...
<br>
All logging of translated training facts extracted should be logged as
<br>
before. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm sure I've left out a number of things but if your pockets are deep
<br>
enough and you really take security seriously some
<br>
variation of the above is what you'll need.

To me, the real problem of Friendly AI is, in non-rigorous terms: What
<br>
is a design and teaching programme for a self-improving AI that will
<br>
give it a high probability of
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
a) massively transcending human-level intelligence
<br>
b) doing so in a way that is generally beneficial to humans and other
<br>
biological sentients as well as to itself and other newly emergent
<br>
digital sentients
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Disputes over details aside, I think this is pretty much what Bill
<br>
Hibbard and Eliezer are also talking about....
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Many subsidiary issues arise, such as &quot;how high is a high enough
<br>
probability for comfort&quot;, &quot;what does 'generally beneficial' mean?&quot;, and
<br>
so forth.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't pretend to have an answer to this question.  I hope to
<br>
participate in working one out perhaps 3-5 years from now, when we (if
<br>
all has gone well in the meantime) have a baby Novamente that's actively
<br>
experiencing and learning from its environment and learning to
<br>
communicate with us and guide its own actions...

<p><p>Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately though, as you know, this doesn't solve the real problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of FAI ... which you have not solved, and Hibbard has not solved, and
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; have not solved, and even George W. Bush has not solved ... yet ... 
</em><br>
<p>Can you spell out what you think the 'real problem of FAI' that hasn't
<br>
been solved yet is, in a format that might make it easier for people to
<br>
create a solution?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
