<em>&gt; So the &quot;derivation&quot; aspect of your proposed system requires something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente's logical inference system, which deals with incompleteness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty and inconsistency in a mostly-probabilistic context.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds like fun to work on ;)
</em><br>
<p>No, actually I was initially planning on focusing on a good, very
<br>
user-friendly &quot;my world view&quot; input system that could help novice users get
<br>
their opinions and reasoning (on a bounded issue) into a good, solid
<br>
Bayesian format (and incidentally, maybe teach them some Bayesian logic as
<br>
they go through it) and then some sort of &quot;resolution&quot; system that allows
<br>
for the combination of world views in an extremely structured format/process
<br>
that indicates where the views are the same and where they differ and walks
<br>
the users through a process of further supporting views where they differ.
<br>
The system should ensure that a given person's views are internally
<br>
consistent but must allow for multiple people to agree to disagree (though
<br>
it would be interesting to see how far down people are willing to explain
<br>
their views - - i.e. go back and support their initial axioms with
<br>
supporting axioms/facts).
<br>
<p>I am certainly not proposing to try to invent anything like a fully
<br>
automated machine process.  All my knowledge of machine learning and machine
<br>
reasoning says
<br>
that we aren't anywhere near being able to do that yet (though many people,
<br>
including you, are making good progress along that path).  What I want is a
<br>
good formal process that can become well-researched, debugged, and accepted
<br>
and &quot;plugged-in&quot; as appropriate later.  In particular, I very much feel the
<br>
need to make this a social and/or community process that can tolerate very
<br>
different world views and facilitate reasoned debate.  I am VERY nervous
<br>
about the idea of even a fully Friendly AI with a single &quot;correct&quot; world
<br>
view.  While I understand the math/reasoning why this isn't truly the case
<br>
with a correctly designed AI, there are going to be far too many people in
<br>
both the political and programming arenas who WILL either latch onto that
<br>
meme or try to make it a reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could you summarize how your proposed system differs from existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision support tools?
</em><br>
<p>I haven't been able to find many current decision support tools that start
<br>
with the concept of resolving multiple world views with structured debate
<br>
and mutual exploration other than a lot of &quot;groupware&quot; semi-solutions that
<br>
really don't provide enough structure.  Could you (or anyone else) give me
<br>
any pointers to anything that you think I've overlooked?  Thanks.
<br>
