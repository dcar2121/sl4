<em>&gt;From what I have seen, corporate R&amp;D groups are either stocked with former
</em><br>
academics, or rely on outside academic &quot;advisory boards&quot; (in the case of
<br>
smaller companies, mostly).  So, yeah, raising corporate funds requires a
<br>
lot of the same kind of presentation as raising academic funds -- BUT, you
<br>
can often sell somewhat more risky radical ideas in the corporate world, IF
<br>
they come along with a good story of how profitable they'll be if they
<br>
succeed.  What this means is that in some ways there is more possibility to
<br>
sell AGI (artificial general intelligence) into the corporate world than
<br>
into academia, if one's AGI story is coupled with a business model.
<br>
However, this is really only true in an &quot;up&quot; economic phase, it's not so
<br>
true right now... right now, the US economy is down enough that gov't
<br>
funding opportunities are definitely a lot brighter than corporate ones.  Of
<br>
course, the down economy has also affected the likelihood of funding from
<br>
maverick futurist philanthropists like the ones Eliezer hopes to attract.
<br>
Because, simply, these folks have less cash than they did a few years ago!
<br>
<p>I think that FAI itself will be very, very hard to sell into academia or the
<br>
corporate world, because academia isn't going to consider FAI important
<br>
since it doesn't really believe in AGI at all; and the corporate world is
<br>
not going to see any near-term profit in FAI.  Probably it would be possible
<br>
to get small one-man research grants (NSF?) for exploratory research on FAI,
<br>
but nothing significant in terms of dollar amount.  Rather, whether industry
<br>
or corporate funding were sought, I think it would be necessary to seek the
<br>
funding for something that looked more plausible to the mainstream mind, but
<br>
had significant overlap with the FAI work.  That is essentially how
<br>
Novamente is funded -- through business funding for projects using the
<br>
Novamente codebase that overlap with Novamente's AGI goals.  We have not yet
<br>
obtained government funding for Novamente but this may be in the cards, time
<br>
will tell.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Absolutely.  Even with mainstream credentials it's tough to raise R&amp;D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; funds.  Without them it's almost impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if you are looking for corporate handouts, you'll need creds even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more. Handing out research grants to well meaning but unqualified persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is grounds for shareholder lawsuits.
