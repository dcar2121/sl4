<p>
I said:
<br>
<em>&gt; It would be quite interesting to conduct some sort of collaborative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scoping exercise to identify what issues different people think we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to look at. If we could produce a single document that had all the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues that each one of us thinks should be considered in the course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tackling AGI morality then we might be able to avoid talking past each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other and from this document we might be able to generate an R&amp;D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda - moving in several direction at once as I don't anticipate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we will all be of one mind..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think of this suggestion?
</em><br>
<p>Ben said it:
<br>
<em>&gt; sounds like a fine idea to me -- except that I don't have time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write the document at the moment, because I've prioritized other things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead of it.  I'll be happy to contribute ideas to such a document and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to review and discuss such a document. 
</em><br>
<p>OK - I'll start a doc - stick it on my website and we can bring ideas from 
<br>
anyone on the list into it (and anyone else too for that matter).  We can 
<br>
tell people via the sl4 lkist when useful increments of progress have 
<br>
been made and invite people to review the document.
<br>
<p>It'll be a slow process because I can't put more than a small 
<br>
amount of time into it.
<br>
<p>It might be an idea if interested people indicated their interest by 
<br>
private email to me to save a flurry on the list.
<br>

<br>
<p>Could someone from the Singularity Institute join this project too - since 
<br>
the Institute has done more on this issue than anyone else?  
<br>
<p>Unless people ask for anonymity I would indicate the names of all 
<br>
contributor to the document.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't see the aim of the document to be to get to &quot;one final view&quot;.  
<br>
Rather I think it would be good to see if there are any coherent clusters 
<br>
of views and perhaps see how many people support each cluster.
<br>
<p>Then it would be up to everyone/anyone to decide what action should 
<br>
be taken in the light of the document content.
<br>
<p>If anyone has any other ideas for process let me know.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
