<em>&gt; The abstract/logical/intellectual sort of intelligence, which is most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonly meant by the word &quot;intelligence&quot;, is not necessarily all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful toward the goal of getting rich.  It can be deployed that way, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority of fortunes are made without the use of too much of this sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social intelligence -- people skills -- is at least as important for getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich, probably more so.
</em><br>
<p><p>I would agree that social savvy is a very significant factor, but I would
<br>
say that this is the same basic kind of intelligence that a bright engineer
<br>
has.  The difference is in the set of patterns that people apply their
<br>
innate intelligence to.  Most of the really savvy business people I know
<br>
have a remarkably good grasp of human behavior in all its detail and nuance,
<br>
and can manipulate social situations in the same way a computer geek can
<br>
manipulate a computer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Not to mention a whole bunch of non-intelligence-related traits like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistence and stamina... and ruthlessness...
</em><br>
<p><p>I think that one could argue that persistence and stamina will get you more
<br>
with merely average intelligence than a very bright person will get without
<br>
it.  I think the biggest problem in this regard is that people only have
<br>
persistence and stamina for things they are interested in, which may not be
<br>
things that are actually useful for business success.  I know many people
<br>
with nearly perfect social business savvy who have never had the attention
<br>
span to fully exploit this ability either.
<br>
<p>I think the hardest thing for me business-wise has always been maintaining
<br>
focus and effort on important things I really don't give a damn about.
<br>
Finally recognizing that this was a significant issue several years ago
<br>
helped quite a bit though, such that I now consciously expend a lot of
<br>
effort on things I despise but know are important.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, getting back to the point of this thread -- it may be that this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a lot of people with geeky intellectual smarts and not that many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with social smarts.  If so, this group is gonna be better at idea-generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and technical problem solving than at raising money.  And the answer to &quot;if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're so smart why aren't you rich&quot; may be, &quot;we're smart in a different way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than what it takes to get rich.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>Absolutely.  But I would also add that lack of social business skills is not
<br>
a terminal condition, and they can be developed in even the most geeky
<br>
engineer types if they are willing to put in a lot of effort.  It *is* a
<br>
problem smart people can solve. :-)
<br>
<p>I've actually been working on a geek-to-executive transformation for a
<br>
number of years, recognizing the clear value of this transition.  Beside
<br>
which, it doesn't really degrade your technical competence in doing so
<br>
(really!), though you may have to spend less time on non-essential geeky
<br>
activity.  You don't have to sell your technical soul to the business devil.
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>Pragmatically speaking though, it helps to have someone around who already
<br>
has the social business savvy to lead the way, because it is easy to be
<br>
blind to your own clueless-ness.  To give credit where credit is due, my
<br>
girlfriend of a few years is one of these super-savvy ladder-climbing senior
<br>
sales executive types at a major multi-national.  She has whipped me into
<br>
proper business executive shape over the last couple years *way* faster than
<br>
I could ever manage on my own.  This has been an immeasurably useful in
<br>
transitioning from technical circles to business circles.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; James Rogers and I are among list members who are in the business world and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hence are trying to get rich, along with advancing our R&amp;D goals.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if my goal were *purely* to get rich, I think I might choose a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach that had less to do with R&amp;D... I actually suspect that deploying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analytical intelligence and technical-invention ability is one of the HARDER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways to get rich...
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree; if I wanted to merely be wealthy, I would have applied my
<br>
intelligence solely in something like finance.  Technological innovation
<br>
requires both excellent engineering/analytical talent *AND* the usual
<br>
business competencies every businessman needs.  As the old saying goes,
<br>
mediocre technology with superior marketing will beat superior technology
<br>
with mediocre marketing every time.  I'm not particularly fond of the whole
<br>
social business side of things, but the result of engaging in this type of
<br>
activity for a couple years has been profoundly beneficial to the long-term
<br>
technical side of things.
<br>
<p>On many levels people who are purely business and finance types have only
<br>
limited trust in people who do not also swim in the same waters of business
<br>
and finance (probably because they don't really understand those other
<br>
people on some level).  It is largely a shell game of manipulated
<br>
perceptions and somewhat different types of meetings, but from the viewpoint
<br>
of the business/finance community I've switched teams.  And maybe I have,
<br>
sort of.  I would point out that this has made my technical judgment and
<br>
competence substantially trustworthy from their standpoint than when I was
<br>
merely an engineer, as contradictory as that may seem at first.
<br>
<p>Social perception is very hackable, and you can extract a lot value hacking
<br>
this space.  It is also a very interesting experience regardless, and pays
<br>
quite a few dividends in numerous areas.
