As usual, Ben has some great points . . . .
<br>
<p>Ben &gt; It's an interesting project, and a very large one...
<br>
<p>I would agree that it is an immense project to complete but I think that
<br>
even the seed of it could provide a lot of insights and value.  I also think
<br>
that getting up part of the system as a decision-making and
<br>
decision-documenting aid is eminently doable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I envision coming out of the process you describe is a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical formal deductive system dealing with morality.  A priori value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgments may be provided as axioms, and the practical moral judgments
</em><br>
based
<br>
<em>&gt; on them emerge as derivations from the axioms.
</em><br>
<p>You're pretty much dead on (except that it gets a lot more complicated when
<br>
the system isn't provided with clean input and needs to deal with
<br>
conflicting axioms, incomplete reasoning, and the rest of the real world)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, not all humans are going to accept that this is a morally
</em><br>
correct
<br>
<em>&gt; process to be using to deal with moral issues!  Many religious folks will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider this process to be part of secular society and hence not morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid....
</em><br>
<p>Which is, of course, a view that should be expressible in the system as
<br>
complete and coherent.  I don't know . . . if the system allows them to
<br>
express their views clearly and in a way that others are more likely to
<br>
accept, the honest ones are likely to like it.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I don't think that I'd want to push it as a moral
<br>
decision-making system.  I mainly used that as a hook for this group.  It's
<br>
a group decision-making under uncertainty system which could be used to
<br>
solve a problem that a Friendly AI desperately needs solved.
