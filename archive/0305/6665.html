Needless to say, 90% of the people on planet Earth no nothing at all about the Singularity. I'm going to just skip the obvious - more people would be interested in the Singularity than there are Singulatarians. By about a factor of five, at least. If we're going to get the funding and public support the Singularity Institute badly needs, we're going to have to convince the world - or at least large numbers of people - that the Singularity is worthwile. I would bet an awful lot of money that if you got a million people to read Staring into the Singularity, written by our moderator, Eliezer, there'd be about $5,000,000 donated to the Singularity Institute within a month. By &quot;read&quot; I don't just mean skimming over the wonderfully written 23 page document, but actually take some time to read it and understand it. We have to &quot;turn on the lights&quot; with the ordinary citizens of the world by getting them to realize that the Singularity - and with it, a wonderful revolution - is really at our doorstep. Mind you, in doi<br>
ng this, we shouldn't just forget about the AI research the Singularity Institute is doing - quite the contrary. Instead, we should go full steam ahead with the research with the resources we already have - while trying every (legal) effort to get public support that the Singularity Institute really does need - very badly. That's my opinion - if you disagree with it, then go right ahead and ground in into the dirt - I'm not better than anyone else.
