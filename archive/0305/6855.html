Wow, Eliezer.  I hope that you're just having a bad day and that this isn't
<br>
your new public relations policy.  Factually, you're mostly correct but the
<br>
attitude and condescension are way over the top and you don't seem to be
<br>
making any effort to understand what others are saying or to help them
<br>
along.
<br>
<p>If you want a good example of a regulation that might work, try something
<br>
that sets up an advisory board of the right people (you can even include
<br>
yourself on it)that constantly reviews all certified projects, evaluates
<br>
their current risks, and takes appropriate action.
<br>
<p>I don't have any faith in a small INBRED group of people going off and
<br>
trying to whip something together without any mistakes when any mistake
<br>
could be fatal in the biggest way possible.  I want as many eyes as possible
<br>
on the project.  Yes, the more people who see it, the better the possibility
<br>
that people might steal the ideas and try to go for an illegal AI but I
<br>
believe that the probability of success of such is much less than the
<br>
probability of a big problem if you don't get as many eyes as possible on
<br>
the original project.
<br>
<p>An even better idea would be to work out an ethics system before you work on
<br>
the AI system.  My belief is that an ethics system should actually follow
<br>
straight from your &quot;rationality&quot; project - - speaking of which, how is that
<br>
going?

<em>&gt; &gt; I would like you to explain why in language that a non-mathematican can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand.  If you can't get around to explaining your ideas in a form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that an intelligent, informed non-mathematician can understand then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are commiting yourself to fail to communicate with the people you want

<em>&gt; &gt; to pusuade not to adopt Bill's approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature is not obligated to make her problems easy enough for intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informed non-mathematicians to understand them.  But of course people get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite indignant when told that a problem may be too difficult for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe, *maybe* if it's someone like a physicist, a nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already-established famously difficult area of science, someone might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to believe that this field is too difficult to be grasped over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunch.  Why?  Because it taps into the ready-made &quot;witch doctor&quot; instinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for understanding a field as arcane and barred to outsiders.  Lacking any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established witch doctors, of course, the presumption must be that your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions are as good as anyone's and that the problem itself is, oh, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as simple as anything else your brain expects to run into.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hunter-gatherers don't confront hard scientific problems.  But just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there isn't a field of AI with an established, confirmed theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, and scientists with reputations for being in a difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field, does not mean that the problem of AI will be simple.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty is set by Nature.  I might try to explain the problem to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent, informed non-mathematician.  But remember that Nature is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under no obligation *whatsoever* to make the problem comprehensible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are doing something that will, in fact, kill you, Nature is under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no obligation to make this obvious to you.  Nature has no privileged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency to avoid killing people whenever her reasons cannot be explained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an intelligent, informed non-mathematician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, bearing that in mind, you might start at:
