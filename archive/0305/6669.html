<em>&gt; Subject: many worlds (was RE: Einstein)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think MWI is rather contrived, but you need to know a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technicalities to appreciate why. Naively, it might sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Quantum mechanics says that some things happen completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at random: one out of a set of possibilities occurs, for no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The many-worlds interpretation says that every possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is realized: whenever such a choice-point is reached, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe 'splits', with one offspring for each possibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is MWI according to DeWitt,
</em><br>
<p>This is also MWI as understood by Deutsch, and probably by 
<br>
Tegmark, who wrote &quot;When she is asked a question, makes a
<br>
snap decision and answers, quantum effects at the neuron
<br>
level in her brain lead to multiple outcomes, and from the
<br>
bird perspective, her single past branches into multiple
<br>
futures.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and it has some problems which are widely recognized:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) Complementary observables. A quantum particle can't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definite position and definite momentum at the same time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When the split occurs, does the particle start out in each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branch with a definite position, or with a definite momentum,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or in some other state?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, but I suggest that you post your question to
<br>
the Fabric of Reality list, where Deutsch himself often answers
<br>
queries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) Relativity. Is the whole universe copied at each split?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, what reference frame are we using? Alternatively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one could suppose that the split propagates outwards at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lightspeed, with the parent universe dynamically cleaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in superspace, but no-one has expressed this mathematically.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the split *does* propagate outward at the speed of
<br>
light.  The visual image I use is that of a thin sheet
<br>
of plastic being pulled apart to form two thinner but
<br>
similar sheets.
<br>
<p>I also believe that this is in accord with what David 
<br>
Deutsch says.  Frankly, when I was studying this intently
<br>
in 2000, I reread his book, &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;, and
<br>
was most impressed.  On my initial reading in 1997, there
<br>
were still a number of places in the book where I could
<br>
not agree.  But now, I disagree with virtually nothing in
<br>
it.  It consists of about 1000 carefully written paragraphs,
<br>
and I've studied that book harder than I have any other book
<br>
that does not have equations in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; c) Interference effects. Quantum effects such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference fringes which show up in the double-slit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment require *recombination* of separated wavepackets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in that example, the recombination of wavepackets that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have passed through the separate slits). If the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; splits before recombination is to occur, recombination would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be impossible, because the two wavepackets are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in separate universes. So either universes can recombine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or splits don't occur between measurements, both of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pose further problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All this is well-known amongst MWI advocates, and so most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them prefer MWI according to Everett, which is a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle approach. Instead of splitting universes, Everett
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talks about &quot;relative states&quot; of subsystems of the universe.
</em><br>
<p>It's a matter of terminology IMO.  The idea of calling these
<br>
&quot;separate universes&quot; offends the positivistic sensibilities
<br>
of many people.  And as Tegmark observed, the reluctance of
<br>
many people to admit larger universes into their ontology
<br>
has been apparent since 1610.
<br>
<p>The remainder of your points are well taken, and I don't know
<br>
how lucid Deutsch and Tegmark would be in addressing them.
<br>
<p>Lee
