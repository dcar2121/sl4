Eliezer said: &quot;It is not a trivial thing, to create a mind that embodies the
<br>
full human understanding of morality.  There is a high and beautiful sorcery
<br>
to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ben said: &quot;I am not sure it is a desirable or necessary goal, either.  The
<br>
human understanding of morality has a lot of weaknesses, and a lot of ties
<br>
to confusing aspects of human biology.  I believe that ultimately an AI can
<br>
be *more* moral than nearly any human or human group.&quot;
<br>
<p>I strongly believe that we shouldn't wait for an AI to understand morality.
<br>
I believe that we, as a society, desperately need to develop formal/codified
<br>
structures/procedures for representing, making, and defending moral (and
<br>
other) decisions that human beings can use as well as, eventually, Friendly
<br>
AIs.  Obviously, these need to be Bayesian and need to take into account the
<br>
very different &quot;facts&quot; that everyone brings to the table.  My assumption is
<br>
that such will, at the very least, make impossible many of the inconsistent
<br>
arguments that are rife today and make explicit the hidden agendas that
<br>
everyone brings to the table while documenting everything for posterity.
<br>
Imagine a world where politicians are required to document their views in
<br>
such a system (or risk being ridiculed or ignored) and public debates are
<br>
informed by an accurate, IMPARTIAL in-depth statement of all views.
<br>
<p>Clearly, any formal/codified process can easily be automated but many of the
<br>
decisions that must be made as part of such a process (such as determing
<br>
whether or not two arguments are the same, collapsing/combining argument
<br>
trees, or even more importantly summarizing arguments to a reasonable
<br>
length) require either human-level or greater intelligence or some further
<br>
(formal/codified) process to collect a consensus of participating human
<br>
beings.  I strongly believe that such is necessarily part of a Friendly AI.
<br>
More importantly,  it is a part that can be worked on now, independently of
<br>
the Friendly AI, and which will provide significant benefits even if it is
<br>
never used for a Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>I've thought about such structures/processes for years but have never spent
<br>
the time necessary to formalize them and attempt to automate them.
<br>
Initially, I didn't even think about using such structures for moral
<br>
decisions but more as a way to coordinate and document decision-making (or
<br>
even research) among (possibly very large) groups of people.  I think that
<br>
this would be an excellent project with large social pay-offs and that this
<br>
group could contribute tremendously to it.  I am more than willing to do the
<br>
automation part but, obviously, need a lot of help on the design and
<br>
formalization parts.  Are there others on this list who are interested in
<br>
attempting such a thing and willing to contribute ideas and time?  If so, I
<br>
will start to pull together all of my notes into some sort of coherent
<br>
documentation as to where I am, what I've thought about, and where a group
<br>
could go from here.
<br>
<p>Any comments?
