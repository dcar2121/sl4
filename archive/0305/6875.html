<p>This inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary conference seeks to

applied
<br>
research, social science and the  fictional worlds of cinema and
<br>
literature.
<br>
<p>Papers, reports, presentations, and workshops are invited on any of
<br>
the
<br>
following key themes:
<br>
<p>* A.I. - master, servant, friend or enemy?
<br>
<p>* A.I. as 'the other'
<br>
<p>* A.I. - science or technology - does it matter?
<br>
<p>* A.I. as evolution of the mind/brain
<br>
<p>* A.I. as marking the end of the human?
<br>
<p>* A.I., the risk society and the accident
<br>

<br>
<p>* Visions of A.I. - cultural and cross cultural identities
<br>
<p>* A.I., humanity and the application of violence
<br>
<p>* A.I. as a gendered identity?
<br>
<p>* The aesthetics of A.I. - replicating the human and the animal
<br>
<p>* Artificial intelligence and artificial emotion?
<br>
<p>* The embodiment of A.I. - robot, cyborg or database?
<br>
<p>* Crossing boundaries: what makes us human, what makes A.I.
<br>
artificial?
<br>
<p>* Defining intelligence from the Turing Test to Bladerunner's
<br>
Voigt-Kampff.
<br>
<p>* Cyberpunk and the re-imagining of A.I.
<br>
<p>* Shifting identities: portrayals of A.I. in film and literature
<br>
<p>* The A.I. 'creation' - victim, hero or villain?
<br>
<p>* A.I. as consciousness
<br>
<p>* A.I. and Orientalism; is the future Asian?
<br>
<p>* A.I. as a failed research programme?
<br>
<p>Papers will be considered on related themes. 300 word abstracts
<br>
should be
<br>
submitted by Friday 27th June 2003. Full draft papers  should be
<br>
