<p>
my 2 cents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think MWI is rather contrived, but you need to know a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technicalities to appreciate why. Naively, it might sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this:
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Usual QM&quot; has these postulates:
<br>
<p>[1] Schrodinger's eqn.
<br>
[2]. An ad hoc &quot;collapse&quot; to an eigenstate of an observable whenever
<br>
an observation occurs.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;--- 2 was a very imprecisely defined postulate, with it being unclear
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what an observation meant.  Unless the &quot;Observation&quot; was done by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a conscious being, no &quot;collapse&quot; occurred. Moreover, this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;collapse&quot; was nonlocal and hence &quot;disturbing&quot;.  To me, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implicitly implied need for &quot;conscious being&quot; was the most disturbing.
<br>
<p>The Everett interpretation simply says:
<br>
<p>Wait a minute, do we even need this ad hoc postulate [2]?  Let's just
<br>
see what happens with [1] alone.  After all, there's nothign special
<br>
about &quot;conscious people&quot; as far as the laws of nature are
<br>
concerned. We are made up of electrons and protons too.
<br>
<p>So, let [1] be the only postulate, and see what happens. And surprise,
<br>
it seems that all the QM &quot;observations&quot; can be explained.
<br>
<p>Everything else simply follows.  Everett interp. doesn't postulate
<br>
&quot;splitting of the universe&quot; or anything.  It has lesser number of
<br>
postulates than &quot;traditional QM&quot; and they are more well-defined, for
<br>
once.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But here's the very first problem: there's more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one way of decomposing a wavefunction.
</em><br>
<p>As i understand it, the wavefunction, following its natural evolution
<br>
equation, can only be interpreted to divide in certain ways. These
<br>
ways are what turn out to be what we observe as &quot;classical reality&quot;.
<br>
Any other way of dividing the wavefunctino up is unstable to
<br>
wavefunction evolution via Schr eqn.  These states are the &quot;physical
<br>
states&quot; we observe, and find ourselves in, and this phenomenon is
<br>
called &quot;decoherence.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One instance of this is illustrated by problem (a) for DeWitt's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of MWI, mentioned above. In the quantum mechanics of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single particle, exact position states are represented by &quot;delta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions&quot;, formal functions which are infinitely peaked at a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordinate and which are zero everywhere else; and exact momentum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states are represented by &quot;plane waves&quot;, the sort of functions which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show up in Fourier analysis on multidimensional spaces. A generic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wavefunction can be decomposed into a sum over delta functions, *or*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sum over plane waves (or indeed, a sum over many many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible sets of functions). Which &quot;basis set&quot; is the real one?
</em><br>
<p><p>When *you* &quot;observe&quot; position, you perform actions that end up
<br>
entangling you with the position basis.  In other words, the wave
<br>
function then becomes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;[|x=2&gt;|you_2&gt;] + [|x=1&gt;|you_1&gt;]                [1]
<br>
<p><p>where you_1 is a version of you that observes x=1. This combined
<br>
wavefunction has only one set of allowed &quot;natural&quot; physical states
<br>
interpretation ---Those physical states are the position basis.  In
<br>
other words:
<br>
<p><p>Consider this combined wavefunction.  Now, one intepretation of
<br>
this wavefunction is that that when you observe x=2, you are just the
<br>
first part of the wavefucntion.
<br>
<p>But then, you might ask, why consider the 2 parts as above?  Why not
<br>
divide up the wavefunction as in eqn. [1] differently?  Why not
<br>
reexpress it as:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;[ |x=2&gt;|you_2&gt; + 0.5* |x=1&gt;|you_2&gt; ]  +  [ |x=1&gt; |you_1&gt; - 0.5* |x=1&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;|you_1&gt; ]
<br>
<p><p>and then consider the 2 parts as the ones in square brackets?  And
<br>
then consider &quot;you&quot; to be the only part in the first square bracket?
<br>
What would that &quot;you&quot; observe?  Wouldn't you observe the particle
<br>
in a weird state instrad of x=2?  IOW, why do you always observe the
<br>
particle at a particular position instead of a mixture?
<br>
<p>The answer to this, iiuc is that the above division is &quot;not stable&quot; to
<br>
wavefunction evolution.  Only certian divisions turn out to be
<br>
&quot;stable&quot; as the Schr. eqn. progresses.  And this phenomenon is called
<br>
decoherence.
<br>
<p>Again, no postulates necessary. Just following the good old Schr. eqn.
<br>
<p><p>Similar considerations apply if you had &quot;observed velocity&quot;, which
<br>
would have landed the combined wavefuinction into a state:
<br>
&nbsp;[|v=1&gt;|you_1&gt;] + [|v=2&gt;|you_2&gt;]
<br>
<p>Again, there's only one &quot;stable&quot; decomposition of the above function
<br>
from which to construct &quot;basic observation states&quot;.  That
<br>
decomposition is the one above.
<br>
<p>Even if some things still leave one uneasy, it is certainly much
<br>
clearner than traditional qm imo.  Atleast the postulates are
<br>
well-defined.  
<br>
<p><p>that's what i  understand, i could be wrong.  
<br>
<p><p>The problem of measure still remains, but that remains in 
<br>
&quot;conventional QM &quot; too,.. where measure is an ad hoc squaring of psi.
<br>
<p><p><pre>
----
When i say &quot;unstable&quot; to wavefunction evolution, i meant that the
complex coefficients in front of the various parts of the wavefunction
(which i omitted above) evolve differently with time, rendering the
division impossible within an epsilon second.
