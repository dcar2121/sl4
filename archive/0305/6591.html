Hi Mike,
<br>
<p>One of the problems is that while there are a lot of people who are willing
<br>
to read SIAI's work, and loosely agree with it, there are few willing to
<br>
contribute money to SIAI's mission, and even fewer willing to spend a
<br>
substantial amount of time working with other Singularitarians in coming up
<br>
with SIAI funding ideas and implementing them.  I've given the question &quot;how
<br>
can I maximize the Singularity Institute's financial resources?&quot; a plenty of
<br>
thought over the past year, and my general conclusion is that efforts fall
<br>
into seven general categories:
<br>
<p>1)  Giving money yourself.  I know some of us might be quite poor, but if
<br>
you have any disposable income at all, there's no place in the world where
<br>
it could used more effectively than as a contribution to SIAI.  Giving to
<br>
SIAI can be a way to prove to yourself that you're serious about the
<br>
Singularity, and to set the psychological stage for encouraging others to
<br>
donate.
<br>
<p>2)  Spend money on pursuing Singularity-derived goals for yourself.  Those
<br>
who plan to support the Singularity Institute long-term can make investments
<br>
in propelling their own lives forward as fast as possible, delegating more
<br>
and more personal time to the pursuit of the Singularity.  Not sure if this
<br>
is always more valuable than #1, it probably depends on the person.
<br>
<p>3) Write original Singularity-related literature to boost credibility and
<br>
awareness of the Singularity Institute's reasoning and mission.  Describe
<br>
why Friendly AI is the most efficient and leveraged way to pursue good, etc.
<br>
Tyler Emerson (Anand) and Mitch Howe are both good examples, for instance.
<br>
A nice way to wrap up an introductory essay is a link to SIAI, or even an
<br>
implicit or explicit challenge to participate in the Singularity movement
<br>
somehow.  I can't overemphasize the importance of original Singularity
<br>
literature; non-writers are effectively mute outside of mailing lists, which
<br>
cater to a very narrow interest group.  (Eliezer wrote a nice webpage on
<br>
advice for Singularity writers, it's in the essays folder at
<br>
www.sysopmind.com.
<br>
<p>5) Mailing lists, forums, flyers, networking, speaking to people, giving
<br>
talks, that sort of thing.
<br>
<p>6) Keep your eye out for ridiculously smart people that might be interested
<br>
in SIAI's work.  Extremely smart people might be okay too.  One of the
<br>
toughest obstacles on the road to the Singularity might be finding
<br>
researchers smart enough to actually understand how intelligence works and
<br>
implement it swiftly given resource, programming, and information
<br>
constraints.
<br>
<p>7) Admit to yourself that whatever pet project you were interested in before
<br>
you found out about the Singularity has probably been rendered a waste of
<br>
time!  (And other sorts of rationality.)
<br>
<p>That's all I can think of offhand.  Another problem about producing money
<br>
through sheer intellect is that we aren't physically located near one
<br>
another, making collaboration more difficult, the fields we specialize in
<br>
tend to already have a high percentage of geniuses, and many of the very
<br>
enthusiastic people are even too young to have graduated college yet.  I
<br>
can't easily imagine any money-making schemes with a high chance of success
<br>
that wouldn't require a large amount of initial investment in terms of time
<br>
and money.  Can you?  If no one can, then boring ol' writing and memetics
<br>
might seem to be the best way to pursue the Singularity at this moment.

<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;SOAPBOX&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the message traffic is slow today, I'll take this opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interject.  There's an old saying:  &quot;If you're so smart, why ain't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From reading the SL4 message traffic, it's obvious that there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty darned smart people in this membership.  Much smarter than me, I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely admit.  I can't help but think that if this group chose to focus
</em><br>
its
<br>
<em>&gt; attention on the problem of SIAI funding, that it could come up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution, so that Eliezer could stay focused on his work (and perhaps go
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; far as to fund the projected personnel additions).  Without knowing how
</em><br>
much
<br>
<em>&gt; the members here are already involved in the singularity effort, I realize
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; may be completely out of line by making such a suggestion.  And maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's another forum where that problem is already being addressed that
</em><br>
I'm
<br>
<em>&gt; not aware of.  But if not, it seems that it'd be nice if we could help
</em><br>
out,
<br>
<em>&gt; instead of just waiting for Eliezer to make the singularity a reality by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself.  Any suggestions?
