</em><br>
<p>### This is a very stifling vision - to try to bind minds to family values
<br>
(don't I hear some Reaganesque echoes here?), exercise, meaningful (what
<br>
does that mean?) vocation, and gregariousness, while prohibiting e.g.
<br>
solitude and chemical hedonism. This is a conservative concept of how humans
<br>
should live, incompatible with freedom (even if it's mentioned there by
<br>
name).
<br>
<p>I think that one of the main thrusts of CFAI is that such contingent
<br>
superficialities may not form the supergoal content of the FAI, and that ve
<br>
will need to perform a more subtle analysis of human mind and its
<br>
relationship with the world.
<br>
<p>It might be quite useful to do a simple exercise:
<br>
<p>Imagine you can dissociate the volitional aspects of your mind (currently
<br>
housed in the prefrontal cortex) from the purely experiential features.
<br>
Imagine you perceive intense pain and discomfort, with autonomic activation,
<br>
wild activity of the thalamus, the sensory cortex, the limbic system and
<br>
insula - all the subjective correlates of torture. Yet, your anterior
<br>
cingulate cortex decides not to act. Perhaps a high dose of exogenous
<br>
opiates was given, maybe you had a cingulotomy, maybe you engaged in
<br>
meditation deciding not listen to your tortured body. You know from the
<br>
models of your own mentality that the routines calculating pain and
<br>
happiness are not self-aware, they have no recursive consideration of self.
<br>
You ignore them (just as some soldiers and yogas did throughout history).
<br>
<p>Would the FAI be justified in intervening on behalf of your non-sentient
<br>
subroutines, the ones screaming in pain? Or should it stay away from
<br>
directly changing the volition of you, the full self-aware mind? Doesn't the
<br>
mind's will matter more than the will of its parts?
<br>
<p>If self-happiness is no longer a goal (as it frequently happens), it's
<br>
subjectively worthless. The FAI may not bind other minds to goals, and
<br>
familial appurtenances, that were left behind in the mind's growth.
<br>
Prescribing definite paths based on our temporary concepts of self, would be
<br>
like closing the door to eternity - an infinite loss.
