<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said, there are three major sources of funding out there:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Private industry (including private investors)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Government grants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Philanthropy (a tiny amount by comparison)
</em><br>
<p><p>The *source* of the funding is largely immaterial.  The *reason* they are
<br>
giving you the money is what matters.  It is the reason that determines how
<br>
much you'll get, how long they will back you, and how much freedom you have
<br>
in spending it.  The investors do not have to believe they are &quot;funding AGI
<br>
research&quot; for them to be willing to do so.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  But Jack Welch has a track record in business.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether or not a business succeeds has to do with much much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than the technical merits of its products.  If Jack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Welch got involved with an AGI business, there would be good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to believe that it would succeed, because he has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience in making other businesses succeed.
</em><br>
<p><p>You are missing the point. The investors won't care if he succeeds at
<br>
producing an AGI, because that isn't why they are giving him their money.
<br>
Jack Welch knows how to manage money and manage businesses such that they
<br>
generate profit.  His reputation in this regard is sufficient for people to
<br>
give him money no matter how ridiculous his sales pitch.  People are betting
<br>
on a profitable investment conversion, not on his successfully producing an
<br>
AGI.  An important distinction.  He really could spend all that capital on
<br>
AGI research or none at all, and it wouldn't be of concern to the investors
<br>
generally speaking.
<br>
<p>This was just an example intended to make a point, not necessarily an actual
<br>
suggestion of course.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that difficult to obtain reputation/credentials on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-academic axis that can be converted into serious capital 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for AGI, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would you do this without having the necessary capital to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build an FAI in the first place?
</em><br>
<p><p>It is easier and faster to build a reputation that is convertable into
<br>
capital in the business world than it is to make money directly.
<br>
Bootstrapping capital from nothing to amass a substantial amount of capital
<br>
is reliable, but slow and requires a lot of work.  You'll find that many of
<br>
the people who amass substantial amounts of capital in relatively short
<br>
periods of time leverage reputation to get access to large quantities of
<br>
capital, short-circuiting the bootstrapping process.  This comes with
<br>
certain limitations and probably involves having something more concrete in
<br>
mind than &quot;AGI research&quot;, but it is actually a significant capital force
<br>
multiplier if you look at it as a function of time (something which is
<br>
assumed to be paramount here).
<br>
<p>I would point out that the reputation they are leveraging ISN'T academic.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
