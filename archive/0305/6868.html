I concede your statement that it was a belief.  However, of course, everything you &quot;know&quot; is a belief.  When one is trying to proove a point, the evidence must support it.  My problem was not with you.  It is with the arguments some people have been making based on guesses and feelings.  I'm sorry I used a specific example.   I aim to be constructive.  Using these quotes as examples may have been more pride-injuring than critically constructive.  I apologize.  However I ask that people stop &quot;estimating&quot; a comparison between probabilities that are not connected in the argument.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stewart &gt;&gt; The probability that these people know the probabilities they claim to is probably small. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat of myself &gt;&gt; I believe that the probability of success of such is much less than the probability of a big problem if you don't get as many eyes as possible on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the original project.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I made no such claims.  I stated a belief and clearly labeled it as such.  I could come up with some supporting evidence for my belief but nothing that I would want to claim as definitive or conclusive.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, what exactly is your problem?  Why was my statement &quot;unbearable&quot;?

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm afraid the chances of uber machines destroying the world is far far
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smaller than the chances of you just being off your medication.&quot; - Barkley Vowk
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't have any faith in a small INBRED group of people going off and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to whip something together without any mistakes when any mistake
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could be fatal in the biggest way possible.  I want as many eyes as possible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the project.  Yes, the more people who see it, the better the possibility
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that people might steal the ideas and try to go for an illegal AI but I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that the probability of success of such is much less than the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability of a big problem if you don't get as many eyes as possible on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the original project.&quot; - Mark Waser
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability that these people know the probabilities they claim to is probably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small.  Many people seem to be writing arguments supported by comparisons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between the probabilities of events they know nothing about (Barkley would seem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be joking in his statement, however it didn't seem so after reading the previous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posts from him).  Certain cases where probabilities can effectively be contrasted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are fine and dandy, but these posts recently have gotten out of hand .
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never posted before now.  I prefer to just read, but some of these posts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by some people have gotten unbearable.
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S. I am not just picking on Vowk and Waser.  There have been plenty other cases.
