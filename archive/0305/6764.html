I said:
<br>
<em>&gt; AGIs are not the solution to *this* problem they are just an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension of the existing problem.
</em><br>
<p>Then Samantha said:
<br>
<em>&gt; You do not believe that something with that (thinks) several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orders of magnitude faster than you can, can outperform you and deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully with more complex situations than you or a group of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like you can? 
</em><br>
<p>Like most people on this list, I think AGIs will eventually be smarter than 
<br>
humans and they'll certainly be able to outperform us in heaps of ways.  
<br>
But will they be better at solving problems that humans think need 
<br>
solving?  There are grounds for thinking they WON'T under several 
<br>
different and reasonably plausible scenarios.
<br>
<p>Firstly, problems only exist once a normative (goal or values-based) 
<br>
framework has been established.  So if AGIs are not motivated to solve 
<br>
problems that some humans think are problems then they won't help 
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>AGIs without a moral code that encompasses humans, AGIs and other 
<br>
living things will be too dangerous to have around because, if they are 
<br>
motivated to do things in the real world, they won't care what effect it has 
<br>
on us, other biological lifeforms, or even other AGIs.
<br>
<p>And if AGIs DO have a moral code then there's a fair chance it will be 
<br>
influenced by some pretty limited moral frameworks due to who had the 
<br>
money to get them designed and housed in a big computer complex in 
<br>
the first place  ie. I will hate x, y, z people because they have been 
<br>
nominated as the enemy of my human owner,  I will skrew everyone 
<br>
except x, y, z because my owner wants to make squillions of dollars and 
<br>
become the most powerful person in the known universe.
<br>
<p>If a single AGI exisits and it gets independence then, unless the AGI has 
<br>
been designed/trained to be both friendly to life and very wise, then we 
<br>
are all going to be hostage to its ideosyncracies.
<br>
<p>And if there are multiple AGIs, and if the overwhelming majority are not 
<br>
both friendly to life and very wise, then far from solving problems things 
<br>
will just get difficult at a vastly higher level of complexity.  We will be 
<br>
living in a world like the ancient Greek Olympus or the Norse Valhalla 
<br>
where the gods are at war.

<p>Samantha said:
<br>
<em>&gt; Trusting the general public in such an area rather speaks for itself as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does a belief that the real authority is or should be in the hands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public at large.    The vast majority in the US believe in demons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't find Iraq (Brazil, India,  Russia(!), etc.) on a world map, read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than one non-fiction book in their lives after schooling,  barely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand simple algebra and so on.  Your faith in them is touching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the masses really do no deserve this sort of credit.  Failure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand this or any other unpleasant facts will not serve us. 
</em><br>
<p>Fortunately not all publics are (on average) as poorly educated, and as 
<br>
self-centred as the US public.  Many of the European countries have 
<br>
better education and a more cooperative/collaborative attitude than the 
<br>
inhabitants at the centre of the US imperium.  And critically, in many of 
<br>
these European countries, not coincidentally, democracy is in much 
<br>
better shape.  (By the way, I don't now nor have I ever lived in Europe).
<br>
<p>What I'm trying to get at (apart from sending a gratuitous broadside in the 
<br>
direction of the US elite and citizenry) is that average humans are 
<br>
demonstrably capable of a lot more in the way of problem solving than 
<br>
we see in the worst cases.  Rather than damning humans generally as a 
<br>
bunch of no-hopers, we need to look carefully at what makes average 
<br>
humans into either no-hopers or into quite clever sensible people.
<br>
<p>While humans are hardware/software limited, most of the stupidity we 
<br>
see them demonstrate is due to poor top layer software, poor databases 
<br>
and disatrous decision-making settings (an institutional issue).
<br>
<p>So if humans, that are pretty impressive GIs, can stuff up badly for 
<br>
reasons unrelated to the basic hardware software issues, then cleverer 
<br>
AGIs can probably stuff up also for reasons that go beyond the issue of 
<br>
hardware and software.
<br>
<p>Quite frankly I doubt that AGIs will solve anything very profound (in 
<br>
terms of making a better life for humans and a sustained world for all life) 
<br>
unless we and the AGIs pay attention to the critical issues of how 
<br>
political/economic power is wielded and how wisdom is generated, made 
<br>
widespread and given scope to be expressed.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
