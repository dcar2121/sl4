</em><br>
<p>I think you missed the point of a flight recorder.  The idea is that even 
<br>
if you don't notice a failure *instantly*, there's at least the 
<br>
*potential* to notice the failure five years later - so long as the AI 
<br>
hasn't overwritten the evidence meanwhile.  When the goal of hiding a 
<br>
catastrophic failure first forms, and before it is implemented, the goal 
<br>
itself should be noticeable.  It may only be noticeable for 500 
<br>
microseconds before it's obscured, but even so, formation of the desire 
<br>
and implementing it should not be simultaneous.  If you have the ability 
<br>
to run an exact frame-by-frame reenactment of the AI's history, you can 
<br>
use advanced tools built offsite, or additional programmers, to notice 
<br>
that 500-microsecond unobscured failure.  Five years later, if necessary. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would at least be a chance, so long as the evidence is not erased 
<br>
in the meanwhile.  That's why the AI can't have access to the flight recorder.
<br>
<p>Trust, but verify.  Having the AI agree (at time T) with the programmers 
<br>
about the necessity of safeguards because of the possibility of 
<br>
catastrophic failure (at time T+1) does not mean that anti-tampering 
<br>
devices would not be necessary in the case of catastrophic failure (at 
<br>
time T+1).
<br>
<p>The flight recorder is not a magical device that automatically notices any 
<br>
humanly conceivable failure of Friendliness before it can do any harm. 
<br>
The function of the flight recorder is not to solve that problem but to 
<br>
smear that problem across time, so that even if you, as a human, fail to 
<br>
notice the failure at time T+1, with the monitoring technology of time 
<br>
T+1, you can potentially still notice that failure at time T+10 with the 
<br>
monitoring technology of time T+10.  Rather than the young UFAI needing to 
<br>
conceal its failure only from inexperienced programmers, and the mature 
<br>
UFAI being old enough to conceal its failure from experienced programmers, 
<br>
the young UFAI must immediately outwit all experienced future programmers 
<br>
that will ever go over that particular moment of its youth.
