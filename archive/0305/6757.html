<p>
This post is not directed to me, but I'm jumping in anyway.
<br>
<p>Bill Hibbard:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pointing out the difficulties does not justify not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying. Independent development of AI will be unsafe. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political process is not guaranteed to solve the problem, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is necessary to at least try to stop humans who will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposely build unsafe AIs for their own imagined benefit.
</em><br>
<p>You need to be far more specific about this. What do you mean by 'a
<br>
political process'? Do you mean each line of code is subject to
<br>
referendum? Surely not. Perhaps the design should be agreed upon by a
<br>
Senate subcommitee? Your insistence on this unknown process doesn't
<br>
really take a position. 
<br>
<p>A broad governmental policy with research guidelines that encourage
<br>
Friendly AI (perhaps coupled with an offer of Manhattan Project funding
<br>
to the most ethical researchers) *might* help. You admit that a
<br>
political process is not guaranteed to help Friendly AI. It probably
<br>
won't even come close. Friendly AI and compromise do not co-exist.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Regulation will make it more difficult for those who want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to develop unsafe AI to succeed. 
</em><br>
<p>Please be more specific. The regulatory process is cumbersome and slow,
<br>
and mostly reactive. Good ideas are rarely implemented except as
<br>
solutions to mature problems. The mature problems of this domain are the
<br>
ones you just don't have time to react to.   
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The legal and trusted AIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have much greater resources available to them and thus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will probably be more intelligent than the unregulated AIs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The trusted AIs will be able to help with the regulation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort. I would trust an AI with reinforcement values for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human happiness more than I would trust any individual human.
</em><br>
<p>Are you talking about tool-level AGIs or &gt;H AGIs? In the latter case, do
<br>
you really think a &gt;H AGI would make laws the way we do? It's possible,
<br>
but even I can think of ways to establish a much larger degree of
<br>
control over the things I would need control over. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It really comes down to who you trust. I favor a broad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political process because I trust the general public more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than any individual or small group.
</em><br>
<p>Most people aren't geniuses. What's even worse, most people deduce
<br>
ethics from qualia. Average intelligence and utilitarian ethics might
<br>
get you a business degree, but this is not the caliber of people that
<br>
need to be working on AGI.      
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, democratic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goverement does enlist the help of experts on technical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, but ultimate authority is with the public. 
</em><br>
<p>What public? Do you mean the 50% of American citizens of voting age that
<br>
actually cast a ballot? Or do you mean the rest of the world, too? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you say &quot;AI would be incomprehensible to the vast majority of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons involved in the political process&quot; I think you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not giving them enough credit. Democratic politics have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managed to cope with some pretty complex and difficult problems.
</em><br>
<p>This is not directed to me, but can you name some of them that approach
<br>
the complexity and difficulty of AGI?
<br>
<p>Keith
