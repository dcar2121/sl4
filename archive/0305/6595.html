<em>&gt; &gt; Since the message traffic is slow today, I'll take this opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interject.  There's an old saying:  &quot;If you're so smart, why ain't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rich?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It's a silly saying, but it gets at the ambiguity of the notion of
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot;
<br>
<p>The abstract/logical/intellectual sort of intelligence, which is most
<br>
commonly meant by the word &quot;intelligence&quot;, is not necessarily all that
<br>
useful toward the goal of getting rich.  It can be deployed that way, but
<br>
the majority of fortunes are made without the use of too much of this sort
<br>
of intelligence.
<br>
<p>Social intelligence -- people skills -- is at least as important for getting
<br>
rich, probably more so.
<br>
<p>Not to mention a whole bunch of non-intelligence-related traits like
<br>
persistence and stamina... and ruthlessness...
<br>
<p>In short, what's needed to make getting rich &quot;easy&quot; is a particular
<br>
combination of personality traits combined with intelligence, and particular
<br>
sorts of intelligence are more useful here than others.
<br>
<p>Among other points, this gets at the point that humans don't really have
<br>
that much &quot;general intelligence.&quot;  Intelligence tends to be specialized in
<br>
one way or another.  People with high IQ's can have poor social
<br>
intelligence, and as a consequence may have a hard time getting rich even if
<br>
they invent valuable things, because others with greater social skills and
<br>
ruthlessness may screw them out of the money they &quot;deserve.&quot;  I'm sure a
<br>
very long thread could be created discussing stories of this nature known to
<br>
various list members who've been in the tech industry ;-0 !!
<br>
<p>Now, getting back to the point of this thread -- it may be that this list
<br>
has a lot of people with geeky intellectual smarts and not that many people
<br>
with social smarts.  If so, this group is gonna be better at idea-generation
<br>
and technical problem solving than at raising money.  And the answer to &quot;if
<br>
you're so smart why aren't you rich&quot; may be, &quot;we're smart in a different way
<br>
than what it takes to get rich.&quot;
<br>
<p>James Rogers and I are among list members who are in the business world and
<br>
hence are trying to get rich, along with advancing our R&amp;D goals.  However,
<br>
if my goal were *purely* to get rich, I think I might choose a different
<br>
approach that had less to do with R&amp;D... I actually suspect that deploying
<br>
analytical intelligence and technical-invention ability is one of the HARDER
<br>
ways to get rich...
