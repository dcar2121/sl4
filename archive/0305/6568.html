</em><br>
<p>Hopefully you appreciate however that for someone to be a Friendly AI
<br>
advocate (&quot;advocate&quot; in the &quot;let me give you some of my money to fund that
<br>
research&quot; advocate sort of way) people need to understand the need
<br>
for Friendly AI.  The progress of the discussion will likely start with
<br>
helping the person to understand the concept of technological progress and
<br>
its exponential nature.  Next, you'll need to discuss artificial
<br>
intelligence
<br>
which will also involve the exorcism of the Hollywood AI image from the
<br>
person (&quot;this house is safe&quot;).  After you manage that small feat, its on
<br>
to describing the Singularity in a conceptual fashion.  Then you need to
<br>
tie up the relevance of the conversation to that point by convincing the
<br>
person of the inevitability of the Singularity.  (Here's where my questions
<br>
about progress to date are concerned.  Most people with money are results-
<br>
oriented people.  If &quot;progress&quot; is a few papers were written and a few
<br>
thousand posts were made to a mailing list then the Singularity is on equal
<br>
footing with a thousand other &quot;movement&quot;.
<br>
<p>Once all this has been accomplished then you can talk about Friendly AI to
<br>
potential supporters.  The discussion path I've outlined above has been
<br>
the general course my discussions have taken with laypersons on these
<br>
topics.
