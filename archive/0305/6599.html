<em>&gt; I also believe that open sourcing some of the components that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are generally useful will be a much faster way of getting those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components built than waiting for everything including funds to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come together to do the job on a closed source basis.  A few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good architects to create component subprojects and manage them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as OSS would be easier to come by than many more master
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers dedicating their lives to a more closed effort with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little or no working capital or compensation until a hopefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there is a false assumption that useful people resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to understand everything about FAI in near Eliezer-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depth before they can do a lot of very useful and needed work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given that we believe both that getting to FAI is utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial and every day until that point is full of huge risks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all humanity and that FAI is difficult on technical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical levels, it seems to me we need to divide and conquer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem as much as possible.  Otherwise stasis will prevail.
</em><br>
<p>It is true, there are useful things that could be done on an OSS basis to
<br>
help us along the path to AGI
<br>
<p>For example, Novamente could use
<br>
<p>*
<br>
a robust visualization tool for visualizing and navigating complex networks
<br>
[including labeled weighted hypergraphs, both small and huge ones].
<br>
Existing tools like Tulip are a start, but no existing tool really fits the
<br>
bill in terms of visualizing the insides of a Novamente instance....  And
<br>
the same tool that could visualize the inside of Novamente could visualize
<br>
the inside of a lot of other would-be AI systems, e.g. Peter Voss's A2I2
<br>
system which is a network of a different sort (more lik ea neural network
<br>
than Novamente)
<br>
<p>*
<br>
an easy to use &quot;distributed processing framework&quot; allowing Novamente or
<br>
other AGI systems to farm out certain types of processing across millions of
<br>
processors, distributed.net / SETI@home style....  Again, such tools exist,
<br>
but when you look at the details none of them are flexible enough to use
<br>
directly off the shelf for Novamente AGI purposes, or for other AGI purposes
<br>
either I suspect
<br>
<p>*
<br>
software that takes currently available perceptual processing software (e.g.
<br>
sound and vision processing software) and outputs the results in a
<br>
Novamente-friendly framework (say, the right sort of XML), and causes it to
<br>
accept control commands in a simple way....  [Eventually Novamente will do
<br>
its own perceptual processing, but for initial experimentation in this
<br>
domain, hooking it up to existing perceptual software may be an interesting
<br>
&quot;scaffolding&quot; step along the path...]
<br>
<p>None of these is a small project.  All of these would likely benefit
<br>
multiple AGI projects, not just Novamente.  All could be developed on an OSS
<br>
basis by a distributed team of enthusiastic part-timers.
<br>
<p>So, if anyone feels like working on one of these things, let me know and we
<br>
can collaborate ;)  The catch is that I do not have time to actively
<br>
organize and manage an OSS effort in any of these areas, only to help out
<br>
with general direction-giving and intermittent technical problem-solving.
<br>
So what is needed is not merely some enthusiastic programmers, but a
<br>
programmer/team-leader, which is a different thing.
<br>
<p>These sorts of projects require significantly less AI and math knowledge
<br>
than working on Novamente itself .. the learning curve is definitely less
<br>
(and the learning curve for doing significant work on Novamente is a damn
<br>
tough one...)
