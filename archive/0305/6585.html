<p><em>&gt; &gt; Assuming FAI, or the proliferations of FAI which

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then the subjective probability of you quickly

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlucky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough to be in a Hell state is very VERY high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How so?  It is doubtful that such a transtion is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; something wearing your skin across that much of a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gap.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming that there is no Anti-FAI which is capable of
<br>
proliferating evil across the multiverse, then FAI
<br>
dominates and so goodness will be maximised meaning
<br>
that any unjustly suffering being throughout the
<br>
multiverse will be recognised as needing to be
<br>
urgently rescued from their suffering. As Eliezer has
<br>
said, higher level intelligences which have the
<br>
ability to make choices can configure the subjective
<br>
conditional probability weightings, applying for each
<br>
subjective state throughout the multiverse. This means
<br>
that is it overwhelming likely that if you are in a
<br>
Hell state you will *immediately* be rescued. From
<br>
moment to moment the probabilities will always be in
<br>
your favour and so the vast majority of hell-suffering
<br>
beings will have a very fleeting experiance of this
<br>
suffering. This is certainly true at Level III, its
<br>
difficult to see how FAI can maintain such dominance
<br>
at the Level IV however. Note that by 'FAI' here im
<br>
not just referring to friendly AI but friendliness and
<br>
goodness in general or the 'godly nature' of all
<br>
beings, so this helps the earlier sections of the
<br>
multiverse if FTL communication turns out to be
<br>
impossible, but i am assuming that godliness of beings
<br>
is ubiquitously dominant over say petty-mindedness or
<br>
mere rationality.
<br>
<p>Another thing to be said is that hells are less
<br>
reasonable than Apothesis'. We can all see why
<br>
intelligent beings have reasons to want Apotheosis and
<br>
the empathetic motivations for allowing others to
<br>
experiance this, but it is difficult to see why they
<br>
would also want Hell. Given that they are less
<br>
reasonable, they would presumably require more
<br>
explanation, they may even warrant greater Kolmogorov
<br>
complexity as you increase the number of descriptive
<br>
specifications - that would mean apotheosis' have
<br>
naturally higher probabilistic occurence frequencies
<br>
than hells, among all worlds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But but but...when i talk about &quot;the cusp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infinitesimalism&quot; im not joking. Im well aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ridiculously low probability involved subjectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remaining for any extended length of time in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world. Those sentients on the very cusp however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; follow a trajectory which a hypothesized devil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; delight in i.e. those that necessarily experiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indefinate extended (and heightened) pain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering, are just as real as You and I. The fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we are aware of the existance of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shocking. Its especially shocking to learn that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is absolutely nothing we can do about it, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; word &quot;necessary&quot; implies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it is all pretty darn hypothetical really.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is amusing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the list is beginning to look like a discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Tibetan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhism with hell worlds and the equivalent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloud dakini 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>In *your* eyes it is hypothetical, in *my* eyes it is
<br>
hard theory. I would never refer to the &quot;tegmark
<br>
hypothesis&quot;. Perhaps you have lived so long in
<br>
limboland that you have a hard time trying to imagine
<br>
either being in Hell or Apotheosis, but because
<br>
technically you *can* imagine being in those worlds it
<br>
means that they do exist. Your mind does not imagine
<br>
things which do not exist for the simple reason that
<br>
things which do not exist have no substance or meaning
<br>
and therefore cannot be imagined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given what i have said above how our empathy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used towards those that suffer most. Far future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (assuming they havent already abandoned their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empathy anchors) are going to have some obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems with this &quot;necessary-ness&quot;. In their time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space, all sentients around them will presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; living a relative bliss (Apotheosis state as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it) and its very difficult to see a need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local-use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of empathy in such a state. Why would you need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about someone who you already know is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; danger?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would it be rational to care about what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot conceivably do anything about?
</em><br>
<p>It wouldnt necessarily be *rational* but it would be a
<br>
travesty of human emotions if we didnt. Certainly *I*
<br>
care about those beings that suffer even if i cant do
<br>
anything about their suffering, am i being irrational?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not terribly interested in preserving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;qualities of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanness&quot; or any other artifacts and aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past states of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being beyond their usefulness and/or the happiness I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derive from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.   Why would I be?  I think it will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disservice to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves if we cling to what no longer serves us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squemishness or sentimentality regarding letting go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where/what we used to be.  Carrying all that baggage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really slow us down and even cripple us.
</em><br>
<p>I have a tendency to agree with you. But at the same
<br>
time we dont want to abandon our heritage completely.
<br>
It would be quite easy for us to sail off in the spock
<br>
direction and abandon all of our human emotions but i
<br>
dont think that this is really what we want to do.
<br>
Sure many of our emotions and complicated, unnecessary
<br>
and even silly but at the same time they identify us
<br>
with the emergent complexity that human culture has
<br>
managed to evolve over the millenia, they also help
<br>
weave great stories for the fictional charactors that
<br>
we can all identify with. I dont think we want to end
<br>
up in a uniform society full of scientific
<br>
rationalists and empty of artists, i think we still
<br>
want to preserve the lovers and the romantics and the
<br>
jealous feuds and all the other little idiosynchracies
<br>
that humanity has developed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I am currently in the process of jettisoning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of mystical/religous baggage, I have some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate understanding of this theme.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. Which religions? And what mystical
<br>
baggage have you jettisoned?
<br>
<p>Simon.
