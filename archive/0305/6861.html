&quot;I'm afraid the chances of uber machines destroying the world is far far
<br>
smaller than the chances of you just being off your medication.&quot; - Barkley Vowk
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't have any faith in a small INBRED group of people going off and
<br>
trying to whip something together without any mistakes when any mistake
<br>
could be fatal in the biggest way possible.  I want as many eyes as possible
<br>
on the project.  Yes, the more people who see it, the better the possibility
<br>
that people might steal the ideas and try to go for an illegal AI but I
<br>
believe that the probability of success of such is much less than the
<br>
probability of a big problem if you don't get as many eyes as possible on
<br>
the original project.&quot; - Mark Waser
<br>
<p>The probability that these people know the probabilities they claim to is probably
<br>
small.  Many people seem to be writing arguments supported by comparisons
<br>
between the probabilities of events they know nothing about (Barkley would seem
<br>
to be joking in his statement, however it didn't seem so after reading the previous
<br>
posts from him).  Certain cases where probabilities can effectively be contrasted
<br>
are fine and dandy, but these posts recently have gotten out of hand .
<br>
<p>I have never posted before now.  I prefer to just read, but some of these posts
<br>
by some people have gotten unbearable.

<br>
<p>P.S. I am not just picking on Vowk and Waser.  There have been plenty other cases.
