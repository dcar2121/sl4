<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Nature is not obligated to make her problems easy enough for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligent, informed non-mathematicians to understand them.  But of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; course people get quite indignant when told that a problem may be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  difficult for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world is not going to be inhabited by large percentages of super 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent mathematicians and is not going to be run by the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anytime this side of the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if you want to ensure that people generally don't do stupid things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re the development of AGIs - including applying inappropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulation - then you or someone is going to have to explain things to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public and the regulators in a non-arrogant way so that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grapple with the issue intellgently and effectively.
</em><br>
<p>As near as I can tell, this is unlikely to the point of being impossible. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can probably take Barkley Vowk as representative of the majority opinion.
<br>
<p>Sure, I have ideas.  Sure, I try.  But if Earth were not my home planet 
<br>
and I was looking it over and dispassionately estimating the odds, the 
<br>
odds would be pretty damn dim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many ways to do this even if the issue involved requires at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least someone to possess some arcane knowledge or understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People regularly rely on experts to advise them on things that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond their generalist knowledge or understanding.  And the successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  advisors are the ones that go to the greatest lengths to help the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advised to understand the issue maximally and then the advisors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establish a state of trust so that the very particular bits of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument that the advised cannot understand for themselves are accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on the basis of that trust.  Then the advised can go on an make lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of good decisions.
</em><br>
<p>No, I think the most successful &quot;advisors&quot; are the ones who willingly sell 
<br>
the illusion of understanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that this document shows that with a little bit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought and reflection and advice from experts even AGI programmers can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reduce the chances that an AGI will go into idiot savant mode and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy the planet/universe or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Showing several clear problem-solution pairs doesn't demonstrate that 
<br>
&quot;with a little bit of thought and reflection&quot;, AGI programmers can 
<br>
substantially improve their chances.  It shows that *those particular* 
<br>
problems, the ones in *that particular* document, may be foreseeable and 
<br>
perhaps preventable.
<br>
<p>If I wanted to be a really successful advisor, I could write the 
<br>
problem-solution pairs for simple cases.  People would read it and say: 
<br>
&quot;Gee!  I understand Friendly AI!&quot;  And then they would have an illusion of 
<br>
understanding that would lead them to listen to me, the expert advisor who 
<br>
led them to so easily understand this wonderful complex thing.  This I 
<br>
regard as unethical.  But it does, I think, form the basis of most 
<br>
successful &quot;advice&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that a two-way contructive dialogue between you and Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hibbard on this subject could get to this point of mutual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding fairly fast (relative to the present onrush to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity) - taking even a week or two of patient discussion wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be too long in this context.
</em><br>
<p>We could perhaps get to an understanding of why some given schema fails. 
<br>
To explain how to do it *right*, sufficiently so that Hibbard could build 
<br>
his own AI without getting killed; that is something that cannot be done 
<br>
in a week or two of patient discussion.
