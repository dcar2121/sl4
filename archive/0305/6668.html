<em>&gt; I understand your enthusiasm at what the Singularity may be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish, but I guess the cynic in me sees too many obstacles to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-profile so quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zeph
</em><br>
<p>I share much of Zeph's cynicism in this regard.
<br>
<p>If a few of us futurist fanatics are saying &quot;Yes, the Singularity is coming
<br>
soon!&quot; but the recognized leaders of the technology and science world are
<br>
saying &quot;Those Singularitarians are waaaaay out there!&quot; then who is the
<br>
general public likely to believe?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the general public accepts things that contradict the
<br>
consensus opinion of the scientific community only when
<br>
<p>a) they're listening to some pre-existing religion that they've bought into
<br>
<p>b) the thing in question provides a lot of personal gratification for the
<br>
believer ... e.g. new-age beliefs...
<br>
<p>The Singularity falls into neither of these categories.  It's not a
<br>
pre-existing religion, and for most people it's unsettling rather than
<br>
gratifying.  So not many people are going to believe in it until Bill Gates,
<br>
the tech columnist in the New York Times, and the head of the MIT computer
<br>
science department give it a rubber stamp.
<br>
<p>Could there be a way to work around this problem?  Of course.  But it'll
<br>
have to be pretty creative, and aided by a fair bit of luck.  I wouldn't
<br>
want to discourage people from making efforts in this direction if that's
<br>
what they're inspired to do -- but please be aware of the factors making
<br>
your job *really really hard*.
<br>
