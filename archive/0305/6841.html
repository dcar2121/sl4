<p>### Forgive me the big snip-out - I do not necessarily disagree with much of
<br>
what you write, but I would like to concentrate on the most pressing issue:
<br>
You and the government have a very limited ability to discern the
<br>
well-intentioned from the badly-intentioned in the context of FAI, and just
<br>
as importantly, from the misguided. It is relatively simple to tell a
<br>
bank-robber from an ordinary customer (by presence of a gun and by loud
<br>
demands for cash, for example). It is still impossible to tell the
<br>
difference between the really well-intentioned FAI researcher (i.e. someone
<br>
who intends to do good, and truly knows how to do it, as opposed to just
<br>
hoping he does), the misguided (good intentions but not smart or not lucky
<br>
enough to get the right ideas), and the evil (bad intentions covered with
<br>
politically correct verbiage about national security). This uncertainty is
<br>
due to our general lack of knowledge about how to build an FAI - you cannot
<br>
rationally regulate a non-existent field of research, because all of the
<br>
&quot;experts'&quot; guesses are as good as mine or yours at this point. Rational
<br>
regulation (both governmental and spontaneous) is only possible once some
<br>
experimental knowledge is available, to guide further research in an
<br>
incrementally modified trajectory. So, you are incapable of a priori
<br>
specifying rational methods of deciding which AGI group to support, and
<br>
which to wipe off the Earth, aside from winnowing out the ones with
<br>
expressly stated bad intentions - but such thugs are unlikely to be a danger
<br>
anyway, for many reasons. The elaborate chip-embedded safety measures are
<br>
not wrong (in fact I am a great fan of total transparency) - but they are
<br>
missing the point.
<br>
<p>It would be an extremely bad idea to specify a single enforceable clause
<br>
restricting AGI research to a specific path before it really gets off the
<br>
ground. Your suggestion of using &quot;human happiness&quot; as a reinforcement goal
<br>
is a case in point - I would see it as a horrible perversion to be dissolved
<br>
by nanotechnic goo and stored as a disembodied non-cogitating happiness
<br>
circuit, and yet this is exactly the kind of outcome one might expect from a
<br>
system designed around the maximization of human happiness.
<br>
<p>To make binding recommendations you need to know much more than you do now,
<br>
and the only way of learning is doing.
<br>
<p>Therefore, it is actually safer to give peer-reviewed support for lots of
<br>
different AGI projects, and to defer specific restrictions (to be imposed by
<br>
the most competent persons, AGI researchers themselves, and not by
<br>
politicians or bureaucrats without a track record of AGI achievement) until
<br>
much later in the game. And, simply don't bother with thugs and Prometheans.
