<em>&gt; I think the hardest thing for me business-wise has always been maintaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus and effort on important things I really don't give a damn about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally recognizing that this was a significant issue several years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helped quite a bit though, such that I now consciously expend a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort on things I despise but know are important.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah.  This paragraph describes my own experience fairly well, except that I
<br>
have also trained myself fairly well not to actually *despise* these things
<br>
... any more than I despise the necessary but not terribly scintillating
<br>
process of defecation ;)  [although, I admit I have been involved in many
<br>
business meetings that were substantially less scintillating than ... oh,
<br>
never mind! ...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Social perception is very hackable, and you can extract a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value hacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this space.  It is also a very interesting experience regardless, and pays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a few dividends in numerous areas.
</em><br>
<p>Yep....  15 years ago I was a purist and never wanted to sully my
<br>
philosophy/science/engineering mind with tedious, dubiously-moral business
<br>
and finance stuff.  I would still *rather* avoid business stuff as much as
<br>
possible, but it's certainly a lot subtler and more interesting and
<br>
rewarding than I thought it would be back then -- even though it can't
<br>
compare interestingness-wise to working on AGI, systems biology, or other
<br>
really deep scientific topics.
<br>
<p>There's no doubt in my mind that the percentage of my time I spend on
<br>
business stuff is well spent, in that this time buys the time of others who
<br>
are working on Novamente.  And I still do get to spend a lot of time on
<br>
Novamente AI stuff as well, though not the 100% I would like...
