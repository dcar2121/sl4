</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But for an unsafe AI to pose a real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threat it must have power in the world, meaning either control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over significant weapons (including things like 767s), or access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to significant numbers of humans. But having such power in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world will make the AI detectable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theoretically, yes.  Practically, maybe not.  Regular humans have such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powers in the world right now, and they are certainly not always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detected before they do something bad... or even most of the time.
</em><br>
<p>We don't have a way to inspect human brains in the way we will
<br>
inspect AI brains. And even if we could, we don't have the same
<br>
level of motivation to inspect humans. With AIs, inspection is
<br>
critical to the future survival of humanity.
<br>
<p>I should make it clear that even with a strong effort to
<br>
detect and inspect AIs, there is no guarantee that all AIs
<br>
will be safe. But without that effort, unsafe AIs will be
<br>
guaranteed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;                        so that it can be inspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to determine whether it conforms to safety regulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is too much of a leap.  Detection, I'll give you, is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if impossible to guarantee.  Inspection for conformation to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of regulations is simply pointless because:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) an AI will be able to self-modify into something different, thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making 'point-in-time' inspections of little value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) inspecting an AI will be an incredibly complex and difficult task
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requiring the intelligence and tracking abilities of a phlanx of highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tallented people with computer support, so it will take a lot of time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete, rendering such inpections out of date and therefore of little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value.
</em><br>
<p>I never said it would be easy. We must take the time and
<br>
effort to inspect every AI to make sure its design
<br>
conforms to regulations. Regulation certainly slowed down
<br>
construction of nuclear power plants (before construction
<br>
stopped altogether), and it will slow down AI development.
<br>
But there's no reason to rush.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think that determining the state of mind of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; programmers who build AIs is all that relevant, [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your opinion here is held by only a small minority of people.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with it because, in humans, state-of-mind effects what people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.  A person who wishes to improve freedom and security for all with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the minimum of violation of volition is going to behave quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently from a person who wants to be Emperor of the Universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state of mind of nuclear engineers isn't that relevant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; safety inspections of nuclear power plants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, it is the most relevent aspect of inspections.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear engineers in charge of the plant don't give a damn about safety,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then when the power plant does break (and they all do) it is unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that proper corrective step will be taken.
</em><br>
<p>In my book, I advocate screening the humans who will teach
<br>
young AIs. I make the analogy to the screening of people who
<br>
control major weapons.
<br>
<p>But inspecting designs is different than inspecting operations.
<br>
I'll grant that those inspecting designs may want to estimate
<br>
the intentions of the designers, but the ultimate judgement
<br>
about the design must come from an inspection of the design
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The focus belongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the artifact itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Correct.  But your statement seems to imply that the 'artifact' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unchanging.  This is untrue for any of the mind designs I have seen so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far, including the human mind.  Minds change, and an AI is going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster and more capable at changing its mind than humans are.
</em><br>
<p>We cannot let it outrun our ability to inspect. There will be
<br>
no rush.
<br>
<p>This is one area where I agree with the SIAI, in their
<br>
recommendation 8, &quot;Controlled ascent&quot;. A careful regulation
<br>
process is a good way to implement controlled ascent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The danger of outlaws will increase as the technology for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent artifacts becomes easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We agree on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But as time passes we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will also have the help of safe AIs to help detect and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inspect other AIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you assume to much.  You are assuming here that we will have safe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs before unsafe AIs exist.  If this does not come to pass, then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pooof!
</em><br>
<p>In the early days, AI technology won't be widely available
<br>
so inspection efforts can focus on the few successful groups.
<br>
No rush. Lets do the first strong AIs slowly, with the public
<br>
insisting on an intensive effort to formulate and enforce
<br>
regulations. Humanity can afford to take its time. It cannot
<br>
afford to get it wrong because of some imagined need to rush.
<br>
<p>By pointing out all these difficulties you are helping
<br>
me make my case about the flaws in the SIAI friendliness
<br>
analysis, which simply dismisses the importance of
<br>
politics and regulation in eliminating unsafe AI.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Bill
