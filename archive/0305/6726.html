<em>&gt; &gt; threat it must have power in the world, meaning either control

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world will make the AI detectable, so that it can be inspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to determine whether it conforms to safety regulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are worrying about an UFAI that has reached the level of intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be dangerous, yes? Somewhere above human level. AND, it has at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one very willing human servant at its disposal. Even IF (a huge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite unlikely if IMO) it can't use the Net undetected to get what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs done, the human will do its bidding. I'm sorry, but your scheme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described above looks rather silly in the face of such an adversary. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current government can't even catch lowly human-intelligence-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists very well.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not going to argue that a human accomplice cannot do a
<br>
lot of damage. And I do not claim that eliminating unsafe
<br>
AI is a sure thing.
<br>
<p>My real point is that without real political commitment and
<br>
resources for regulating AI, unsafe AI is a sure thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember, a being with such an intelligence level may very well not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursue power through the kinds of traditional means you may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagining. It could for instance, if it was good enough, come up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plan to build some working molecular nanotech and from there do whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wants. And it might be able to execute such a plan in an undetectable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion, barring a 100% worldwide transparent society.
</em><br>
<p>Nanotech and genetic engineering of micro-organisms are
<br>
huge threats independent of AI. I think human society will
<br>
devote large resources to detection networks for these
<br>
things (this already exists to some extent for micro-
<br>
organisms). It is far from a sure thing that humanity will
<br>
survive these threats. There is a new book, &quot;Our Final
<br>
Hour&quot;, about these threats and the very real possibility
<br>
that humanity will fail to meet them.
<br>
<p>But with these threats and the threat from unsafe AI, the
<br>
only hope is a strong political commitment to do what is
<br>
necessary to meet them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The danger of outlaws will increase as the technology for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent artifacts becomes easier. But as time passes we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will also have the help of safe AIs to help detect and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inspect other AIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even in such fictional books as Neuromancer, we see that such Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Police do not function well enough to stop a determined superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence. Realistically, such a police force will only have any real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of success at all if we have a very transparent society... it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would require societal changes on a very grand scale, and not just in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one country. It all seems rather unlikely... I think we need to focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions that have a chance at actual implementation.
</em><br>
<p>I never said that safe AI is a sure thing. It will require
<br>
a broad political movement that is successful in electoral
<br>
politics. It will require whatever commitment and resources
<br>
are needed to regulate AIs. It will require the patience to
<br>
not rush.
<br>
<p>By pointing out all these difficulties you are helping
<br>
me make my case about the flaws in the SIAI friendliness
<br>
analysis, which simply dismisses the importance of
<br>
politics and regulation in eliminating unsafe AI.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Bill
