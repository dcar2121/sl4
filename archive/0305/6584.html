<em>&gt; The reason i am more concerned with Hell worlds than

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients have it easy, they dont need to suffer. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course we can still empathasize with beings that dont
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer but thats a bit of a waste of our empathy. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans it is natural for us to react more to those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do suffer, and to extend our sympathies most to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who also suffer the most.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't tend to center my concerns or have my drivers 
<br>
centered around suffering.  It feels healthier and I tend to 
<br>
function better if I am centered on what is possible to acheive 
<br>
for self and as many others that I can possibly gift with new 
<br>
possibilities and share parts of life's adventures with.  It is 
<br>
a question of focus.
<br>
<p>I have empathy for suffering beings galore but it is not a 
<br>
primary driver.  I would much prefer to have no suffering beings 
<br>
requiring that kind of empathy to the extent I can.  I will not 
<br>
miss that sort of empathy (more again to pity in some ways) when 
<br>
there isn't a good target for it.  Nothing stands alone as a 
<br>
good to be preserved outside its useful context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming FAI, or the proliferations of FAI which have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a same basic ethical system NOT alien to humankind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are moreorless ubiquitous throughout the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the subjective probability of you quickly jumping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into an Apotheosis state if you are already unlucky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to be in a Hell state is very VERY high.
</em><br>
<p>How so?  It is doubtful that such a transtion is just a matter 
<br>
of the FAI's desire.  It might take a much more gradual movement 
<br>
to get *you* versus something wearing your skin across that much 
<br>
of a gap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But but but...when i talk about &quot;the cusp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitesimalism&quot; im not joking. Im well aware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculously low probability involved subjectively in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining for any extended length of time in a Hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. Those sentients on the very cusp however, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow a trajectory which a hypothesized devil would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delight in i.e. those that necessarily experiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indefinate extended (and heightened) pain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering, are just as real as You and I. The fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are aware of the existance of them is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shocking. Its especially shocking to learn that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is absolutely nothing we can do about it, just as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;necessary&quot; implies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it is all pretty darn hypothetical really.  It is amusing 
<br>
how the list is beginning to look like a discussion of Tibetan 
<br>
Buddhism with hell worlds and the equivalent of cloud dakini 
<br>
land.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given what i have said above how our empathy works:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used towards those that suffer most. Far future AIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (assuming they havent already abandoned their human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empathy anchors) are going to have some obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems with this &quot;necessary-ness&quot;. In their time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, all sentients around them will presumably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living a relative bliss (Apotheosis state as you call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it) and its very difficult to see a need for local-use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of empathy in such a state. Why would you need to care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about someone who you already know is in absolutely no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why would it be rational to care about what you cannot 
<br>
conceivably do anything about?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest that in order for these future beings to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep their anthropic empathy they will have to target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it elsewhere, to those beings that actually suffer.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why this is of overriding importance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And i see the obvious target of this as the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cusp of suffering implied by the Level IV multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All such worlds would be accessible by simulation, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the need for advanced beings to express their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heightened humanlike empathy may end up becoming quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a morbid pastime, as beings try to simulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling of being in a Hell world and experiencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense pain. 
</em><br>
<p>Whatever in the multiverse for?  If experiencing such cannot 
<br>
help the beings in question then it is little more than 
<br>
emotional masturbation.  It certainly is not rational.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; [Aside: Can there be such a thing as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia of infinite pain felt by a consciousness in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single moment? We had better hope not!!] Im beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think that at some stage, when advanced sentients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally reach the state of maximum local apotheosis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might be a very wise idea for them to abandon their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empathy, at least as we know it in the human form.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This could be an unnecessary sacrafice of at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of humanness though so im still in favour of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended ignorance holidays :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am not terribly interested in preserving &quot;qualities of 
<br>
humanness&quot; or any other artifacts and aspects of past states of 
<br>
being beyond their usefulness and/or the happiness I derive from 
<br>
them.   Why would I be?  I think it will be a disservice to 
<br>
ourselves if we cling to what no longer serves us just out of 
<br>
squemishness or sentimentality regarding letting go of 
<br>
where/what we used to be.  Carrying all that baggage could 
<br>
really slow us down and even cripple us.
<br>
<p>As I am currently in the process of jettisoning a lot of 
<br>
mystical/religous baggage, I have some immediate understanding 
<br>
of this theme.
