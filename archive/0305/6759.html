Hello,
<br>
<p>Perhaps there was a mix-up of sorts regarding my reference to SIAI 
<br>
looking for money because, in order to do what SIAI seems to be wanting 
<br>
to do, it doesn't take a deep analysis (I agree) to see that without 
<br>
money that's more or less impossible (under present circumstances).
<br>

<em>&gt; Hi, you wrote:
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; LW&gt; one of the most widely used man-made contraptions (money).
</em><br>
<p>Yet the discussion was about a flawed analysis in regards to 
<br>
friendliness, and the connection to values, and more or less such 
<br>
discussions do not really mention money as one of the core elements in 
<br>
society by which what we &quot;value&quot; gets measured, creating a set of values 
<br>
that are intimately yet subconciously linked with that tool by which we 
<br>
&quot;measure,&quot; &quot;store,&quot; and &quot;transfer&quot; that which we consider valuable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, as Douglas Adams points out, it's just little colored bits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper, it's all just symbols, etc.  (...)
</em><br>
<p>I take this is more or less in jest. Otherwise, your bringing up Douglas 
<br>
Adams as your reference to speak about &quot;money&quot; would be a completely 
<br>
unscientific reply to my longwinded paragraph. Up to sl4 standards? I 
<br>
mean, that's the reason I had to step back for a month, for bringing up 
<br>
issues refering to authors that are not considered, by certain list 
<br>
standards, to be real scientists.
<br>
<p>I'm not defending authors nor scientists, and I like Douglas Adams' 
<br>
work, and his references to money are quite on the mark in many ways, 
<br>
yet I would never have dared to bring up Douglas Adams as my &quot;scientific 
<br>
proof&quot; for anything related to the issue of money. But I can understand 
<br>
that being new to the list my posts are more closely looked at and any 
<br>
half-degree deviation from the purity of science will be scolded, and 
<br>
that those who are better known and have had a chance to prove 
<br>
themselves in their knowledge-ableness have more leeway. So be it. But 
<br>
it just points back to the issue that I seem to have understood Bill 
<br>
Hibbard as trying to make, i.e., that we need to further define what we 
<br>
mean by friendliness (and I add, &quot;Not just that&quot;) in order to be able to 
<br>
agree on something, especially on things as volatile or bound to 
<br>
interpretation as values. As an example, you wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So your longwinded paragraph above might be of interest to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined to sit back and wonder about the meaning of it all, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI's mission is to achieve things, not contemplate.
</em><br>
<p>I see that you don't value longwinded paragraphs, or that your value of 
<br>
them is lower (if not in negative) than short paragraphs that go 
<br>
directly to the point. Also, the sentence says that &quot;wondering about the 
<br>
meaning of it all&quot; is, more or less, a waste of time to SIAI's mission. 
<br>
It directly implies, too, that &quot;contemplation&quot; is not a worthwhile 
<br>
activity. So, for SIAI's mission, it is put into the box of the &quot;bad 
<br>
stuff&quot; that will not allow SIAI to reach its goal.
<br>
<p>Let me be clear here. I'm all for the need for friendliness in an AI or 
<br>
else, as Eliezer clearly points out, we'll be considered disposable. 
<br>
Unnecessary? Not &quot;good enough&quot; to allow lurking about? It's about goals, 
<br>
right?
<br>
<p>If you have a goal, and you want to carry it out, it would be an 
<br>
&quot;intelligent&quot; thing to do to analyze what it is that you are after, as 
<br>
well as what means you need to make that possible. So it was said: &quot;We 
<br>
need money.&quot; Okay, that's clear. But it is not intelligent, really, to 
<br>
go after the money without knowing what it is. It is philosophy, yes, to 
<br>
go after something you don't know what it is and, when you realize that, 
<br>
wonder why you are doing it? The funny thing is that most people in 
<br>
today's world arrange their whole lives around the &quot;acquisition&quot; of this 
<br>
thing we call money. But where you to ask them: &quot;What is money?&quot; they 
<br>
can't give you a coherent answer. They tell you how you can get it (by 
<br>
working hard, by gambling in Las Vegas, by robbing a bank, by investing 
<br>
in the stock market, etc.), but all those replies will _not_ tell you 
<br>
what money is, they will tell you how you can acquire them and, perhaps, 
<br>
a whole study can be made in terms of which kind of activity is the most 
<br>
suited for reaching your goal of having money.
<br>
<p>And Gary Miller replied to that very same posting with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; GM: If on Tuesday they have a paranoid psychotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI they restore him to Friday and try to determine what made him bonkers!  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they Should have left him read Gandhi's autobiography instead of of Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nixon's. Or maybe they just forgot to assert Gandi good, Nixon bad!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not of course try to define all the inputs that are required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a normal, social, and mentally healthy FAI or even attempt to define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what one of those is.  I leave that to the behavioral psychologists and knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineers.
</em><br>
<p>It wasn't a matter of defining all the inputs, but rather of defining 
<br>
what it is that we mean by &quot;friendliness.&quot; Replies are Gödelian in 
<br>
nature, just like waiting for an AI to say that it is intelligent. In 
<br>
fact, Gödelian logic works the other way round. In order for an 
<br>
intelligence to be intelligent, it must prove that it is _not_ 
<br>
intelligent. That's all very fine with intelligence, because its 
<br>
function is completely different than, say, friendliness. Friendliness 
<br>
is not a function, it is the result of a need, so it would completely 
<br>
undermine the goal of creaing a FAI to wait for it to prove that it's 
<br>
not friendly.
<br>
<p>It so happens that the _functions_ of &quot;money-as-we-know-it&quot; are 
<br>
contradictory in nature, to the point where, due to this contradiction, 
<br>
the behavior it incites in people who, as Cliff Stabbert said: &quot;(...) 
<br>
these symbols are real to the extent that other people behave as if they 
<br>
are real -- and in this universe, on this planet, at this time, most 
<br>
other people do behave that way.&quot; But _what_ behavior is that? Not just 
<br>
that money is real, but much more than that; one of the elements is an 
<br>
inherent induction of a kind of behavior that we might call &quot;unfriendly 
<br>
towards life in general.&quot; The kind of behavior money induces in people 
<br>
is akin to the pheronomal (chemical) communication in insects, where 
<br>
ants, for example, will be bound in their behavior due to the 
<br>
semiochemicals secreted by the other individuals. So your assumption 
<br>
that money is what it is because we look upon it as real and that 
<br>
therefore, since it's real, we shouldn't bother wondering what money is, 
<br>
this kind of attitude being exactly one of the fallacies in the 
<br>
friendliness analysis.
<br>
<p>If behavioral psychologits and knowledge engineers are left with the 
<br>
definition of friendliness, they will do whatever they feel is right as 
<br>
long as _they_ get paid for it. And who will pay them? Those entities 
<br>
that have the money. And what will they pay for? To further their own 
<br>
goals. And what goals will that be and how can you ensure that _their_ 
<br>
kind of friendliness (and the target of that friendliness) will make the 
<br>
FAI &quot;safe&quot; for humanity at large ... which is the goal of Eliezer, as 
<br>
far as I've managed to gather.
<br>
<p>Let me repeat what Cliff Stabbert wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; CS: SIAI's mission is to achieve things, not contemplate.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if you realize what you said, there. That SIAI isn't into 
<br>
contemplation. And written in a way that:
<br>
<p>a) it assumes that I am not a &quot;doer&quot; and merely a contemplator who 
<br>
doesn't achieve things and
<br>
<p>b) that contemplation isn't really something worth the time of those who 
<br>
are part of SIAI.
<br>
<p>You are probably referring to certain _kind_ of contemplation, though 
<br>
not at one of the first definitions of it: 1.&quot;The act of looking at 
<br>
something intently.&quot; Nor of yet another important definition of it: 4. 
<br>
&quot;the act of looking forward to; intention or expectation.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is part of human intelligence the ability to contemplate ahead and 
<br>
not do as certain insects do: plow ahead until they reach an obstactly 
<br>
and then try to feel their way around/over/under it. Upon reading once 
<br>
again my &quot;longwinded paragraph&quot; I found that you probably didn't catch 
<br>
onto many of the subtle comments; since money is not of interest to you 
<br>
except for _how_ to acquire it in order to fulfill your goals, the wider 
<br>
picture seemed too undefined to understand. But let me say something in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regards to money: When and if a Singularity comes into being and 
<br>
develops into a FAI, one of the _first_ technologies it will take a 
<br>
closer look at is man-made contraptions that are at the core of our 
<br>
&quot;unfriendly&quot; behavior towards each other and the environment that 
<br>
supports us. Using Bill Hibbard's very clear statement: &quot; (...) choosing 
<br>
between different value systems requires base values for comparing the 
<br>
consequences of different value systems.&quot;
<br>
<p>The value system we base our _other_ values on (such as friendliness) is 
<br>
the system by which we acquire what we need. That is, our so-called 
<br>
economic structure. Which is, basically (and in the present time), a 
<br>
structure based on a tool we call money.
<br>
<p>Friendliness is a behavioral pattern that has evolved because, through 
<br>
it, it ensures the survival not only of the individual, but of the 
<br>
species. Yes, Philip:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Frans de Waal ???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.emory.edu/PSYCH/Faculty/dewaal.html">http://www.emory.edu/PSYCH/Faculty/dewaal.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>... is the author I was thinking of. We can see that certain behavioral 
<br>
patterns that were considered arising in the human only are, in fact, 
<br>
part of the strategy of survival of many species.
<br>
<p>The other interesting aspect of money is that it is being created 
<br>
through a collusion that has left out the original consensus of &quot;what 
<br>
money is.&quot; In other words, the &quot;social agreement&quot; is one of imposition.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to convince anyone to look and contemplate into the 
<br>
issues regarding money, but I can assure you that there are thousands of 
<br>
places in the world where there are in fact people who aren't just 
<br>
contemplating the issue of money, but also doing something about it.
<br>
<p>Not that SIAI must get into that. I had just brought it up to show how, 
<br>
something as widespread as money, which is at the core of our base value 
<br>
systems (and at the core of the problem Eliezer and others are facing 
<br>
when wondering what kind of company or organization will have the 
<br>
capacity to create an AI), is something that we all take so much for 
<br>
granted that we don't even realize how our lives are ruled by it nor why 
<br>
that is happening the way it is.
<br>
<p>If Friendly AI is mean to deal with the issue of Poverty, then it _must_ 
<br>
look into money, since poverty is, per definition of how economy works 
<br>
today, _caused_ by how money works (not just what it is).
<br>
<p>But enough for today.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Leonardo Wild
