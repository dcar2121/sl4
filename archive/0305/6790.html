<p>I trust we are talking about very immature AIs here with abnormally 
<br>
slow maturation rates.   Five years is a very, very long time in the 
<br>
life of an AI of much real promise.  In five years an AI that had 
<br>
gone off track would be expected to take considerable countermeasures 
<br>
and be a *lot* harder to stop or countermand.   I am very surprised 
<br>
to see you speak in terms of noticing a problem five years later and 
<br>
doing something useful about it.  It seems very counter earlier 
<br>
notions of how fast a Singularity would ensue from a well constructed 
<br>
seed.  
<br>
<p>This also assumes that anything much less complex than the AI would 
<br>
be capable of dependably detecting flaws in its reasoning/motivation. 
<br>
This is by no means a given.  I would expect the humans, 
<br>
augmentation, tools and all to have a very difficult time 
<br>
understanding the AI for veyr long even &quot;smeared across time&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The flight recorder is not a magical device that automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notices any humanly conceivable failure of Friendliness before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do any harm. The function of the flight recorder is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve that problem but to smear that problem across time, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if you, as a human, fail to notice the failure at time T+1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the monitoring technology of time T+1, you can potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still notice that failure at time T+10 with the monitoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology of time T+10.  Rather than the young UFAI needing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceal its failure only from inexperienced programmers, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mature UFAI being old enough to conceal its failure from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced programmers, the young UFAI must immediately outwit all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced future programmers that will ever go over that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular moment of its youth.
</em><br>
<p><p>Except of course by then it may well be far too late.
