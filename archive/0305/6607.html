Lee Corbin said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, I too think that Einstein would have felt relieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if he'd lived to hear Everett's explanation.  The whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue for him was determinism, I believe, and the famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dice remark refers to the universe taking just one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible random branches.  MWI is, of course, completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deterministic.
</em><br>
<p>I think MWI is rather contrived, but you need to know a few
<br>
technicalities to appreciate why. Naively, it might sound
<br>
like this:
<br>
<p>1) Quantum mechanics says that some things happen completely
<br>
at random: one out of a set of possibilities occurs, for no
<br>
reason.
<br>
<p>2) The many-worlds interpretation says that every possibility
<br>
is realized: whenever such a choice-point is reached, the
<br>
universe 'splits', with one offspring for each possibility.
<br>
<p>This is MWI according to DeWitt, and it has some problems
<br>
which are widely recognized:
<br>
<p>a) Complementary observables. A quantum particle can't have
<br>
definite position and definite momentum at the same time.
<br>
When the split occurs, does the particle start out in each
<br>
branch with a definite position, or with a definite momentum,
<br>
or in some other state?
<br>
<p>b) Relativity. Is the whole universe copied at each split?
<br>
If so, what reference frame are we using? Alternatively,
<br>
one could suppose that the split propagates outwards at
<br>
lightspeed, with the parent universe dynamically cleaving
<br>
in superspace, but no-one has expressed this mathematically.
<br>
<p>c) Interference effects. Quantum effects such as the
<br>
interference fringes which show up in the double-slit
<br>
experiment require *recombination* of separated wavepackets
<br>
(in that example, the recombination of wavepackets that
<br>
have passed through the separate slits). If the universe
<br>
splits before recombination is to occur, recombination would
<br>
seem to be impossible, because the two wavepackets are now
<br>
in separate universes. So either universes can recombine,
<br>
or splits don't occur between measurements, both of which
<br>
pose further problems.
<br>
<p>All this is well-known amongst MWI advocates, and so most
<br>
of them prefer MWI according to Everett, which is a more
<br>
subtle approach. Instead of splitting universes, Everett
<br>
talks about &quot;relative states&quot; of subsystems of the universe.
<br>
Formally, this involves taking the total wavefunction of
<br>
the universe, and expressing it as a superposition of
<br>
&quot;product states&quot; of parts of the universe:
<br>
<p>z1|a1&gt;|b1&gt;|c1&gt;... + z2|a2&gt;|b2&gt;|c2&gt;... + ...
<br>
<p>(Just to explain: a,b,c,... are physical systems.
<br>
|a1&gt;,|a2&gt;,... are distinct quantum states of system a.
<br>
|a1&gt;|b1&gt; means 'a is in state a1, b is in state b1', etc.
<br>
z1,z2,... are complex numbers, coefficients in the overall
<br>
superposition.)
<br>
<p>The basic task of the MWI is to connect the particular
<br>
universe we see with the ensemble of universes implicit
<br>
in the supreme wavefunction. Everett does it through this
<br>
algebraic decomposition: you-in-this-world are one of
<br>
those physical systems, in one of those distinct quantum
<br>
states appearing in the sum above.
<br>
<p>But here's the very first problem: there's more than
<br>
one way of decomposing a wavefunction. One instance of
<br>
this is illustrated by problem (a) for DeWitt's version
<br>
of MWI, mentioned above. In the quantum mechanics of a
<br>
single particle, exact position states are represented
<br>
by &quot;delta functions&quot;, formal functions which are infinitely
<br>
peaked at a single coordinate and which are zero everywhere
<br>
else; and exact momentum states are represented by &quot;plane
<br>
waves&quot;, the sort of functions which show up in Fourier
<br>
analysis on multidimensional spaces. A generic wavefunction
<br>
can be decomposed into a sum over delta functions, *or*
<br>
a sum over plane waves (or indeed, a sum over many many
<br>
other possible sets of functions). Which &quot;basis set&quot; is
<br>
the real one?
<br>
<p>The same consideration applies to finite-dimensional
<br>
quantum states, such as the state of a qubit. Qubits are
<br>
normally thought of as existing in a superposition of
<br>
|0&gt; states and |1&gt; states, but they can equally well be
<br>
thought of as being in a superposition of |0&gt;+|1&gt; states
<br>
and |0&gt;-|1&gt; states.
<br>
<p>In the many-worlds FAQ, which is the most popular
<br>
exposition of MWI available online, a particular basis
<br>
is singled out for attention, but it's also explicitly
<br>
stated that this basis is preferred only for purposes
<br>
of calculation, it's not ontologically special in any way.
<br>
<p>There's a further step in the MWI according to Everett:
<br>
the construction of a probability measure. Again, I think
<br>
this involves the postulation of extra structure, rather
<br>
than being implicit in the wavefunction. I'm in the middle
<br>
of discussing these issues with the author of the FAQ,
<br>
and we haven't got to this step yet, so I won't say more.
<br>
But I just wanted to point out *why* the MWI is not as
<br>
natural as it might sound.
