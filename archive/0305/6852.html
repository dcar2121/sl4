Dear Eliezer&gt; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nature is not obligated to make her problems easy enough for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent, informed non-mathematicians to understand them.  But of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course people get quite indignant when told that a problem may be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult for them. 
</em><br>
<p>The world is not going to be inhabited by large percentages of super 
<br>
intelligent mathematicians and is not going to be run by the same  
<br>
anytime this side of the singularity.  
<br>
<p>So if you want to ensure that people generally don't do stupid things re 
<br>
the development of AGIs - including applying inappropriate regulation - 
<br>
then you or someone is going to have to explain things to the public 
<br>
and the regulators in a non-arrogant way so that they grapple with the 
<br>
issue intellgently and effectively.
<br>
<p>There are many ways to do this even if the issue involved requires at 
<br>
least someone to possess some arcane knowledge or understanding.
<br>
<p>People regularly rely on experts to advise them on things that are 
<br>
beyond their generalist knowledge or understanding.  And the 
<br>
successful advisors are the ones that go to the greatest lengths to help 
<br>
the advised to understand the issue maximally and then the advisors 
<br>
establish a state of trust so that the very particular bits of the argument 
<br>
that the advised cannot understand for themselves are accepted on the 
<br>
basis of that trust.  Then the advised can go on an make lots of good 
<br>
decisions.
<br>
<p>So the existence of a problem that has elements that can only be 
<br>
understood by ultra-experts is not a basis for abandoning democracy or 
<br>
real dialogue.  This is because such problems come up all the time in 
<br>
almost every aspect of modern complex human society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, bearing that in mind, you might start at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://intelligence.org/CFAI/design/structure/why.html">http://intelligence.org/CFAI/design/structure/why.html</a> 
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for  this reference.  I've just read it.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that this document shows that with a little bit of thought 
<br>
and reflection and advice from experts even AGI programmers can 
<br>
reduce the chances that an AGI will go into idiot savant mode and 
<br>
destroy the planet/universe or whatever.  
<br>
<p>It seems to me that a two-way contructive dialogue between you and 
<br>
Bill Hibbard on this subject could get to this point of mutual 
<br>
understanding fairly fast (relative to the present onrush to the 
<br>
singularity) - taking even a week or two of patient discussion wouldn't 
<br>
be too long in this context.
<br>
<p>And this being so it should be possible for people like Bill, who I 
<br>
suspect would have a better chance of talking contructively with the 
<br>
public and potential regulators, could ensure that the public and the 
<br>
potential regulators in turn are brought up to speed and able to make 
<br>
reasonably sensible decisions.
<br>
<p>I don't think it's very hard to come up with a two pronged strategy 
<br>
something like:
<br>
<p>-   self-regulation by AGI development teams, in a mature and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible way, is the first line of defence against an AGI-led
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disaster
<br>
<p>-   but bearing in mind that some AGI development teams might not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-regulate responsibly, then there needs to be a second layer of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regulation - this time imposed from outside for the collective good.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there are responsible AGI teams in existence then the highly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expert members of these teams, given that they will have striven
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mightily hard themselves to come up with effective means of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generating friendly AGI, will be in a good position to be expert
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advisors to the regulators on how to go about the regulation task in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an intelligent and effective way.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
