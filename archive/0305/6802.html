</em><br>
<p><p>You have completely missed the point.  I am not referring to the complexity
<br>
of the actual code, but the conceptual complexity of the design space.  Most
<br>
code in the world is of an exceptionally simple design.
<br>
<p>I design algorithmically sophisticated systems for a living.  Many people
<br>
have access to the code and fully understand what the code does, but for
<br>
many systems I've designed they still consult me before making any design
<br>
changes.
<br>
<p>Why?  Because the code is only a single (n-k)-dimensional slice through an
<br>
n-dimensional conceptual design space.  There is a vast amount of knowledge
<br>
and context that must be grokked if one is going to attempt to modify the
<br>
orientation of the &quot;implementation slice&quot; through the conceptual design
<br>
space and I've already taken many things into consideration which are not
<br>
expressed in the code.  It is the difference between fully understanding how
<br>
a specific car engine works and being able to design an engine to any given
<br>
specification from scratch.  One is a mechanic, the other is an engineer. It
<br>
is really hard for a mechanic to become a competent engineer by studying a
<br>
specific product of an engineer in detail.
<br>
<p>It isn't enough that people have access to and understand the code.  They
<br>
have to grok the entire design space the same way the designer does or they
<br>
will never *really* understand the code in a meaningful way.  What you are
<br>
proposing is a dog and pony show to give &quot;the people&quot; warm-n-fuzzy feelings
<br>
without actually accomplishing what it claims to accomplish.  It sounds like
<br>
a lot of wishful thinking and wasted time to me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In my experience, if one group of people can create it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then another group can understand it.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Can understand it&quot; and &quot;do understand it&quot; are very different things, and
<br>
the more complex the conceptual space the less likely &quot;do understand it&quot;
<br>
will be.  Throw politicians and government bureaucracy into the mix and,
<br>
well, I don't think I need to explain where THAT goes.
<br>
