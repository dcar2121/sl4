<p>Too bad Jeffrey Dahmer's parents didn't interfere with his
<br>
self-determination
<br>
and seek help for him before he exercised his self-determination and
<br>
raped,
<br>
tortured , and canibalized his victims!
<br>
<p>It is every parent's responseability to provide a positive role model
<br>
and encourage
<br>
healthy moral development to the best of their ability.  I would hope
<br>
that
<br>
if as child your parents found you mutilating animals they would have
<br>
had the
<br>
good sense to interfere with your self-determination as well!
<br>
<p>I would hope that if you developed an FAI and it developed the habit of
<br>
visiting
<br>
BDSM and hate group web pages that you would at least exercise some
<br>
judgement and 
<br>
at a minimum question it's motives in doing so!

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; they were going to do something sufficiently destructive.  I'd also

<em>&gt; talking about an AI and not a human child!  Just reach into a human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind and tamper like that?  Thank Belldandy my own parents didn't have
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; that capability or I'd be a nice, normal, Orthodox Jew right now.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if one of my children were suicidal (far from the case,
<br>
thankfully!!), I would try to help them to not be suicidal, via
<br>
medication, psychotherapy, etc.  What is this but &quot;reaching into a human
<br>
mind and tampering&quot;?  If they were confused and not sure they wanted my
<br>
help, damn right I'd try to push my help on them.  And after my
<br>
intervention had succeeded, in all probability they'd thank me.
<br>
<p>I have not had that kind of experience with my kids -- they're rather
<br>
weird (surprise, surprise!) but generally happily and well-behavedly so.
<br>
However I HAVE seen other parents deal with similar situations.  For
<br>
instance, parents of a kid who was taking way too many drugs, and
<br>
involved with a lot of senseless vandalism and violence and other
<br>
destructive behavior.  They sent him to a posh &quot;reform school&quot; --
<br>
against his protests -- and it actually did reform him, and now I
<br>
believe he's genuinely glad they did.
<br>
<p>You mention religion -- now, I'm fairly ardently non-religious, but one
<br>
of my kids is very interested in the Bible and shows signs of
<br>
potentially becoming a religious person.  Am I gonna try to force him
<br>
not to be that way?  Of course not.  Am I gonna tell him really clearly
<br>
and repeatedly and calmly what I think of religious dogma, and am I
<br>
gonna give him stuff to read reflecting a scientific view of religion?
<br>
For sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Because we have values for our kids that go beyond the value of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; volition/self-determination...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the kids' values for themselves?  Parents don't own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we may not own our children -- but when you're stopping your
<br>
2-year-old from running across the busy street even though their
<br>
volitional self-determination tells them to do so, there's some kind of
<br>
cousin to &quot;ownership&quot; going on...
<br>
<p>Compared to most parents I see, I tend very much toward &quot;children's
<br>
rights&quot; ... for instance, I have given my children the choice of whether
<br>
to attend school or not, and for a while they were home-schooled.
<br>
However, even I, as a lenient and child's-rights-respecting parent, can
<br>
envision many situations where I would unreservedly try to &quot;tamper&quot; with
<br>
my children's motivational structure (like the examples described above,
<br>
of suicidal or extremely self-destructive behavior).
<br>
<p>There is a radical philosophy of child-raising (&quot;Taking Children
<br>
Seriously&quot;) that believes parents should never try to coerce their
<br>
children at all.  See <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a> .  One individual
<br>
involved with this philosophy is physicist David Deutsch, a pioneer of
<br>
theoretical quantum computing. Before having kids myself I might have
<br>
agreed with this, but in the thick of raising three kids I have to say
<br>
it seems unproductively extreme.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But we presumably don't want a Friendly AI to take on this kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parental role to humans -- because it's simply too dangerous??
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I think it's wrong.  Direct nonconsensual mind modification 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems unambiguously wrong.  I'm not as sure about gentle friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advice given in the service of humane goals not shared by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual; that strikes me as an ethically ambiguous case of &quot;What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would humanity want to happen here?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is a big middle ground between &quot;direct nonconsensual mind
<br>
modification&quot; and &quot;gentle friendly advice.&quot;
<br>
<p>The kinds of things normal parents can and will do to affect their
<br>
children's motivations and attitudes lie in this middle ground.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the interesting moral issues pertaining to future AI's
<br>
interfering with humans, also lie in this middle ground.
<br>
<p>After all, if a superintelligent AI is going to interact with us, it's
<br>
certainly going to influence us, and if it's really clever it may be
<br>
able to achieve amazing amounts of &quot;coercion&quot; by indirect means.  It may
<br>
be able to lead us along just as easily as we can lead a dog into a room
<br>
it's afraid of, by tempting it there with doggie treats.
<br>
<p>Free will itself is a can of worms, now isn't it?  Can we tell a future
<br>
AI not to mess with our free will, when we don't even know what it is?
<br>
... and when we in fact know from cognitive neuroscience (e.g.
<br>
Gazzaniga's work) that much of our subjective experience of freedom and
<br>
conscious decision-making is illusory, being a matter of the conscious
<br>
mind making up decision-stories for things that the unconscious mind has
<br>
already decided. If the future AI understands human psychology at all,
<br>
it will understand the complexity and fuzziness of the distinction
<br>
between influencing a human's unconcsious and controlling its conscious
<br>
decision-making processes. Actually &quot;volition&quot; is just as tricky as
<br>
&quot;happiness&quot;, maybe more so..
