<em>&gt; So to sum up: the idea of even excellent-level programmers being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump into this without deep understanding is not an idea we wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemplate or encourage at this point. Hence, need for book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's a page he wrote about this recently:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?SoYouWantToBeASeedAIProgrammer">http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?SoYouWantToBeASeedAIProgrammer</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian Atkins
</em><br>
<p>I found that page very funny!
<br>
<p>Especially the line
<br>
<p>&quot;Seed AI. It sounds like a cool idea, something that would look good on your
<br>
resume, so you fire off a letter to the Singularity Institute indicating
<br>
that you may be vaguely interested in coming on board. &quot;
<br>
<p>The idea that &quot;Seed AI&quot; would look good on anyone's resume, is pretty
<br>
hilarious!!  My estimate of Eliezer's sense of humor has just been elevated
<br>
37.342 notches ;-)
<br>
<p>I think that Eliezer's ideas about who should or should not become a seed AI
<br>
programmer, are tied in with his idea that it's necessary to FIRST create a
<br>
complete theory of AI friendliness, and only AFTERWARDS start making an
<br>
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
<br>
<p>If you adopt the alternate point of view (shared by Peter voss and myself,
<br>
for example) that it's only through experimenting with real AGI systems that
<br>
we'll come to a real understanding of AI friendliness, then the story comes
<br>
out a little differently....
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, I find something to agree with in Eliezer's comments.  I have
<br>
found that most people who e-mail me and say they want to help out with the
<br>
Novamente project, aren't actually prepared to put in the amount of effort
<br>
that would be necessary to do so.  This is partly because the Novamente
<br>
design is quite large and time-consuming to master, partly because the
<br>
Novamente project's organization is not all that newbie-friendly (our
<br>
tutorial documentation on the code is quite limited; there's no IT helpdesk,
<br>
etc.), and partly because building a thinking machine is just damn hard --
<br>
hard enough if you're giving it full-time effort, let alone if you're
<br>
squeezing it in after work and during lunch your.  However, miraculously
<br>
enough, some folks have managed to learn enough about the design to
<br>
contribute meaningfully to the project even on a part-time basis...
