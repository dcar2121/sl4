</em><br>
<p><p>I generally consider the usual &quot;research funding&quot; to be an inferior type of

funding compared to some other more imaginative options, and so I would
<br>
probably ignore that altogether if I applied my intellect to the problem.
<br>
There are many sources of funding that are substantially more &quot;robust&quot; than
<br>
most research funding that do not require the attainment of time consuming
<br>
academic credentials.  There are many kinds of reputations that can be
<br>
turned into capital, people in research just tend to fixate on the academic
<br>
kind.
<br>
<p>To give a somewhat oblique example, if Jack Welch (the former CEO of General
<br>
Electric) decided to start an AGI company without spending a single dime of
<br>
his own money, I can guarantee you that his startup would have mountains of
<br>
capital at his disposal.  It could be (in our opinion) one of the stupidest
<br>
AGI ideas ever presented but that fact alone would not stop his ability to
<br>
obtain capital, and despite the fact that Jack Welch has exactly zero
<br>
expertise in the field of AI and wasn't investing his own money in the
<br>
venture.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that the obvious methods of funding haven't worked very well
<br>
for most AI researchers historically.  It is limiting to only consider the
<br>
best ways to get &quot;research&quot; funding.  Take a more strategic view and get
<br>
yourself some reputation and credentials beyond academic ones.  It isn't
<br>
that difficult to obtain reputation/credentials on a non-academic axis that
<br>
can be converted into serious capital for AGI, especially not for a bright
<br>
person willing to put in some work.
<br>
<p>What is your goal ultimately, to build stellar credentials in the academic
<br>
AI community or to build an AGI?  These are not the same thing.  And I
<br>
suspect the first person to successful build an AGI will have all the
<br>
intellectual credentials they need, whether they climbed the academic ladder
<br>
or not. :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
