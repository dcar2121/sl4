hi
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, the coefficients of &quot;mismatch states&quot; like |x=1&gt;|you=2&gt; should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become very small, compared to those of &quot;veridical states&quot; like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |x=1&gt;|you=1&gt;. But I don't see how that addresses the basis problem.
</em><br>
<p>The mismatch state's coefficient was 0 in the first place.  I had
<br>
added and subtracted a term like that to both sides.  
<br>
<p><p><p>I should go over the argument more carefully: 
<br>
<p><p>[1] say, the particle is in a(t)|x_1&gt; + b(t)|x_2&gt;  
<br>
&nbsp;where a(t) and b(t) are some functions of time. 
<br>
<p>So the system's total state is (a(t)|x_1&gt; + b(t)|x_2&gt;)*|you&gt;
<br>
<p>[2] You perform measurements attempting to observe the position. 
<br>
&nbsp;The new state becomes: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;|x=1&gt;|you_1&gt; + |x=2&gt; |you_2&gt;.     ---- (2)
<br>
<p>where you_1 is the part of you whose molecules in the brain remember
<br>
seeing the particle at x=1.
<br>
<p>[3] Eqn. [2] is just a snapshot in time.  The time-dependent solution
<br>
looks more like:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp(+it)|x=1&gt;|you_1&gt; + exp(-it)|x=2&gt; |you_2&gt;.     ---- (3)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>[4] Now, we want to interpret eqn. [3].  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If eqn. [3] could be written as:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[a1(t)|f=1&gt;|you_f1&gt;] + [a2(t) |f=2&gt; |you=f2&gt;] 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ [a3(t) |f=3&gt; |you=f3&gt;]  + ...
<br>
.                                                    ---(4)
<br>
for some basis of the particle &quot;F&quot;.  Where you_f1 means &quot;you having
<br>
observed the particle in state f=1&quot;, then that's a valid
<br>
interpretation.   
<br>
<p>Then we could say, &quot;Well, that's a valid interpretation... and then
<br>
the allowed states for the particles which one of the above &quot;you's&quot;
<br>
would observe in (4) are the various f's.
<br>
<p><p><p>[5] Turns out that the only way in which (3) can be put into form (4)
<br>
is by choosing the x basis.  If time were not an issue (viz. you were
<br>
just considering (2), then (2) can be put in the form (4) in *many*
<br>
ways).  But (3), the time-dependent solution has only one way of being
<br>
put in form (4).
<br>
<p>Again, note that (2) can be put into (4) in many many ways.  But the
<br>
issue is to put the time-dependent equation (3) into form
<br>
(4)----viz. we want an &quot;interpretation&quot; that is &quot;stable&quot; with time.
<br>
<p><p>[6] That way is 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[exp(+it)|x=1&gt;|you_1&gt;] + [exp(-it)|x=2&gt; |you_2&gt;]     ---- (3)
<br>
<p><p><p>Thus, once you entangle yourself with the system in a certain way,
<br>
there's effectively only one basis to choose from.
<br>
<p>That's just my understanding.  I may be wrong. I haven never studied
<br>
that math of decoherence. :(
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; So I still think you need an extra postulate in MWI, in order to single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a basis.
</em><br>
<p><p>Maybe that's true indeed. I really don't know at this point how much
<br>
of what I am saying is true and how much i am imagining.. 
<br>
<p>====================================================
<br>
unrelated but:
<br>
<p>BTW, if one were to survey what most GR/QFT professors believe in, as
<br>
regards the &quot;QM problem&quot;, I think that Everett intepretation would
<br>
outnumber all others combined.  It is my observation that most
<br>
professors who are puzzled by the &quot;collapse&quot; aspect of QM when growing
<br>
up---most GR, QFT, particle physicists, soon gravitate to the Everett
<br>
intepretation[1].  And that Everett intepretation is really the
<br>
&quot;standard&quot; now..  just not yet taught this way in first year QM
<br>
textboks.  Since they concluded that their &quot;QM issue&quot; is more or less
<br>
solved and there are bigger controversies to tackle in QFT etc., they
<br>
move on to QFT.. Once in a while, you find a few professors who got
<br>
turned off by the &quot;many worlds hogwash&quot; early on in their lives and
<br>
never gave it a chance, end up investigating nonunitary solutions..
<br>
And since these professors are the ones being seen as &quot;working on
<br>
basic interpretation of QM&quot;, this serves to &quot;keep the controversy
<br>
alive, at least in the minds of journalists&quot;.
<br>
<p>[1] BTW, they dislike the &quot;journalists labeling this a Many Worlds
<br>
Intepretation&quot; -- because that leads to observations like &quot;this has
<br>
got to be ridiculous, exactly how often does the split take place?&quot;
<br>
Q. Mechanically, there's just one wavefunction for the universe that's
<br>
happily following the Schrodinger's equation..  no splits..
