</em><br>
<p>First of all, as a member of the human race who has an
<br>
absolute belief in the existance of all possible
<br>
worlds, i can testify that whenever i contemplate
<br>
conscious beings in enduring hell worlds (for want of
<br>
a better phrase) it *does* provoke an emotional
<br>
response in me. This is mainly due to my awareness
<br>
that whatever i imagine does have a very real
<br>
existance, the instants of my imagination are all
<br>
presents and those presents exist in real time as
<br>
equally real as our present, they are co-happening
<br>
right now. Given their presentness and realness i dont
<br>
see how we can label them as members of the &quot;past&quot; or
<br>
even the generalised past.
<br>
<p>Now since i can certainly imagine things far worse
<br>
than the horrors of our past such as the holocaust,
<br>
you can see that i already have a hard time dealing
<br>
with this and yet my empathy levels are quite low
<br>
because i am a mere human (and a male of the species).
<br>
<p>Our recollections of the past are very different from
<br>
the actual past. The actual past is a bunch of
<br>
presents, and those presents co-happen with all the
<br>
other presents, but the past we remember exists only
<br>
as information patterns stored in either our memories
<br>
or embedded in the world as we know it and none of it
<br>
may be accurate in terms of representing the actual
<br>
past. For example time travel may have allowed our
<br>
descendents to change everything we know about the
<br>
past, including the holocaust or any event before
<br>
todays date and time, in the majority of QM histories
<br>
at the very least. Strangely this means that those
<br>
doubters of the holocaust who many see as ignorant may
<br>
actually be right when they say it never happened,
<br>
even if all the history books and history sources
<br>
disagree, our probable history may turn out to very
<br>
quiescent or nice without any significant horrors to
<br>
speak of.
<br>
<p>Anyway the point i was making was that a highly able
<br>
vivid imagination plus high levels of empathy plus
<br>
strong awareness of Level IV immutable processes is a
<br>
recipe for disaster for a mind which wants to remain
<br>
sane. The way to get round this problem of course is
<br>
to put a limit on one or more of the above
<br>
ingredients. Putting limits on posthuman minds may
<br>
seem unnecessary and contrary to your notion of the
<br>
freedom that posthuman minds will have, but presumably
<br>
those limits will be self-imposed. Each mind should
<br>
have the right to become insane if ve wishes, but i
<br>
think most would choose sanity over insanity so there
<br>
may be many instances in which there is a balancing
<br>
act wherever there is a potential conflict between
<br>
higher level extreme cognitive abilities which
<br>
posthumans will no doubt possess. The above is just
<br>
one example.
<br>
<p>The message seems to be: instead of trying to
<br>
concentrate on creating artificial super-intelligence
<br>
however possible, we should focus instead on trying to
<br>
replicate the exact nature of the human mind but in an
<br>
artificial substrate. The human mind is a proven
<br>
model. Its out there and it funtions well in our
<br>
environment as evolution intended, we know it works.
<br>
If we instead focus all our energy on creating that
<br>
all explosive Singularity yielding self-bootstrapping
<br>
seedAI with a model that we think will work just
<br>
because we know it will have the intelligence of
<br>
humans and has the ability to quickly surpass human
<br>
intelligence, then many things could go wrong.
<br>
Intelligence could interfere with friendliness,
<br>
empathy could interfere with imagination etc. There
<br>
may be many such unforseeable conflicts which could
<br>
turn our good Singularity into a very disasterous
<br>
Singularity. Imagine the first supposed FAI quickly
<br>
gaining intelligence and power and also quickly
<br>
becoming insane in the process perhaps because of its
<br>
liberal ability to evolve in anyway it chooses
<br>
resulting in a design conflict, humanity would
<br>
unlikely be able to do anything about this having not
<br>
got an SI psychiatrist on stand by.
<br>
<p>I put my trust in evolution far more than human
<br>
design. Evolution has had millions of years to slowly
<br>
tinker and experiment resulting in our very stable and
<br>
balanced human minds. Replicating the human mind
<br>
artificially would be another stable stepping block
<br>
toward the creation of SIs, and this method is a lot
<br>
safer. In short we should learn to walk before we rush
<br>
ahead.
<br>
<p>Simon.
