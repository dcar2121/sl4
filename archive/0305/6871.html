Unfortunately, I agree with Mark that there's a lot of danger in a small
<br>
inbred group of people going off and trying to whip a seed AI together, and
<br>
I also agree with Eliezer that gov't regulation is unlikely to effectively
<br>
manage the seed AI problem.
<br>
<p>I think Eliezer is absolutely right that understanding Friendly AI is a damn
<br>
hard problem.  I don't agree with his pessimistic assessment that creating a
<br>
seed AI without a full understanding of Friendliness is almost sure to lead
<br>
to dire consequences, though.  I think that Matt Stewart's comment on
<br>
probability estimates is pertinent here.  We just don't know!  And knowing
<br>
in advance is going to be mighty hard.
<br>
<p>I am hoping, as I've said before &amp; will say again, that experimentation with
<br>
near-human-level AGI systems will allow us to learn a lot more about AI's
<br>
and their moralities and their dynamics under self-modification.  Maybe this
<br>
will teach us enough to really seriously address the damn hard problem at
<br>
hand...

<em>&gt; Wow, Eliezer.  I hope that you're just having a bad day and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your new public relations policy.  Factually, you're mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude and condescension are way over the top and you don't seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making any effort to understand what others are saying or to help them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want a good example of a regulation that might work, try something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sets up an advisory board of the right people (you can even include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself on it)that constantly reviews all certified projects, evaluates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their current risks, and takes appropriate action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have any faith in a small INBRED group of people going off and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to whip something together without any mistakes when any mistake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be fatal in the biggest way possible.  I want as many eyes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the project.  Yes, the more people who see it, the better the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people might steal the ideas and try to go for an illegal AI but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that the probability of success of such is much less than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of a big problem if you don't get as many eyes as possible on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An even better idea would be to work out an ethics system before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI system.  My belief is that an ethics system should actually follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straight from your &quot;rationality&quot; project - - speaking of which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going?

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like you to explain why in language that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-mathematican can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; understand.  If you can't get around to explaining your ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that an intelligent, informed non-mathematician can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are commiting yourself to fail to communicate with the people you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to pusuade not to adopt Bill's approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nature is not obligated to make her problems easy enough for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; informed non-mathematicians to understand them.  But of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quite indignant when told that a problem may be too difficult for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe, *maybe* if it's someone like a physicist, a nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already-established famously difficult area of science, someone might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; willing to believe that this field is too difficult to be grasped over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lunch.  Why?  Because it taps into the ready-made &quot;witch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctor&quot; instinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for understanding a field as arcane and barred to outsiders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lacking any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; established witch doctors, of course, the presumption must be that your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinions are as good as anyone's and that the problem itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, oh, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as simple as anything else your brain expects to run into.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hunter-gatherers don't confront hard scientific problems.  But just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because there isn't a field of AI with an established,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confirmed theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence, and scientists with reputations for being in a difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; field, does not mean that the problem of AI will be simple.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difficulty is set by Nature.  I might try to explain the problem to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent, informed non-mathematician.  But remember that Nature is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; under no obligation *whatsoever* to make the problem comprehensible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you are doing something that will, in fact, kill you, Nature is under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no obligation to make this obvious to you.  Nature has no privileged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tendency to avoid killing people whenever her reasons cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to an intelligent, informed non-mathematician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
