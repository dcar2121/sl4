zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzHi, Leonarda Wild wrote:

<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, as Douglas Adams points out, it's just little colored bits of

</em><br>
<p>LW&gt; I take this is more or less in jest. Otherwise, your bringing up Douglas 
<br>
LW&gt; Adams as your reference to speak about &quot;money&quot; would be a completely 
<br>
LW&gt; unscientific reply to my longwinded paragraph. Up to sl4 standards? I 
<br>
LW&gt; mean, that's the reason I had to step back for a month, for bringing up 
<br>
LW&gt; issues refering to authors that are not considered, by certain list 
<br>
LW&gt; standards, to be real scientists.
<br>
<p>I believe the issue was (and Eliezer can correct me) that whoever was
<br>
being cited was not doing real science, not whether they &quot;are&quot; real
<br>
scientists.
<br>
<p>Douglas Adams' observation about money is by no means unique, but it
<br>
is a nice compact formulation.  Money only has value in people's
<br>
minds, but it has &quot;real&quot; value because of this -- i.e., other people
<br>
believe that my twenty dollar bill has value and act accordingly,
<br>
therefore I can act as if it has value.
<br>
<p>LW&gt; I'm not defending authors nor scientists, and I like Douglas Adams' 
<br>
LW&gt; work, and his references to money are quite on the mark in many ways, 
<br>
LW&gt; yet I would never have dared to bring up Douglas Adams as my &quot;scientific 
<br>
LW&gt; proof&quot; for anything related to the issue of money.
<br>
<p>I did not cite him as &quot;scientific proof&quot;.
<br>
<p>LW&gt; But I can understand 
<br>
LW&gt; that being new to the list my posts are more closely looked at and any 
<br>
LW&gt; half-degree deviation from the purity of science will be scolded, and 
<br>
LW&gt; that those who are better known and have had a chance to prove 
<br>
LW&gt; themselves in their knowledge-ableness have more leeway. So be it.
<br>
<p>Oh dear.  Do you often feel victimised?
<br>
<p>LW&gt; But 
<br>
LW&gt; it just points back to the issue that I seem to have understood Bill 
<br>
LW&gt; Hibbard as trying to make, i.e., that we need to further define what we 
<br>
LW&gt; mean by friendliness (and I add, &quot;Not just that&quot;) in order to be able to 
<br>
LW&gt; agree on something, especially on things as volatile or bound to 
<br>
LW&gt; interpretation as values. As an example, you wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So your longwinded paragraph above might be of interest to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inclined to sit back and wonder about the meaning of it all, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SIAI's mission is to achieve things, not contemplate.
</em><br>
<p>LW&gt; I see that you don't value longwinded paragraphs, or that your value of 
<br>
LW&gt; them is lower (if not in negative) than short paragraphs that go 
<br>
LW&gt; directly to the point.
<br>
<p>You see incorrectly.  I value paragraphs of the right length to make
<br>
their point.  Yours did not, in my estimation, have any real point at
<br>
all: discussing the abstract meaning, underlying values, whatever, of
<br>
money in the context of SIAI's request for same seems completely
<br>
irrelevant to me.
<br>
<p>LW&gt; Also, the sentence says that &quot;wondering about the
<br>
LW&gt; meaning of it all&quot; is, more or less, a waste of time to SIAI's mission. 
<br>
LW&gt; It directly implies, too, that &quot;contemplation&quot; is not a worthwhile 
<br>
LW&gt; activity. So, for SIAI's mission, it is put into the box of the &quot;bad 
<br>
LW&gt; stuff&quot; that will not allow SIAI to reach its goal.
<br>
<p>Again, you misinterpret.  Stating that contemplation is not SIAI's
<br>
mission is not the same as stating contemplation is not valuable to
<br>
SIAI's mission -- in fact, much of what SIAI has done so far could be
<br>
described as very deep contemplation of the issues of Seed AI.  This
<br>
is contemplation in the service of its mission: achieving a friendly
<br>
singularity. 
<br>
<p>LW&gt; Let me be clear here. I'm all for the need for friendliness in an AI or 
<br>
LW&gt; else, as Eliezer clearly points out, we'll be considered disposable. 
<br>
LW&gt; Unnecessary? Not &quot;good enough&quot; to allow lurking about? It's about goals, 
<br>
LW&gt; right?
<br>
<p>LW&gt; If you have a goal, and you want to carry it out, it would be an 
<br>
LW&gt; &quot;intelligent&quot; thing to do to analyze what it is that you are after, as 
<br>
LW&gt; well as what means you need to make that possible. So it was said: &quot;We 
<br>
LW&gt; need money.&quot; Okay, that's clear. But it is not intelligent, really, to 
<br>
LW&gt; go after the money without knowing what it is.
<br>
<p>Come on, the money is a means to their goal, not SIAI's goal.  You are
<br>
being willfully obtuse.
