-- SPOILERS AHOY --

<p>JML&gt; Maybe even more than human. The diverse and free-willed nature of the
<br>
JML&gt; rogues in the Matrix (and the fact that there were self-acting rogues 
<br>
JML&gt; at all) completely changed my in-movie &quot;worldview&quot;. The hegemonic 
<br>
JML&gt; Matrix turned out to be a loose system exploiting and controlling 
<br>
JML&gt; agents with varying loyalties and capabilities.
<br>
<p>JML&gt; In Matrix Reloaded, Neo was even an expected aspect of the system.
<br>
<p>Aye.  And the only Free Agent turned out to be Smith...
<br>
<p>JML&gt; Although there are many annoying elements to the Matrix, the movie has 
<br>
JML&gt; many of the benefits of an ancient Greek play. Well, hazards, too. 
<br>
JML&gt; These philosophical perspectives are very hard to convey without the 
<br>
JML&gt; long monologues, silly premises, and hyper-allegorical characters. The 
<br>
JML&gt; effects offered the characters a good mask to hide behind.
<br>
<p>Agreed.  I'm very curious how the third part turns out.  I don't think
<br>
most people will get what they're expecting (well, yes, there will be
<br>
more eyecandy).  I've read a few interesting analyses that make much
<br>
of the Gnostic symbolism and names used, which points in some
<br>
interesting directions.
<br>
<p>JML&gt; The Matrix has a lot to offer us in terms of how we deal with 
<br>
JML&gt; potentially dangerous machines, on a moral level, and on a practical 
<br>
JML&gt; level.
<br>
<p>I don't think The Matrix is about machines and technology, despite
<br>
initial appearances.
<br>
<p>[On a separate note, I thought the Wall of Neos effect was neat, and
<br>
that something along its lines would be an interesting way to convey
<br>
_Dune_'s internal multitudes.  The crucial element lost in _Dune_'s
<br>
translations to the screen has been the inner world and I'd love to
<br>
see somebody take a whack at it.  Maybe Peter Jackson and the
<br>
Wachowski brothers could team up with the set &amp; costume designer from
<br>
The Fifth Element...damn, I just managed to make myself salivate*.]
<br>
<p>I have to admit that I was a bit underwhelmed by the first movie.  The
<br>
effects rocked, but the story seemed like so much cheap coffeeshop
<br>
philosophy mixed with bad pulp scifi (humans as batteries, the machines
<br>
have taken over, etc.).  Better than most mindless Hollywood crap, of
<br>
course, but I had seen similar ideas presented better elsewhere.  I
<br>
was pleasantly surprised by Matrix Reloaded; it appears that what Neo
<br>
was lead to believe was just another cover story.
<br>
<p>I look forward to further onion peeling in part 3.
