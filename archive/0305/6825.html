A much-delayed reply to these posts... I've been discussing another 
<br>
interpretation
<br>
(John Cramer's &quot;transactional interpretation&quot;) elsewhere, and have come to 
<br>
the
<br>
conclusion that to make any progress on this question (the truth about QM), 
<br>
one
<br>
has to think about all the various interpretations (hidden variables, many 
<br>
worlds,
<br>
time-symmetric, spontaneous collapse) at once, because they have all sorts 
<br>
of
<br>
unexpected connections... and that this is going to be slow hard work, 
<br>
because
<br>
two things have to be done:
<br>
<p>(i) Get the technicalities of each interpretation right.
<br>
(ii) Get them to 'talk to each other' - establish a common frame of 
<br>
reference.
<br>
<p>I will spare you all my current thoughts about those connections, since they
<br>
are a work in progress, but interested parties might want to look at the 
<br>
arxiv.org
<br>
preprints hep-th/0302111 (which I think is pointing the way towards an
<br>
Everett-derived &quot;one-history&quot; interpretation) and quant-ph/0305089.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, the coefficients of &quot;mismatch states&quot; like |x=1&gt;|you=2&gt; should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become very small, compared to those of &quot;veridical states&quot; like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; |x=1&gt;|you=1&gt;. But I don't see how that addresses the basis problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The mismatch state's coefficient was 0 in the first place.  I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;added and subtracted a term like that to both sides.
</em><br>
<p>I was describing an effect of decoherence (mismatch coefficients become
<br>
small). In your argument (see <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0305/6592.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0305/6592.html</a>),
<br>
you are basically taking this effect for granted and setting those numbers
<br>
equal to zero. Which is OK as an approximation, precisely *because* of
<br>
decoherence, but there should in actuality be an infinitesimal (but still
<br>
nonzero) amplitude for cross-terms in your equation (3).
<br>
<p>In any case, I think the crucial step is this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, note that (2) can be put into (4) in many many ways.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue is to put the time-dependent equation (3) into form
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(4)----viz. we want an &quot;interpretation&quot; that is &quot;stable&quot; with time.
</em><br>
<p>Who says? Where does this condition come from? This looks to me
<br>
like an &quot;extra postulate&quot;.
<br>
<p>Amongst the experts, I think the most popular way to pick the many
<br>
worlds out of the wavefunction is via 'decoherent coarse-grained
<br>
histories'. Each history is specified by a time series of projection 
<br>
operators,
<br>
and it's required that each history decoheres from each other history,
<br>
where this is calculated using a 'decoherence functional' constructed
<br>
from the Hamiltonian. There is a brief exposition of this in the second
<br>
paper above, by Hartle. But an important point is that there is no
<br>
canonical set of decoherent histories associated with a particular
<br>
wavefunction, not even a canonical 'maximal set' (no extra histories
<br>
or finer graining of operators possible). So it's the basis problem again,
<br>
at a more sophisticated level.

<p><em>&gt;I suggest that you post your question to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Fabric of Reality list, where Deutsch himself often answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;queries.
</em><br>
<p>I tried posting there years ago, a question about Deutsch's &quot;shadow
<br>
photons&quot;. Early in his book he says that the double-slit diffraction
<br>
pattern can be explained by the effect on photons in our world of
<br>
&quot;shadow photons&quot; in the worlds next door. My question was along
<br>
the lines: Can you mathematically describe this in terms of interactions
<br>
between individual shadow photons and individual photons in this
<br>
world? I don't think he could, in which case this way of speaking is
<br>
misleading. As I recall, I posted my question, it never showed up,
<br>
the moderator hadn't seen it, and I just lost patience and stopped
<br>
trying. I'll probably have another go eventually, but first I want to
<br>
work through my own version of many-worlds, in the context of
<br>
step (ii), back at the start of this post.
