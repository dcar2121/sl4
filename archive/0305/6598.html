</em><br>
<p><p>I more or less agree.  I would very much enjoy and love to see 
<br>
the book on rationality and think it could generally do much 
<br>
good in the world.  However, the more theoretical writings on 
<br>
FAI very much need to be broken down into some more accessible 
<br>
semblance of components and requirements for each of those 
<br>
components so that the actual programming work can begin.  Until 
<br>
that point is reached very few programming resources are going 
<br>
to step forward.  Without those, no matter how good the theory 
<br>
is, FAI will remain a pipedream.
<br>
<p>I also believe that open sourcing some of the components that 
<br>
are generally useful will be a much faster way of getting those 
<br>
components built than waiting for everything including funds to 
<br>
come together to do the job on a closed source basis.  A few 
<br>
good architects to create component subprojects and manage them 
<br>
as OSS would be easier to come by than many more master 
<br>
programmers dedicating their lives to a more closed effort with 
<br>
little or no working capital or compensation until a hopefully 
<br>
happy Singularity.
<br>
<p>I think there is a false assumption that useful people resources 
<br>
need to understand everything about FAI in near Eliezer-like 
<br>
depth before they can do a lot of very useful and needed work.
<br>
<p>Given that we believe both that getting to FAI is utterly 
<br>
crucial and every day until that point is full of huge risks to 
<br>
all humanity and that FAI is difficult on technical and 
<br>
theoretical levels, it seems to me we need to divide and conquer 
<br>
the problem as much as possible.  Otherwise stasis will prevail.
