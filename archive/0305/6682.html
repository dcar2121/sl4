Hi, you wrote:
<br>
<p>CR&gt; Let me put it this way. Imagine a *succesful* Friendly AI
<br>
CR&gt; programmer. Someone who really understands the process by which a
<br>
CR&gt; Friendly seed AI will change the entire universe forever, making
<br>
CR&gt; it a much better place for everyone. Can you expect them to get
<br>
CR&gt; involved in the (relatively) pathetic little quarrels that are
<br>
CR&gt; presently taught to us as human History? 
<br>
<p>I do get your point, but still think it's somewhat naive.  We, as
<br>
humans, don't deign to &quot;get involved&quot; with this trifling little matter
<br>
called history.  *It* tends to get us involved (cf. Joyce, &quot;History is
<br>
a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.&quot;).
<br>
<p>Presumably, being human and growing up in a human environment, the
<br>
people working on FAI will be embedded in human history -- have human
<br>
desires, human weaknesses, relationships with other humans, etc.
<br>
Becoming free of such involvement, for most people, is what would take
<br>
an effort, not becoming involved.
<br>
<p>I am not entirely convinced that (what-I-perceive-as) Eliezer's
<br>
attempt to be as unencumbered as possible with the extraneous
<br>
business of life, i.e. anything not related to achieving a friendly
<br>
singularity, is a) successful b) healthy or c) helpful to his goals. 
<br>
Perhaps it will turn out to be, but I'm certainly not buying an
<br>
argument based on imagination.
<br>
