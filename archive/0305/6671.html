<p>Sure, part of me wishes for an easier, simpler time.  But it's really 
<br>
an illusion that it was easier back then.  Sure it might have been 
<br>
low-tech, but dealing with tyrants, disease, irrationality, the unknown 
<br>
- basically everything we have now, but in much larger helpings back 
<br>
then.  We can't uninvent technology (short of annihilating humanity), 
<br>
so we might as well make the best of the direction in which we found 
<br>
the world.
