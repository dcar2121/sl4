(This post of mine consists of repeating some basic considerations. Feel 
<br>
free to ignore me, unless you're a luddite ;)

</em><br>
<p>The work of the singularitarian movement and especially the SIAI is all 
<br>
about developing mechanisms to safeguard radical technological development. 
<br>
I trust that you are aware of the concepts of Friendly AI and the Sysop 
<br>
Scenario, for example.
<br>
<p>I, for one, have been quite the luddite before becoming familiar with the 
<br>
singularitarian way of thinking, and have been really sympathetic to 
<br>
Kaczynski. It isn't rare at all to see singularitarians give a rather high 
<br>
probability of mankind blowing itself up in a few decades etc, and I don't 
<br>
think that we are underestimating the risks or not paying a lot -- if not 
<br>
most -- of our attention to them. And if the grim scenarios come true, I 
<br>
don't mind if someone considers the invention of agriculture a mistake.
<br>
<p>It is, however, totally irrelevant whether the invention of agriculture was 
<br>
a mistake. What matters is coming up with methods to cope in our current 
<br>
predicament. Have the luddites presented anything realistic? You're never 
<br>
going to get the majority, or even a significant portion thereof, to become 
<br>
hunter-gatherers again, and if you yourself and a few friends go back to 
<br>
the neolithic style of living, you've won nothing. The majority will still 
<br>
be perfectly, and increasingly, capable of destroying our planet etc. One 
<br>
doesn't even need a majority for that.
<br>
<p>Unless the luddites think they'll be able to stop technological development 
<br>
by force (thoroughly unrealistic; there won't be enough of them, though 
<br>
they are strong enough to hinder the positive aspects of technological 
<br>
progress, and unfortunately are somewhat active in this respect), their way 
<br>
of thinking is just a way of closing your eyes from the problems of the 
<br>
world. And that at its best.
