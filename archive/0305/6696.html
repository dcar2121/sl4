</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, anyone? Anything particularly notable or exciting emerge from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Foresight Conference?
</em><br>
<p>For those who are keeping score: Last year Eliezer helped lead a 
<br>
Special Interest Group last year on FAI or maybe it was AGI. Everyone 
<br>
who was there I think would agree that it went badly, in the sense 
<br>
that people who were interested but hadn't heard about these issues
<br>
left in deeper confusion than when they came in. Not one of them 
<br>
probably ever followed up. It wasn't anyone's fault. There was little
<br>
time and it seemed as if Eliezer (and Ben Goertzel and Peter Voss)
<br>
had their hands tied behind their backs because they really had no
<br>
chance of saying anything meaningful about their work in such a limited
<br>
amount of time.
<br>
<p>This year, however, after Eliezer presented to the entire group, it 
<br>
seemed as if everyone applauded. I genuinely felt that he got his 
<br>
messages across to many people at once. The talk was inspiring. I 
<br>
really enjoyed it. I have to say it gave me some hope. After hearing 
<br>
him speak and having the pleasure of meeting and talking with Emil 
<br>
Gilliam I decided I should finally read LOGI. I'm almost done. It's 
<br>
really great stuff. I can't believe I waited so long. 
<br>
<p>Other speakers of interest were: Lawrence Lessig, on how monopolies
<br>
will calculate exactly how much money they can spend to distort the 
<br>
social process to maintain their positions (through a negative process
<br>
which economists call &quot;rent-seeking&quot;). Also, for those interested in 
<br>
life extension, you might want to google: Aubrey De Gray. I don't know 
<br>
biology enough to critique his ideas, but by naming and arguing that 
<br>
there are just seven things keeping us from solving the &quot;death&quot; problem,
<br>
he has been able to focus the attention of many top researchers on 
<br>
the idea and will be having a conference with many of them later this
<br>
year (in Cambridge, England) Sometimes getting everyone to look a the 
<br>
same problem and talk about it is the first roadblock. All he needs is 
<br>
$1 billon over ten years to show it works in mice and then positive 
<br>
public opinion will cause a groundswell of funding to conduct the 
<br>
research for humans :-)
<br>
<p>As for this legendary after-party, I was sadly unable to attend.
