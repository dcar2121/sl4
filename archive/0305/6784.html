<em>&gt;&gt;I wonder why it is that government funding has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;been so much more effective in biomedical areas than in AI.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Government research grants typically require the principles performing
<br>
the research to be heavily degreed.  A successful track record for at
<br>
least some of the research team on prior grants is important.  This is
<br>
why independent researchers do well to team with universities that have
<br>
received DARPA sponsorship in the past.
<br>
<p>They also lean towards very narrow areas of research where research
<br>
methodology has been successful in similar problems.  The research
<br>
grants must be specific enough to survive an informal peer review.  Most
<br>
projects sponsors will ask their favorite past researchers in the field
<br>
for at least informal approval on most of the grant applications.
<br>
Grants should be able to spell out what quantifiable benefits could be
<br>
achieved for the taxpayers, DOD, or mankind if the research was
<br>
successful.
<br>
<p>It also does not hurt to get at least one congressman on your side to
<br>
help start the good old boy network rolling.  If it's a large project
<br>
and will create jobs in your state he may push harder to look good to
<br>
his constituents. Aka PorkBarrel...

<p>yeah, you do have a point.
<br>
<p>Biomedical research is not nearly as easy as you seem to suggest ... it
<br>
involves a huge number of insanely difficult, closely interconnected
<br>
problems....  However, I think it is true that there are clearer
<br>
gradual, incremental paths for moving toward solutions to these insanely
<br>
hard problems, than there are in AI.
<br>
<p>In biomedicine, the gov't research establishment has done a pretty good
<br>
job of dynamically and aggressively shifting funding to promising new
<br>
areas, and not overfunding &quot;ingrained ideas&quot; whose time has come and
<br>
gone.  Not a perfect job, but a pretty good job.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the habit of gov't funding in AI has been to
<br>
repeatedly fund almost the same exact research by the same exact
<br>
researchers over and over again, in spite of repeated failures.  There
<br>
has been interesting AI research, but the correlation between level of
<br>
gov't funding and interestingness of research has been surprisingly low.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I don't think &quot;biomedicine is easier in some ways than AI &quot; is
<br>
anywhere near a full explanation of the historical phenomenon in
<br>
question, though I agree that it does have some truth to it.
