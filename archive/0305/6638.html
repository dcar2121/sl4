</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; its exact set of rules) always comprise of 5 &quot;On&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cells/Pixels. Thus Level IV is full of immutability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it contains definite mathematical structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cannot be altered or distorted meaning that all
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This need not, however, imply any emotionally unbearable response on the 
<br>
part of an empathic mind.
<br>
<p>We are already familiar with realities containing unbearable suffering 
<br>
that we can never alter.  We call them the &quot;past&quot;.  Nothing we can do will 
<br>
ever unwrite the Holocaust; it is fixed.  Nothing we can do will ever 
<br>
erase medieval and modern torture chambers from the stream of time.
<br>
<p>Let us call the &quot;generalized past&quot; the space of reality mathematically 
<br>
unalterable by us; call the &quot;generalized future&quot; the space of reality 
<br>
which could conceivably contain a dependency on our decision process or a 
<br>
sufficiently similar copy thereof; call the &quot;generalized present&quot; the 
<br>
surface along which the generalized future becomes the generalized past.
<br>
<p>This makes resolving Newcomb's Paradox even *more* straightforward - you 
<br>
just need to realize that if the unknown past contains a sufficiently 
<br>
similar copy of your current self, then the unknown past can be part of 
<br>
your generalized future.  Your copy's decision in Newcomb's Paradox, and 
<br>
the contents of Box B, form part of the generalized future - even though 
<br>
they may be part of your past light cone - because they contain unknowns 
<br>
that correlate with your unknown-until-decided action variable.  It is no 
<br>
different from supposing that an exact copy of you exists somewhere in a 
<br>
distant galaxy that just happens to be part of your past light cone.
<br>
<p>Unalterable Level IV Processes, if they exist, may be counted as part of 
<br>
the generalized past - though of course it would be a terrible error to 
<br>
write them off too early.  At any rate I do not believe it would be 
<br>
necessary to erase the knowledge.  We already have emotional faculties for 
<br>
dealing with mathematically unalterable known horrors; we call them the 
<br>
&quot;past&quot;.  There is no definite temporal relation of an external Process to 
<br>
Bayesia in any case.  Since we cannot affect it, why not call it the &quot;past&quot;?
