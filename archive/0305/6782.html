Hello,

<p>No. Rarely.
<br>
<p>It is perhaps due to having started off with the wrong foot when the 
<br>
rules were not clear yet (to me). Seeing a lot of speculation about 
<br>
&quot;reality&quot; being passed on as &quot;scientific,&quot; has made me wonder where the 
<br>
redshift of science starts on this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;LW&gt; I see that you don't value longwinded paragraphs, or that your value of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant to me.
</em><br>
<p>I was making a point about values and using your comment as an example. 
<br>
You value what interests you. The question is: How to make a FAI value 
<br>
humanity so it will be friendly towards us and not look upon us as 
<br>
&quot;irrelevant&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; CS: &gt; Douglas Adams' observation about money is by no means unique, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a nice compact formulation.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Compact formulations don't always manage to show you the core of a given 
<br>
reality or problem. The problem with money is far from abstract. 
<br>
Naturally, if you have no interest in a given subject, you will feel 
<br>
that any deeper contemplation and perusal of it as irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; CS: i.e., other people
</em><br>
<em> &gt; believe that my twenty dollar bill has value and act accordingly,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; therefore I can act as if it has value.
</em><br>
<p>That's another issue. Do you really believe that &quot;my twenty dollar bill&quot; 
<br>
is _mine_ or if you hold the same that it is _yours_? If you hold money 
<br>
in your hand, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's yours, just as it 
<br>
doesn't mean that your renting a house makes it yours. But you do want 
<br>
to know what the terms of use are for an apartment. We use money without 
<br>
questioning it in the least, yet we still direct our lives towards the 
<br>
acquisition of it.
<br>
<p>And I'm not being facetious.
<br>
<p>It is one of the core problems with money-as-we-know-it. (And I say 
<br>
&quot;as-we-know-it&quot; because there are other kinds of money out there, and 
<br>
money has evolved throughout history.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CS: &gt; Come on, the money is a means to their goal, not SIAI's goal.  You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being willfully obtuse.
</em><br>
<p>Am I?
<br>
<p>I was trying to give an example of how basic values are based on what we 
<br>
value, money being one of the pivot points of our pyramid of values and 
<br>
one of the &quot;goals&quot; that so many human beings strive for nowadays ... 
<br>
without know what it is nor where it comes from. That's the absurdity of 
<br>
it. As absurd as us trying to &quot;create&quot; a being, an entity, that is 
<br>
friendly, when in our social exchanges we are veering towards something 
<br>
that isn't part of what I would consider friendly. In my view, one of 
<br>
the elements inherent in friendliness is some degree of respect.
<br>
<p>There seems to be a great effort in trying to ensure that friendliness 
<br>
can come into existence or be part of AI, though the descriptions I've 
<br>
read so far of &quot;friendliness&quot; (what it is and how it can be achieved) 
<br>
have not really been clear. So, if you or anyone can help me out in 
<br>
this, I would be very grateful indeed.
<br>
<p>Returning to the issue of &quot;values&quot; and what it is that we value:
<br>
<p>As a rule, value exists when three basic elements come together:
<br>
<p>1) An organism (an individual, a family, a community, etc.).
<br>
2) A need.
<br>
3) The quantity (of the needed thing).
<br>
<p>So we come up with the phenomenon that:
<br>
<p>&quot;The value of something depends on the inner need of an organism and the 
<br>
availability (and quantity) of the thing needed.&quot;
<br>
<p>This means that the measure or amount of “value” is not inherent in 
<br>
something without the existence of organisms and their needs.
<br>
Besides, there are also three qualitatively different types of value, 
<br>
and they are once again circumstantial:
<br>
<p>1) Cultural Value,
<br>
2) Subjective Value.
<br>
3) Absolute Value.
<br>
<p>Cultural value is whatever a group of people has, over time, considered 
<br>
valuable, the object’s inherent “value” not withstanding.
<br>
<p>Cultural value is something people can accept as “having value” even 
<br>
though, in practical terms, it may be useless.
<br>
<p>Subjective value is based on three aspects: an organism —be it an 
<br>
individual, a community, a company, a nation, etc.— has a need for an 
<br>
object or service. The value of whatever object or service will grow the 
<br>
less that object or service is available.  Also, certain things are more 
<br>
subjectively valuable than others (emotional, intellectual, spiritual), 
<br>
but if they enter the realm of “basic survival needs,” the subjectivity 
<br>
of something valuable can turn into a near “absolute,” that is, into 
<br>
“real” value.
<br>
<p>If not having a glass of water means that I will die, that glass of 
<br>
water has acquired a value so real and absolute, that so I'm willing to 
<br>
give anything in exchange for the water. In other words:
<br>
<p>&quot;Subjective value is a circumstantial phenomenon related to place and 
<br>
time and relates to a given need and the availability of what would 
<br>
fulfill that need.&quot;
<br>
<p>The third and least “measurable” type of value is absolute value:
<br>
<p>Absolute value is the value of anything that exists, and is immeasurable 
<br>
because the implications of absolute value go into the realm of the 
<br>
spiritual and of processes that can hardly be fathomed by our limited 
<br>
understanding of Reality.
<br>
<p>This means that truth of this type of value is so great, that we cannot 
<br>
grasp it. The closest we can come to comprehend “absolute value” is when 
<br>
we speak of “real value,” that is, when our existence depends on 
<br>
something and thus we come to value it “above all things.” In other 
<br>
words, real value is a type of “subjective value” directly related to 
<br>
our most basic needs of survival.
<br>
<p>&quot;Values,&quot; in this sense, are related to what we value. What 
<br>
does/will/should an AI value in order for it to be friendly towards us 
<br>
and those things that we need for our survival and subsequent growth as 
<br>
individuals and as a species?
<br>
<p>I believe that one of the keys to it is directly related to &quot;need.&quot; If 
<br>
we are not needed, an AI will have no reason to be friendly towards us.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Leonardo Wild
