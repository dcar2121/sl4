<em>&gt; &gt; As a parent, I would interfere with my child's self-determination if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they were going to do something sufficiently destructive.  I'd also try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to change them so that they no longer *wanted* to do the destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Angels and ministers of grace preserve us, Ben, I hope you were talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about an AI and not a human child!  Just reach into a human mind and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tamper like that?  Thank Belldandy my own parents didn't have that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability or I'd be a nice, normal, Orthodox Jew right now.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if one of my children were suicidal (far from the case, thankfully!!),
<br>
I would try to help them to not be suicidal, via medication, psychotherapy,
<br>
etc.  What is this but &quot;reaching into a human mind and tampering&quot;?  If they
<br>
were confused and not sure they wanted my help, damn right I'd try to push
<br>
my help on them.  And after my intervention had succeeded, in all
<br>
probability they'd thank me.
<br>
<p>I have not had that kind of experience with my kids -- they're rather weird
<br>
(surprise, surprise!) but generally happily and well-behavedly so.  However
<br>
I HAVE seen other parents deal with similar situations.  For instance,
<br>
parents of a kid who was taking way too many drugs, and involved with a lot
<br>
of senseless vandalism and violence and other destructive behavior.  They
<br>
sent him to a posh &quot;reform school&quot; -- against his protests -- and it
<br>
actually did reform him, and now I believe he's genuinely glad they did.
<br>
<p>You mention religion -- now, I'm fairly ardently non-religious, but one of
<br>
my kids is very interested in the Bible and shows signs of potentially
<br>
becoming a religious person.  Am I gonna try to force him not to be that
<br>
way?  Of course not.  Am I gonna tell him really clearly and repeatedly and
<br>
calmly what I think of religious dogma, and am I gonna give him stuff to
<br>
read reflecting a scientific view of religion?  For sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Because we have values for our kids that go beyond the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; volition/self-determination...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the kids' values for themselves?  Parents don't own children.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we may not own our children -- but when you're stopping your
<br>
2-year-old from running across the busy street even though their volitional
<br>
self-determination tells them to do so, there's some kind of cousin to
<br>
&quot;ownership&quot; going on...
<br>
<p>Compared to most parents I see, I tend very much toward &quot;children's rights&quot;
<br>
... for instance, I have given my children the choice of whether to attend
<br>
school or not, and for a while they were home-schooled.  However, even I, as
<br>
a lenient and child's-rights-respecting parent, can envision many situations
<br>
where I would unreservedly try to &quot;tamper&quot; with my children's motivational
<br>
structure (like the examples described above, of suicidal or extremely
<br>
self-destructive behavior).
<br>
<p>There is a radical philosophy of child-raising (&quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot;)
<br>
that believes parents should never try to coerce their children at all.  See
<br>
<a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a> .  One individual involved with this philosophy
<br>
is physicist David Deutsch, a pioneer of theoretical quantum computing.
<br>
Before having kids myself I might have agreed with this, but in the thick of
<br>
raising three kids I have to say it seems unproductively extreme.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But we presumably don't want a Friendly AI to take on this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parental role to humans -- because it's simply too dangerous??
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I think it's wrong.  Direct nonconsensual mind modification seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unambiguously wrong.  I'm not as sure about gentle friendly advice given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the service of humane goals not shared by the individual; that strikes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me as an ethically ambiguous case of &quot;What would humanity want to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is a big middle ground between &quot;direct nonconsensual mind
<br>
modification&quot; and &quot;gentle friendly advice.&quot;
<br>
<p>The kinds of things normal parents can and will do to affect their
<br>
children's motivations and attitudes lie in this middle ground.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the interesting moral issues pertaining to future AI's
<br>
interfering with humans, also lie in this middle ground.
<br>
<p>After all, if a superintelligent AI is going to interact with us, it's
<br>
certainly going to influence us, and if it's really clever it may be able to
<br>
achieve amazing amounts of &quot;coercion&quot; by indirect means.  It may be able to
<br>
lead us along just as easily as we can lead a dog into a room it's afraid
<br>
of, by tempting it there with doggie treats.
<br>
<p>Free will itself is a can of worms, now isn't it?  Can we tell a future AI
<br>
not to mess with our free will, when we don't even know what it is? ... and
<br>
when we in fact know from cognitive neuroscience (e.g. Gazzaniga's work)
<br>
that much of our subjective experience of freedom and conscious
<br>
decision-making is illusory, being a matter of the conscious mind making up
<br>
decision-stories for things that the unconscious mind has already decided.
<br>
If the future AI understands human psychology at all, it will understand the
<br>
complexity and fuzziness of the distinction between influencing a human's
<br>
unconcsious and controlling its conscious decision-making processes.
<br>
Actually &quot;volition&quot; is just as tricky as &quot;happiness&quot;, maybe more so..
<br>
