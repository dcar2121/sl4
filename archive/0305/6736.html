</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Uh, no.  An AI worth the bother of inspecting would have code, even 
<br>
if it was in human readable form, complex and volumnious enough that 
<br>
no human or team of humans would be able to understand it that well.  
<br>
Certainly not well enough to determine motivation, behavior and 
<br>
likely future behavior to a sufficiently fine level as to satisfy 
<br>
you.    In actuality a true AI will be much more difficult to 
<br>
understand than a member of your own species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I should make it clear that even with a strong effort to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be safe. But without that effort, unsafe AIs will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You are not competent to inspect AIs themselves in a way that will do 
<br>
anything to guarantee safety.  This says nothing about your personal 
<br>
abilities.  It is the nature of the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; b) inspecting an AI will be an incredibly complex and difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; task requiring the intelligence and tracking abilities of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phlanx of highly tallented people with computer support, so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will take a lot of time to complete, rendering such inpections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out of date and therefore of little value.
</em><br>
<p>It is worse than that.  It is actually impossible for all but the 
<br>
simplest AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never said it would be easy. We must take the time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort to inspect every AI to make sure its design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conforms to regulations. Regulation certainly slowed down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction of nuclear power plants (before construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopped altogether), and it will slow down AI development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there's no reason to rush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is every reason to rush.  Nuclear power was killed by poorly 
<br>
informed and politicized implementation of regulations.  I am not 
<br>
willing to have AI be stillborn on some quest to insure our safety 
<br>
from beings more complex and brighter than ourselves. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But inspecting designs is different than inspecting operations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll grant that those inspecting designs may want to estimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the intentions of the designers, but the ultimate judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the design must come from an inspection of the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So you believe that the ethics/behavior of an AI is a matter of the 
<br>
initial design?   If so, why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Correct.  But your statement seems to imply that the 'artifact'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is unchanging.  This is untrue for any of the mind designs I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen so far, including the human mind.  Minds change, and an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is going to be faster and more capable at changing its mind than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We cannot let it outrun our ability to inspect. There will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no rush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is the most foolish statement I have ever heard.  Do you limit 
<br>
humans to not developing and changing faster than your ability to 
<br>
sufficiently inspect their thinking processes and psychology?   You 
<br>
are talking about new minds here, minds vastly more capable in 
<br>
potential than our own.  To insist they be limited to what your (no 
<br>
offense as this applies to all of us) pea brain can encompass and 
<br>
predict is to oppose the creation of such intelligences utterly.   
<br>
Hell, teams of very bright humans can barely keep something as 
<br>
uninspiring as Windows XP running and plug its security holes.  The 
<br>
notion that similar teams can analyze and judge the safety of an AI 
<br>
beyond a very rudimentary stage is ludicrous
<br>
<p>There is no hurry only if we are sufficiently capable to solve the 
<br>
problems that face us and face us with more complexity and detail day 
<br>
by day.   I do not believe that is the case.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the early days, AI technology won't be widely available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so inspection efforts can focus on the few successful groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No rush. Lets do the first strong AIs slowly, with the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insisting on an intensive effort to formulate and enforce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulations. Humanity can afford to take its time. It cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford to get it wrong because of some imagined need to rush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No!  I will become an &quot;outlaw&quot; myself before I will sit back and 
<br>
watch such a farce unfold.
