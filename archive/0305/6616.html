Hi, you wrote:
<br>
<p>TD&gt; I realize that there is a lot of subconscious information people have,
<br>
TD&gt; process, and use. But a super AI, given access to something like the
<br>
TD&gt; Internet, would probably have access to all of the raw information it would
<br>
TD&gt; need. If it was taught how to process that information, there'd be little
<br>
TD&gt; need to train it further - it could teach itself. That's because the net
<br>
TD&gt; contains ridiculous amounts of information (and myriad examples, unintended
<br>
TD&gt; and otherwise) about things like social relationships, interactions, and the
<br>
TD&gt; like. An SAI should be able to do a far better job than a research team
<br>
TD&gt; could in learning how to deal with people if it was just given a basic
<br>
TD&gt; framework that it could color in itself.
<br>
<p>TD&gt; Or maybe I am just naive. I just like reading this list, I haven't much
<br>
TD&gt; education as far as cognitive science goes :)
<br>
<p>IMO you are being naive.  Look at it this way: would an intelligent
<br>
person, raised in isolation to the point where they could read, but
<br>
without social interaction -- would they be able to learn about
<br>
&quot;things like social relationships, interactions, and the like&quot; purely
<br>
from the internet?
<br>
<p>As much content as is out there on the internet, to look at it as a
<br>
repository of all human knowledge is waaaaaaay premature.  There are
<br>
numerous ways in which this is the case, a few of the most basic ones:
<br>
- it's content, not &quot;information&quot;, until it's been processed
<br>
- there are vast areas of knowledge not covered and that cannot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be easily covered with current technology -- lots of procedural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge falls into this category
<br>
<p>As a larger point, I doubt Dani is married to the 2.5 year figure.
<br>
But it's useful to come up with some sort of guesstimates and stick to
<br>
them, so that trends can be tracked.
