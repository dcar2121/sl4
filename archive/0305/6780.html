<p>
I've been reading Creating Friendly AI, and it talks about the concept of a 
<br>
&quot;flight recorder,&quot; to monitor the AI's actions and goals. It said that 
<br>
&quot;obviously,&quot; the flight recorder needed to be made inaccessible to the AI if 
<br>
at all possible. Yes, that is the obvious answer, but &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;correct&quot; 
<br>
are not always synonymous. After all, it was once &quot;obvious&quot; that the Sun went 
<br>
around the Earth! The concept of &quot;preventing tampering with the flight 
<br>
recorder&quot; would probably be necessary with an AI too young to understand FoF 
<br>
and the concept of a &quot;flight recorder&quot; fully. However, as the AI matures, if 
<br>
FoF is a genuine possibility, the AI should agree with the programmers about 
<br>
the need for safeguards, thus eliminating the need for &quot;anti-tampering&quot; 
<br>
devices.  If an unFAI tried to modify the flight recorder for unFriendly 
<br>
purposes, it must already have an unFriendly parent goal to give desirability 
<br>
to the subgoal of &quot;modifying the flight recorder&quot;, and this parent goal will 
<br>
have been noticed by the &quot;flight recorder&quot; before it is actually modified. A 
<br>
sufficently advanced &quot;flight recorder&quot; would be intelligent enough to alert 
<br>
the humans whenever there is an unFriendly goal in the AI, or, at least, an 
<br>
unFriendly goal that could cause damage. Thus, the only data that would need 
<br>
to be protected is the data that would store the memory of an unFriendly 
<br>
goal, and even that &quot;guard the data&quot; concept could be worked around, given a 
<br>
year or so to figure it out.
