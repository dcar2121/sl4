</em><br>
<p>There are a number of secular people out there who
<br>
have some idea of what the singularity is and oppose
<br>
it on the ground that advanced technology either poses
<br>
a great threat to the environment and/or it will be
<br>
used for oppressive purposes.  And for one I believe
<br>
the public is warranted to be suspicious of highly 
<br>
disruptive technology. I want to know who is going to
<br>
control this technology and what kind of safeguards
<br>
are going to be put in place to prevent it from being
<br>
put to qustionable use. I'm beginning to agree with
<br>
Ted Kaczynski that perhaps the invention of
<br>
agriculture itself was a mistake.  A neolithic,
<br>
hunting-gathering lifestyle with no big centralized
<br>
governments and oppressive economies is starting to
<br>
sound good to me. Perhaps the Luddites were right all
<br>
along.
