Bill,

<p>You wrote:

<p><em>&gt; We don't have to follow an AI's detailed thoughts. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspection is of the design, not the changing contents
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; for human happiness, and its simulation and reinforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning algorithms are accurate, then we can trust the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way it will develop. [snip]
</em><br>
<p>Inspecting the design might work (with the caveats well elucidated in
<br>
James Roger's earlier post) if the design relied on reinforcement
<br>
values.  But many designs won't rely on such things, or at least not
<br>
exclusively.
<br>
<p>Additionally, looking at a design alone for a general intelligence (GI)
<br>
is going to always (always!) produce an open-ended answer as to how it
<br>
will develop.  That is what a GI is, that is what it does: it develops
<br>
in an open-ended way.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I would not trust a GI that was based on 'reinforcement
<br>
values [...] for human happiness' for one nanosecond!  If it is not
<br>
smart enough to be more intelligent than my own, humanly evolved,
<br>
happiness program - then it is not worthy of my trust.  I am already
<br>
smart enough to know that the person *in charge* should be the smartest
<br>
and best-informed person in the room.  I don't see that 'person' as
<br>
having the reinforced goal of 'human happiness' - not now, and not in
<br>
the future.  Sure, that goal might work well every once in a while...
<br>
but not in all situations.
<br>
<p>I have refrained from replying to most of your recent posts, not because
<br>
I agreed with them, but because there was so much that I disagreed
<br>
with - and the points of disagreement were so basic - that I saw no
<br>
point in discussing them with you.  No offence, Bill, but we seem to
<br>
have very different views of reality.
<br>
<p>Here's wishing you all the best in yours,
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
