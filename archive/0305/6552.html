<p>It would help if you would actually address your comments to me, rather 
<br>
than other people whom have said things that you find annoying.
<br>
<p>I'm a rationalist, born and raised; science runs in my family for at least 
<br>
three generations that I know of.  One of my earliest memories is of my 
<br>
father, a physicist, complaining about how people invent their own 
<br>
theories of physics - I was cautioned against crackpotism from a very 
<br>
early age.  I know the scientific method well enough to describe it as a 
<br>
cleverly disguised form of Bayes' Theorem.  I am not aware of any case in 
<br>
which I have ever contradicted an experimentally established hypothesis. 
<br>
(The field of AI is in a state of chaos and has no established 
<br>
interpretation to contradict; a highly promising state of affairs, of 
<br>
course.)  When writing for a technical audience I write in the language of 
<br>
those fields that I draw upon, make statements consistent with the 
<br>
evidence in those fields, strive for consilience across fields, build on 
<br>
established work, and cite my sources.
<br>
<p>Okay, I don't do a *lot* of writing for a technical audience - so far I've 
<br>
been bothered to do it exactly once.  That is because I am not in this for 
<br>
the tenure and I am not going to spend all my time writing papers. 
<br>
However, if you want to see a paper, &quot;Levels of Organization&quot; is out 
<br>
there.  I wrote it, I gave something back to science, and now I have other 
<br>
things to do.  If anyone has specific objections to it, I will respond. 
<br>
Otherwise I consider myself to have fulfilled my responsibility.
<br>
<p>My dispute is solely with the field of AI as it exists in modern academia. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead I draw upon other branches of cognitive science, which I 
<br>
consider to be far more solid, and would not argue with them unless I had 
<br>
an extremely good reason to do so.  I would not hesitate to describe 
<br>
myself as squarely orthodox with respect to most such fields.
<br>
<p>I get the strong feeling that you've never read anything I've written that 
<br>
was intended for a technical audience.  Frankly, your comments strike me 
<br>
as being addressed to someone else.
