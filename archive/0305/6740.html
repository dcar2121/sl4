Ahhh, but there is the rub... Who are the outsiders and who are the
<br>
insiders.
<br>
<p>What are the rules and secret handshakes that transform an mere outsider
<br>
into an insider?
<br>
<p>Are all of the people on this list outsiders?  Or is it just me?
<br>
<p>And even if I by some miracle of god I achieved the coveted status of a
<br>
true insider
<br>
would I be thus annointed and always correct?  Nay, I say to thee,
<br>
brainstorms are meant to
<br>
be exactly that, and challenged at every turn.
<br>
<p>And who shall ever soever one commit the ultimate sin and have a bad
<br>
idea or make an unwise decision.  Shall they be cast aside to ever
<br>
remain among the outsiders?

<p><em>&gt; but very secure development process. It is based upon separation and

</em><br>
<p>Overkill?  No, I don't think it's overkill.  I don't think there's any 
<br>
such thing as overkill when it comes to certain problems.  And even if
<br>
it 
<br>
were, what's wrong with overkill?
<br>
<p>Note one thing, however:  Safety is very, very expensive.
<br>
<p>For example, I would very much like to have guaranteed frame-by-frame 
<br>
reproducibility of AI development.  You develop the AI for a week, 
<br>
recording and timestamping all outside inputs.  Then, when the week is 
<br>
over, you take a snapshot.  Then, on a separate computer, you take last 
<br>
week's snapshot and run it forward, using the timestamped input.  If the
<br>
<p>final result doesn't match this week's snapshot, start over again from 
<br>
last week.  This guarantees that each and every frame of the AI's 
<br>
existence is available to inspection, even five years later, or for that
<br>
<p>matter after the Singularity.
<br>
<p>But that would require specific software support, and the software
<br>
support 
<br>
would be expensive.  At present it seems like no one much cares about
<br>
the 
<br>
Singularity, so expensive safety options are pretty much out of the 
<br>
question.  Sad.  Pathetic, in fact.  But I can't control humanity's 
<br>
choices, only my own.
<br>
<p>Aside from that, I see at least one major problem with the set of 
<br>
precautions you proposed.  You suggested separation of the system 
<br>
architects from the development environment, which strikes me as both 
<br>
infeasible, and suboptimally safe.  Remember that Friendly AI is much 
<br>
harder as a theoretical problem than as a trust problem.  The
<br>
theoretical 
<br>
problem is harder because you can't solve it by throwing up security 
<br>
walls.  Security measures are one thing, but anything that actually 
<br>
reduces the ability of the system architects to solve the problem of 
<br>
*building* Friendly AI... no.  You don't have that kind of safety
<br>
margin; 
<br>
or not knowably so, at any rate.
<br>
<p>That's the problem with outsiders making up security precautions for the
<br>
<p>project to take; at least one of them will, accidentally, end up ruling 
<br>
out successful Friendliness development.
