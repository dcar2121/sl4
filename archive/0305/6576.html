<em>&gt; James, I found your last post interesting but rather abstract.

</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not suggesting any particular approach.  I think my only point was that
<br>
the ideas being proffered were not particularly creative.  The idea that
<br>
research funding is an anathema to accomplishing technical goals is not
<br>
mine, but with time I have come to largely agree with it.  More often than
<br>
not, research funding gives researchers just enough money to continue gaming
<br>
the system for more research funding.  As a result, the conversion into
<br>
technical results of the already comparatively small amount of money
<br>
research funding gives you tends to be very poor.
<br>
<p>Capitalization of one type or another always involves gaming a system of one
<br>
type or another, but if technical results are the goal it is generally
<br>
better to be gaming a system that doesn't have such direct negative feedback
<br>
on technical results.  I've heard many fairly compelling arguments that the
<br>
conversion efficiency of &quot;direct&quot; research funding is so poor that indirect
<br>
research funding can often lead to technical results faster.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Pardon?  I don't think I understand this.  Or if I do, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't agree. I've pitched a business to hundreds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors.  I've been an angel investor in pre-VC startups 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself.  In the business world you make your reputation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily /by/ making money, either for yourself or someone else.
</em><br>
<p><p>Precisely.  I don't disagree with this, and I've been in the game a long
<br>
time in Silicon Valley.  Much capital is spent on people who deliver good
<br>
investment conversion, often whether or not they made any money themselves
<br>
in the past.  However, it is useful to break this down further.
<br>
<p>First, there are those &quot;investees&quot; whose reputations are that they can
<br>
convert money into more money.  Their lever is that they have a proven
<br>
ability to turn capital into more capital; give them nothing but money and
<br>
they can make it multiply.  This is what most people think of, but it isn't
<br>
the only type.
<br>
<p>Second, there are those investees whose reputations are that they can
<br>
convert technology into more money.  Their lever is that they have a proven
<br>
ability to turn any technological capital into investor capital.  Note that
<br>
this is generally NOT an engineer or research geek, but someone with a
<br>
reasonably amount of both business and technological sense who can be given
<br>
just about any kind of technology and leverage it into a profitable
<br>
business.
<br>
<p>There are lots of both of these types of capital magnets in Silicon Valley.
<br>
For a company that plans to do AI work you need someone of the second type
<br>
if you want commercial capital backing, but these are noticeably absent from
<br>
most AI startups. Having capital attractors of this type in an organization
<br>
gives a fair amount of carte blanche on the utilization of the capital for
<br>
technical development, and gives access to a larger capital pool than direct
<br>
research funding will ever give you.  Of course, you can't do the wandering
<br>
aimless experimental work that seems to make up much of AI research; you
<br>
have to be able to articulate a clear target with a well-defined roadmap,
<br>
even if executing it will require substantial R&amp;D.  But if you don't have
<br>
this then you aren't ready for funding anyway IMO.
<br>
<p><p>The really question in my opinion, is how do you coalesce a company that can
<br>
attract substantial and commercially legitimate capital (read: not
<br>
single-sourced angel investment from unconnected parties) that has the
<br>
freedom to legitimately spend most of the capital on critical core R&amp;D.  It
<br>
is certainly possible, as it has happened countless times in both good and
<br>
bad conditions, and there are many ways to go about creating such an entity.
<br>
<p><p>Of course, you may have to get your hands dirty and spend a lot of time
<br>
working on things that have no apparent application to AGI or AGI companies,
<br>
but that is a tactical concern, not a strategic one.  (&quot;Specialization is
<br>
for insects&quot;, sayeth Heinlein.)  Yet it seems to me that many, if not most,
<br>
AI researchers focus on the tactical scenario rather than the strategic one.
<br>
If they spent two years not doing any AI research at all, they may very well
<br>
get to their end goal *faster* than if they did nothing but AI research,
<br>
depending on how they spent the two years doing other things.
<br>
<p>Path optimization is a legitimate use of time for AI research, even if it
<br>
has nothing to do with AI.  And if I've learned nothing else from Silicon
<br>
Valley, path optimization is a decisive factor in who succeeds and who
<br>
doesn't.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
