<p>I applaud the efforts of the SIAI for wanting to raise the 
<br>
consciousness of the masses with respect to AI and the Singularity.  I 
<br>
am more or less in agreement with Eliezer in &quot;Future Shock Levels&quot; in 
<br>
as much as I don't think everyone should have to suddenly come 
<br>
face-to-face with an almost certain inevitability - indeed it may be 
<br>
counterproductive to the goals of the SIAI (reactionary responses from 
<br>
religious groups and various under-educated policy makers).  Not too 
<br>
long from now (a decade or two), I hope that most people will become 
<br>
familiar and fairly comfortable with the benefits of intelligent 
<br>
systems and maybe nanotechnology, such that the introduction of Strong, 
<br>
recursively-enhancing AI will be less a shock.  Therefore I believe 
<br>
it's better to let the course of the world's adaptation to 
<br>
technological change occur naturally, rather than forcing everyone into 
<br>
it too quickly.
<br>
<p>I understand your enthusiasm at what the Singularity may be able to 
<br>
accomplish, but I guess the cynic in me sees too many obstacles to go 
<br>
high-profile so quickly.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Zeph
