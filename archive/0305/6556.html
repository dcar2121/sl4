<p>
<em>&gt; For any research project to be science, and not pseudo-science you require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) a credible research group, filled or associated with properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credential-ed researchers. (why? because without this, nobody will waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time to review your work without good reason, see below).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) a credible body of work, that has been suitably reviewed (by a group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the one described above).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) a credible and logic-ly correct methodology for producing the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body of work.
</em><br>
<p>Wow!  I definitely do not buy that attitude toward science!
<br>
<p>(FYI, I have a PhD in math and spent 8 years as an academic before turning
<br>
to software entrepreneurship, in departments of math, psych and computer
<br>
science.  I have my share of publications in peer-reviewed journals.)
<br>
<p>I do not believe that science should be considered as *defined* by the
<br>
social structures surrounding it, in the way you're suggesting.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, regarding your comment &quot;nobody will waste the time to review
<br>
your work&quot;, I am a credentialed scientist who has taken the time to review
<br>
Eliezer's work, because I think it's interesting.  And, for example, one of
<br>
Eliezer's papers is going to appear in an edited volume I'm organizing,
<br>
alongside papers by PhD's from academic institutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why bother with all that? Because real science gets real funding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition (eventual, but required for large scale funding however),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pseudo-science hangs around the Internet, waiting for someone to foolish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read it.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that following the typical social forms associated with science can
<br>
make your life a lot easier, if you're trying to get money or recognition
<br>
for your scientific ideas.  But it's just not right to *define* science that
<br>
way!!
<br>
<p>If Eliezer achieves something really significant in his work, then
<br>
credentials or no, eventually the scientific establishment will pay
<br>
attention.  Although the science establishment can be over-conservative and
<br>
trend-obsessed, eventually it has enough objectivity to recognize the value
<br>
in serious discoveries made by maverick outsiders.  The history of science
<br>
demonstrates this, though I don't have time to list examples.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In many cases &quot;researchers&quot; who are self-described geniuses (or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just more X than most people), dismiss journals because their &quot;peers&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do the reviewing toss their papers (or use them for lining bird
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cages/cleaning up coffee spills). Usually this is followed by the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stalking legitimate researchers to get their ideas heard. This step is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally followed by a restraining order or meds being administered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes the above is marked with statements like &quot;Academics in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field are filled with anti-knowledge!&quot;, or &quot;Those reviewers aren't smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to understand my paper!&quot;, or even &quot;There is a conspiracy against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, my ideas are just too good, and are being suppressed&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Jeeez!!!
<br>
<p>I knew a guy like this once (he stalked *me* when I was a prof at UNLV, in
<br>
the early 90's).  He really didn't have much in common with Eliezer,
<br>
scientifically or psychologically or however...
<br>
<p>I have studied Eliezer's work pretty carefully.  Eliezer is not a
<br>
&quot;crackpot.&quot;  He is a maverick thinker and a maverick human being, outside
<br>
the academic CS/cog-sci establishment both in his thinking and in his
<br>
practical life.  His exposition of his ideas does not always adhere to the
<br>
proper academic form, which may make it harder for the average academic to
<br>
digest his ideas.
<br>
<p>I certainly don't agree with all Eliezer's ideas, but that's a whole
<br>
different issue!  Heck, there are plenty of ideas put forth by credentialed
<br>
academics that strike me as downright ridiculous, and some of them are
<br>
published in peer-reviewed journals....
<br>
<p>I am not sure that the way Eliezer is conducting his career (the maverick
<br>
approach) is optimal in terms of achieving his long-term goals.  But I'm not
<br>
sure it *isn't* optimal either.  He's made a different choice than me in
<br>
that regard -- but, well, if people didn't make a variety of life-choices
<br>
the world would be duller and we'd have a narrower sample of examples from
<br>
which to learn...
