<p>
Doug,
<br>
<p>Just to clarify: the recent work on Novamente has yielded measurable
<br>
practical achievements, as well as progress toward a grander goal.  For
<br>
instance, the probabilistic inference capability of the system has
<br>
progressed a lot.  Now our software can read in hundreds of thousands of
<br>
items of knowledge from biology (or other) databases, and derive useful,
<br>
interesting, potentially important conclusions about them en masse.  This is
<br>
a level of inferential data integration that has not been seen before in any
<br>
software system.  It's a step toward the Singularity -- but, taken in
<br>
itself, it's just one among many many small steps.  Hopefully what
<br>
differentiates Novamente from many other tech projects is that the series of
<br>
small steps toward the Singularity that its development embodies, is
<br>
intended to be along a path that will eventually lead to a *big leap* to the
<br>
finish line (which is really a starting line, but whatever ;)
<br>
<p>Increases in hardware technology are easy to talk about because they're so
<br>
clearly quantifiable.  But advances in AI, software, biomed, etc. are coming
<br>
along just as surely.
<br>
<p>To take another example of advance toward the Singularity that few know
<br>
about, my friend &amp; former colleague Barak Pearlmutter has pushed ahead with
<br>
using signal separation technology to study MEG signals from the human
<br>
brain.  See <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~bap/">http://www.cs.unm.edu/~bap/</a> .  Year by year, it becomes possible
<br>
to understand more and more about brain activity from analyzing MEG, along
<br>
with  many other techniques.  Steady, real, quantifiable progress -- and
<br>
when it gets far enough, we'll be able to really study the dynamics of
<br>
thoughts in brains (not just from MEG, but from a combo of brain imaging
<br>
technologies) ... and this will have all sorts of dramatic Singularity-ward
<br>
consequences...
<br>
<p>But of course, examples of advances in Singularity-related tech certainly
<br>
don't help prove to skeptics that a Singularity will exist.  Any more than
<br>
concrete measurable successes of Novamente's inference component help
<br>
demonstrate to skeptics that Novamente will one day be a true AI.
<br>

<em>&gt; Anyone else other than Ben on this subject even if Ben's response was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually one of hopeful progress on a prospective achievement (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that progress toward future achievements is an achievement also)?  Were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their no identifiable achievements in 2002?  Lets put the query a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.  If a Singularity skeptic were to challenge you to identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress that occurred in 2002 towards a Singularity event what would your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response be?  Do we have only increases in hardware technology to offer in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response?
