Not all ethical problems are large, not all are immediate, and not all 
<br>
come up every day.  Some problems might even be stable, and so an AGI's 
<br>
revisions of it would not expand the erroneous ethics.
<br>
<p>Let's say an AGI comes to the conclusion that violence is a result of 
<br>
culture, and so banning expressions of violence by humanity would 
<br>
eliminate unethical violence.  This is a small ethical error (and 
<br>
probably a large cognitive one).  I do martial arts, which is obviously 
<br>
an expression of violence.  The ban would run counter the principle of 
<br>
volition (as all bans do) -- I volunteer to risk pain.  It's a small 
<br>
error because when it realizes its mistake, it will correct it.  Losing 
<br>
5 years of training in my hopefully endless life will not concern me.
<br>
<p>Take another example: say the AGI has an error in its ethics whereby it 
<br>
denies &quot;rights&quot; (for lack of a better word) to uploads.  If it takes 5 
<br>
years before anyone's ready to upload, that's not a concern.
<br>
<p>Or take the same example, but consider the cases when the AGI would 
<br>
actually violate ethical principles.  The computational architecture 
<br>
required to support an upload is probably unimpressive to the AGI by the 
<br>
time uploading is possible.  Let's say it takes an upload 5 years to 
<br>
create a computer the AGI is interested in, and he (the upload) 
<br>
transfers himself to the supercomputer.  As long as the error is spotted 
<br>
and corrected before the AGI wipes the upload from the computer to 
<br>
subsume the computing power, it's not a concern.
