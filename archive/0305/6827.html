<p><em>&gt;I like this interpretation, because it has all the beautiful simplicity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the Everett interpretation without the problems of other versions. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem of probability also seems solvable or solved (in this version and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others such as Deutsch's). It also fits nicely with functionalism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the idea that identity over time (of observers and worlds) need not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be exactly well-defined.
</em><br>
<p>I'd turn that around and say that Dennett's functionalism and this approach
<br>
are untenable for precisely the same reason: they want to deny that there's
<br>
any particular fact of the matter regarding an epistemic fundamental. In one
<br>
case it's your conscious experience, in the other case it's the specific 
<br>
world
<br>
that you live in.
<br>
<p>Fuzzy Functionalist: The mind is a finite-state machine running on the 
<br>
brain!
<br>
Critic: Which finite-state machine? There are many many ways of 
<br>
coarse-graining
<br>
the brain's physical state space into a space of computational states.
<br>
Fuzzy Functionalist: *shrug* Any coarse-graining that's fine enough to 
<br>
account
<br>
for behavioral differences will do.
<br>
<p>Mangled Worlds Proponent: The world we see is just a part of the universal
<br>
wavefunction!
<br>
Critic: Which part? There are many many sets of decoherent histories.
<br>
Mangled Worlds Proponent: *shrug* Any coarse-graining that's fine enough
<br>
to account for experiment will do.
<br>
<p>I disagree with Objectivists on a lot of things, but I do agree with the
<br>
principle that Ayn Rand called the Axiom of Identity: in order to be, you
<br>
have to be *something*. It makes no sense to take a particular thing
<br>
(your mind, your world) and say it's one of a set of things, but it's not
<br>
any one of them in particular.
