<p>Well, let's discuss it on-list unless/until Eliezer deems it too irrelevant
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>The system I'm thinking of is something we used to call Webworld, back in
<br>
the Webmind Inc. days, so I'll call it that here, until a better name
<br>
emerges.  A fair bit of design work went into Webworld, and a partial
<br>
prototype was built &amp; tested at Webmind inc., but is no longer available (as
<br>
it's lost in the bizarre legal IP mess that was once Webmind Inc.)
<br>
<p>A paper Stephan Bugaj and I wrote on Webworld is available at
<br>
<p><a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/395030.html">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/395030.html</a>
<br>
<p>That is a conceptual paper with a few tech details toward the end.  It is
<br>
focused on Alife rather than AI (as it was presented at the Alife 7
<br>
conference), but the Webworld design supports either.  The key section is
<br>
halfway through or a little more: &quot;Webworld: an internet Alife OS.&quot;
<br>
<p>Actually we don't need the whole Webworld design for Novamente, but Webworld
<br>
was designed to support pretty much any kind of Alife or AI activity, not
<br>
just the requirements of one particular Ai system.
<br>
<p>In a nutshell, Webworld involves a very generic piece of software, which
<br>
runs in the background on a computer a la distributed.net.  A Webworld
<br>
&quot;location&quot; (the word for a local instance of Webworld) is basically just an
<br>
&quot;environment&quot; in which artificial agents can live.  Any agent fulfilling a
<br>
certain simple API can live in a webworld location, and can send messages to
<br>
other agents living in other webworld locations.  Distributed
<br>
problem-solving is one application of this sort of setup.  The various
<br>
control objects for Webworld locations are also implemented as particular
<br>
kinds of agents, so they can be updated dynamically if this is desired.
<br>
<p>The main point is the generality of the agent API, and, the fact that a
<br>
variety of distributed processing paradigms are supported.  Yeah, you can
<br>
use it to dispatch jobs from a central server and collect the results
<br>
later -- the easiest paradigm.  But you can also use it to run algorithms
<br>
that involve P2P interactions -- say, a distributed GP population using an
<br>
islands model, where agents migrate from one machine to another within the
<br>
same multi-machine evolving population; or, a problem-solving method that is
<br>
mostly carried out in the background of a large number of machines around
<br>
the world - but, that requires moderately frequent calls into a central DB
<br>
for information in the course of problem solving... etc.  The Webworld
<br>
architecture does not impose narrow restrictions on the style of distributed
<br>
processing, which is important for Novamente because Novamente can make use
<br>
of a lot of different styles of distributed processing for different
<br>
purposes.
<br>
<p>Webworld would be very useful for Novamente because procedure learning and
<br>
probabilistic logical unification, two of the most difficult and
<br>
processing-intensive aspects of Novamente cognition, are very well-suited
<br>
for Webworld-style distributed processing.
<br>
<p>Webworld as previously designed was intended to run Java agents only.  Since
<br>
Novamente is in C++, it would be nice if it were possible to use C++ agents
<br>
too (could be done with Java wrappers and JNI, of course). Or Webworld could
<br>
be done in all C++, forgetting Java... of course there are many
<br>
possibilities on this level...
<br>
<p>We will implement something like this for Novamente someday, but it's not
<br>
high on our priority list because there is still a lot more we can do on our
<br>
local network of machines... we have not yet reached the point where
<br>
processing power is our main obstacle.  However, WebWorld work could be done
<br>
in parallel with Novamente work, so that WebWorld will be ready when
<br>
Novamente needs it.  And there may be other Ai projects that could make use
<br>
of it right now.  In fact we could use it right now for some of our Biomind
<br>
(biology data analysis &amp; database integration) work, quite apart from its
<br>
potential applications to deep Novamente cognition....
