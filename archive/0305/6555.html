Barkley Vowk opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Credentials are a token with which one proves he/she has been taught the
<br>
skills to learn, and the background knowledge to at least start an
<br>
understanding in their field. Dismissing credentials is a common
<br>
sign of a crackpot.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>But this also gives a Pass to conformists, who may or may not be less 
<br>
capable, more likely to know how to milk the government/academic community 
<br>
for research--because they appear to conform. This is known from the 1950's 
<br>
as Not Invented Here. Freeman Dyson recently opined that the Phd. degree, 
<br>
seemed to him a waste of time in astronomy and physics. This statement is 
<br>
from a person who would quite easily belong to a peer review board.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In many cases &quot;researchers&quot; who are self-described geniuses (or perhaps
<br>
just more X than most people), dismiss journals because their &quot;peers&quot; that
<br>
do the reviewing toss their papers (or use them for lining bird
<br>
cages/cleaning up coffee spills). Usually this is followed by the author
<br>
stalking legitimate researchers to get their ideas heard. This step is
<br>
generally followed by a restraining order or meds being administered.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I could imagine such academics on a review board, flushing any such papers 
<br>
axiomatically, sans critical review. Many of those who occupy review boards, 
<br>
the few that I have encountered via media interviews, come across as rather 
<br>
full of themselves. I concede that there are many nutters around, but contend 
<br>
that this screening process is hap-hazzard, at best, and fraught with conceit 
<br>
and sometimes envy, at worst. The baby is indeed thrown out with the bath 
<br>
water.
