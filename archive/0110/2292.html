</em><br>
<p>I agree with you that Sysop would be interested in maintaining MLS, and I
<br>
see your vision of emergent declines in population growth as plausible.
<br>
However, I disagree with you when you seem to make the assumption that a
<br>
friendly Sysop would think it fair to initially divvy up the solar system 6
<br>
billion ways.  My reason for this is simple:  If the Sysop is actually
<br>
thinking long-term, calculating its ability to incorporate new matter, etc,
<br>
then it ought to be making initial allocation decisions based upon this
<br>
data.  Why?  So that subsequent generations of citizens aren't comparatively
<br>
screwed out of large resource blocks on the mere account of their having
<br>
been created later. (I may thus be breaking the definition of Sysop again,
<br>
but if so in it may be an indication of a weakness in the Sysop concept.)
<br>
<p>A rough historical comparison:
<br>
<p>18th and 19th century Ireland experienced more than its share of famine,
<br>
with overpopulation cited as a serious mitigating factor, if not the root
<br>
cause.  In the early 1700's, the adoption of the potato as an agricultural
<br>
gift from the Americas allowed for increased agricultural productivity.
<br>
This encouraged farmers to subdivide their plots to their sons, who
<br>
incidentally married earlier and had children sooner as a result.*
<br>
Population boomed, and with each generation the cycle continued -- higher
<br>
crop yields, more farmers, smaller plots.  This was fine until 1846, when a
<br>
black fungal rot rendered the high-yield staple, potato, inedible.  Other
<br>
crops could still be raised, but farmers' plots were too small to produce
<br>
enough food without potatoes.  Death and emigration reduced the island's
<br>
population from 8 million to 5 million by 1850.
<br>
<p>Was it poor decision-making on account of the farmers in 1846 that led to so
<br>
much suffering?  Was the famine the result of bad government policy?  No.
<br>
The mid-nineteenth century Irish farmer inherited so little land that he
<br>
could grow little besides potatoes.  The reason safety margins were
<br>
non-existent by 1846 was the emergent result of individual -- and logical --
<br>
decisions made by ancestors starting more than a hundred years earlier.  It
<br>
was a case of rational self-interest on a wide scale leading to even wider
<br>
scale destruction farther down the pipe.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that there would ever be anything akin to a potato blight in
<br>
Sysop space, although there might.  I'm saying that a Friendly SI might feel
<br>
just as obligated to protect and serve future generations as present ones.
<br>
It's really not fair to be born into an MLS situation (where you can maybe
<br>
only have one offspring at an unspecified future date) while your neighbor,
<br>
who happened to be first generation Citizen sits on an unfathomable hoard of
<br>
matter she decided not to share through having a trillion offspring.  I'm
<br>
not sure of the flavor of mathematics neccessary to describe the more
<br>
equitable allocation system, but the Sysop might do Friendliest to divvy up
<br>
matter based on:  1) Current population 2) Birth rate trends 3) Expected
<br>
rate of matter assimilation. 4) Significant barriers to further growth
<br>
Conservatively using its longest term projections, seeing where potentially
<br>
unsurpassable barriers to expansion exist (edge of the galaxy?), it could
<br>
come up with an MLS that is generous but applied to everyone, regardless of
<br>
when they come online in Sysop space.  At its simplest, it could be a
<br>
calculation of what resources are neccessary for a comfortable, individual
<br>
MLS, and how many of these MLS blocks could likely be made out of the
<br>
refinable matter in the galaxy (if the galactic edge is likely to be an
<br>
effectively insurmountable barrier).
<br>
<p>To quote some Native American philosophy:
<br>
<p>&quot;Look behind you. See your sons and your daughters. They are your future.
<br>
Look farther, and see your sons' and your daughters' children and their
<br>
children's children even unto the seventh generation. That's the way we were
<br>
taught.&quot;

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker of the House
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand Council of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy
<br>
<p><p>A recognized weakness in this concept of Friendly MLS allocation is the fact
<br>
that people tend to have many more children when they know they will be
<br>
provided for.  An individual producing a trillion offspring who each produce
<br>
a trillion offspring would probably break the system very quickly.  This
<br>
could be anticipated as part of the &quot;growth trends&quot; factor in the initial
<br>
MLS calculation, but the end result might be suffocatingly small MLS --
<br>
really SMLS (sub-minimal).
<br>
<p>So in the end we may wind up back with distasteful-but-equitable enforced
<br>
limits on reproduction.  Its really outside the realm of average human
<br>
experience to produce hundreds of children anyway, so a limit of 10 or 20
<br>
might be perfectly acceptable to most.  It's not high enough to satisfy the
<br>
dreams of any King Solomon wanna-be, but it is already established that not
<br>
every wish can possibly be granted in Sysop space (unless some of the
<br>
wildest theoretical possibilities for, say, tapping into other universes
<br>
prove tenable).
