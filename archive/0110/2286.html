<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but a backup, to me, is like freezing 
<br>
the state of a mind at a certain point in time.  Should the original 
<br>
later die, the backup is started up at just as the original mind 
<br>
existed at that pervious point in time.  Thus, if I backup my mind at 
<br>
t=5 and later die at t=7, I will have lost whatever happened during 
<br>
the passing of those two time units, but will restart my mind as it 
<br>
was at t=5 when I die at t=7.  I like to think of it (further diving 
<br>
into Unix Reality) as minds are in CVS and the latest version is 
<br>
checked out into Sysop Space and being run.  This allows a number of 
<br>
nice things.  For example, a mind could start a branch and if the 
<br>
experiment that started that branch fails, revert to a previous mind 
<br>
state (this allows a mind to try out what it's like to be evil and 
<br>
then revert back later).  Also, in the event that the checked out 
<br>
version gets killed before being committed, the last version is just 
<br>
checked out automatically and started up.  Hmm, this sounds like the 
<br>
start of another paper...
<br>
<p>BTW, is there anywhere Online this paper is posted up besides the 
<br>
archives of SL4.  I'd like to be able to link whatever your latest 
<br>
version is from the To Do List under a list of completed items (this 
<br>
way we can see where we've been and how much as been accomplished 
<br>
thus far).
