</em><br>
<p>Robert Aikin is here referring to a suggestion he submitted to the
<br>
Singularity Institute privately.
<br>
<p>The &quot;eye in a pyramid surrounded by Hebrew writing&quot; was an archetype for
<br>
&quot;maximally mystic symbol&quot; that I constructed based on memories of having
<br>
read the Illuminatus Trilogy and having watched &quot;End of Evangelion&quot;, stuck
<br>
in my mind as the symbols of literary and visual mysticism respectively. 
<br>
I think I'd have picked that archetype regardless of whether Aikin had
<br>
sent a suggested symbol that happened to have an eye in it.  If Aikin had
<br>
posted his suggestion to the list, I'd have picked an archetype that
<br>
didn't have an eye in it, so it was clear that I wasn't making fun of
<br>
him.  Since he didn't post his message to the list, I assumed that it
<br>
wouldn't even occur to anyone that I was making fun of him.  The thought
<br>
that Robert Aikin might take offense, post his suggestion to the list and
<br>
that people would *then* misinterpret my post did not really occur to me. 
<br>
Well, live and learn, I guess.
<br>
<p>As for the massively doomed attempt by my parents to raise me as an
<br>
Orthodox Jew, that failed so completely that today I can incorporate the
<br>
Hebraic lettering concept from NGE into a parody without being anxious
<br>
that someone will take it as a product of an attempted Jewish upbringing,
<br>
just as I'm not worried that someone will take the reference to the eye in
<br>
the pyramid as indicating Illuminati membership.  Maybe I'm wrong not to
<br>
worry.  Maybe I need to go through the rest of my life carefully never
<br>
referring to anything Jewish just in case someone thinks I'm still somehow
<br>
contaminated.  Personally, though, I think the ideal is to live out your
<br>
life just as if nobody had ever attempted to give you a religious
<br>
upbringing.  And if so, I have no reason to avoid mentioning Hebraic
<br>
lettering in the context of mysticism - it's one of the most popular
<br>
mystic marks anywhere that silly memes are sold, and is certainly not
<br>
confined to Judaism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is a suggestion:  Forget about a mark based upon an object and focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon creating a graphic based upon the (English) letters SIAI.  Or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporating the first characters of code proposed for Friendly AI as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbolic representation.
</em><br>
