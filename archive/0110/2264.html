<em>&gt; &gt;My question is somewhat simpler. Is there an actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimated crossover point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of 'operations per second' where the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must occur? Is there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;calculated range where it could occur?  If someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has estimated this level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of processing, what are the calculations per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A full simulation of a human brain running on a 
<br>
a computer should be the upper limit to what is needed
<br>
to cause a singularity if it is possible at all.
<br>
The reason is that once you have one simulation 
<br>
working at the level of a human scientist or
<br>
engineer, you can make as many copies as you want.
<br>
This increases the total available brain power
<br>
above that of the human pool of scientists and
<br>
engineers, therefore accelerating progress in
<br>
those fields.  You then quickly get a runaway
<br>
acceleration in brainpower and progress.
<br>
<p>The computer power to run a good enough simulation
<br>
of a human brain has been estimated to be anywhere
<br>
from 100 trillion flops to 100,000 trillion flops.
<br>
A top-end PC chip today can do about 2 billion flops.
<br>
You can afford to build a cluster of a few hundred
<br>
to a few thousand PCs for what you spend on a human
<br>
scientist or engineer.  That will buy you a few
<br>
trillion flops right now, so you are a couple of
<br>
orders of magnitude from the lower bound.  At
<br>
worst, the 5 orders of magnitude to the upper bound
<br>
will take you 25 years of Moore's Law growth,
<br>
then perhaps 5 more years to do the software once
<br>
you have the hardware, then another 5 years to
<br>
build enough copies to get the runaway feedback
<br>
going.  That's around 2035 AD.
<br>
<p>At the other end of the scale, the seed AI code
<br>
might only take as much space as the seed HI 
<br>
(human intelligence) code.  The part of our DNA
<br>
that specifies how the brain develops is probably
<br>
less than half of the total, say &lt;1.6 billion
<br>
base pairs.  That converts to &lt;400 MB of software.
<br>
If you run the brain as a distributed client over
<br>
the Net, you could get the required number of
<br>
machines almost immediately.  So the near term
<br>
bound on the Singularity is today.
