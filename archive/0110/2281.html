Zan
<br>
<p>I wanted to say that I really enjoyed your Essay, The Frozen Accident God, 
<br>
which I would say is very, excellent.
<br>
<p>My only addition to this story (as insisted upon only by myself) is my focus 
<br>
on the pre-Singularity lives that have past, the one Not-uploaded because the 
<br>
Singularity hadn't happened yet. I understand that Tipler and Hans Moravec 
<br>
have considered re-computing the past through unbelievably, titanic, 
<br>
computing power. I am not sure that computation alone, and computing all 
<br>
possible paths (formulations) of who and when they were born, their 
<br>
personalities, and memories, experiences, and their background 'world' is 
<br>
necessary.
<br>
<p>My own hunch is that, although the past in unchangeable, in the Grandfather 
<br>
Assassination Paradox (if you kill grand dad-how could you still be here?) 
<br>
sense of the phrase, one could, through the understanding of physics, gain 
<br>
nearly, precise information of the past.  The purpose of this would be to 
<br>
re-create the past, in upgraded form, in the distant future. 
<br>
<p>Beyond holography around black holes, I suspect that the interaction of 
<br>
photons and gravity might imprint gravity itself. This wild conjecture 
<br>
suggests that the cosmic quintessence, or gravity waves are themselves acting 
<br>
as storage media. This is my hope anyway. I also toying with ideas about 
<br>
gathering data through tiny wormholes,
<br>
( in the great some-when) and then utilizing it to reformulate the past. I 
<br>
tend to spend quite a bit of time searching for such matters on LANL 
<br>
Archives. Lots of interesting papers there.
