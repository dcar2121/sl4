<p>
While I have some minor points of disagreement, this is very well written
<br>
and thus exactly what I was looking for.  Three cheers for Mitch Howe.
<br>
<p>The major point of disagreement on my part is that I think that global
<br>
patterns follow from individual choices.  Most people will run as
<br>
simulations, but not because simulations are more &quot;efficient&quot; - if you
<br>
divvy up the solar system among only six billion people, nobody's going to
<br>
be forced into simulation for lack of room.  People will run as
<br>
simulations because they want to - because they want the total
<br>
environmental control or the ability to expand into superintelligences. 
<br>
Post-Singularity we'll have a lot more resources than we do now; people
<br>
may *choose* to do certain things for the sake of efficiency, but there
<br>
will be very little that people *need* to do for the sake of efficiency.
<br>
<p>Not every singleton superintelligence (&quot;singleton&quot;: one to Human Space)
<br>
constitutes a Sysop.  I think the phrase &quot;Sysop&quot; implies partitioning of
<br>
resources among citizens, individual volition, and so on.  A benevolent
<br>
dictatorship seems to me like a different scenario.  A Sysop, in other
<br>
words, is a root process that manages the way in which other processes
<br>
interact; a benevolent dictator is a root process that tampers with other
<br>
processes for their own good.  The Sysop Scenario is supposed to suggest
<br>
the former.  (Note that I am not suggesting the latter is impossible -
<br>
just that we need different terminology.)
<br>
<p>If a governing superintelligence determines that each citizen can only
<br>
produce one offspring per subjective century, this being the sustainable
<br>
long-term population growth rate given individual growth and the rate of
<br>
acquisition of new resources, that's a Benevolent Dictator scenario.
<br>
<p>Under a Sysop Scenario, the population growth rate is the emergent result
<br>
of property rights and child abuse laws.  At the time of Singularity, each
<br>
of six billion initial citizens gets a resource allotment, and there's a
<br>
Minimal Living Space requirement to create a new citizen to prevent
<br>
peonage-based coercion.  This MLS would be the amount of RAM/resources
<br>
required to go on thinking &quot;forever&quot; given the expected rate of overall
<br>
growth - that is, you won't run out of mental living space before the New
<br>
Territory opens up.  The requirement would be even higher to create a new
<br>
citizen with the desire to reproduce.  In both cases the reason is the
<br>
same - so that you can't create a citizen that wants to live, or
<br>
reproduce, and then control it by threatening to withhold the resources ve
<br>
needs to accomplish these things.  In other words, to create a citizen,
<br>
that citizen has to be self-sufficient.
<br>
<p>Under this scenario, one of us (i.e., one of the six billion beings born
<br>
before the Singularity) might be able to create a few trillion offspring
<br>
immediately after the Singularity using his or her allotment of Solar
<br>
matter - but those trillion offspring won't be able to create another
<br>
trillion offspring in turn, and none of them (including the original) will
<br>
run out of room to think before the Sysop manufactures more paired
<br>
negative/positive matter, opens up a new Van Den Broeck(*) pocket, splits
<br>
off another universe, or whatever.  However, reproductive rates are likely
<br>
to be substantially lower, and MLS sustantially higher, if we have to go
<br>
all the way to Alpha Centauri at C to obtain more mass.  If resource
<br>
acquisition is geometric rather than exponential in the long run, then
<br>
reproduction will also become slower as time goes on.  Even individual
<br>
subjective rates may need to become slower so that personal growth doesn't
<br>
exceed available resources.  I tend to regard that as the &quot;pessimistic&quot;
<br>
scenario, although it may still permit an infinite amount of subjective
<br>
fun over infinite time.
<br>
<p>The main case where you have something resembling benevolent-dictator-like
<br>
behavior inside a Sysop Scenario is a case where you care what other
<br>
people think and they are all thinking the same thing, thus transmitting
<br>
their volitions to you as a pressure; i.e., if you transform yourself into
<br>
a malicious superintelligence you may no longer be able to send any
<br>
communications to other citizens, because they don't want to spend the
<br>
computing power needed to analyze the message in toto for brainwashing
<br>
effects.  This also works for unavoidable entanglements; if the Luddites
<br>
are all staying on Earth, you may not be able to stay on Earth as a
<br>
transhuman.
