</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Secondary problem...
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A recognized weakness in this concept of Friendly MLS allocation is the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people tend to have many more children when they know they will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided for.  An individual producing a trillion offspring who each produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a trillion offspring would probably break the system very quickly.  This

</em><br>
<em>&gt; really SMLS (sub-minimal).
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your statement of the primary problem and the secondary
<br>
problem.  My thought that the solar system will be divvied up among
<br>
current citizens - even if this results in the creation of super-wealthy
<br>
hoarding Elders - is based on the projection that, in the long run, it
<br>
doesn't really matter; an individual created using only MLS will be able
<br>
to grow indefinitely at a normal rate (guaranteed) and will, even if
<br>
created with no desire to reproduce, probably still be able to reproduce
<br>
someday.  So having super-wealthy Elders isn't really all that bad, and
<br>
I'm not just saying that because I expect to be an Elder myself.  However,
<br>
if there's a good way to avoid people gaming the system - i.e., some
<br>
solution that is fair to those who want to reproduce, those who don't, the
<br>
newcomers, and the latecomers; and moreover, can't be gamed by cheaters -
<br>
then that alternate solution might be adopted.
<br>
<p>The thing to remember is that ultrawealthy Elders is a very much smaller
<br>
problem than it would be in our own society.  What are they (we) going to
<br>
do with those resources, bribe politicians?  What's really being discussed
<br>
is the difference between ultra-wealthy and super-ultra-wealthy, and I
<br>
don't quite see that as a problem...
<br>
<p>My previous thought was that an initial divvy of the solar system among
<br>
the Eldest, and subsequent divvy of new resources among all citizens
<br>
equally, should roughly balance the moral forces here.  However, perhaps
<br>
your suggestion of a limiting reproductive rate would be relevant to
<br>
divvying up newly acquired resources, if not to the actual prevention of
<br>
hyper-reproduction.  Suppose that the divvy of newly acquired resources
<br>
would involve a limiting reproduction rate of, say, one sentient per nine
<br>
months, again to prevent gaming the system.  If you reproduce faster than
<br>
that, i.e. two sentients per nine months, those two sentients only get
<br>
half the usual share of newly acquired resources until enough time passes
<br>
to validate them as full citizens, first-come first-served.  This, in
<br>
turn, may naturally increase the MLS requirement when you spawn lots of
<br>
new citizens simultaneously.  And it ensures that the disadvantage applied
<br>
to rapid-reproduced citizens is only temporary... in the long run, that
<br>
is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So in the end we may wind up back with distasteful-but-equitable enforced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits on reproduction.  Its really outside the realm of average human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience to produce hundreds of children anyway, so a limit of 10 or 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be perfectly acceptable to most.  It's not high enough to satisfy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams of any King Solomon wanna-be, but it is already established that not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every wish can possibly be granted in Sysop space (unless some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wildest theoretical possibilities for, say, tapping into other universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove tenable).
</em><br>
<p>Not every wish can be granted in Sysop space, definitely, regardless of
<br>
physics.  Example:  &quot;I wish to conquer Old Earth and make all the
<br>
inhabitants my slaves.&quot;  You may be able to get an indetectably good
<br>
illusion of this, but you can never have the actuality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To quote some Native American philosophy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Look behind you. See your sons and your daughters. They are your future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look farther, and see your sons' and your daughters' children and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children's children even unto the seventh generation. That's the way we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught.&quot;
