Are you kidding?  Who's not paying attention here?
<br>
<p>A pyramid?  Hebrew lettering?  Am I missing something here?  The concept
<br>
submitted was a symbol for conscious AI (an eye with no style smacking of
<br>
religion, e.g. Egyptian Ra) within a unicursal geometric star.  Neither is
<br>
Jewish.  I'm not sure how you managed to find Hebrew lettering in such.
<br>
There are no characters whatsoever from any linguistic family.  I take it
<br>
your parents are (or were) Jewish, and perhaps your upbringing has something
<br>
to do with subliminally reading Hebrew characters.  
<br>
<p>Here is a suggestion:  Forget about a mark based upon an object and focus
<br>
upon creating a graphic based upon the (English) letters SIAI.  Or even
<br>
incorporating the first characters of code proposed for Friendly AI as a
<br>
symbolic representation.

</em><br>
<p>In the words of Mr. Boffo:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ucomics.com/misterboffo/viewmb.cfm?uc_full_date=20010625">http://www.ucomics.com/misterboffo/viewmb.cfm?uc_full_date=20010625</a>
<br>
<p>Any symbol can be interpreted as religious.  However, using an eye in a
<br>
pyramid surrounded by Hebrew lettering as your symbol is just begging for
<br>
trouble.
<br>
<p>Picking a symbol that has no immediate mystical connotations to the
<br>
average browsing rationalist is a different task than picking a symbol
<br>
which *cannot* be mystically interpreted.  We might put three graphics on
<br>
the back of a T-Shirt, but if so, we'd probably put them in a straight
<br>
line rather than a triangle.
<br>
<p>And SIAI's current decision is that we want to stay out of trouble, and
<br>
that this is worth some visual inconvenience if required.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any possible SIAI mark could have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textual disclaimer or explanation of the symbol for the public.
</em><br>
<p>A symbol that requires explanation to avert a bad reaction is not
<br>
acceptable - we'd take something totally abstract first.
