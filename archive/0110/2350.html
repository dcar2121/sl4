<p>
Okay, there have been sentiments expressed on occasion that we need 
<br>
an FAQ.  So, I've decided to get off my ass and put one together.  In 
<br>
the same vein, I'll be creating a Web site to serve as a gateway to 
<br>
things that Singularitarians should read (don't inundate me with 
<br>
links just yet; I'll post something up in a couple of weeks and then 
<br>
send links if I left something out).
<br>
<p>Now, aside from a statement of intent, I'm posting here because I 
<br>
need some help.  Basically, I need to know what are the questions 
<br>
that need to be answered.  Below is my initial list of questions that 
<br>
I can remember needing answered, but, especially if you are new to 
<br>
the Singularity, respond to this message with whatever questions you 
<br>
have.  For now, I think it would be appropriate to keep this 
<br>
discussion on list since it will help with the identification of 
<br>
subquestions, but if it gets too far away from SL4 appropriate I'll 
<br>
take it off list.
<br>
<p>The Questions:
<br>
<p>What is the Singularity?
<br>
What/who is a Singularitarian?
<br>
How are Singularitarians related to Extropians/Transhumaninsts/etc.? 
<br>
[separate questions?]
<br>
How can I help advance the Singularity?
<br>
What is the Sysop?
<br>
What is computronium?
<br>
How do you expect to react to opposition?
<br>
The Singularity will never happen for reason X.  Your response?
<br>
What is Friendly AI?
<br>
What about X about Friendly AI? [A:  see CFAI FAQ]
<br>
What is the meaning of life? [A: supplied by Eliezer already ;-)]
<br>
Why should I care about the Singularity?
<br>
Wow, the Singularity is AMAZING.  Should I go enlighten everyone to 
<br>
it? [A: just to ward off any worries, my answer to this is along the 
<br>
lines of 'level people up slowly, not all at once']
<br>
Does the Singularity encourage political belief X?
<br>
Is there a central philosophy that Singularitarians hold?
<br>
When will the Singularity happen?
<br>
How much computing power will we need to get AI off the ground?
<br>
Does famous person/group X support the Singularity?!?
<br>
I just wrote this AI.  It is going to bring us to the Singularity! 
<br>
Want to see it?
<br>
How many Singularitarians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
<br>
Okay, how many ops/sec will the Singularity really bring about?
<br>
Does the Singularity mean I can live forever?
<br>
I'm scared.  What should I do?
<br>
I have another question.  Where can I ask it?
<br>
<p>Well, I think this is a good start.
<br>
<p>Finally, just to let everyone know how I plan to do this, my initial 
<br>
thought is to keep the FAQ in the CVS repository on my computer and 
<br>
then build it using a Python script into a Web page.  This way I can 
<br>
have old versions of the questions/answers and won't be stuck if I 
<br>
try out a new answer and it sucks.  If anyone knows of a tool 
<br>
designed just for FAQ writing, please let me know about it.  Only 
<br>
Unix or Mac software, though.
