You still didn't read Diaspora did you? I don't see any reason that the
humans who want to can't stay on Earth and just keep living the same way
after the Singularity. Probably be a lot less of them around though, at
least for a while. The sysop can keep them from killing themselves off.
Might be interesting to see how far strictly human minds will be able to
develop technology.

Of course I read Diaspora.  Of course some humans can choose not to
transform.  But unless the species has the ability to transform, and
especially vastly increased intellectual abilities, humanity will not
survive its current and increasing challenges.  Or it will for a time but
will degenerate  quickly.  When I say humans must transform or perish I am
not subscribing for every single individual but for the capabilities of the
species.  Perhaps this is the confusion?  Diaspora contains the ultimate
transformation of humanity as a species.  That leaves enough room for lots
of different types of individual and group choices but certainly does not
dispute my point.  Sorry if it was unclear.
