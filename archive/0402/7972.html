not as hard...
<br>
<p>Well, assuming we make a marked point of &quot;intending&quot; humaneness, that
<br>
sounds like a good start :) 
<br>
<p>I didn't get the impression from CFAI that Eliezer thought the
<br>
massively iterated pure self-modification should happen before the
<br>
concepts and goal system reflected a high degree of convergence.   His
<br>
position seemed to represent that if we get the structural
<br>
consideration correct, then given accurate information, the AI should
<br>
voluntarily refrain from such self-enhancement until it's &quot;predicted&quot;
<br>
self-enhancements are regularly MUCH better than the best programmer
<br>
enhancements, and ALL of the AGI's &quot;practice&quot; design attempts are
<br>
analytically approved by the programmers on an ongoing basis.  Plus a
<br>
margin of safety.  If we get to this point at all, it seems a
<br>
statistical near-certainty that that convergence has happened.
<br>
<p>We probably STILL can't conclude whether or not that convergence will
<br>
be maintained into transhumanity , but it seems like the most solid
<br>
methodology I've heard proposed.  Although, most other specific
<br>
recommendations I've seen aren't really an integrated set of ideas,
<br>
but rather a disparate set of recommendations.  
<br>
<p>I think that as Eliezer further develops his ideas, and restates them
<br>
in more standardized terminology (i.e. game theory and experimental
<br>
economics, etc..), then the precepts of Friendly AI should be more
<br>
accessible to a larger body of specialists.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my academic experience, most of the minds that COULD be
</em><br>
contributing to the theory are pretty much doing all they can, on
<br>
information overload, to filter out the crap from their respective
<br>
field.  That more or less results in ignoring content not phrased in
<br>
readily processible terminology.  So as I see it, one of the biggest
<br>
challenges to the disemination of Friendliness Theory is a matter of
<br>
avoiding an easy misclassification by those individuals' &quot;efficiency
<br>
measures&quot;.
