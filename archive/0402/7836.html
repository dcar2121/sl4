Jef,
<br>
<p>Yes, I see what you mean.
<br>
<p>As Curzio points out, in order to define a quality-ranking of ethical
<br>
systems, one has to make some kind of &quot;a priori&quot; assumption about what's
<br>
good or not.  One is not ranking individual ethical actions, but is rather
<br>
ranking ethical systems -- but one is still ranking according to some
<br>
standard.
<br>
<p>You're suggesting that the place to get this standard is from the *universe
<br>
itself*.  That is: favor ethical systems that embody principles that seem to
<br>
be embodied by the universe itself.  For example, growth... expansion of
<br>
information...
<br>
<p>And when you say &quot;expansion of Self&quot; is a basic principle, you're not
<br>
referring necessarily to the &quot;psychosocial self&quot; of an individual mind, but
<br>
just as much to &quot;self&quot; as the holistic integrity of a coherent set of
<br>
patterns.  You're largely stating Charles Peirce's &quot;Law of Mind&quot;, that a
<br>
pattern, once existent, will tend to strive to extend itself throughout the
<br>
mind/universe....  This is also the key idea underlying Nietzsche's vision
<br>
of the universe as &quot;morphology and will to power,&quot; once you subtract his
<br>
sometimes misleading (though artistic) rhetoric...
<br>
<p>A good line of thinking, thanks!
<br>
<p>-- Ben G

<em>&gt; &gt; But nonetheless, I'm not sure I like &quot;expansion of Self&quot; as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foundational ethical principle...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a difficulty in that we don't currently have good terminology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss some of these issues without introducing unintended meanings and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotations.  We also don't yet have the mathematics to properly model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-linear dynamics as we'd like to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said in my earlier post on this subject, Self is not what many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it is.  A more useful understanding  crosses borders that many feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are inviolable, little realizing that they would not be alive if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so alone as they imagine.  Systems theory, Category theory, and various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas of epistemology try to deal in a practical way with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's ultimately one interconnected process, which can be sliced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diced to provide various useful views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All our observations tell us that &quot;life&quot; is about growth.  While
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we perceive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that individual structures/organisms/persons &quot;die&quot;, we see that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected thread of information that continues, and proceeds to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further. This thread (which is not linear as the metaphor implies) appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reach as far back as we can see or imagine. We are enmeshed and part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this process, although many don't see it.  All &quot;living&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsystems dissipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy from the world around them to increase local complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex they become, the better they become at doing this. We are all part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this process on many simultaneous levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what I am saying is whether you like it or not, your existence is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth.  But you're not alone, and it is apparent that your growth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interconnected with the growth of others.  In fact your interaction with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others constitutes a larger system which follows the same rules of growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the same  &quot;expansion of Self&quot; that doesn't feel right to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feels selfish?) actually implies and promotes the growth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.  I think this point is similar to Randian morality except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they hit a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wall because they're not thinking in a broad enough context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm saying that if we're looking for some guidance -- an ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is consistent across all levels of organization -- we might look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature operates at a most fundamental level and align ourselve with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is like being aware enough to come in out of the rain, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more subtle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect that a lot of this appears to verge on the mystical at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and perhaps should be reserved for SL5.  Ben, if you'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further, please contact me offlist and I'll be happy to carry on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
