<em>&gt; OK Mikko, I'll bite -- what is the &quot;great moral system&quot; to which you refer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;-)
</em><br>
<p>I did not claim to know this great moral system, I claimed that such
<br>
exists and that we can strive to find it. The way to do that is to make
<br>
conjenctures and then allow as strong criticism to break them as possible.
<br>
If they break, they weren't really good enough and we need to keep
<br>
searching. If they don't, we can tentatively adopt them as our theories
<br>
(about morality in this case).
<br>
<p>I don't find morality to be any different in this regard as any other
<br>
sphere of knowledge.
<br>
<p>And what comes to my own view of morality, it's not something I can
<br>
explain in a short post fully. I also happen to think there's a lot that
<br>
needs refining, and alterations, since it is not my dayjob to think of
<br>
these things and try to break the conjenctures on the area of morality. If
<br>
you want name tags, I might call myself evolutionary anarchocapitalist,
<br>
popperian fallibilist, and a rationalist with some altruistic tendencies
<br>
among other things. I also have this cautious streak in my brains which I
<br>
can't fully explain to myself, but which I still tentatively accept.
<br>
<p>In short one might say that I'm currently using a sort of constraint
<br>
programming approach (having those primitives what a good solution to a
<br>
problem cannot be like helps in most cases). I also believe that solving
<br>
problems is the more important part and that the happiness we experience
<br>
when we do that is just a nice side effect.
<br>
<p>I hope this explains it a bit - I hope you didn't disappoint too much, but
<br>
I don't think we can find any one liner which accurately describes a great
<br>
moral system.
