Well I agree with most points.
<br>
<p>The only point where I disagree with EPT is where you say that any
<br>
meta-ethical or ethical system must in the end be irrational and based on
<br>
&quot;invented&quot; assumptions. If this were really the case, then there would not
<br>
be a &quot;best&quot;/&quot;better&quot; moral system but they would all be equivalent bar none
<br>
including the most evil and those that generate most negative qualia.
<br>
<p>In my opinion once you experience pain and pleasure directly, that is an
<br>
absolute frame of reference given to you, it is a data point. We can argue
<br>
that we have no real evidence other people and animals also experience the
<br>
same thing, although most people seem to be convinced that at least other
<br>
people do experience it (the reasons why they believe this are by the way
<br>
often the wrong ones). Even if you make such an argument however, then you
<br>
will agree that morally the thing to do is be conservative and assume other
<br>
people feel stuff in just about the same way; at least for now. Because if
<br>
you are not conservative you have considerable likelihood of producing
<br>
events that in retrospect may become very evil.
<br>
<p>I think that qualia-based morality is not invented or equivalent to
<br>
maximizing &lt;favorite object&gt; but the only moral theory that can justify its
<br>
stuff in universal/physical terms from a simple perceptual perspective.
<br>
<p>Another thing that made me think is how easily you dismiss an orgasmic
<br>
universe as not worthy of being our ultimate goal. I don't see any good
<br>
reason to dismiss it. First, all growth and freedom are in the end only
<br>
there to let us increase our happiness. With immediate happiness who cares
<br>
about everything else including freedom and growth? Second, the things that
<br>
look so cool to us now, like space exploration, warping the laws of physics,
<br>
whatever you care to imagine following from immense growth and freedom,
<br>
these are just little tricks for an AI who has already gotten there. There
<br>
is no intrinsic moral valence in freedom. Making an AI is easy. Going
<br>
transhuman is easy. We just haven't gotten there yet. Once you do get there,
<br>
it will be just normal. &quot;The laws of physics have always allowed it&quot;. No
<br>
intrinsic &quot;good&quot; in being smarter, it's just a state of affairs. That looks
<br>
cool now because we're pathetic monkeys thinking about how many bananas we
<br>
can eat with transhuman AI, but won't be cause for excitement or joy after
<br>
we get there; any more than we rejoyce about having binocular vision when we
<br>
wake in the morning.
<br>
<p>Everything that has value for us, including romance, reproduction, success,
<br>
freedom, achieving our goals, this ONLY makes sense from our particular
<br>
perspective of evolved mammals. These are coupled with happiness so closely
<br>
for us that when we think of success we think of happiness, when we think of
<br>
freedom we think of the absolute good. But these things are good only
<br>
because they are always (from our perspective) followed by happiness. We
<br>
must decouple these and realize that satisfaction alone is our ultimate goal
<br>
and the factors that commonly trigger it are dispensable and irrelevant.
<br>
<p>This is not an argument in favor of the orgasmium universe which is only one
<br>
scenario. I personally think that in order to keep maximizing positive
<br>
qualia and minimizing negative ones, a lot of resources will need to be
<br>
dedicated to growth and research. All I am saying is that we can't dismiss
<br>
the orgasmium very easily. It is probably a mistake to consider orgasmium as
<br>
a mindless jelly; more likely it will be a highly intelligent substance
<br>
capable of producing transhuman qualia of all sorts. Therefore I see a
<br>
window of possibility of growth being a necessary precursor to maximization
<br>
of positive qualia and minimization of negative ones (although not a
<br>
&quot;sibling&quot; supergoal, just a physical necessity).
<br>
<p>So this is the experiment. Whenever something good happens, try to break it
<br>
down. the sensation it triggered vs. the actual event. How do these look
<br>
when separated?
