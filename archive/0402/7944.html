<p>
It's interesting to note the near-religious fervor that accompanies the
<br>
discussion on this list of saving humanity via a single savior AI.  It's a
<br>
common pattern, when apprehension of a serious threat to survival coincides
<br>
with an apparent single solution that will require a particularly narrow
<br>
focus to achieve.  It's the kind of pattern cults form around, but it's
<br>
clear that Eliezer is aware of this, and equally clear he has no intention
<br>
of forming one. I admire his altruism, and readiness to admit that his
<br>
thinking changes as he grows in knowledge and experience.
<br>
<p>However, I am concerned that humanity is approaching a critical time, when
<br>
the appropriate choices and actions will make a big difference, and that the
<br>
narrow approach is not the one true way.
<br>
<p>A single solution is not natures's way, and I see all around evidence that
<br>
we are fundamentally enmeshed in nature, that there is a backgound process
<br>
of increasing complexity that drives all progress, and that complexity with
<br>
long-term survival value is accompanied by *increasing diversity*.
<br>
<p>As the members of this list will generally agree, our greatest threats to
<br>
survival arise from humankind's relative immaturity and therefore lack of
<br>
wisdom in dealing with the next higher level of human interaction and
<br>
capability.  We are now effectively a global organism but we don't have any
<br>
experience keeping a global organism alive and growing.  Naturally, at the
<br>
same rough time frame that we achieve global connectivity and influence, we
<br>
also have access to technology that (for good and bad) has an inherent
<br>
global impact.  Nature does not guarantee humans survival, but if we are to
<br>
survive, it is by using the tools nature has provided at this time and level
<br>
of complexity that we find ourselves in and by applying them in a way that
<br>
is most effective.
<br>
<p>The tools that are now becoming available at this time and level of
<br>
complexity are information tools.  Tools for sharing information widely
<br>
across the global organism so the organism can make effective decisions for
<br>
survival.  In effect, tools for increasing wisdom.  It's already happening
<br>
with the Internet, a global economy, and many other examples that members of
<br>
this list are well aware of.
<br>
<p>I have little doubt that progress will continue, but there is great
<br>
uncertainty as to how painful it will be for humanity.  Great changes
<br>
generally involve a process of breakdown before further growth can proceed,
<br>
and this is where we can focus our efforts. Most effective change occurs
<br>
when all the components are positioned for change at the right time.
<br>
<p>My point is that we can contribute most effectively to this process by
<br>
increasing intelligence *at all functional points* within the global
<br>
organism.  It's happening anyway, with human intelligence already becoming
<br>
augmented with media streams, personal computers, PDAs, mobile phones,  all
<br>
networked, with the trend toward ubiquitous intelligence all around and
<br>
within us. We can't ignore the exponentionally enhancing power of networks.
<br>
Rather than put all energy and hopes into a great Friendly AI  to take over
<br>
and protect us as in the myths of old, we would do better to place our faith
<br>
(yes, faith of the Bayesian kind) in spreading knowledge over a much wider
<br>
network of nodes and work with nature.  Not one great AI, but innumerable
<br>
augmented intellects.
<br>
<p>We'll be changed in the process, but we'll look back and see that it was
<br>
both natural and &quot;good.&quot;
<br>
