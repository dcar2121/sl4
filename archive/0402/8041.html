<p>
My name is Brett Swanson and I have only been lurking on this mailing list for 
<br>
a little over a week.  I am a senior at Colorado State University, studying 
<br>
creative writing and journalism.  Obviously, my ability to contribute to these 
<br>
discussions will, for the time being at least, be somewhat limited.  
<br>
Therefore, though earlier than perhaps I would have liked, I feel compelled to 
<br>
respond about The Observer article on climate change.
<br>
<p>The fact is, the Pentagon Has created a document much as The Observer 
<br>
reported.  This document, however, was given to Fortune magazine earlier this 
<br>
month.  The Observer's fault is not in misrepresenting the content of the 
<br>
document but, rather, it misrepresents the level of secrecy surrounding it.  
<br>
Obviously, this is a case wherein The Observer decided to sex-up its article 
<br>
by creating a &quot;secret-document&quot; scenario.  Undoubtedly, The Observer obtained 
<br>
the document through somewhat secretive means, but it's not the top-secret 
<br>
situation they describe.
<br>
<p>That being said, the concerns presented in the article are real.  There has 
<br>
been a shift in environmental thinking recently amongst many scientists.  
<br>
Namely, that global warming might not be the long-term phenomenon that people 
<br>
have assumed it is.  Intense temperature changes, droughts, and other extreme 
<br>
natural disasters are possible.  Many in The Pentagon think that this kind of 
<br>
climate change needs to be considered.  They are taking it seriously, so I 
<br>
think it follows that we should take it seriously as well.
<br>
<p>I end with a link to the original Fortune article, a link to an older article 
<br>
that describes the science behind the doomsdsay scenarios in greater detail, 
<br>
and an open-ended question from someone who's relatively ignorant concerning 
<br>
the topics this mailing list addresses:  If this new paradigm for viewing 
<br>
global warming is to be taken seriously, and I would emphatically argue that 
<br>
it is, how might it affect the singularity and transhumanism?
