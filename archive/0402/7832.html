Hi Ben,
<br>
<p>Here are my first dribbles of thought on the 'ethical theories' thread...
<br>
<p>Are you looking for only theories on ethics or perhaps including theories 
<br>
on wisdom too?
<br>
<p>Ethics are (simplistically?) about right and wrong - where I think the 
<br>
issue of 'right conduct' in relation to 'the other' I think is central.
<br>
<p>But I picked up a feeling from your comments that you are definitely 
<br>
covering the notion of 'wise conduct' as it bears on the self's best 
<br>
interest - for example &quot;treat others well because that will allow a higher 
<br>
level of personal self-development&quot;.....
<br>
<p>The issue of how we/AGIs can judge masses of systems that may or 
<br>
may not be directly commensurable still remains whether the focus is 
<br>
on ethics (with regard to the 'other' or wisdom in relation to both the self 
<br>
and the 'other').
<br>
<p>I haven't yet thought enough about your idea of having a meta-level 
<br>
system for comparing ethical and wisdom systems.  I did have a go at 
<br>
something like this years ago when I was trying to develop ways of 
<br>
judging wildly different economic systems as part of a virtual reality 
<br>
exercise - ie. each scenario would have it's own internal logic and 
<br>
cultural success factors - but how would you choose between the 
<br>
preferred futures (using your current values? or the values within each 
<br>
scenario?  or using a meta-judgement system that somehow allows you 
<br>
to be across all these systems at once?)
<br>
<p>There's some interesting insights from psychological research that 
<br>
suggests that people's long term circumstances have surprisingly little 
<br>
effect on their subjective sense of hapiness.  People tend to have a 
<br>
normal state of happiness that is set by internal factors and they trend 
<br>
back to this state after deviations caused by external changes.
<br>
<p>Having such a psychology perhaps makes it easy for humans to be 
<br>
able to live stably in a staggeringly diverse number of ways - as shown 
<br>
by anthropological and sociological studies - so adding to human 
<br>
resilience and survival.  (Having said this however, I'm not sure what 
<br>
this thought has to do with your core interest of finding a meta-
<br>
comparison/judgement system for ethical/wisdom(?) theories!!!)
<br>
<p>You original line of inquiry started when you ported the meta approach 
<br>
to judging scientific systems to the ethical theories domain.  But isn't 
<br>
the scientific domain about what 'is'/what 'could be' rather than what 
<br>
'ought' to be?  Using scientific insights we can imagine alternative 
<br>
possible states of reality.  But ethics and wisdom acutally influences 
<br>
which of those states we try to bring into existence.
<br>
<p>Maybe ethics only can be created by social beings.  ie. ones that are 
<br>
programmed to consider the needs of 'other' as well as the needs of 
<br>
'self'.  Wisdom could be generated/practiced by a non-social being as a 
<br>
technique for seeking the super-optimised achievement of the being's 
<br>
felt objectives.
<br>
<p>But if a being can change its own objectives then how can it judge what 
<br>
is wisdom?  Doesn't everything collapses back into relativism.
<br>
<p>Maybe what we are after is a solution that is not actually infintely meta 
<br>
but a more mundane thing......given that we have more than one being 
<br>
in the universe now that can reflect on how the world could be 
<br>
structured and that these beings can act socially to find a mode of 
<br>
moving into the future that improves the chances that each of being 
<br>
achieving a decent and worthwhile life they can now choose to shape 
<br>
new beings that enter this population (children / AGIs, etc.) to also show 
<br>
the same respect for others and that we can help shape the new entity 
<br>
so that it maximises its chance to be fulfilled while living in this socially 
<br>
considerate way.
<br>
<p>So the objective is a kind of mutual adjustment so that the system as a 
<br>
whole is adjusted to optimise for a set of the parts of the system. 
<br>
<p>But there is also a thread of our thinking, on this list, where we seem to 
<br>
be subscribing to a sense of creation or progress where the parts of the 
<br>
system are the vehicles for the unfolding of the system as a whole to 
<br>
achieve a greater state.  But how can parts of the system judge what is 
<br>
a better condition for the system as a whole - especially in the distant 
<br>
future which has yet to evolve?  
<br>
<p>Are we playing around with two drivers?
<br>
<p>- an urge to create a social system where all sentient beings with 
<br>
sufficient reflective power are expected to optimise their own lives in 
<br>
ways that are not at the expense of the other beings that are given 
<br>
moral regard
<br>
<p>- an urge to contribute to the unfolding of a more wonderful 
<br>
universe....... (but what constitutes a more wonderful universe would 
<br>
most likely be rather different for different beings)
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
