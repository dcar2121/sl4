<p>
Ben,
<br>
<p>I agree with many points you raised.
<br>
<p>1- most people think that believing in god is morally correct. but we know
<br>
they are wrong, deluded, irrational, stupid. so we can't just assume that
<br>
people's collective intuitive definition of what is moral would be a
<br>
reasonable one! And who are we to judge? we're people smart enough to make
<br>
it happen, make a transhuman AI, create the next step in human evolution.
<br>
And we are _discussing_ about it, whether most people don't discuss about
<br>
absolute moral standards regardless of what their take is on the subject.
<br>
Notice that there was not one person on this list who proposed to leave out
<br>
a particular country, who suggested any kind of racism toward people or even
<br>
animals. On other lists there was always a guy who fiercely opposed allowing
<br>
animals to matter, but nobody objected here. So although discussions get a
<br>
bit personal sometimes which I don't think they should, we still are in a
<br>
pool of gifted people who are not having crazy ideas but span from
<br>
replicating human infrastructure that produces morality, to perfectly
<br>
symmetric qualia optimization theories, to joyous growth for everyone. The
<br>
common denominator has been complete symmetry in all the moral theories that
<br>
have been proposed. I don't think we can be more open minded, more correct,
<br>
than we are being, with the present mammalian brain we have to work with. So
<br>
when we tell them, no, no god for you. We are not just using our advantage
<br>
to impose our moral standards. We have the advantage because we are smarter
<br>
and as a consequence our moral standard is also better. If they want a god
<br>
loving ai they can make one themselves :-)
<br>
<p>2- cultural variation makes the task of extracting the 'average human'
<br>
impossible (as I pointed out myself). I am not talking about eating sushi
<br>
with ketchup vs. wasabi, but about entire tribes or populations believing in
<br>
hammurabi's law's moral correctness, valuing the collective over the
<br>
individual, and otherwise holding beliefs that are in sharp contrast with
<br>
western liberal ideas. Suicide bombers, terrorists, cannibalism, human
<br>
sacrifice, japanese dying of overwork for their company. You can't average a
<br>
suicide bomber with a regular human. Would their memes get diluted in a
<br>
large population sample? Maybe the bombing part would, but the final
<br>
result... I don't know what will come out, probably a standard human that is
<br>
equally alien to every regular human.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second point here may seem bizarrely egomaniacal - who am I to judge
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; vast mass of humanity as being ethically wrong on major points?  And yet,
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; has to be observed that the vast mass of humanity has shifted its ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs many times over history.  At many points in history, the vast mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humans believed slavery was ethical, for instance.  Now, you could
</em><br>
argue
<br>
<p>At any point in history, you can find individual A who thinks that doing
<br>
&lt;presently thought of as immoral action&gt; to B is right. However, the same A
<br>
would not switch sides with B. In B's judgment of course receiving &lt;X&gt; was
<br>
not right. In saddam's view, torturing people was right. But he wouldn't
<br>
have switched places.
<br>
Therefore the greatest plauge in human morality is lack of symmetry.
<br>
&quot;Minimization of negative qualia&quot; is the most symmetrical law I can think
<br>
of, as it targets not the being, but the actual sensation of discomfort,
<br>
which, if absent, makes the corresponding mind morally irrelevant. So if it
<br>
has no other advantage versus other moralities, at least it is symmetric. I
<br>
think that 'symmetry' is a required ingredient of any moral system. If it's
<br>
not symmetric it's got nothing to do with morality. That is probably one
<br>
criterion that can be defined meta-ethical if you wish. So I think we can
<br>
replace &quot;moral law&quot; with &quot;collective goal system in which everyone profits
<br>
equally&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that if they'd had enough information, and carried out enough discussion
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; deliberation, they might have decided it was bad.  Perhaps this is the
</em><br>
case.
<br>
<p>I doubt it. What other information is needed to convince you to stop slavery
<br>
when you see people exhibiting the whole range of human emotions, you see
<br>
them scream and cry and bond with each other? Definitely information was
<br>
already there. And, discussion was also there, just they weren't discussing
<br>
whether to free slaves or not, or to take them back to africa or give them
<br>
green cards; they were discussing about how much more work they could be
<br>
forced to do. _This_ is what human morality can allow. Hence, the need for
<br>
something a bit better.
<br>
<p>my two cents (they will add up someday) :)
