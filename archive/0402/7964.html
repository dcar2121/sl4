<p>
Ben,
<br>
<p>The major point of Friendly AI (CFAI) addressing this concern, is we
<br>
must conservatively assume that we're probably not smart enough to
<br>
properly define any of these ethical prescriptions much better than
<br>
we've been able to.  If we can, that's great, and desireable on a
<br>
number of levels.
<br>
<p>But maybe we won't, and quite possibly we'll be confused into thinking
<br>
we're right.
<br>
<p>We'd better make damn sure that the AGI we end up with does not lack
<br>
the structural capability to represent those &quot;highly complex and messy
<br>
networks of beliefs&quot;, and renormalize them.  If we can't guarantee
<br>
that the AGI will remain humane under both state-of-ethics scenarios,
<br>
then we should continue to improve our design.  The forementioned
<br>
messy belief network itself is not necessarily the goal, but its
<br>
structural accessibility to the AGI as a fundamental consideration is
<br>
a goal.  
<br>
<p>It may be that our current theories are lacking, but if they are
<br>
well-enough defined to delineate knowably unpredictable circumstances,
<br>
then there is no excuse for &quot;being taken by surprise&quot; by AGI behavior.
<br>
We may choose, most likely due to impending disaster, to explicitly
<br>
accept risks that our theory knowably exposes, but the conservative
<br>
and responsible path would be to rely upon only those mechanisms whose
<br>
structure is defined within the theory.  
<br>
<p>In other words, if we're doing something we can't fundamentally
<br>
explain, then we don't understand it.  The things that we KNOW we
<br>
don't understand should either be examined further, or excluded from
<br>
consideration.  The fact that we cannot know the risk imposed by the
<br>
the things we don't understand AND are unaware of entirely, would seem
<br>
to dictate that we minimize all known risk compulsively.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I am off-base here, and it could be that Eliezer is rolling
<br>
his eyes reading this, but that is part of what I see as a core
<br>
concept behind CFAI.  
<br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And one more point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said in my essay that &quot;Be nice to humans&quot; or &quot;Obey your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human masters&quot; are simply too concrete and low-level ethical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prescriptions to be expected to survive the Transcension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I suggest that a highly complex and messy network of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs like Eliezer's &quot;humane-ness&quot; is insufficiently crisp, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elegant and abstract to be expected to survive the Transcension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still suspect that abstract principles like &quot;Voluntary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joyous Growth&quot; have a greater chance of survival.  Initially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are grounded in human concepts and feelings -- in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of &quot;humane-ness&quot; -- as as the Transcension proceeds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will gain other, related groundings.
</em><br>
