<em>&gt; Well, I guess that you have a different meta-principle, that's all... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; articulated two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Joyous Growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Human Stability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you're insisting on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Pure Joy
</em><br>
<p>Can I rename my meta-principle to the nexus principle (a la startrek)?
<br>
<p>The nexus in startrek was an area in which every being's dreams became true.
<br>
Captain kirk was found here, enjoying eternal life with his wife before
<br>
Picard came to bother him. In ST the nexus travelled randomly in space. The
<br>
nexus I propose is something that expands voluntarily in every possible
<br>
direction taking negative qualia producing processes and bettering them for
<br>
the beings instantiated in those processes (=modifying existing processes so
<br>
that the resulting qualia streams do not contain negativity). &lt;flash&gt;
<br>
instant bonification, instant fulfillment, everything starts going right,
<br>
heaven delivered to your door.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; guiding principles.  If you choose a different guiding principle than me,
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; have no way to argue against you...
</em><br>
<p>You talk about joyous growth. I am not sure that growth and joy are
<br>
interdependent. In humans, growth leads to joy both because we are wired to
<br>
enjoy discovery and because discovery gives us power to overcome negative
<br>
factors. Although I can imagine a qualia-free universe in which ever more
<br>
complex patterns arise but in which nobody is conscious (though this may in
<br>
practice be impossible). I can also imagine a qualia-filled universe in
<br>
which there is not much growth at all. So is it possible for you to separate
<br>
joyous growth into joy and growth as independent principles?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your examples seem to be of &quot;qualia complexity&quot; as much as of intensity --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance, are you sure crying listening to classical music is *more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense* than laughing listening to children's music?
</em><br>
<p><p>Regarding qualia complexity vs. intensity: yes of course, who knows! That is
<br>
why I am not making such a strong point out of positive qualia as much as I
<br>
am with negative ones. If I were to decide right here right now about
<br>
complexity, I'd say complexity and intensity are equally important. But we
<br>
do want something to do after we're enhanced and all laws of physics are
<br>
discovered right? Trying every positive quale that physics allows seems like
<br>
a good hobby, no need to decide now whether complexity is more important
<br>
than intensity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Also, what if the MAXIMUM INTENSITY of positive qualia is achievable only
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; a universe where the AVERAGE VALENCE of qualia is near zero?  I.e., what
</em><br>
if
<br>
<em>&gt; universes in which lots of positive AND negative qualia exist, are the
</em><br>
ones
<br>
<em>&gt; in which the most intensely wonderful positive qualia exist?
</em><br>
<p>not likely, but if so, then we're screwed :)
<br>
we are in a universe in which 'good' cannot be realized, therefore existence
<br>
is evil.
<br>
<p>In that case, the moral thing would be to opt for a dull universe I guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are a lot of things about qualia we don't understand... particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when talking about the universe-wide system of interlocking qualia...
</em><br>
<p>I agree, that is why comparison between positive and negative qualia,
<br>
especially quantitative ones, are impossible with our current level of
<br>
knowledge.
<br>
<p>But there are very clear areas in which we _can_ use qualia morality. For
<br>
example, abortion is not a problem if there isn't a developed neural net in
<br>
the fetus. For example, going to war for any reason is wrong, since no
<br>
economic advantage given to 100 million people will make up for 1 guy losing
<br>
an arm.
