<p>
Damien Broderick's quote from Ken MacLeod can be thought about 
<br>
through the lense of in-group / out-group ethics.
<br>
<p>Lots of ethics have very different rules/guidance relating to how to 
<br>
behave in relation to the members of one's in-group (family, tribe 
<br>
enthnic group, religion, club, nation, etc.) as compared to the out-group 
<br>
(anyone else).
<br>
<p>Usually ethics structure this way lead to less nastiness between the in-
<br>
group members but frequently more natiness in relation to the out-
<br>
group.
<br>
<p>But this result doesn't prove that acting 'morally' or 'ethically' is worse 
<br>
than not not acting  'morally' or 'ethically'.  It just shows that that the 
<br>
ethics/morals in question are not designed to reduce nastiness between 
<br>
outgroups.
<br>
<p>It's interesting to see what humans do to religious codes that seem to 
<br>
argue that we should treat the out group well.  Chistianity specifically 
<br>
talks about that (Good Samaritan story, thou shalt not kill [humans]).  
<br>
But plenty of Christians have killed people. But I think the common 
<br>
feature is that most people killed by Christians are outgroups in relation 
<br>
to the specific Christian communities doing the killing.
<br>
<p>My feeling is that humans have evolved in a tribal setting where they 
<br>
have been in intense competition with other tribes (we are more like 
<br>
Chimpansees than Bonobos in this regard).  So we do NOT have a 
<br>
natural anthropocentric hard-wired ethical framework.  I think we are 
<br>
trained culturally (in most cases) and perhaps are hard-wired to bond to 
<br>
an in-group which we usually treat well and will defend. (As an aside 
<br>
the in-group can include more than humans - it can include dogs, 
<br>
horses, cars, computers, works of art......depending on how our bonding 
<br>
process goes!!). But we find it scarily easy to be nasty to anyone or 
<br>
anything that is outside the in-group if it threatens us or gets in the way.
<br>
<p>If AGIs are going to be very clever one day and they are likely to 
<br>
spread themselves through the universe then not only for our sake but 
<br>
for the sake of anything in the rest of the universe, I think we need to 
<br>
help AGIs develop a 'universal' (is that a pun??) ethic that puts (?????) 
<br>
nothing in an out-group for the AGI.  So everything would be treated 
<br>
with consideration and respect for its its actual or potential selfhood (or 
<br>
something).  I haven't thought through this sort of 'no-outgroup' ethic.  
<br>
Are there people who have workable ethics of this sort.
<br>
<p>By the way, my guess would be that if one adopted a universal no-out-
<br>
group philosophy that it would have to have some gradation of 
<br>
consideration - otherwise the person adopting the philosophy would not 
<br>
be able to act in any way for fear of negatively affect the rest of the 
<br>
universe - can't walk 'cos the dust might be affected beneath my feet.
<br>
<p>But the value of a universal ethic is that there is mindfulness whenever 
<br>
anything is done and the level of respect shown to some category or 
<br>
element of the universe can be tweaked up or down according to 
<br>
experience and growing wisdom without having to fundamentally 
<br>
challenge the structure of the ethic in order to get nicer behaviour.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
