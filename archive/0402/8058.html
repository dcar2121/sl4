Mr. Sutton:
<br>
<p>I think the problem, as I defined it, was ill-posed. I simply can't
<br>
understand *why* a truly intelligent being would act out of pure
<br>
altruism, or anything motive at all that isn't self-interest -
<br>
especially if the being had to struggle for existence. So I can't
<br>
honestly claim to know what kind of example I'm looking for, as I can't
<br>
imagine intelligent altruism.
<br>
<p>A super-intelligent entity would have less trouble than most in
<br>
&quot;surviving AND treading lightly in relation to other life&quot; alone, as you
<br>
suggest, but not if it were competing with an equally intelligent entity
<br>
that didn't play by those rules.
<br>
<p>Past patterns do need to be destiny. My argument was that the successful
<br>
existence of an entity requires it to be self-interested, and that this
<br>
follows (however indirectly) from whatever laws of the universe (think
<br>
physics) we hold immutable. It's silly to argue from this standpoint -
<br>
and perhaps from any other - if we can't assume past patterns to return
<br>
inevitably.

<p>Hi Joe,
<br>
<p>If one could demonstrate an intelligence that was not exploitative would
<br>
<p>you deny its existence?
<br>
<p>Past patterns need not be destiny, surely?
<br>
<p>Perhaps an super intelligent entity could be good at surviving AND 
<br>
treading lightly in relation to other life?  Indeen the more intelligent
<br>
it 
<br>
was perhaps the easier this multiple goal approach might be?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
