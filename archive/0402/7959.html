<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Trolling the Net briefly, I found this quote from you (from the WTA list in
<br>
Aug. 2003):
<br>
<p>***
<br>
The important thing is not to be human but to be humane. ...
<br>
<p>Though we might wish to believe that Hitler was an inhuman monster, he was,
<br>
in fact, a human monster; and Gandhi is noted not for being remarkably human
<br>
but for being remarkably humane. The attributes of our species are not
<br>
exempt from ethical examination in virtue of being &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;human&quot;.
<br>
Some human attributes, such as empathy and a sense of fairness, are
<br>
positive; others, such as a tendency toward tribalism or groupishness, have
<br>
left deep scars on human history. If there is value in being human, it
<br>
comes, not from being &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;natural&quot;, but from having within us the
<br>
raw material for humaneness: compassion, a sense of humor, curiosity, the
<br>
wish to be a better person. Trying to preserve &quot;humanness&quot;, rather than
<br>
cultivating humaneness, would idolize the bad along with the good. One might
<br>
say that if &quot;human&quot; is what we are, then &quot;humane&quot; is what we, as humans,
<br>
wish we were. Human nature is not a bad place to start that journey, but we
<br>
can't fulfill that potential if we reject any progress past the starting
<br>
point.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>If the goal of your &quot;Friendly AI&quot; project is to create an AI that is
<br>
&quot;humane&quot; in this sense, then perhaps &quot;Humane AI&quot; would be a better name for
<br>
the project...
<br>
<p>I have a few comments here.
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
I am not sure that humane-ness, in the sense that you propose, is a
<br>
well-defined concept.  Doesn't the specific set of properties called
<br>
&quot;humaneness&quot; you get depend on the specific algorithm that you use to sum
<br>
together the wishes of various individuals in the world?  If so, then how do
<br>
you propose to choose among the different algorithms?
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
How do you propose to distinguish the &quot;positive&quot; from the &quot;negative&quot; aspects
<br>
of human nature ... e.g. compassion versus tribalism?  I guess you want to
<br>
distinguish these by a kind of near-consensus process -- e.g. you're hoping
<br>
that most people, on careful consideration and discussion, will agree that
<br>
tribalism although humanly universal, isn't good?  I'm not so confident that
<br>
people's &quot;wishes regarding what they were&quot; are good ones...  (which is
<br>
another way of saying: I think my own ethic differs considerably from the
<br>
mean of humanity's)
<br>
<p><p>Do you propose to evaluate
<br>
<p>P(X is humane) = P(X is considered good by H after careful reflection and
<br>
discussion | H is human)
<br>
<p>I guess you're thinking of something more complicated along these lines (?)
<br>
<p>One runs into serious issues with cultural and individual relativity here.
<br>
<p>For instance, the vast majority of humans believe that
<br>
<p>&quot;Belief in God&quot;
<br>
<p>is a good and important aspect of human nature.  Thus, it seems to me,
<br>
&quot;Belief in God&quot; should be considered humane according to your definition --
<br>
it's part of what we humans are, AND, part of what we humans wish we were.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, I think that belief in God -- though it has some valuable
<br>
spiritual intuitions at its core -- basically sucks.  Thus, I consider it MY
<br>
moral responsibilty to work so that belief in God is NOT projected beyond
<br>
the human race into any AGI's we may create.  Unless (and I really doubt it)
<br>
it's shown that the only way to achieve other valuable things is to create
<br>
an AGi that's deluded in this way.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are many other examples besides &quot;belief in God&quot; that could
<br>
be used to illustrate this point.
<br>
<p>You could try to define humaneness as something like &quot;What humans WOULD wish
<br>
they were, if they were wiser humans&quot; -- but we humans are fucking UNwise
<br>
creatures, and this is really quite essential to our humanity... and of
<br>
course, defining this requires some ethical or metaethical standard beyond
<br>
what humans are or wish they were.
<br>
<p>??
<br>
