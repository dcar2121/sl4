</em><br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
Have we? Population growth certainly hasn't stopped. Nor has economic
<br>
growth. Resource usage continues to increase year by year.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Areas of the world are purposely left untouched.
</em><br>
<p>A few national parks amounting to a miniscule fraction of one percent of the
<br>
land area does not seem like much of a limitation. Those areas are
<br>
surrounded by land that is either actively or potentially under development.
<br>
Many public lands in the USA (especially in the West where I live) are
<br>
leased for private use.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite possible that a 'higher' being might be even more so this way.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. Or maybe not. I haven't heard any good reasons why this would be so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Just as we feel we don't have the right to remake all of nature according
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; our rules,...
</em><br>
<p>Wait a minute. Who is this &quot;we&quot; you keep referring to? The thrust of human
<br>
history since before there was recorded history has always been to expand,
<br>
to control nature and to remake it as much as possible to fit our needs.
<br>
This is as much true of Asian cultures, including the Zen-influenced culture
<br>
of Japan, as it is of Europe or America or Africa or South America. The
<br>
modern reverence for &quot;nature&quot; among citizens of the industrial democracies
<br>
generally exists in inverse proportion to that  population's exposure to
<br>
untrammeled, unimproved &quot;nature.&quot; Our ideal of nature bears more resemblance
<br>
to the idealized, **improved** form to be found in an English garden (or in
<br>
the even more artificial Zen gardens of Japan) than in raw nature, red in
<br>
tooth and claw.
<br>
<p>And where, exactly, is it written that we have, or have not, the &quot;right&quot; to
<br>
do whatever we please with nature? &quot;Rights&quot; are human constructs. Nature,
<br>
per se, has no rights whatsoever. We, on the other hand, have certain rights
<br>
that are guaranteed by our governments and by the UN Universal Declaration
<br>
of Human Rights. But you will have noticed that many of these rights are not
<br>
actually in force for many people on Earth today. By the same token, even if
<br>
there were to be some international treaty granting &quot;natural rights&quot; (so to
<br>
speak) to raw nature, those rights could not be asserted by mute nature
<br>
herself, but would have to be claimed on her behalf by others.
<br>
<p>Nature has no rights of its own, nor have humans collectively agreed (so
<br>
far) to grant nature any rights.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; it may feel that it would be wrong to overly interfere in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution of the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps some other species, AI or otherwise, may feel this way. In that
<br>
case, such a species will eventually find itself surrounded by the presence
<br>
and works of other species that have no such compunction.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You also have to ask, is there always going to be &quot;a little improvement&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible?
</em><br>
<p>It's impossible to know right now if there will be any conclusion to our
<br>
knowledge of natural law and our ability to develop technology to harness
<br>
it. We may, indeed, someday have a final Theory of Everything and maybe a
<br>
ultimate technology to go with it. But will we ever have complete and final
<br>
knowledge of mathematics? If Chaitin
<br>
(<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/</a>) is correct, this may not be
<br>
possible. So, like the lead character in Grag Egan's novel _DIASPORA_ we may
<br>
spend an unlimited future mining mathematical truths.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps a 'higher' being can at last define and reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atleast for a little while.
</em><br>
<p>If &quot;perfection&quot; only lasts &quot;for a little while&quot; then (to use some hyperbolic
<br>
Buddhist terminology) it is not the **unsurpassed, supreme perfect**
<br>
whatever.
<br>
<p>Obviously, there are many questions on this topic that we are simply not
<br>
capable of answering at this time. It would seem merely prudent, then, to
<br>
minimize the number of assumptions we make about what other, smarter beings
<br>
might want to do, or be capable of doing. All we can be sure of is what the
<br>
most intelligent species on our planet has done and is doing. Extrapolating
<br>
the behavior of this species into the future would seem to be less
<br>
problematic than assuming that a still higher intelligence would
<br>
automatically behave in a radically different fashion.
<br>
<p>You might be right. Maybe a future superintelligence will get comfortable
<br>
and just sit back and watch the universe run its course. But somehow, I
<br>
doubt it.
<br>
