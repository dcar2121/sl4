<p>Actually, &quot;penultimate&quot; means &quot;second to last&quot; .. but I guess you mean

&quot;ultimate&quot; ;-)
<br>
<p>Whether the experience of spiritually advanced humans is the &quot;ultimate of
<br>
Mind&quot; depends on one's measure for judging &quot;ultimacy&quot; I guess....
<br>
<p>According to some metrics, these experiences may well be ultimate; but the
<br>
question then becomes whether one accepts these metrics as the ultimate
<br>
metrics ;-)

<p><p>Hmmm.. I don't really like the language of &quot;absolute&quot; versus &quot;relative&quot;

truth.  (I'm aware however that these English words have shades of meaning
<br>
that may not have existed in the Oriental words used to refer to these
<br>
things in Oriental Zen texts)
<br>
<p>I think there is experiential truth, which is absolute in a sense (it simply
<br>
is what it is); and then there's relational truth, which is relative by
<br>
nature (an example of this is how the definition of &quot;what is a pattern&quot;
<br>
depends on a prior understanding of &quot;what is simplicity&quot;)
<br>
<p>I don't think the experiences of a spiritual master are any more (or less)
<br>
absolute than the experiences of you, me or Jennifer Lopez's uncle..

<p>Hmmm... I don't believe in an absolute reality underlying all the other

illusory realities
<br>
<p>But, I do acknowledge the possibility of a more pure state of mind -- in

which the world and mind are understood in a perfectly harmonious and simple

way, without the contradictions and troubles and confusions that plague our
<br>
typical state of mind's perception/construction of the world.
<br>
<p>To me, what you call &quot;seeing it all as it truly is&quot; is **just another type
<br>
of experience** ---- albeit a particularly wonderful and powerful type of
<br>
experience..
<br>
<p>Of course, some experiences are more connected to wisdom than others are.
<br>
<p>However, I don't really expect us to come to agreement on these points.
<br>
These issues are closely connected to the reasons why, although I consider
<br>
Zen Buddhism an excellent practice compared to most others, I am not a Zen
<br>
Buddhist.
