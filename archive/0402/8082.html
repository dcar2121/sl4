<p>
The Fundamental Theorem of Morality
<br>
<p>Discovery
<br>
<p>This theorem was first publicly posted to the sl4
<br>
mailing list on the World Wide Web by Marc Geddes (New
<br>
Zealand) on 29th February, 2004.
<br>
<p>Definition of Universal Morality:
<br>
<p>*UM is normative (all rational beings would converge
<br>
on a unique solution given sufficient intelligence and
<br>
time)
<br>
*UM is morally symmetric (Universal, that which works
<br>
if all sentients respect it)
<br>
*UM is consistent (Non-contradictory)
<br>
*UM is non-observer centered
<br>
<p>Definition of Personal Morality:
<br>
<p>*PM is morally asymmetric
<br>
*PM is not normative (there is no necessary
<br>
convergence between sentients)
<br>
*PM can include both observer centered and non
<br>
observer centered goals
<br>
<p>Definition of Sentient Minds:
<br>
<p>*In the most general sense of the term, a morality is
<br>
a goal system.  A general sentient goal system will be
<br>
some mixture of parts of Universal Morality and a
<br>
Personal Morality.  
<br>
<p>Since all goals are either Observer centered or not
<br>
Observer Centered, any sub-set of Universal Morality
<br>
is equivalent to the whole of Universal Morality with
<br>
some parts filtered by Personal Morality (Altruistic
<br>
goals can be deleted by taking the set of the all
<br>
goals representing Universal Morality, then blocking
<br>
out some particular goals with observer centered goals
<br>
which are the inverse of the altruistic goals).  Think
<br>
of it this way:  Universal Morality in it's entirely
<br>
is already in some sense 'present' in all sentient
<br>
minds capable of reasoning about morality.  It is
<br>
simply 'filtered' by a Personal Morality which
<br>
contains some observer centered goals the opposite of
<br>
some of the altruistic goals of Universal Morality.
<br>
<p>Therefore the structure of sentient minds can be
<br>
described as an interaction (transformation
<br>
represented by a multiplication symbol, x) of
<br>
Universal Morality (all of it) with Personal Morality.
<br>
&nbsp;The result (Mind) equals (=) the goal system of the
<br>
sentient.
<br>
<p>All possible Minds defined
<br>
<p>The space of all possible mixtures of Universal
<br>
Morality and Personal Morality is the space of all
<br>
possible sentient Minds.  Not all of these Minds will
<br>
be realizable or desirable.  Minds which have no
<br>
congruence with Universal Morality (as for instance
<br>
would be the case for all minds if there is no such
<br>
thing as UM) can be defined as:  UM = Unity 
<br>
(Universal Morality =1).  Minds with no Personal
<br>
Morality (as for instance Minds which are totally
<br>
altruistic and have no observer centered goals) can be
<br>
defined as PM = Unity (Personal Morality =1).
<br>
<p>Fundamental Theorem of Morality established
<br>
<p>All possible sentient Minds are represented by the
<br>
equation:
<br>
<p>Universal Morality x Personal Morality = Mind
<br>
<p>Friendliness and Unfriendliness
<br>
<p>The completely Friendly (good) sentients are the
<br>
sentient's with Minds congruent with Universal
<br>
Morality.  That is, the Friendly sentients are the
<br>
sentients with Personal Moralities congruent with
<br>
Universal Morality.  The completely Unfriendly (evil)
<br>
sentients are the sentients with Minds incongruent
<br>
with Universal Morality.  That is, the completely
<br>
unfriendly sentients are the sentients with Personal
<br>
Moralities completely incongruent with Universal
<br>
Morality.
