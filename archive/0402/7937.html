Curzio ... Metaqualia ... whomever you feel like being this morning ;-&gt;  ...
<br>
<p>I had a bit more to say about qualia and orgasmium and ethics, which I
<br>
didn't say before because
<br>
<p>a) it gets soooo philosophical/spiritual and veers away from the
<br>
technological/futurological focus of the conversation
<br>
<p>b) I reckoned that you might think it sounded like useless and ridiculous
<br>
mumbo-jumbo
<br>
<p>But I'm in an even stranger than usual mood this morning, so I decided to
<br>
say the extra bit anyway ;-)  At first I was going to email it just to you,
<br>
but then I decided to inflict it upon the list...
<br>
<p>Let me clarify beforehand that I do not think these are matters to be
<br>
decided through rational argumentation.  Calling them &quot;spiritual&quot; isn't
<br>
quite right either because it brings to mind images of religious
<br>
mumbo-jumbo, which I dislike as much as any other atheist/agnostic
<br>
rationalist.  But even so, these thoughts are more &quot;spiritual&quot; than
<br>
&quot;rational&quot;...
<br>
<p>So -- here we go -- some Sunday morning metaphysics...
<br>
<p>Firstly I don't think that seeking &quot;happiness&quot; in itself is a good goal,
<br>
because I think that instances of human happiness come in many different
<br>
kinds.  There are moments of happiness that center on sense-gratification,
<br>
and then there are moments of happiness that center on a feeling of
<br>
connectedness, which bridges the division between the individual and the
<br>
cosmos.  These latter moments of happiness are the ones I think are
<br>
valuable, and should be maximized.  (I stress that I don't know how to
<br>
quantify this any more than you know how to quantify your more generic
<br>
notion of &quot;happiness.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Next, about orgasmium.  My perspective is that the universe &quot;began&quot; in a
<br>
state of pure undifferentiated orgasmic bliss.  (Note, my use of &quot;began&quot;
<br>
here is not temporal in the normal sense; it's more in the sense of Peirce's
<br>
cosmogony ... in terms of what is logically or metaphysically prior.)  Then
<br>
differentiation came about -- separate objects and separate minds emerged...
<br>
leading to US among other things ... but also leading to negative qualia,
<br>
which are entirely consequent from the separation of the parts from the
<br>
whole, the subdivision of the original formless void.
<br>
<p>Now, some of these parts seek to recombine with each other in a sense --
<br>
seek to find unity with the whole, directly or via unity with other
<br>
minds/beings -- and the best moments of human experience are like this.
<br>
Sexual orgasms can be like this in some cases, particularly when experienced
<br>
with a partner ;-) ... simple things like love for one's family are like
<br>
this too (yeah, I know you can look at sexuality and family-love in terms of
<br>
evolutionary psychology as well -- and I think that's interesting -- but I
<br>
am choosing a different perspective in this context -- )
<br>
<p>But by seeking unity, are we ambitious parts merely seeking to return to the
<br>
primordial undifferentiated orgasmium?  I don't think so.  We are on a
<br>
grander quest.  We are working toward a kind of dialectical synthesis of
<br>
unity and separation, in which the parts still have their autonomy and
<br>
choice, but ALSO have the beautiful fused ecstasy and perfection of the
<br>
primordial orgasmium.  This may seem contradictory; yet, this contradiction
<br>
may just be consequent from an overly narrow application of logic.
<br>
<p>I think this relates to what you said by &quot;the way to maximize happiness may
<br>
be to have a lot of complex minds doing complex things.&quot;  I'm not sure that
<br>
is true.  The original orgasmium may have been just as happy as the
<br>
dialectical-synthesis orgasmium toward which we are tending.  But the new
<br>
one has growth and choice along with happiness -- and doesn't need to have
<br>
any LESS happiness than its predecessor....  However, the current phase of
<br>
passing through a painful separation-of-parts period is a necessary evil
<br>
(and is in fact the essence of &quot;evil&quot;) in order to pass from the
<br>
undifferentiated orgasmium to the dialectical-synthesis orgasmium.
<br>
<p>The human Transcension/Singularity should be understood as part of this
<br>
process of the void reconnecting with itself, undoing-without-undoing what
<br>
it did by separating itself from itself in the first place...
<br>
<p>Anyway that's how I look at it.  This is a further development of the
<br>
perspective in the prose poem &quot;Journey of the Void&quot; that is on my website,
<br>
and it's some of the deeper philosophy underlying the Voluntary Joyous
<br>
Growth principle that I wrote about in the Positive Transcension essay.
<br>
<p>FYI, some Zen Buddhist folks think my perspective has a lot in common with
<br>
Zen Buddhism, others see major differences
<br>
