Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only point where I disagree with EPT is where you say that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-ethical or ethical system must in the end be irrational and based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;invented&quot; assumptions. If this were really the case, then there would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a &quot;best&quot;/&quot;better&quot; moral system but they would all be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent bar none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the most evil and those that generate most negative qualia.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think all ethical systems are equivalent.  However, I think
<br>
there are many different ethical and meta-ethical systems that are
<br>
equivalently good from the point of view of reason.  Reason merely judges
<br>
whether an ethical or meta-ethical system is CONSISTENT or not.  It makes no
<br>
judgment beyond that.  And I think there are many different consistent
<br>
ethical and meta-ethical systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my opinion once you experience pain and pleasure directly, that is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute frame of reference given to you, it is a data point.
</em><br>
<p>Each quale is what it is -- positive or negative -- but the notions of
<br>
&quot;total positive qualia&quot; or &quot;total negative qualia&quot; over some region of time
<br>
are quite abstract and are not really immanent in the quales themselves in
<br>
any direct way.  It's not so clear to me that quales permit this kind of
<br>
summation --- maybe they do, but it's certainly not obvious to me...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We can argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we have no real evidence other people and animals also experience the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same thing, although most people seem to be convinced that at least other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do experience it (the reasons why they believe this are by the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often the wrong ones). Even if you make such an argument however, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will agree that morally the thing to do is be conservative and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people feel stuff in just about the same way; at least for now. Because if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are not conservative you have considerable likelihood of producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events that in retrospect may become very evil.
</em><br>
<p>I do agree with this, but not for rational, logical reasons....  I think it
<br>
is logically consistent to assume other minds have no qualia, AND it is
<br>
logically consistent to assume other minds have qualia.  The choice between
<br>
these perspectives seems NOT to be a matter for reason.  At least, given the
<br>
current state of science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that qualia-based morality is not invented or equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizing &lt;favorite object&gt; but the only moral theory that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff in universal/physical terms from a simple perceptual perspective.
</em><br>
<p>Conceivably this might be true ... but I don't see how you can justify this
<br>
statement rationally right now, when there is no rational way to even
<br>
explain how to sum up the valence of a set of qualia ... or to explain why I
<br>
should assume you have qualia ... etc.  As of now, your belief in
<br>
qualia-based morality would seem to be (yet another) nonrational belief
<br>
being used as a foundation for a value system...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another thing that made me think is how easily you dismiss an orgasmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe as not worthy of being our ultimate goal. I don't see any good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to dismiss it. First, all growth and freedom are in the end only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there to let us increase our happiness.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this last statement is a value judgment you are making.
<br>
<p>I think it is possibly a logically consistent point of view (though I'm not
<br>
certain of that).  But I am pretty sure it is not the ONLY logically
<br>
consistent point of view.
<br>
<p>When there are multiple conflicting logically consistent perspectives,
<br>
something besides logic needs to make the decision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With immediate happiness who cares
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about everything else including freedom and growth?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand that if a being is experiencing a constant orgasm than it
<br>
won't care about anything else.  To me, that does not demonstrate that
<br>
experiencing a constant orgasm is a desirable state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look so cool to us now, like space exploration, warping the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever you care to imagine following from immense growth and freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are just little tricks for an AI who has already gotten there. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no intrinsic moral valence in freedom.
</em><br>
<p>There is no intrinsic moral valence in anything, in  my view.  Moral valence
<br>
is extrinsic, it's imposed by the valuing mind.
<br>
<p>You see intrinsic moral value in happiness -- but it's YOU who's seeing
<br>
that... the moral value is in your mind, your value system, not in the
<br>
happiness itself....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everything that has value for us, including romance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduction, success,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom, achieving our goals, this ONLY makes sense from our particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective of evolved mammals.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but your notion of &quot;happiness&quot; also makes sense only from the
<br>
perspective of evolved mammals.
<br>
<p>Happiness as experienced by you is a
<br>
<p>a) a certain neurochemical cocktail, or
<br>
<p>b) less reductionistically, a certain type of experience of a certain type
<br>
of mind
<br>
<p>And then you generalize this experience into a broad concept of &quot;happiness.&quot;
<br>
Just as I generalize the human experiences of growth and choice also...
<br>
<p>We have to take our mammalian experiences and do our best to generalize and
<br>
abstract from them.  The result of this is not infinite wisdom, but it's
<br>
greater wisdom than if we just took our mammalian experiences directly as
<br>
the only truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These are coupled with happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us that when we think of success we think of happiness, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom we think of the absolute good. But these things are good only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they are always (from our perspective) followed by happiness. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must decouple these and realize that satisfaction alone is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the factors that commonly trigger it are dispensable and irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>You keep repeating that we must all realize that the goal YOU posit as
<br>
important is the only important goal!!
<br>
<p>But you can't give any kind of rational argument for this... supporting my
<br>
point that the choice of abstract ethical principles is nonrational...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not an argument in favor of the orgasmium universe which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario. I personally think that in order to keep maximizing positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia and minimizing negative ones, a lot of resources will need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicated to growth and research. All I am saying is that we can't dismiss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the orgasmium very easily. It is probably a mistake to consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orgasmium as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mindless jelly; more likely it will be a highly intelligent substance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of producing transhuman qualia of all sorts. Therefore I see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; window of possibility of growth being a necessary precursor to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of positive qualia and minimization of negative ones (although not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sibling&quot; supergoal, just a physical necessity).
</em><br>
<p>I agree, it is possible that the maximum of joy, growth and choice will
<br>
occur via some kind of universewide cosmis orgasmium.  Quite possible!  Gee,
<br>
I hope so...
<br>
<p>But if the choice comes down to orgasmium VERSUS &quot;growth and freedom plus a
<br>
decent amount of joy&quot; I'm going to choose the latter, whereas it seems
<br>
you're going to choose the former.  And that's fine with me, so long as we
<br>
each get the choice (because choice, according to my value system though not
<br>
yours, is a fairly important thing)
<br>
