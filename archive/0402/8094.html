<p>
Tomaz,
<br>
You're correct that productivity is rising. So are corporate profits. And
<br>
the unemployment rate is not going up. But neither is the employment rate
<br>
increasing by much. With the economy expanding this much and yet not
<br>
creating many new jobs, we are perhaps seeing the effects of
<br>
computer-assisted productivity increases combined with job-outsourcing
<br>
(sending jobs overseas).
<br>
<p>The net result for the US economy is a nice growth rate with low inflation.
<br>
But the effects upon many individual Americans -- the aggregate of the
<br>
unemployed and the underemployed (those who lost high-paying jobs and have
<br>
had to settle for much lower-paying jobs) -- is not at all reassuring.
<br>
<p>I suspect that Samantha is right in predicting that this situation will get
<br>
worse; that is, this may be the &quot;new normal&quot; and it will continue and
<br>
intensify.
<br>
<p>The danger this poses for Singularity efforts stems from the likelihood that
<br>
this growing mass of disaffected people may give up hope and lash out at the
<br>
high-tech they believe to have caused their suffering. By high-tech I don't
<br>
mean only the machinery, but also those people who are associated with the
<br>
creation and use of it. Those of us who are benefiting materially from
<br>
high-tech right now through our jobs or investments could become targets.
<br>
<p>We can't (or shouldn't) try to tell them &quot;Just hold on, in a few more years
<br>
we'll make everyone rich through super-high-tech.&quot; They'd laugh in our
<br>
faces. And rightly so. Try telling an unemployed, 50-year-old engineer whose
<br>
job has been sent to India that it's OK that he lost his house because he
<br>
couldn't make the mortgage; and it's OK that his pension has gone away, too;
<br>
just hang on and it will all be right in, oh, maybe 10 or 20 years.&quot;
<br>
<p>But don't stand too close when you say this because he's liable to punch you
<br>
right in the nose.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Friendliness&quot; we want to see in the SI must begin even sooner with us.
<br>
If we can't help people to get through the tough  times right now, those
<br>
same people may prevent us all from seeing an FAI arise at all.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra
