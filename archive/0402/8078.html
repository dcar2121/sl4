<em>&gt; In any event, I don't regard non observer based

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you strip out all observer centered goals, you're

</em><br>
<em>&gt; converge on this, and all individual uniqueness would
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; uniformity.  An empty husk.  Universal morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably just a very general set of contrainsts, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI's following this alone would be qute unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish between the myraid of interesting personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals that are consistent with it.  Everything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't hurt others (assuming that Universal Morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is volition based) whould be equally 'Good' to such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI.  There would be no possibility of anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquinely human or personal.  For instance the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes 'Rafal kills himself', 'Rafal doesn't kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humself' would be designated as morally equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under Volitional Morality.
</em><br>
<p>### I don't understand the first part of your paragraph. As to your claim
<br>
about what would and would not be equivalent under volitional morality, I
<br>
have to disagree. Since I am opposed to killing myself, all other being
<br>
equal, one of the outcomes is regarded as inferior in any moral system
<br>
striving to fulfill the wishes of sentients, including mine.
