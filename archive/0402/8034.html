<p><p>Yes, I have little doubt that an AGI will eventually exist and that it will
<br>
be capable of experiencing more than we ordinary humans can. Since, as we
<br>
all agree, the AGI will be capable of sensing, evaluating and integrating
<br>
experiential data into knowledge structures that are larger than any a human
<br>
brain could hold--and will do it all much faster--there is every reason to
<br>
believe that the AGI's larger experiences will become qualitatively
<br>
different from any we can imagine.
<br>
<p>The point where I differ with you, Ben, is in the distinction I would like
<br>
to make between experience and cognition with respect to &quot;the great truths
<br>
of spirituality.&quot; What we experience is not the same as what we know, or
<br>
cognize, in the sense of having deep understanding of it. We might call this
<br>
&quot;recognition&quot; because it is a &quot;knowing again&quot; in some way that is deeper
<br>
than an immediate impression.
<br>
<p>In meditation and in altered states of consciousness we may experience
<br>
aspects of our minds (and bodies and environments) that we had not seen
<br>
before (or were not consciously aware of). But having these experiences is
<br>
not the same as understanding how they fit into the larger picture of
<br>
existence.
<br>
<p>For example, someone might take up meditation and eventually have some
<br>
so-called &quot;spiritual&quot; experience in which the person seems to leave the
<br>
body, or see lights, hear sounds, detect smells, that all seem like
<br>
something from another realm. The person then might decide to meditate even
<br>
more in order to have these experiences again and again.
<br>
<p>Some people call this spiritual advancement. In Zen, we call it delusion.
<br>
<p>My point is that deep understanding has nothing to do with experience per
<br>
se, whether of the ordinary take-out-the-garbage type or the extremely
<br>
subjective &quot;I've-left-my-body&quot; type. Understanding (which is a better
<br>
translation of the Buddhist term that, unfortunately, is usually translated
<br>
as &quot;Enlightenment&quot;) means knowing things as they truly are. In truth,
<br>
experience high or low is just experience. But seeing it all as **just
<br>
that** is understanding, or if you will, wisdom.
<br>
<p>One doesn't need a human brain to realize this wisdom-understanding. An AGI
<br>
could certainly understand it, too. But in neither case is such an
<br>
understanding automatic. The wise have had teachers.
