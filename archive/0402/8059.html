<br>
<p>BOOK DESCRIPTION:
<br>
The graduates of any Evolution 1 - 01 course are likely to parrot
<br>
with unblinking certainty that evolution has no overall direction and
<br>
is not headed anywhere.  But they are wrong.  Evolution's Arrow
<br>
demonstrates that evolution is directional and progressive, and that
<br>
this has major consequences for humanity.  Without resort to
<br>
teleology, the book shows that evolution moves in the direction of
<br>
producing cooperative organisations of greater scale and
<br>
evolvability - evolution has organised molecular processes into
<br>
cells, cells into organisms, and organisms into societies.
<br>
The book founds this position on a new theory of the evolution of
<br>
cooperation.  It shows that self-interest at the level of genes does
<br>
not prevent cooperation from increasing as evolution unfolds.
<br>
Evolution progresses by discovering ways to build cooperative
<br>
organisations out of self-interested individuals.
<br>
<p>Evolution's Arrow argues that `management' and
<br>
`governance' are keys to explaining the evolution of
<br>
cooperation. The book shows how management can organise cooperative
<br>
organisations of self-interested components.  Management can be
<br>
external (eg. proteins managed by RNA, and human societies managed by
<br>
rulers or government) or can be internal and distributed (eg. insect
<br>
societies managed by genes reproduced in each individual insect,
<br>
multicellular organisms managed by genes reproduced in each cell,
<br>
human tribes managed by inculcated beliefs reproduced in each tribal
<br>
member).
<br>
<p>The book also argues that evolution itself has evolved.  Evolution
<br>
has progressively improved the ability of evolutionary mechanisms to
<br>
discover effective adaptations.  And it has discovered new and better
<br>
mechanisms.  The book looks at the evolution of pre-genetic, genetic,
<br>
cultural, and supra-individual evolutionary mechanisms.  And it shows
<br>
that the genetic mechanism is not entirely blind and random.
<br>
<p>Evolution's Arrow uses this understanding of the direction of
<br>
evolution to identify the next great steps in the evolution of life
<br>
on earth - the steps that humanity must take if we are to continue to
<br>
be successful in evolutionary terms.  A key step for humanity is to
<br>
increase the scale and evolvability of its societies, eventually
<br>
forming a unified and cooperative society on the scale of the
<br>
planet.  Another step is for humans to transform themselves
<br>
psychologically to become self-evolving organisms - organisms that
<br>
are able to escape their biological and cultural past by adapting in
<br>
whatever directions are necessary to achieve future evolutionary
<br>
success.

<p>REVIEW
<br>
Francis Heylighen's article in Complexity (&quot;Evolutionary
<br>
transitions: how do levels of complexity emerge?&quot;, Complexity
<br>
6(1), 53-57) favourably reviews Evolution's Arrow along with five
<br>
other books concerned with the evolution of new levels of
<br>
complexity.  The review identifies how the theory of the evolution of
<br>
cooperation developed in Evolution's Arrow goes beyond the approach
<br>
taken by Maynard Smith and Szathmary in their work on the major
<br>
evolutionary transitions.  A copy of the article is at:
