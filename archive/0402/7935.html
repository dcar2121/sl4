Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As one of the chief early offenders in the &quot;Well, past physics got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revised, so why not current physics?&quot; debate, I'd like to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics got a *lot* more impressive once I knew a little more about it.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; The limits imposed by our models, and sometimes our hypotheses, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, arise from exactly those features of the model that seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shout:  &quot;Here is something truly fundamental about reality!&quot;  Back in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days when we were tossing theories out the window every half-decade, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories we got rid of didn't have that &quot;Here is something absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental!&quot; look about them.  That, in particular, I didn't understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I made the historical comparison.  History doesn't always repeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.  Today's physics might be here to stay; or, when it settles down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the fundamental limits might still be there.  At any rate I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bet that no one can distinguish two electrons - EVER.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, it is clearly the case that 150 years ago when people thought
<br>
Newtonian physics was here to stay, they DID feel Newtonian physics had that
<br>
&quot;Here is something absolutely fundamental!&quot; look about it.  From the modern
<br>
perspective it doesn't look that way anymore, but very clearly, that's what
<br>
nearly every scientist thought at that time...
<br>
<p>As for distinguishing two electrons -- that is really beside the point.  In
<br>
future physics theories, &quot;electron&quot; might not even be considered a
<br>
fundamental or profoundly interesting concept to think about.
<br>
<p>Each scientific research programme has its own vocabulary and own tools, its
<br>
own notions of what is possible and impossible.  Personally I'm pretty
<br>
confident that when we hook up an AGI to quantum-domain sensors and
<br>
actuators and let it play, it's going to develop new theories and new ideas
<br>
and it's going to laugh a rich digital laugh at our awkward attempts to
<br>
understand that domain with concepts like &quot;electron&quot; and &quot;field.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong and you could be right -- I don't know any
<br>
convincing rational way to decide this argument.  Time will tell, blablabla.
<br>
<p>However, I do think you need to reconsider whether a set of theories that is
<br>
MUTUALLY LOGICALLY INCONSISTENT (i.e. the Standard Model is logically
<br>
irreconcilable with general relativity, except in some very special cases)
<br>
really has a &quot;Here is something absolutely fundamental!&quot; look about it.  To
<br>
me, this logical inconsistency is a clue that something significant is
<br>
missing from the modern-physics picture...
<br>
