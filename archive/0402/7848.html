<p>I suppose it's time for me to weigh in on the &quot;positive qualia&quot; concept.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that experiencing a good feeling is just nature's way of
<br>
providing feedback for an evolved state that has improved ancestral fitness.
<br>
For any particular instance, it may actually be productive or
<br>
counter-productive, despite how good it feels.   If we try to base an
<br>
ethical theory on having &quot;positive qualia&quot; we immediately run into trouble
<br>
because we will soon have the technical capability to directly create any
<br>
level of bliss we might choose, completely bypassing any external feedback
<br>
loop, and it is therefore of no substantial value to the system.  In my
<br>
opinion this is one of those subtle and perennial topics that is based on
<br>
being a little too locked into the Cartesian viewpoint.
<br>
<p>Given that kind of technology, my near-term choice would be to eliminate the
<br>
kinds of feelings that impair performance, and utilize a gradient of
<br>
&quot;positive feelings&quot; as motivators.
<br>
<p>While qualia are certainly an important part of the subjective context of
<br>
today's more evolved biological organisms, I don't think qualia played any
<br>
role in primitive organisms, unless one distorts the meaning of &quot;qualia&quot; in
<br>
a kind of philosophically panpsychic way that would violate the intuitive
<br>
way people mean it &quot;because they know their own qualia better than they know
<br>
anything else&quot;.  Looking ahead to more advanced organisms, I think it will
<br>
be considered an out-moded concept, although perhaps optional.  It's just a
<br>
good trick that works at this phase of evolution.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, Qualia is one of those subtle concepts that evaporates (mu)
<br>
when viewed in a larger context, and is not needed as a fundamental
<br>
principle of this broad ethical system but it does play a role at the useful
<br>
context level of dealing with humans and other animals that have subjective
<br>
experience.
