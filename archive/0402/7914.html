</em><br>
<p>I think I'll jump in here for a moment.
<br>
<p>Systems of thought are consistent only within a given context.  No system of
<br>
thought can be said to be absolutely consistent (Godel, Hume,...) but we
<br>
observe with nested levels of context that overall consistency increases
<br>
with increasing scope.  A god's-eye view (encompassing time and space) would
<br>
be the most consistent but can only be approached, never achieved even in
<br>
theory.  As life becomes increasingly more complex, more capable, and more
<br>
aware, I think life becomes more consistent in its actions.  In my opinion,
<br>
there's no avoiding this kind of &quot;progress&quot;.
<br>
<p>That being said, future states of any significant complexity can not be
<br>
predicted, but can be influenced (at least from our point of view) by our
<br>
choices and actions.  In other words, in any practical sense, we create our
<br>
future out of the randomness that is always present at the edges of the
<br>
system that comprises Self as it interacts with the unknown Other.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that a workable meta-ethics could be based on an
<br>
understanding of the dynamics of complex systems as they apply to phenomena
<br>
at the atomic, molecular, cellular, organism, social, global, ...) level,
<br>
combined with our present set of evolved human values, with the goal of
<br>
maximizing consistency as we continue to grow.
<br>
<p>Before you think the foregoing is hopelessly circular, remember I'm talking
<br>
about *nested* levels of context, with the goal of increasing consistency.
<br>
It's not circular.  It's recursive, with the end never quite in sight, and
<br>
that is a concept still unfamiliar and uncomfortable to many humans, but
<br>
it's the way nature works.  Ultimately, I think it's unavoidable.  So the
<br>
better we understand and act in harmony with this process, the less pain
<br>
(more joy) we will experience, and that is the essence of our current
<br>
popular understanding of goodness or morality.
