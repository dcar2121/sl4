</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At first it seems a pure triviality, but then you realize what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preconditions are, in order for the statement to be meaningful.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;be accepted&quot; to be meaningful, one needs to assume there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind or community of minds that has the intelligence and the freedom

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Ensure that one or more minds with some form of volition exist, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then formulate rules that these minds will 'freely' choose to accept&quot;
</em><br>
<p>### You are close to getting to the bottom of the issue here, but let me try
<br>
to reformulate the initial meta-ethical statement. As you point out, this
<br>
statement is actually applicable only to ethical systems professed by
<br>
creatures interested in survival - but creatures which don't care about
<br>
their own lives can have ethical systems, too. Let me then make a hopefully
<br>
more general meta-ethical statement - &quot;Formulate rules that make themselves
<br>
into accepted rules, or, make themselves come true&quot; (cause the existence of
<br>
states of the universe, including conscious states, in agreement with goals
<br>
stated in the rules). Or &quot;Formulate rules which, if applied, will as their
<br>
outcomes have the goals explicitly understood to be inherent in these
<br>
rules&quot;. Or &quot;Do not formulate rules which have outcomes *opposite* to
<br>
intended&quot;. If the goal of the rule is to have a &quot;good&quot; outcome, where
<br>
goodness is defined within the rule itself, then only rules which have good
<br>
outcomes are good rules, and ethical systems which have good outcomes are
<br>
worth considering. Ethical systems which by their very structure have
<br>
results opposite to or uncorrelated with goals of these systems would appear
<br>
to be inferior to those which produce intended outcomes, because the very
<br>
essence of ethics is to define desired outcomes, no matter what they
<br>
actually are. I think that this is the basic meta-ethical statement we can
<br>
make, essentially demanding rationality in ethics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the demand for rationality in ethics one can derive further
</em><br>
meta-ethical statements. Need for computability - a system which does not
<br>
provide rules sufficient to compute desirability of concrete actions open to
<br>
decision-makers (such as the system consisting of the sole statement &quot;Be
<br>
good&quot;), is useless, uncorrelated with outcomes. Internal consistency - the
<br>
system should not make contradictory recommendations for a single situation.
<br>
Wide applicability - a system that guides only in a few situations is less
<br>
useful (less correlated with outcomes) than a system applying everywhere.
<br>
Stability under changes of input - systems which totally change
<br>
recommendations after minor changes in inputs are likely to be affected by
<br>
random misinformation and therefore uncorrelated with outcomes. I think
<br>
similar points were made in this thread, sorry for repetition.
<br>
<p>All these considerations seem at first approximation to be independent of
<br>
the content of ethical systems, but depend on epistemological features of
<br>
existing minds - which in turn *are* linked to ethics via the shared
<br>
physical environment which caused both our desires and our truth-finding
<br>
faculties to develop. This represents a bit of circularity between ethics,
<br>
and epistemology, but I don't think that such circularity would invalidate
<br>
the meta-ethical statements - it merely makes them contingent on the current
<br>
state of our (physical) truth-finding capabilities - but, everything we say
<br>
shares this feature.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we define happiness_* (one variant of the vague notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;happiness&quot;) as &quot;the state of mind a volitional agent assumes when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's obtained what it wants&quot;, then your rule is really equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Ensure that one or more minds with some form of volition exist, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then formulate rules that these minds will 'freely' choose to accept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they assess that accepting these rules will bring them an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable level of happiness_*&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point in tautologously unfolding your rule in this way, is to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that (as you obviously realize) it contains more than it might at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first appear to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the shortcoming it has, is that it doesn't protect against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds being stupid and self-delusional.  Volitional agents may accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something even if it's bad for them in many senses.  (This is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness_* is not the only meaningful sense of happiness).
</em><br>
<p>### Well, as I mentioned above I wanted to say something even less dependent
<br>
on our current structure of volition, which for most humans contains a
<br>
desire to exist. I hope that the reworked statement is more general, and
<br>
then it wouldn't entail the need for continued existence of minds espousing
<br>
a given ethics, much less the specific content of joyousness or growth. I
<br>
understand that this makes it even less intuitively compelling that my
<br>
initial statement, but it is more meta-ethical.
