<p>
Ben,
<br>
<p>Which list do you want Encouraging a Positive Transcension discussed 
<br>
on? AGI or SL4? It could get cumbersome having effectively the same 
<br>
discussion on both lists.  
<br>
<p>Thanks for the paper. it was stimulating read.  
<br>
<p>I have a few quibbles.   
<br>
<p>You discuss the value of aligning with universal tendencies.  How can 
<br>
you know what's really universal since were in a pretty small patch of 
<br>
the universe at a pretty circumscribed moment in time?  If we 
<br>
happened to be in a universe that oscillated between big bangs what 
<br>
looked universal might be rather different in the expanding universe 
<br>
phase and in the contracting universe phase.   
<br>
<p>Also socially certain things look universal until some new possibilities 
<br>
pop up.  If judged at an early stage of the said popping, then new thing 
<br>
might look like a quaint Quixotic endeavour.  It only after the quaint 
<br>
quixotic idea becomes widespread that its inherent universalism 
<br>
becomes clear.  
<br>
<p>On the subject of growth - do you really want to foster growth per se 
<br>
(quantitative moreness?) or development (qualitative improvement?)??  
<br>
<p>I’ve got a feeling that promoting growth or even development is not a 
<br>
rounded enough goal.  I think there’s something powerful in the idea of 
<br>
promoting (using my pet terminology) ‘genuine progress’ AND 
<br>
‘sustainability.  So at all times philosophising entities are considering 
<br>
what they want to change for the better for the first time and they are 
<br>
also thinking about what should be maintained from the past/present 
<br>
and carried through into the future.  So both continuity and change are 
<br>
important paired notions.  
<br>
<p>Your principle that &quot;the more abstract the principle, the more likely it is 
<br>
to survive successive self-modification&quot; seems to make intuitive sense 
<br>
to me.  
<br>
<p>You said: “that in order to make a Megalomaniac AI, one would 
<br>
probably need to explicitly program an AI with a lust for power.”  
<br>
Wouldn’t it be rather easy to catch the lust for power bug from the 
<br>
humans that raise an AGI - or even from our literature?  I think there’s 
<br>
a high chance that at least a few baby AGIs will be brought up by 
<br>
megalomaniacs.  And one super-powerful megalomaniac AGI is 
<br>
probably more than we want and more than we can easily deal with.  
<br>
<p>If humans are allowed to stay in their present form if they wish and if 
<br>
some humans as they are now might go dangerously berserk with 
<br>
advanced technology and we go down the AI Buddha path then the 
<br>
logic developed in your paper seems to suggest that AI Buddhas will 
<br>
have to also take on a Big Brother role as well as whatever else they 
<br>
might do.  
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
