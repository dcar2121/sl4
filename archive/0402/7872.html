<p>&nbsp;One distinction that seems to be missing in our recent discussions of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't eat the yellow snow, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- ethical systems (an ethical system contains a set of specific

</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules to deal with new situations)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- abstract principles specifying what's desirable in the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is somewhat similar to the distinction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- specific scientific theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- scientific research programmes (Lakatos) or paradigms (Kuhn)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- abstract principles specifying what's the overall goal of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as opposed to, say, witchcraft, juggling, prostitution or music
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An example of an abstract principle specifying the overall goal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science is Popper's dictum: &quot;Create conjectures that have greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirical support than their predecessors.&quot;  Note that this is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informal statement, and it may be formalized and interpreted in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different ways.  But nevertheless, essentially everyone involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scientific enterprise will agree with this abstract principle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if they adhere to different research programmes or interpret the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms slightly differently.
</em><br>
<p>### These two quotes from separate posts jibe with what I think about the
<br>
initial problem you posited, the description of methods for evaluation of
<br>
ethical systems in the abstract, a metaethics. Metaethics would have to be
<br>
independent of the qualia of desire and the application of these qualia to
<br>
evaluation of outcomes - otherwise it would be identical to ethics itself.
<br>
<p>Yet, most of the discussion so far focused on what we (or imaginary beings
<br>
such as the Buddha AI or Friendly AI) might think about particular systems,
<br>
seen as tools for achieving goals that suit our fancy, such as joyous
<br>
growth, enlightenment, the intellectual pleasure associated with absence of
<br>
contradictions in thinking (consistency), etc - in fact, confining itself to
<br>
observer-dependent ethics.
<br>
<p>But, if not for desire, how can value (in the eVALUation) be formed?
<br>
<p>Let me first observe that as you write above, a meta-statement can be made
<br>
about the overall goal of science - although instead of Popper's injunction
<br>
I would say &quot;Create conjectures that come true&quot;. In view of this
<br>
metascientific statement, a good research programme is one that generates
<br>
multiple conjectures in various areas, which tend to come true, with minimum
<br>
amount of computation (so as to avoid crowding out of parsimonious but
<br>
fertile ideas by computationally intensive and relatively barren ones).
<br>
Farther down the line, application of such research programmes leads me for
<br>
example to accept the mitochondrial theory of PD causation, rather than
<br>
other theories.
<br>
<p>Second observation is that one might also say that demanding &quot;Conjectures
<br>
that come true&quot; leads automatically to principles that are embodied in the
<br>
universe itself, and independent of the desires of the observer regarding
<br>
particular outcomes.
<br>
<p>How can we use the above observations for deriving a metaethics by analogy
<br>
to metascience, without direct recourse to desires and ethics itself?
<br>
<p>I think we could begin by making the metaethical statement &quot;Formulate rules
<br>
which will be accepted&quot; (although this statement is actually a high-level
<br>
link in a very long-term recursive mental process, rather than a starting
<br>
logical premise). Just as science is a way of finding what will be,
<br>
metaethics is then a way of predicting what the *should* will be (i.e. what
<br>
will be perceived as right in the future or by some sentients). Note the
<br>
association of a verb anchored in time, &quot;predict&quot;, which is science-related
<br>
and non-emotional and the somewhat atemporal &quot;should&quot;, which is emotional
<br>
and ethics-related. A metaethics is then &quot;predictive ethics&quot;, a form of
<br>
thinking independent of desire, like science, but taking the future of
<br>
desire, the essence of ethics, as its subject.
<br>
<p>If the rules (&quot;specific ethical applications&quot;) derived from an ethical
<br>
system (an &quot;ethical programme&quot;) find wide and stable acceptance, then by
<br>
predictive ethics this programme is better than a programme whose rules are
<br>
rejected - and such rejection may among others take the form of the physical
<br>
disappearance of those who follow such rules. In this way, &quot;the universe
<br>
itself&quot;, by evolving or removing structures (individuals, societies) capable
<br>
of accepting some rules but not others, is the ultimate source of the good
<br>
(=predicted) ethical system, while removing the bad (=unacceptable) ones, in
<br>
a way acting in an observer-independent way.
<br>
<p>This may sound like fatalist &quot;what will be, will be&quot; musings, or perhaps a
<br>
strange tautology, not ethics - but then, we don't want to come up with yet
<br>
another ethical system, but a metaethics. For me, predictive ethics is not a
<br>
sterile exercise in sophistry, after all, because it is predictive ethics
<br>
(as processed in my admittedly limited frontopolar cortex) that prompts me
<br>
to accept volitionism, the idea (=ethical research programme) that the best
<br>
ethical rules can be derived by careful analysis of sentient volition and
<br>
its interactions with the physical world, and it is in part because of
<br>
predictive ethics that I reject the concept of &quot;objective ethics&quot;. It allows
<br>
you to reject pleasant ideas which cannot come true (like building a
<br>
chemical rocket flying faster than light, or universal, feedback-free giving
<br>
of unlimited resources to all who ask), and instead concentrate on at least
<br>
theoretically viable options, like  laser-propulsion von Neumann probes, or
<br>
anarchocapitalism.
<br>
<p>Of course, YMMV.
