</em><br>
<p>There's a difficulty in that we don't currently have good terminology to
<br>
discuss some of these issues without introducing unintended meanings and
<br>
connotations.  We also don't yet have the mathematics to properly model
<br>
non-linear dynamics as we'd like to.
<br>
<p>As I said in my earlier post on this subject, Self is not what many people
<br>
think it is.  A more useful understanding  crosses borders that many feel
<br>
are inviolable, little realizing that they would not be alive if they were
<br>
so alone as they imagine.  Systems theory, Category theory, and various
<br>
areas of epistemology try to deal in a practical way with the understanding
<br>
that it's ultimately one interconnected process, which can be sliced and
<br>
diced to provide various useful views.
<br>
<p>All our observations tell us that &quot;life&quot; is about growth.  While we perceive
<br>
that individual structures/organisms/persons &quot;die&quot;, we see that there is a
<br>
connected thread of information that continues, and proceeds to grow
<br>
further. This thread (which is not linear as the metaphor implies) appears
<br>
to reach as far back as we can see or imagine. We are enmeshed and part of
<br>
this process, although many don't see it.  All &quot;living&quot; subsystems dissipate
<br>
energy from the world around them to increase local complexity. And the more
<br>
complex they become, the better they become at doing this. We are all part
<br>
of this process on many simultaneous levels.
<br>
<p>So what I am saying is whether you like it or not, your existence is about
<br>
growth.  But you're not alone, and it is apparent that your growth is
<br>
interconnected with the growth of others.  In fact your interaction with
<br>
others constitutes a larger system which follows the same rules of growth.
<br>
So the same  &quot;expansion of Self&quot; that doesn't feel right to you (because it
<br>
feels selfish?) actually implies and promotes the growth and cooperation of
<br>
others.  I think this point is similar to Randian morality except they hit a
<br>
wall because they're not thinking in a broad enough context.
<br>
<p>I'm saying that if we're looking for some guidance -- an ethical system that
<br>
is consistent across all levels of organization -- we might look to the way
<br>
nature operates at a most fundamental level and align ourselve with it.
<br>
This is like being aware enough to come in out of the rain, but more subtle.
<br>
<p>I suspect that a lot of this appears to verge on the mystical at this time,
<br>
and perhaps should be reserved for SL5.  Ben, if you'd like to discuss this
<br>
further, please contact me offlist and I'll be happy to carry on the
<br>
discussion.
