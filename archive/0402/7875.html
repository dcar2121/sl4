<p>
It occurs to me that the meta-goal of science,
<br>
<p>&quot;Create conjectures with more empirical support than their predecessors&quot;
<br>
<p>also has some hidden relativism in it, in the sense that what it really
<br>
means is
<br>
<p>&quot;Create conjectures that have more empirical support than their
<br>
predecessors, as judged by some community C&quot;
<br>
<p>Godel's theorem (properly deployed) shows that for any community C (with
<br>
finite total compute power) there are some conjectures whose degree of
<br>
empirical support can't be estimated by community C.
<br>
<p>Now, we could say
<br>
<p>&quot;Create conjectures that have more empirical support than their
<br>
predecessors, as judged by a maximally intelligent, rational, self-aware
<br>
mind&quot;
<br>
<p>(and we could try to formalize this appropriately)
<br>
<p>but this isn't useful as we don't have this uber-mind at hand.
<br>
<p>Or we could say
<br>
<p>&quot;Create conjectures that have more empirical support than their
<br>
predecessors, and create a community of empirical-support-judgers whose
<br>
intelligence, rationality and self-awareness is progressively increasing&quot;
<br>
<p>This is analogous to the meta-ethic
<br>
<p>&quot;Iteratively create rule-sets that will be accepted, by a community of minds
<br>
that are increasingly intelligent, rational and self-aware&quot;

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### These two quotes from separate posts jibe with what I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial problem you posited, the description of methods for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethical systems in the abstract, a metaethics. Metaethics would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; independent of the qualia of desire and the application of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these qualia to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evaluation of outcomes - otherwise it would be identical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you have expressed very well what I would like to see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;metaethics&quot; be...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet, most of the discussion so far focused on what we (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imaginary beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such as the Buddha AI or Friendly AI) might think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen as tools for achieving goals that suit our fancy, such as joyous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; growth, enlightenment, the intellectual pleasure associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contradictions in thinking (consistency), etc - in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; confining itself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observer-dependent ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree -- rather than a true meta-ethics, something like &quot;joyous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth&quot; is in fact a *maximally abstracted ethical principle*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As compared to particular ethical rules like &quot;don't kill people&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is moving in the direction of a meta-ethic, but it's still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a meta-ethic...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me first observe that as you write above, a meta-statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the overall goal of science - although instead of Popper's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; injunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would say &quot;Create conjectures that come true&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, Popper intentionally avoided this phrasing to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quibbles about the philosophy of &quot;truth&quot;... your phrasing is fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with me though...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How can we use the above observations for deriving a metaethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to metascience, without direct recourse to desires and ethics itself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think we could begin by making the metaethical statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Formulate rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which will be accepted&quot; (although this statement is actually a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; link in a very long-term recursive mental process, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logical premise).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's interesting.  It's a little deeper than it seems at first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I need to think about it more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At first it seems a pure triviality, but then you realize what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the preconditions are, in order for the statement to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful.  For &quot;be accepted&quot; to be meaningful, one needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume there is some mind or community of minds that has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence and the freedom to accept or to not accept.  So one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is implicitly assuming the existence of mind and freedom.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your rule is really equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Ensure that one or more minds with some form of volition exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then formulate rules that these minds will 'freely' choose to accept&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we define happiness_* (one variant of the vague notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;happiness&quot;) as &quot;the state of mind a volitional agent assumes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it's obtained what it wants&quot;, then your rule is really equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Ensure that one or more minds with some form of volition exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then formulate rules that these minds will 'freely' choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept, because they assess that accepting these rules will bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them an acceptable level of happiness_*&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point in tautologously unfolding your rule in this way, is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show that (as you obviously realize) it contains more than it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might at first appear to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the shortcoming it has, is that it doesn't protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against minds being stupid and self-delusional.  Volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents may accept something even if it's bad for them in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senses.  (This is because happiness_* is not the only meaningful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of happiness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that &quot;to accept&quot; is a vague and somewhat screwy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion, particularly when you're dealing with  minds that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid and self-conflicted (like most human minds).  Just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a human says &quot;I accept X&quot; doesn't mean that all parts of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept X -- it just means that the subsystems that's grabbed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of the mouth says &quot;I accept X.&quot;  It also doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they really understand what X means -- they may accept X out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some dumb misunderstanding of what the consequences of X will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Acceptance becomes more and more meaningful, the smarter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more self-aware the acceptor becomes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this is where &quot;growth&quot; seems to play a role, if you interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;growth&quot; as meaning &quot;minds becoming less stupid and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-delusional over time.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I want to say something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Iteratively create rule-sets that will be accepted, by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community of minds that are increasingly intelligent and self-aware&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, you could argue that this veers further away from being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pure meta-ethic.  Or, you could argue that &quot;accepting a rule&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means more for a mind that is more intelligent and self-aware, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it actually makes your meta-ethic more powerful and meaningful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But of course my modified version is basically a variant of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principle of Joyous Growth -- since I have growth in there in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of &quot;increasing intelligence and self-awareness&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;joyousness&quot; in the form of happiness_*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
