Hello,
<br>
<p>My name is James MacAulay. I live in Ottawa, Canada, and I was first 
<br>
introduced to the Singularity a few years ago by Eliezer's FAQ About the 
<br>
Meaning of Life, after trying to amuse myself by asking &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot; what 
<br>
the meaning of life was. That night I ended up finding as much as I could on 
<br>
the Singularity, which made me have the biggest bout of future shock of my 
<br>
life. I actually cried because it scared me so much, actually. Heh. Suffice 
<br>
to say it didn't take me long to take a different view of things, and to 
<br>
grow to be comfortable with and even excited about these new possibilities 
<br>
(more excited than comfortable, I guess).
<br>
<p>After high school I spent a couple years pursuing animation, but I recently 
<br>
decided that it wasn't really what I wanted to do for a career and now I've 
<br>
applied to a CogSci program, which was the other path I considered as I was 
<br>
wrapping up my high school years. My biggest interest in the field these 
<br>
days is probably memetics. I also found the recent SL4 post about the 
<br>
creativity machine really interesting.
<br>
<p>You most likely won't hear from me much for a while; I'll just be another 
<br>
lurker until I at least finish skimming through the archives, and even then 
<br>
I'll probably be fairly quiet, until I feel like I know what I'm talking 
<br>
about more.
<br>
<p>Anyway, blah blah blah and all that. Thanks for providing me with all this 
<br>
great food for thought, all of you. Oh, and sorry if this hotmail account 
<br>
ever causes problems. I think I managed to get it to send in plain text 
<br>
only, though.
<br>
<p>James
