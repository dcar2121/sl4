Q1: Is this really creativity at work?
<br>
Q2: Is the machine really inventing?
<br>
<p>I saw this the other day too and it all depends on one's definition of
<br>
creativity and inventing - If you measure it by evidence then of course
<br>
its doing both but it cannot vouch for that fact itself - like I would
<br>
if I were being creative or inventing. The trouble with making something
<br>
that mimics one cabability of the human mind is that there's not any way
<br>
of knowing if its really going on or not - but what is real creativity
<br>
or real inventiveness? These are just concepts defined by us after we've
<br>
done the things we're defining so I suppose we can think whatever we
<br>
like - the question of whether anything REALLY is or not is always going
<br>
to be a matter of opinion. It's like Searle's Chinese room argument from
<br>
back in the 80's which didn't have a leg to stand on.
