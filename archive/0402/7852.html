</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;A more compact restatement of the above was as follows:
</em><br>
<p>I am in complete agreement with this statement.  For that matter, we are at 
<br>
the very end of Darwinian dynamics applying to *humans.*
<br>
<p>But that wasn't my point (sorry for being unclear).
<br>
<p>Darwinian dynamics operating within the constraints of the physical 
<br>
universe generated creatures with a sense of ethics as a 
<br>
solution.  (Solution to what?  To a world with others in it.)  Self 
<br>
modifying superintelligence operating in the same universe with the same 
<br>
constraints and needing rules about how to deal with others might come to 
<br>
similar ethical rules, only one heck of a lot faster.
<br>
<p>There are maybe a dozen conditions I am assuming here.  Let's see if I can 
<br>
name some of them and if the other readers can fill in what I miss.
<br>
<p>1) There are a lot of individual superintelligences.
<br>
<p>I have no idea of what scale is involved, the material around a star could 
<br>
be one SI, but I would think light speed is going to make syncing up a 
<br>
brain with that much material tough. (Unless we can make wormholes or have 
<br>
some other form of FTL--if we can, the whole universe might become one 
<br>
brain.  In that case, I am not entirely sure ethics is the right word to use.)
<br>
<p>2)  There is at least mild competition for energy and materials, but matter 
<br>
and energy far from a SI's core is worth much less than near matter and 
<br>
energy.  Enough less that it is not worth trying to take it from another.
<br>
<p>If superintelligences figure out how to bud off and move into entire new 
<br>
universes this constraint goes away.
<br>
<p>3)  There are advantages to being social.
<br>
<p>Being social ourselves, it is hard to imagine non-social 
<br>
intelligences.  Perhaps that's because our main use for intelligence is to 
<br>
impress our peers and in doing so attempt to gain status.  I have no idea 
<br>
of what a non-social SI would be like or how it would
<br>
interact (if at all).
<br>
<p>These three might be enough for non-zero sum elements to come into play and 
<br>
something possibly similar to human ethics to emerge.  But I am far from 
<br>
sure about this.
