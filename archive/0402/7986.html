Hi Ben,  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More concrete suggestions would be appreciated! 
</em><br>
<p>Well, here are a few immediate thoughts off the top of my head. ..... 
<br>
how about finding the most democractic country in the world (pick you 
<br>
favourite - but my guess is that it would be in Scandinavia or 
<br>
somewhere thereabouts) and run a big discussion about the new 
<br>
'technology'/(life) there - you'd get the best chance of an informed and 
<br>
intelligent conversation - then the ideas and the measured response 
<br>
might spill over into other countries.  You could also trial the public 
<br>
policy response there - cautious but not fundamentally inhibitory 
<br>
(except in relation to really nasty outcomes which is what you'd want 
<br>
anyway).  This public policy response could then become the model for 
<br>
elsewhere or at least a key benchmark.  
<br>
<p>If, by the time you want to open this up for wide discussion / decision, 
<br>
the proto-AGI technology has made you stinking rich you might want to 
<br>
do a George Soros and put a lot of money into (.....not ramming 
<br>
through a decision or buying support) but into helping people who are 
<br>
interested to engage in a measured well-informed debate and process 
<br>
of consensus formation.  If you are not stinking rich by then it might be 
<br>
useful to enlist some people who are!  
<br>
<p>I think the 'pact with humanity' idea is a key part of calming people as is 
<br>
designing/training in friendliness.  I think committing AGI resources to 
<br>
helping people solve their major problems (racism, oppression, poverty, 
<br>
environmental degradation, climate flips, food security, terrorism, etc.) 
<br>
would be a good way to win friends and influence people - and to create 
<br>
the psychology of partnership with AGIs.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sounds like an excellent idea....  I assume you're volunteering to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiate this effort ;-)) 
</em><br>
<p>90% of what I do now is pro bono - which is, to say the least, not very 
<br>
good for the bank balance.  If some philanthopist could cover a salary 
<br>
I'd be delighted to facilitate a discussion / consensus building process  
<br>
:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having a broad diversity of perspectives represented would be a really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting thing
</em><br>
<p>I think that would be a very good thing to do.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
