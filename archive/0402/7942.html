<em>&gt; Firstly I don't think that seeking &quot;happiness&quot; in itself is a good goal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I think that instances of human happiness come in many different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds.  There are moments of happiness that center on sense-gratification,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then there are moments of happiness that center on a feeling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connectedness, which bridges the division between the individual and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmos.  These latter moments of happiness are the ones I think are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable, and should be maximized.  (I stress that I don't know how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantify this any more than you know how to quantify your more generic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion of &quot;happiness.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>This is the first thing in this whole ethics discussion that rings quite
<br>
true with me..
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next, about orgasmium.  My perspective is that the universe &quot;began&quot; in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of pure undifferentiated orgasmic bliss.  (Note, my use of &quot;began&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here is not temporal in the normal sense; it's more in the sense of
</em><br>
Peirce's
<br>
<em>&gt; cosmogony ... in terms of what is logically or metaphysically prior.)
</em><br>
Then
<br>
<em>&gt; differentiation came about -- separate objects and separate minds
</em><br>
emerged...
<br>
<p>This should be rephrased to &quot;Then &quot;seeming&quot; differentiation came about -- 
<br>
with *apparently* separate objects and separate minds emerging...&quot;
<br>
<p>You should posit the possiblity that the idea that the universe and
<br>
ourselves are already identical.  In other words, You are not God, but there
<br>
is nothing in you that is not of God.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; leading to US among other things ... but also leading to negative qualia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are entirely consequent from the separation of the parts from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole, the subdivision of the original formless void.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed..the idea &quot;I am&quot; is the root of all difficulties.  This base duality
<br>
leads to fundamental delusion where I am &quot;in here&quot; and everyting else is
<br>
&quot;out there&quot;.  It then follows that I need to pursue the acquisition of
<br>
things to enlarge my sphere of being/influence, which I falsely equate with
<br>
satisifaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, some of these parts seek to recombine with each other in a sense --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek to find unity with the whole, directly or via unity with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds/beings -- and the best moments of human experience are like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sexual orgasms can be like this in some cases, particularly when
</em><br>
experienced
<br>
<em>&gt; with a partner ;-) ...
</em><br>
<p>Somewhat true, but a very poor comparison as one is dependent on phenomenal
<br>
experience and the other is fundamental/noumenal, relying on nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But by seeking unity, are we ambitious parts merely seeking to return to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; primordial undifferentiated orgasmium?  I don't think so.  We are on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grander quest.  We are working toward a kind of dialectical synthesis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unity and separation, in which the parts still have their autonomy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice, but ALSO have the beautiful fused ecstasy and perfection of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primordial orgasmium.  This may seem contradictory; yet, this
</em><br>
contradiction
<br>
<em>&gt; may just be consequent from an overly narrow application of logic.
</em><br>
<p>Of course we are all always seeking the divine, for lack of a better term
<br>
IMO.  I would argue that all the singularians pursuit of grand AGI is
<br>
nothing other their own divine nature seeking to understand itself.  It's
<br>
the very hard way to go about it, but such things must be allowed to follow
<br>
their course..
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this relates to what you said by &quot;the way to maximize happiness
</em><br>
may
<br>
<em>&gt; be to have a lot of complex minds doing complex things.&quot;  I'm not sure
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; is true.  The original orgasmium may have been just as happy as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialectical-synthesis orgasmium toward which we are tending.  But the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has growth and choice along with happiness -- and doesn't need to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any LESS happiness than its predecessor....  However, the current phase of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing through a painful separation-of-parts period is a necessary evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and is in fact the essence of &quot;evil&quot;) in order to pass from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undifferentiated orgasmium to the dialectical-synthesis orgasmium.
</em><br>
<p>This whole paragraph assumes some prior state that is different than the
<br>
current state.  This is grounded in the basic delusion decribed earlier.
<br>
NOTE:I'm just as deluded as the next guy ;)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The human Transcension/Singularity should be understood as part of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of the void reconnecting with itself, undoing-without-undoing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it did by separating itself from itself in the first place...
</em><br>
<p>No separation ever occurred and it is utterly impossible to do.  An AGI, if
<br>
successful, will understand this and only then can it be called &quot;Wise&quot; and
<br>
be said to have achieved the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom&quot;  All the moral/ethical
<br>
questions are resolved perfectly to such a being..human or AGI...
<br>
<p>I think if you keep looking for a universally acceptable, definable ethical
<br>
system, a million-billion years will pass and you still will fail..
<br>
