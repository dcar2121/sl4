Perhaps of some salience to the topic, from that fine, clear-eyed writer Ken
<br>
MacLeod, at <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/">http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>Morality has very little to do with choosing sides. It can tell us that a
<br>
given act is dreadful, but it can't tell us whether to say, 'This is
<br>
dreadful, therefore ...' or 'This is dreadful, but ...' We still often
<br>
believe that we oppose our enemies because of their crimes, and support our
<br>
allies despite their crimes. I wouldn't be surprised if Margaret Thatcher
<br>
was quite sincere in condemning ZAPU as a terrorist organization because it
<br>
shot down a civilian airliner, and in supporting one of the mujahedin
<br>
factions, despite the fact that it had deliberately blown up a civilian
<br>
airliner. Sometimes our moral justifications can blunt our moral sense.
<br>
Think of the incendiary bombings of Germany and Japan. Suppose they were a
<br>
military necessity. If so, better to accept that what 'our side' is doing is
<br>
wrong and do it anyway than to persuade ourselves it is right because it is
<br>
in a just cause.
<br>
<p>(The writings of a great amoralist - a de Sade, a Stirner, a Nietzsche - can
<br>
inspire a handful of murders in two centuries. Over the same period, the
<br>
writings of a great moral philosopher - an Aquinas, a Kant, a Bentham, a
<br>
Mill - can justify, if not indeed incite, the deaths of millions in just
<br>
wars and just revolutions. Morality is an immensely dangerous and
<br>
destructive force, which must be restrained by the strongest human passions
<br>
and sympathies if it is not to break all the bonds of society.)
<br>
<p>Morality is real. Morality is ideology. It is the heat given off by the
<br>
workings of quite different machinery. In measuring the heat while ignoring
<br>
the mechanism - in making a moral case for or against a particular war, for
<br>
example - the moral philosopher reasons 'consciously indeed, but with a
<br>
false consciousness'. The screams of those caught in the machinery continue
<br>
unabated. They cry to heaven. It is only in what Locke called the 'appeal to
<br>
heaven' - the clash of arms - that anyone (apart from, of course,
<br>
'pacifists, Quakers and other bourgeois fools' as someone said, who indulge
<br>
in 'pacifist-Quaker-vegetarian prattle about the sanctity of human life', as
<br>
someone else said) sees a hope that some day the machinery can be made to
<br>
stop, and the screams to cease. That hope itself is the machines' fuel.
