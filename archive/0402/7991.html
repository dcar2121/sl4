Hi,
<br>
<p>I lived in Australia for a couple years, as you know....  So far as I know,
<br>
most hallucinogens are illegal in Australia, and it's also illegal to ask
<br>
your neighbor to insert a chip in your brain (unless you both have
<br>
government approval).  Also, I didn't find Australia to be that wonderfully
<br>
egalitarian and humanistic -- the conditions in the &quot;blacks camps&quot; outside
<br>
Perth were, in many ways, worse than anything I've seen in the US, even in
<br>
the Appalachians or on Indian reservations.  Don't get me wrong, Oz is a
<br>
great country (fantastically beautiful, for one thing) -- and the US is a
<br>
great country too, in different ways (for instance, I didn't manage to raise
<br>
investment money for any of my hi-tech ventures in Oz; I had to return here
<br>
for that).
<br>
<p>But that's a bit off-topic ;-)
<br>
<p>I didn't mean to say that humans are too irrational to handle democracy.
<br>
Clearly, the democratic process works moderately well for many things.
<br>
<p>However, it may well be too slow-paced, awkward and inefficient to deal with
<br>
the Singularity.
<br>
<p>This gets back to my &quot;AI Big Brother&quot; discussion.  I agree that, given a
<br>
long enough period of time, education and democracy will be able to deal
<br>
with Transcension technologies and issues.  But the problem is that if we
<br>
don't take specific action to ensure we do, we ain't gonna have that much
<br>
time.  Because someone will kill us all, or else someone who doesn't care
<br>
abotu democracy and education will simply build their own superhuman AI in
<br>
their basement once computers get cheap enough and knowledge spreads.  To
<br>
slow things down enough for democracy and education to be able to handle the
<br>
situation, will probably require some kind of quasi-fascist control of
<br>
advanced technologies.  Which is a &quot;solution&quot; that comes with its own
<br>
copious risks.
<br>

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are some communities around the world that are not like the US -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and since we are genetically rather similar it suggests that many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems you point to are intrinsic to human nature but are cultural and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutional.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My fear is that if we actually turn our backs on working slowly (but as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast as we can) to fix these cultural and institutional problems we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually heat up the problem - the whole issue descend into who can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own AGI into play first so that they can take over the world first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and impose their own flavour of absolute-mind-control-driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, I'd recommend that the US get a democratic voting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system and put lots of money into education for the poorest sections of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society and getting the excessive influence of media moguls under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control before telling the rest of the world that humans (in general) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too irrational to handle democracy.  (Of course, as a citizen of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a country that is running around like a US lap-dog and that launched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rupert Murdock on the world - I need to take of my own advice!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers,  Philip
