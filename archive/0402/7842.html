<p><em>&gt;Hi Keith,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, I'm aware of the recent work on evolutionary psychology and ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think this work is VERY relevant in terms of helping explain why human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethics are the way they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, when thinking about the ethics of posthuman digital minds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionary ethics probably aren't so relevant, because these minds won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be evolving by Darwinian natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>I am not so sure.  The scale may be off in space and/or time, but it seems 
<br>
to me that posthuman digital minds are going to be faced with much the same 
<br>
kinds of problems of limited resources human groups were faced with.  Being 
<br>
able to directly change their nature might not make a lot of difference in 
<br>
the long term about the kinds of ethics they adopt.
<br>
<p>For example, close by matter and energy is more useful to you than it is to 
<br>
others who are far away.  Unless you get FTL, then minds are going to be 
<br>
limited in the amount of matter they can use, ultimately by forming a black 
<br>
hole, but more likely just because of light speed delays.
<br>
<p>Does physics limit posthuman minds to a population rather than a 
<br>
megamind?  If so cooperation and/or competition become options?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As per Jef's comments, it probably makes sense to tie a &quot;universal theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical systems&quot; in with the process of &quot;general evolution&quot; as observed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cosmos at large -- more so than with the ethical systems that emerge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from Darwinian natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>Far as I know we have not observed evolution in the cosmos at large 
<br>
yet.  We have seen a mess of evolution simulated in computers.  It is 
<br>
interesting to note that one kind of parasitism that was first observed in 
<br>
a simulation was later found to exist in the biological world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, even in this perspective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Darwinian natural selection is interesting as an important special case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general evolution.
</em><br>
<p>Genetic programming is becoming a major method to find solutions.  Works 
<br>
well enough when you have enough cycles to burn.  It's way below the level 
<br>
where it needs ethics yet.
<br>
<p>One thing for sure, a neighborhood of vastly powerful AIs duking it out 
<br>
would not be a good place to raise a family.  :-)
<br>
<p>Incidentally, my recent thoughts at the included URL on rising or at least 
<br>
not falling income per capita being a way to keep human groups from 
<br>
starting wars might remotely have application to AIs.
<br>
