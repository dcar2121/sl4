<p>Okay, as a proof of principle, let's take a generic optimization process 
<br>
(i.e., a paperclip SI) and decompartmentalize learning into Bayesian 
<br>
learning of world-models and the expected utility equation with a constant 
<br>
utility function.  See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://intelligence.org/friendly/features.html#causal_bayesian">http://intelligence.org/friendly/features.html#causal_bayesian</a>
<br>
<a href="http://intelligence.org/CFAI/design/clean.html#reinforcement">http://intelligence.org/CFAI/design/clean.html#reinforcement</a>
<br>
<p>(CFAI doesn't call anything by its proper name - &quot;cleanly causal&quot; should 
<br>
be translated as &quot;expected utility&quot;, &quot;Bayesian Probability Theorem&quot; is 
<br>
Bayes' Theorem.)
<br>
<p>The point is that you can perform all learning necessary to the task of 
<br>
transforming everything in sight into paperclips, and you won't have 
<br>
conflicts with distant parts of yourself that also want to transform 
<br>
everything into paperclips - the target is constant, only the aim gets 
<br>
updated.
<br>
<p>Programming in explicit cooperation with distant self-parts, or 
<br>
maintaining integrity of a philosophically growing Friendly AI, are more 
<br>
complex subjects.  The former looks doable and theoretically 
<br>
straightforward; the latter looks doable and theoretically complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose every AI could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadcasting its total information stream into memory and receiving the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory dumps from every other AI.  It would have to treat the experience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (memory) of other AIs with equal weight to its own.  That would keep at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least close ones in sync, but if there are growing numbers of these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, the storage problem will get out of hand no matter what media is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being used.  (In fact, it might make the case for very few AIs.  Even on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per star would get out of hand.)
</em><br>
<p>Hm... I infer that you're thinking of some algorithm, such as 
<br>
reinforcement on neural nets, that doesn't cleanly separate model 
<br>
information and utility computation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problems this creates are bad enough that far apart AI cores would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be forced to consider themselves as different &quot;individuals&quot; just by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight of different (unsync'ed) post creation experiences.  I think this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is true even if closer ones engaged in total mind melding.
</em><br>
<p>In human beings all the axes of &quot;individual&quot; versus &quot;group&quot; are conflated: 
<br>
many memories versus one memory, many clusters versus one processor, 
<br>
different goals versus same goals, different plans versus same plans, and 
<br>
so on.
<br>
<p>Different memories stored in local nodes of an optimization process 
<br>
sprawled over long interprocessor communication delays does not equate to 
<br>
conflict of interest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With FTL there doesn't seem to be an obvious limit.  Without . . . 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually your brain undergoes a gravitational singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you want to keep each computing element within small-N clock ticks 
<br>
of every other computing element.  This is the case with the human brain, 
<br>
for which Anders Sandberg calculated S = (single instruction time / 
<br>
communication delay) ~ 1.  See &quot;The Physics of Information Processing 
<br>
Superobjects&quot;.
<br>
<p>Actually, with FTL or without FTL, if you try to keep S ~ 1 or S &lt; bound, 
<br>
you run into problems with your brain collapsing gravitationally.  Without 
<br>
FTL, because of the lightspeed delay; with FTL, because the necessary 
<br>
density of FTL relays to keep all processors within N hops also grows, 
<br>
albeit logarithmically (I guess).  In either case, you can either slow 
<br>
down your processors or accept a lower S.
