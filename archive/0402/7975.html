Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I didn't get the impression from CFAI that Eliezer thought the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massively iterated pure self-modification should happen before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts and goal system reflected a high degree of convergence.   His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position seemed to represent that if we get the structural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration correct, then given accurate information, the AI should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntarily refrain from such self-enhancement until it's &quot;predicted&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-enhancements are regularly MUCH better than the best programmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements, and ALL of the AGI's &quot;practice&quot; design attempts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analytically approved by the programmers on an ongoing basis.  Plus a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; margin of safety.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with all of that... I just don't think it gets you very far...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We probably STILL can't conclude whether or not that convergence will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be maintained into transhumanity ,
</em><br>
<p>This is my problem.  I don't think that &quot;keep doing stuff I think my
<br>
trainers would like&quot; is the best principle for an AI ... it doesn't
<br>
generalize well beyond the human domain.  It's a good principle but needs to
<br>
be supplemented with more abstract principles guiding it to figure out what
<br>
to do when there's no clear analogy with past situations in which it knew
<br>
what its trainers wanted...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;From my academic experience, most of the minds that COULD be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing to the theory are pretty much doing all they can, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information overload, to filter out the crap from their respective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field.  That more or less results in ignoring content not phrased in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readily processible terminology.  So as I see it, one of the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenges to the disemination of Friendliness Theory is a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding an easy misclassification by those individuals' &quot;efficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I agree there.
<br>
<p>Although I don't fully agree with Eliezer's ideas, I have paid a fair amount
<br>
of attention to them because I do think they reflect some deep and
<br>
high-quality thinking... but I have not succeeded in getting many of my
<br>
academic or industry colleagues to take them seriously, because Eliezer's
<br>
style of exposition is very eccentric by contemporary mainstream standards.
<br>
I don't personally find his style of exposition BAD -- I like reading his
<br>
stuff -- but it's definitely eccentric, and it generally seems to appeal
<br>
more to laypeople with futurist inclinations than to formally-trained
<br>
scientists...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
