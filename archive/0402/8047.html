<p>
Our ability to affect the environment increases
<br>
as technology improves, both for the worse and
<br>
for the better.  The air pollution I grew up
<br>
with in New York City has mostly gone away by
<br>
banning apartment building trash incinerators,
<br>
putting catalytic converters in cars, and adding
<br>
scrubbers to coal-fired power plants.  These
<br>
things happened because air pollution was enough
<br>
of a problem that society decided to fix it.
<br>
<p>Carbon Dioxide accumulation is almost at the point
<br>
where society will do something to fix it.  There
<br>
are various ways to address the problem.  For
<br>
example, I currently put 7 tons of CO2 per year
<br>
into the air by burning gasoline, but I also remove
<br>
150 tons per year by growing trees on land that
<br>
I own.  I could double my removal rate if I planted
<br>
genetically improved trees, which are already
<br>
available, and applied fertilizer.  A carbon tax
<br>
on emissions and a tax credit on removals would
<br>
mean coal burning plants would pay me to upgrade
<br>
my forest so they could offset their tax bill.
<br>
<p>A higher tech solution is to notice that the
<br>
sublimation point of CO2 (-78C) is only slightly
<br>
below the average winter temperature near the 
<br>
South Pole (-60C).  By making 'cold spots', areas
<br>
sheltered from the Sun, and perhaps a bit of 
<br>
refrigeration, you can freeze out the CO2 from the
<br>
air.  Naturally occurring cold spots on the Moon
<br>
are speculated to contain water where crater
<br>
walls shield them from the Sun near the poles.
<br>
Similarly, artificial cold spots could be made
<br>
by scooping out hollows and piling the ice around
<br>
the edges, and by suitable emissivity control
<br>
(putting shiny material around the mound to reflect
<br>
away sunlight, and black material inside the
<br>
hollow to radiate away heat to space).
<br>
<p>An even higher tech solution is to develop highly
<br>
automated factories to first replicate themselves,
<br>
then turn out large quantities of solar panels to
<br>
substitute for burning fuels.  This should be 
<br>
possible with today's or very near term technology.
<br>
It does not require nanotech or AI much smarter than
<br>
us.
<br>
<p>The basic thing to remember is the timescale for
<br>
the problem - 50 to 100 years to double CO2 content
<br>
in the atmosphere, is 
<br>
<p>(a) much longer than the time scale for our ability 
<br>
to do something about it using conventional
<br>
technology. Manufacturing productivity has doubled in
<br>
20 years, and advanced automation may have a doubling
<br>
time as short as a year.
<br>
<p>(b) Development of really advanced technology such
<br>
as nanotech or AI is likely to happen in a generation
<br>
or less, still shorter than the timescale for the
<br>
CO2 problem.  These would make radical changes in
<br>
our ability to deal with the problem.
