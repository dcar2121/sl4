<p>Yes, sort of.  If we all understand the rules of the game we are playing,
<br>
then we can each adjust our playing for the good of the team, and thereby,
<br>
the good of ourselves.  (The rules of the meta-game are available to us as
<br>
natural law, the way the universe appears to work.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; - an urge to create a social system where all sentient beings with

</em><br>
<p>As Ben stated, and I agree, a useful ethical theory may not be able to give
<br>
us the specific answers, such as the desired social system that you
<br>
mentioned, but it may help us understand the process of moving toward the
<br>
desired goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - an urge to contribute to the unfolding of a more wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe....... (but what constitutes a more wonderful universe would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most likely be rather different for different beings)
</em><br>
<p>The nature of the non-linear dynamics of complex systems (including social
<br>
systems) is that we can't predict what it's going to be like very far in the
<br>
future.  But we can learn the science of dealing with complex systems on a
<br>
more local level and thus reduce the amount of thrashing.
