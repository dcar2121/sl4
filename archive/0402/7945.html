<em>&gt; &gt; I think this relates to what you said by &quot;the way to maximize happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be to have a lot of complex minds doing complex things.&quot;  I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is true.  The original orgasmium may have been just as happy as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dialectical-synthesis orgasmium toward which we are tending.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one has growth and choice along with happiness -- and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any LESS happiness than its predecessor....  However, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current phase of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; passing through a painful separation-of-parts period is a necessary evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and is in fact the essence of &quot;evil&quot;) in order to pass from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undifferentiated orgasmium to the dialectical-synthesis orgasmium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This whole paragraph assumes some prior state that is different than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current state.  This is grounded in the basic delusion decribed earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOTE:I'm just as deluded as the next guy ;)
</em><br>
<p>Sure -- well -- I stated above that I didn't mean &quot;prior&quot; in a traditional
<br>
temporal sense.
<br>
<p>However, I didn't really make an effort to explain the sense in which I do
<br>
mean it ;-) ....
<br>
<p>More like &quot;X is prior to Y&quot; if &quot;X is simpler and more fundamental than Y,
<br>
and naturally gives rise to Y&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The human Transcension/Singularity should be understood as part of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process of the void reconnecting with itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undoing-without-undoing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it did by separating itself from itself in the first place...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No separation ever occurred and it is utterly impossible to do.
</em><br>
<p>I would rather say that the separation occurred and did not occur, exists
<br>
and does not exist
<br>
<p>We run up against the limitations of the notion of &quot;existence&quot; here
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An AGI, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful, will understand this and only then can it be called &quot;Wise&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be said to have achieved the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom&quot;  All the moral/ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions are resolved perfectly to such a being..human or AGI...
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I agree that all ethical questions will be resolved perfectly
<br>
to any being.  Some problems are fundamentally unsolvable.  However, it's
<br>
possible for a mind to make peace with the unsolvability of certain problems
<br>
at a fundamental level...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think if you keep looking for a universally acceptable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definable ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, a million-billion years will pass and you still will fail..
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I agree that a universally acceptable, clearly definable ethical
<br>
system does not exist -- and such a thing is not a goal of mine.
<br>
<p>But -- as I'm sure you'll agree -- this doesn't mean there is no value in
<br>
seeking to improve our ethical systems or give AI's good ethical systems.
