<p>
As one of the chief early offenders in the &quot;Well, past physics got 
<br>
revised, so why not current physics?&quot; debate, I'd like to say that today's 
<br>
physics got a *lot* more impressive once I knew a little more about it. 
<br>
In the latest physics, the bound formerly known as Beckenstein (now known 
<br>
as the 't Hooft bound, briefly known as the Susskind bound) is a 
<br>
holographic bound on the entanglement between a spherical volume and the 
<br>
rest of the universe, measured in Planck units of the surface area.  It's 
<br>
not something you could defeat by being clever about how you stored your 
<br>
data - if the holographic theories are correct, the 't Hooft bound is 
<br>
absolutely fundamental.
<br>
<p>It's that &quot;absolutely fundamental&quot; quality to modern physics that might 
<br>
make the bounds resistant to any amount of intelligence and creativity. 
<br>
Intelligence isn't actually magic.  If it sometimes seems that way, it's 
<br>
because someone a bit smarter does something that violates your model of 
<br>
reality, not because intelligence is actually some kind of hole in 
<br>
reality.  According to my own understanding of intelligence, nearly 
<br>
everything that once puzzled me seems to exist within physics and is 
<br>
continuous with physics, and I expect that the few remaining mysteries are 
<br>
not any different.  Physics is sovereign over intelligence, not the other 
<br>
way around.  When we tentatively model physics, we are tentatively 
<br>
modeling something that implements the intelligence with which we 
<br>
tentatively model it.  I particularly regret inventing the phrase 
<br>
&quot;ontotechnology&quot;, which seems to have become an excuse not to learn 
<br>
physics.  This is one of those areas where people really didn't need 
<br>
another excuse.
<br>
<p>Some obvious absolute fundamentals are Special Relativity - no local speed 
<br>
faster than light, period, because it's woven into the definition of 
<br>
causality.  Even at my worst, I didn't suggest you could go faster than 
<br>
the local speed of light by pushing real hard.  I did suggest that the 
<br>
various speculations about wormholes and other ways to fake FTL based on 
<br>
General Relativity showed that the pragmatic &quot;interstellar speed limit&quot; 
<br>
problem might be solvable.  But then again, it might not be solvable.  The 
<br>
prospect no longer fills me with dread.  I can have fun in a speed-limited 
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>You can't tell two electrons apart.  Ever.  It's not that our current 
<br>
physics doesn't tell us how to do it, it's that our current physics 
<br>
*requires* two electrons to be absolutely interchangeable.  If you read up 
<br>
on bose-einstein and fermi-dirac statistics, you'll see what I mean.
<br>
<p>Today's hypotheses of physics aren't things you can just change out like a 
<br>
used air filter.  They seem to be telling us something fundamental about 
<br>
the nature of reality.  Conservation of energy doesn't just mean that we 
<br>
haven't so far found any physical operation that changes the total energy; 
<br>
it reflects the invariance of the laws of physics under translation in 
<br>
time, and specifically the invariance of the computation of the 
<br>
Hamiltonian of a system.  Things like that.
<br>
<p>The laws of physics we know today are not compartmentalized.  They could 
<br>
be wrong, but you can't just rip out Special Relativity and replace it 
<br>
with a different hypothesis that allows you to go faster than light. 
<br>
That'd be... I can't even put it into words.  Reality would unravel.  The 
<br>
socks of reality don't have loose strings - if you take out a string, the 
<br>
whole sock falls apart.
<br>
<p>The limits imposed by our models, and sometimes our hypotheses, of 
<br>
physics, arise from exactly those features of the model that seem to 
<br>
shout:  &quot;Here is something truly fundamental about reality!&quot;  Back in the 
<br>
days when we were tossing theories out the window every half-decade, the 
<br>
theories we got rid of didn't have that &quot;Here is something absolutely 
<br>
fundamental!&quot; look about them.  That, in particular, I didn't understand 
<br>
when I made the historical comparison.  History doesn't always repeat 
<br>
itself.  Today's physics might be here to stay; or, when it settles down, 
<br>
all the fundamental limits might still be there.  At any rate I am willing 
<br>
to bet that no one can distinguish two electrons - EVER.
