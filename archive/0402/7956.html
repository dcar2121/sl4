It's been my gut feeling for quite a while ;)

</em><br>
<p>It's hard to tell what complexity is, but I think there are some 
<br>
definitions which could
<br>
fit your statement, however &quot;diversity&quot; is even less defined. It does not
<br>
matter which definition I take, I don't think that &quot;increasing 
<br>
diversity&quot; is a general
<br>
principle. We see increasing  and decreasing diversities on different 
<br>
levels and
<br>
it is completely chaotic. For example biological diversity is rapidely 
<br>
decreasing
<br>
these days, but e.g. the diversity of cell phone systems is increasing, 
<br>
but I assume,
<br>
it will decrease soon. ;)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree about networks, especially the internet. It has caused important 
<br>
changes
<br>
and improved overall efficiency.
<br>
<p>However I don't believe at all in the &quot;intelligence enhancing&quot; effects 
<br>
of the
<br>
&quot;media streams&quot; (whatever they are), PDAs, personal computers etc.
<br>
I don't really think that we were intellectually much more capable using 
<br>
those
<br>
stuff than anyone at the beginning of the last century with a some 
<br>
sheets of
<br>
paper and a pen. I even would go far as to say, that they were capable of
<br>
even more without them ;)
<br>
<p>I agree that this will change as soon as the computers and gadgets become
<br>
more usable, but I think, today they are merely distracting toys, but 
<br>
necessary
<br>
nevertheless.
<br>
<p>And it is nout just a question of hardware. I could imagine that the current
<br>
hardware could be used much more effectively by more sophisticated people.
<br>
I simply think that our skills in concentrating and using all those 
<br>
stuff is very
<br>
low compared to the potentials both of human brain and current computer
<br>
hardware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;network of nodes and work with nature.  Not one great AI, but innumerable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;augmented intellects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It would be nice, but I don't think it's feasible. The potential of 
<br>
engineered computing
<br>
substrate is so much higher that of the human brains, so it won't take 
<br>
much time
<br>
till it comes to an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;. It is not a &quot;faith&quot;. I am 
<br>
not too optimistic
<br>
about its effects on humanity, but I don't think it would make much 
<br>
difference to
<br>
try to accelerate or deccelerate this process. (In fact, I working on 
<br>
accelerating it,
<br>
simply because it's more fun).  The only way to postpone it, is nuking 
<br>
away 99.9%
<br>
of the humanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We'll be changed in the process, but we'll look back and see that it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both natural and &quot;good.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Will &quot;we&quot; include humans also? - Anyway, who cares?
