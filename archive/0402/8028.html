<p><p>Well, first a disclaimer: I am no expert on Zen, but I've practiced a fair
<br>
bit of meditation over the years, and I got a lot of exposure to Zen via my
<br>
ex-wife being deeply involved in a Chinese Zen temple...
<br>
<p>So the remarks I'll make in this email are my own reaction to and
<br>
interpretation of Zen, which shouldn't be taken too seriously.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of online resources on Zen for those who are interested.
<br>
<p>The website of my ex-wife's order is www.hsuyun.org, for example
<br>
<p>I also recommend the writings linked to from www.shambhala.org -- which is
<br>
not Zen, but is related
<br>
<p>And I have found the writings of this dude particularly well-constructed...
<br>
<a href="http://www.seaox.com/thich.html">http://www.seaox.com/thich.html</a>
<br>
<p>Anyway ... my own experience with meditation was that it helped ME to
<br>
understand some of the limitations of my own habitual patterns of thinking,
<br>
perceiving, acting and being ... to sense, in a way, the lack of solidity
<br>
and definiteness in many things in the world and myself that I'd previously
<br>
felt were a bit more &quot;real&quot; and &quot;certain&quot; (not that I'd *ever* felt anything
<br>
to be totally real and certain -- I was never that naive even as a small
<br>
child ;-)
<br>
<p>&quot;Simultaneous stating of opposites&quot; refers to a style of talking about Zen
<br>
that some people have adopted, which is very amusing and is probably very
<br>
useful in some contexts (and is not the only way of talking about Zen).
<br>
<p>What I'm talking about are the kinds of realizations that you get from
<br>
plunging yourself deep into meditation....  You can get pretty far beyond
<br>
your individual self and you can feel the insubstantiality and non-absolute
<br>
nature of the everyday world....
<br>
<p>The analogy with the singularity is that it will also bring us far beyond
<br>
our individual selves and reveal rather boldly the non-absolute nature of
<br>
the everyday human world and mind-states...
<br>
<p>But I wouldn't want to overstate this analogy -- that wouldn't be fair
<br>
either to Zen or to the Singularity!
<br>
<p>Zen doesn't focus so much on progress -- it's more of an exchatology of
<br>
immanence, whereas Singularitarianism is more of an eschatology of
<br>
transcendence.  Zen is more about realizing that we're already there, in the
<br>
middle of the wonderful perfection of being; whereas Singularitarianism is
<br>
about trying to bring about a more wonderful, closer-to-perfect state of
<br>
being via technological means.
<br>
<p>Zen presents more paradoxes to the conceptual mind, because it asks us to
<br>
realize that everything is already just as it should be, but it also pushes
<br>
us to get beyond the habits that constrain our ordinary thinking and living.
<br>
And it then asks us to get beyond the frame of thinking in which this kind
<br>
of paradox is perceived as a paradox -- rather than just another part of
<br>
wonderful being -- etc.
<br>
<p>The two are not in contradiction to each other in principle -- you can work
<br>
toward the Singularity with a Zen mind ... though it will bias the nature of
<br>
your work -- for instance Zen practice tends to go along with compassion,
<br>
which means a Zen approach to the Singularity would be unlikely to involve
<br>
killing a lot of humans....  On the other hand, it's an empirical fact that
<br>
not many serious Zen folks seem to be interested in techno-transcendence, as
<br>
they're more focused on achieving perfection &quot;within&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, a key point is that reading about Zen -- even reading  my silly
<br>
emails about it -- isn't much use.  If you want to appreciate or evaluate
<br>
Zen in any meaningful way, you need to meditate a lot -- I guess there's no
<br>
other way.  Personally I do NOT meditate a lot -- I used to meditate
<br>
regularly though never that obsessively -- because there are other things
<br>
I've chosen to do with my limited time ... but nearly all of the limited
<br>
understanding I have of Zen came from this experience rather than from
<br>
reading.
<br>
