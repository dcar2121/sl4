<p>I agree with the philosophical perspective that the &quot;universe is perfect 
<br>
as it is&quot; but take that a step further and add &quot;at this moment&quot;. 
<br>
Indeed, how could it be otherwise?
<br>
<p>Zen Buddhism is about acceptance of reality, and recognition that we 
<br>
cause ourselves suffering when we try to be in discord with reality, but 
<br>
Zen is not about non-progress.
<br>
<p>I think you are making a very good point, that with rising intelligence, 
<br>
our goals are likely to change, and that boundless physical expansion as 
<br>
a primary goal may be seen as a simple relic of our evolutionary 
<br>
programming, easily changed at a higher level of awareness.
<br>
<p>At the same time, I think a more fundamental form of growth, in 
<br>
complexity, will continue to underlie goal systems as far into the 
<br>
future as I can imagine.
<br>
<p>Yes, there is a correspondence between complexity and the necessary 
<br>
physical substrate that eventually reaches its limit, but considering 
<br>
the vast interstellar distances and energy requirements, it seems to me 
<br>
that there will be a substantial period of local development before 
<br>
needing to turn outward with megascale engineering, and  I suspect that 
<br>
before that point, the rules of the game may change beyond our our 
<br>
current capability to imagine.
