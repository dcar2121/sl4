<p>By Tina Hesman
<br>
Of the Post-Dispatch
<br>
<p><p>Technically, Stephen Thaler has written more music than any composer in 
<br>
the world. He also invented the Oral-B CrossAction toothbrush and 
<br>
devices that search the Internet for messages from terrorists. He has 
<br>
discovered substances harder than diamonds, coined 1.5 million new 
<br>
English words, and trained robotic cockroaches. Technically.
<br>
<p>Thaler, the president and chief executive of Imagination Engines Inc. in
<br>
Maryland Heights, gets credit for all those things, but he's really just 
<br>
&quot;the man behind the curtain,&quot; he says. The real inventor is a computer 
<br>
program called a Creativity Machine.
<br>
<p>What Thaler has created is essentially &quot;Thomas Edison in a box,&quot; said 
<br>
Rusty Miller, a government contractor at General Dynamics and one of 
<br>
Thaler's chief cheerleaders.
<br>
<p>&quot;His first patent was for a Device for the Autonomous Generation of 
<br>
Useful Information,&quot; the official name of the Creativity Machine, Miller 
<br>
said. &quot;His second patent was for the Self-Training Neural Network 
<br>
Object. Patent Number Two was invented by Patent Number One. Think about 
<br>
that. Patent Number Two was invented by Patent Number One!&quot;
<br>
<p>Supporters say the technology is the best simulation of what goes on
<br>
in human brains, and the first truly thinking machine.
<br>
<p>Others say it is something far more sinister - the beginning of 
<br>
&quot;Terminator&quot; technology, in which self-aware machines could take over 
<br>
the world.
<br>
<p>Thaler's technology was born from near-death experiences of dying 
<br>
computer programs. Its foundation is the discovery that great ideas are 
<br>
the result of noisy neurons and faulty memories.
<br>
<p>The invention began to take shape in the 1980s. By day, the physicist 
<br>
worked at McDonnell Douglas Corp., where he wielded a powerful laser 
<br>
beam to crystallize diamonds. He built elegant computer simulations, 
<br>
called neural networks, to guide his experiments.
<br>
<p>But at night, things were different. Shirley MacLaine and her ilk were 
<br>
all over the TV and on magazine covers talking about reincarnation and 
<br>
life after death and near-death experiences. It made Thaler wonder: 
<br>
&quot;What would happen if I killed one of my neural networks?&quot;
<br>
<p>Neural networks can be either software programs or computers designed to 
<br>
model an object, process or set of data. Thaler reasoned that if a 
<br>
neural network were an accurate representation of a biological system, 
<br>
he could kill it and figure out what happens in the brain as it dies.
<br>
<p>In biological brains, the information-carrying cells, called neurons, 
<br>
meet at junctions, called synapses. Brain chemicals, such as adrenaline 
<br>
and dopamine, flow across the junctions to stimulate or soothe the 
<br>
cells. In the computer world, there are switches instead of cells. The 
<br>
switches are connected by numbers or &quot;weights.&quot;
<br>
<p>So after work, Thaler went home and created the epitome of a killer 
<br>
application - a computer program he called the Grim Reaper. The reaper 
<br>
dismantles neural networks by changing its connection weights. It is the 
<br>
biological equivalent of killing neurons. Pick off enough neurons, and 
<br>
the result is death.
<br>
<p>On Christmas Eve 1989, Thaler typed the lyrics to some of his favorite
<br>
Christmas carols into a neural network. Once he'd taught the network the 
<br>
songs, he unleashed the Grim Reaper. As the reaper slashed away 
<br>
connections, the network's digital life began to flash before its eyes. 
<br>
The program randomly spit out perfectly remembered carols as the killer 
<br>
application severed the first connections. But as its wounds grew 
<br>
deeper, and the network faded toward black, it began to hallucinate.
<br>
<p>The network wove its remaining strands of memory together, producing 
<br>
what someone else might interpret as damaged memories, but what Thaler 
<br>
recognized as new ideas. In its death spiral, the program dreamed up new 
<br>
carols, each created from shards of its shattered memories.
<br>
<p>&quot;Its last dying gasp was, 'All men go to good earth in one eternal 
<br>
silent night,'&quot; Thaler said.
<br>
<p>But it wasn't the eloquence of the network's last words that captured 
<br>
Thaler's imagination. What excited him was how noisy and creative the 
<br>
process of dying was. It gave Thaler ideas. What if, he asked, I don't 
<br>
cut the connections, but just perturb them a little?
<br>
<p>Thaler built another neural network and trained it to recognize the 
<br>
structure of diamonds and some other super-hard materials. He also built 
<br>
a second network to monitor the first one's activities.
<br>
<p>Then he tickled a few of the network's connections, and something began 
<br>
to happen. The tickling, akin to a shot of adrenaline or an electrical 
<br>
jolt in the brain, produced noise. In this sense, noise is not sound, 
<br>
but random activity. And the noise triggered changes in the network.
<br>
<p>The result was new ideas. The computer dreamed up new ultra-hard 
<br>
materials. Some of the materials are known to humans, but Thaler didn't 
<br>
tell the network they existed. Other materials are entirely new, unknown 
<br>
to humans or computers before.
<br>
<p>&quot;A little elbow room&quot;
<br>
<p>When Rusty Miller went to lunch one day in 1998, he picked up a 
<br>
specialized computer magazine called PCAI journal. He flipped through 
<br>
the pages and came across a story about Thaler and his Creativity 
<br>
Machine inventing the ultra-hard substances. Instantly, Miller knew that 
<br>
Thaler had taken a step beyond other artificial intelligence 
<br>
technologies, such as fuzzy logic or genetic algorithms, he said.
<br>
<p>The brilliance of Thaler's invention is the noise he introduces into the
<br>
system, Miller said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Noise allows neurons to have a little elbow room to dream up new 
<br>
ideas,&quot; Miller said.
<br>
<p>Other researchers have come to the same conclusion.
<br>
<p>Good old-fashioned artificial intelligence uses human experts to input 
<br>
huge quantities of data and a list of rules to create a model, said 
<br>
Robert Kozma, a computer scientist at the University of Memphis. Kozma 
<br>
is experimenting with a similar technology.
<br>
<p>The rigidity of traditional artificial intelligence technologies holds 
<br>
back creativity, Kozma said.
<br>
<p>&quot;This type of rule-based system is frozen. It's dead and cannot get to 
<br>
the essence of intelligence,&quot; Kozma said. &quot;Creativity cannot be derived 
<br>
in a logical way, in a step-by-step fashion.&quot; You need a little noise to 
<br>
come up with good ideas, he said.
<br>
<p>Human brains are also noisy places, said Dr. Walter J. Freeman, a
<br>
neurobiologist at the University of California at Berkeley. A debate has 
<br>
raged for half a century about what the brain does with noise.
<br>
<p>Many biologists see noise as just a nuisance or a necessary evil, 
<br>
Freeman said. The brain devotes many neurons to the same task so it can 
<br>
swamp out that random activity, those scientists argue.
<br>
<p>But Freeman subscribes to an alternative theory - that noise is 
<br>
essential for the brain to function properly. Noise provides variability 
<br>
that allows organisms to adapt to new situations, he said.
<br>
<p>Kozma has replaced the brain of a robotic toy dog with this new 
<br>
technology. The idea is to create a robot that can explore a new 
<br>
environment, such as the surface of another planet, without human 
<br>
guidance. NASA is funding Kozma's efforts.
<br>
<p>Thaler believes that Kozma's research is derivative of his seminal work.
<br>
<p>It's not merely noise that makes Thaler's Creativity Machines so 
<br>
ingenious, he argues. He has discovered a mathematical equivalent to the 
<br>
fleeting signals that work on neurons - a special kind of noise.
<br>
<p>And Creativity Machines are their own best critics. In fact, they have 
<br>
critic networks built right in. The critics select the best ideas 
<br>
generated by the noisy networks and reward good work. The feedback helps 
<br>
the network dream up even better ideas.
<br>
<p>Bunker-busting robots
<br>
<p>Thaler, too, is engineering independent robots. A glossy, black, plastic
<br>
cockroach named H3 could be the prototype for swarms of bunker-busting 
<br>
robots that could seek out, explore and use collective intelligence to 
<br>
defeat an enemy target. The U.S. Air Force has contracted Thaler to 
<br>
create such robots.
<br>
<p>Robots, including Mars rovers, have been programmed with artificial
<br>
intelligence before, Thaler said. But those robots require human 
<br>
engineers to program in leg movements and rules for getting around 
<br>
obstacles. Each unique encounter requires new programming, new rules, 
<br>
and time.
<br>
<p>H3 gets no tutelage from Thaler at all. A sonar beacon beckons the 
<br>
robot, and H3's legs begin to flail. Every time the robot makes a 
<br>
movement that carries it closer to the signal, it learns the value of 
<br>
the move. Within a few seconds, the cockroach coordinates enough good 
<br>
moves to scuttle toward the signal.
<br>
<p>But Thaler hasn't stopped with robots. Creativity Machines can solve 
<br>
just about any problem in any field, he says.
<br>
<p>A Creativity Machine used two neural networks to study toothbrush design 
<br>
and performance. A brainstorming session between the two produced the 
<br>
idea to cross the bristles of the toothbrush for optimal cleaning. That 
<br>
toothbrush became the Oral-B CrossAction toothbrush.
<br>
<p>In one weekend, a Creativity Machine learned a sampling of some of 
<br>
Thaler's favorite Top 10 hits from the past three decades and then wrote 
<br>
11,000 new songs. Some are good, Thaler said. Miller confesses to being 
<br>
haunted by one of the melodies in a minor key. Other offerings are the 
<br>
musical equivalent of a painting of dogs playing poker, Thaler said.
<br>
<p>But computer-composed music doesn't have to be bad. Human mentors with 
<br>
good taste could train a critic network to grade the Creativity 
<br>
Machine's songs, punish it for bad tunes and reward it for harmonious 
<br>
melodies. The feedback would hone the machine's composing skills.
<br>
<p>Such a self-training system was the Creativity Machine's first 
<br>
invention, and the subject of Thaler's second patent.
<br>
<p>Carmakers and security industries want to use machines to identify 
<br>
obstacles, pedestrians or intruders. Some machines can identify certain 
<br>
objects, but change lighting conditions or mist the lens with water, and 
<br>
the system falls apart.
<br>
<p>Thaler spins a collection of toy cars, trucks and planes on an old 
<br>
turntable in his office while a Creativity Machine watches. The computer 
<br>
learns to distinguish Hummers from pickups and F-18s from 747s, no 
<br>
matter if the object is lit by a searchlight or sits in shadow or if 
<br>
rain spatters the windshield. The technology could alert drivers to 
<br>
whether they are about to back over a boy or a bicycle. Battlefield 
<br>
commanders might use similar technology to assess damage and decide 
<br>
whether to send in more bombs.
<br>
<p>Machines trained to detect dangerous objects could replace humans at 
<br>
baggage screening stations or watch for suspicious behavior.
<br>
<p>Thaler's first contract with the Air Force used a Creativity Machine to 
<br>
help design warheads that reconfigure the pattern of shrapnel 
<br>
scattering. That's important to limit collateral damage and to save 
<br>
money by tailoring bombs to destroy a target in one hit.
<br>
<p>Thaler's machines engage in the guilty pleasure of reading supermarket
<br>
tabloids. The networks learn how to write tabloid headlines. The 
<br>
&quot;International Expirer&quot; quickly became a hit on the Internet. But the 
<br>
computer reporters of the tabloid &quot;have no shame,&quot; and generated such 
<br>
celebrity-skewering headlines that Thaler removed the Expirer to avoid 
<br>
libel and slander suits.
<br>
<p>Spy agencies want to use Thaler's technology to map the Internet and 
<br>
detect unusual activity.
<br>
<p>Thaler coined more than a million new English words by showing a network 
<br>
a list of words. It learned rules of spelling and pronunciation and 
<br>
generated new words. In one trial, the network came up with a name for 
<br>
one of Thaler's spinoff companies - Synaptrix. The words are nonsense 
<br>
now, but Thaler predicts that companies could use them to name products. 
<br>
The machine also liked &quot;eggo.&quot; Too bad that one is already taken.
<br>
<p>The technology is not ready for widespread commercial use yet, say some
<br>
supporters.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's got extraordinary potential. Right now the holdup is packaging the
<br>
technology as a tool that somebody can actually pull off the shelf and 
<br>
use,&quot; said Lloyd Reshard, the Weapons Platform Integration Team Lead at 
<br>
the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate at Eglin Air 
<br>
Force Base. With other artificial intelligence technologies, &quot;software 
<br>
is commercially available on the street, but if you want to apply a 
<br>
Creativity Machine to your problem, there's no software package you can 
<br>
go out and buy.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Air Force is working with Thaler now to solve that problem, Reshard 
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I might lose my job&quot;
<br>
<p>All of the possible applications for Creativity Machines make some 
<br>
people uneasy. The machines could easily supplant people for many 
<br>
mundane jobs, and Thaler predicts that some traditionally human-only 
<br>
jobs, including laboratory scientist, could be up for grabs. Computer 
<br>
chemists could soon design new compounds and figure out how to make them.
<br>
<p>The machines could even be used to solve pressing societal problems, 
<br>
Thaler says.
<br>
<p>The prospect is just too much for people who see machines as a possible 
<br>
threat to humans.
<br>
<p>The normal human response is, &quot;Don't want it. No thanks. I might lose my 
<br>
job,&quot; Miller said.
<br>
<p>Or worse, sentient machines could decide that they don't need humans at 
<br>
all and do away with people. That fear is fueled by the plots of 
<br>
science-fiction movies, such as &quot;The Terminator.&quot; In that movie, a 
<br>
satellite called Skynet became self-aware, saw humans as a threat and 
<br>
destroyed more than 3 billion people.
<br>
<p>Sci-fi fans see similarity between Thaler's thinking machines and 
<br>
Skynet. There's even an eerie coincidence between the fictional 
<br>
satellite's Judgment Day - August 29, 1997 - and the date the patent for 
<br>
Creativity Machine became final - August 19, 1997.
<br>
<p>But Thaler doesn't see the world ending at the hands of the machines.
<br>
<p>&quot;I can never imagine a world that looks like 'Terminator.' What do 
<br>
people want? Food. Land. Mates. Machines aren't interested in that,&quot; 
<br>
Thaler said.
<br>
<p>Miller, who is in the business of protecting U.S. computers from foreign
<br>
attackers, agrees that machines are not the real threat. He worries more 
<br>
about humans with malicious intent turning Creativity Machines into 
<br>
weapons. Other countries are already studying U.S. patents and 
<br>
experimenting with revolutionary technologies. Terrorists could follow 
<br>
suit, he says.
<br>
<p>&quot;If the U.S. doesn't wake up and pay attention, we're going to get 
<br>
smoked,&quot; Miller warns. &quot;It's important for people to understand. It 
<br>
doesn't have anything to do with the business of business. It's about 
<br>
America.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some people are threatened by the idea that machines could think like 
<br>
humans, Kozma said. They don't like the idea of computers out-creating 
<br>
humans, he said.
<br>
<p>But Thaler's machines may never match the unique qualities of humans, no 
<br>
matter how clever they are at designing toothbrushes or warheads, Miller 
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Miller, a former ballet dancer and Green Beret, says he enjoys competing
<br>
against Thaler's neural networks, even when they beat him. Miller will 
<br>
always have a toe up on the machines, he says.
<br>
<p>&quot;None of his computers can do ballet.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet.
