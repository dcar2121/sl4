</em><br>
<em>&gt;something you could defeat by being clever about how you stored your data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- if the holographic theories are correct, the 't Hooft bound is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absolutely fundamental.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's that &quot;absolutely fundamental&quot; quality to modern physics that might

<p><em>&gt;The laws of physics we know today are not compartmentalized.  They could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be wrong, but you can't just rip out Special Relativity and replace it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a different hypothesis that allows you to go faster than light. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That'd be... I can't even put it into words.  Reality would unravel.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socks of reality don't have loose strings - if you take out a string, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whole sock falls apart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The limits imposed by our models, and sometimes our hypotheses, of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics, arise from exactly those features of the model that seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shout:  &quot;Here is something truly fundamental about reality!&quot;  Back in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;days when we were tossing theories out the window every half-decade, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theories we got rid of didn't have that &quot;Here is something absolutely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamental!&quot; look about them.  That, in particular, I didn't understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when I made the historical comparison.  History doesn't always repeat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself.  Today's physics might be here to stay; or, when it settles down, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all the fundamental limits might still be there.  At any rate I am willing 
</em><br>

<p>This is important because the *ethics* of superhuman  intelligences depend 
<br>
on the underlying physics.
<br>
<p>If you have FTL,  the ethics of the future are more on the scale of taking 
<br>
care of your body vs having to deal with other independent superhuman 
<br>
intelligences.
<br>
<p>It also leads to some very interesting questions about how physically large 
<br>
a superhuman intelligence can be.  At some point there is no utility in 
<br>
absorbing more matter.
