Hi Keith,
<br>
<p>Yes, I'm aware of the recent work on evolutionary psychology and ethics.
<br>
<p>I think this work is VERY relevant in terms of helping explain why human
<br>
ethics are the way they are.
<br>
<p>However, when thinking about the ethics of posthuman digital minds,
<br>
evolutionary ethics probably aren't so relevant, because these minds won't
<br>
be evolving by Darwinian natural selection.
<br>
<p>As per Jef's comments, it probably makes sense to tie a &quot;universal theory of
<br>
ethical systems&quot; in with the process of &quot;general evolution&quot; as observed in
<br>
the cosmos at large -- more so than with the ethical systems that emerge
<br>
from Darwinian natural selection.  However, even in this perspective,
<br>
Darwinian natural selection is interesting as an important special case of
<br>
general evolution.
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt;Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I've been thinking a lot about ethical theory, and I'm wondering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knows of an ethical theory that has the same kind of structure as Imre
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Lakatos's theory of &quot;research programmes&quot; (in the philosophy of science).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What I'm thinking of would be a theory of &quot;ethical systems&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ethical acts.  It would agree that any one act may be ethical or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;depending on the ethical system within which you view the act.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;give some high-level criteria for judging ethical systems as wholes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the risk of sounding like someone with a new hammer . . . . I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the basics of evolutionary psychology and biology to analyze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics.  That area has resolved a lot of questions to my satisfaction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though some of the answers are extremely unsettling--like the discovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that evolution has put no limit on irrational behavior in wars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://cfpm.org/~majordom/memetics/2000/16474.html">http://cfpm.org/~majordom/memetics/2000/16474.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The genes which lead to our feelings about what are thought of as good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics/morals were shaped by our long evolutionary history in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small tribes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the tribe members were mostly relatives.  Positive ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and morals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are actions that promotes survival of your genes, particularly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamilton's sense of &quot;inclusive fitness.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes personal survival was &quot;contraindicated&quot; as it was for Leonidas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; king of Sparta who commanded 300 Greeks in one of the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battles in human history: Thermopylae where his small force held up over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,000 Persians for six days while the Greeks mustered the forces that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually won at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marathon.  <a href="http://users.erols.com/nolan/heroes.htm">http://users.erols.com/nolan/heroes.htm</a>  Sometimes as in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story of Horatio at the Bridge they took chances and survived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can see at once where the (shared) genes of the relatives of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heros did better than they would have without their sacrifice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turning to less drastic situations, a major drive for humans is seeking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status.  We have genetically build brain reward systems that are switched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on by attention following actions such as killing an animal large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feed the whole tribe.  Status the residue from many such episodes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But status is more complicated than just being a good hunter.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a person who can be trusted, who can be counted on to do what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they say they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will, who will not be the first to defect (&quot;nice&quot; in the terms defined in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution of Cooperation).   Status and power more likely accrue to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to delay gratification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is easy to see why the reward circuits behind these traits evolved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperative social primates, as Henry Kissinger said, &quot;Power is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate aphrodisiac.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, non-zero cooperative situations--such as cleaner fish--can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be exploited.  There is a fish that looks like a cleaner and takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of larger fish by biting a chunk out of them when they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expecting to be cleaned.  Even though this has nothing at all to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human ethics, humans react to it with disgust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So while I have not worked out a framework for ethical theories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide a pointer to a possible solution.

<em>&gt; PS as a complete coincidence, I was looking to talk to Ben today before I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw his postings here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PPS  As a goal for friendly AI, seeking status (good opinion) in the eyes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humans and other AIs might be one part of the design.
