<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think there can be an objective morality, but I wonder if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be an &quot;objective&quot; (in some sense) set of system-theoretic criteria for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assessing ethical systems (which would not pertain to the actual content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these systems).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't it the same thing? Having an objective way of determining which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective theories of morality are good and which are not, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being able to choose one objectively good morality.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  Maybe it would just give you a &quot;partial ordering&quot; on
<br>
moralities, i.e. a tool that would allow you to -- in some cases -- declare
<br>
that one ethical system is better than another.  In other cases, the tool
<br>
might tell you &quot;no comparison is possible, the systems are too
<br>
incommensurable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also, the kind of criteria I'm thinking of wouldn't give a quantitative
<br>
assessment of the quality of an ethical system, so it wouldn't be able to
<br>
make fine distinctions between roughly equally high-quality ethical systems.
<br>
And two roughly equally high-quality-overall ethical systems might make
<br>
drastically different conclusions about specific situations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose if you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove that an objective morality does not exist, then you would also have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proved that an objective way to choose good moralities also does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist....
</em><br>
<p>That really depends on the details of how you define &quot;objective morality&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It comes down to exactly this. I have no clue how to build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quale detector,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since we still don't know how qualia are generated. So _if_ this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation comes down to &quot;I agree in principle, but what to do in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if I agree in principle, because I don't know enough about
<br>
qualia.
<br>
<p>I am not even sure that &quot;degrees of positivity&quot; of qualia are the sort of
<br>
thing that can be summed up, and the sum of one set of positive qualia
<br>
compared to the sum of another set of positive qualia.....
<br>
<p>This seems a little dubious to me.  Summing of degrees does not exist on the
<br>
level of qualia (Peircean First); it exists on the level of mathematical
<br>
relationships (Peircean Third).  Mapping qualia into summable qualities
<br>
seems to require some substantial theoretical assumptions ... so the quality
<br>
of an ethical system based on qualia-summation seems to rely on the quality
<br>
of the scientific research programme containing these theoretical
<br>
assumptions... no?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My suggestion has been from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning to have the AI have &quot;figure out qualia&quot; as an intermediate goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it starts doing big changes in the universe which will affect many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there's a germ of an interesting idea there.. ;-)
<br>
<p>I guess that a Universal Mind Simulator AI would have a lot of useful data
<br>
for &quot;figuring out qualia&quot;, if it was trying to simulate the experiences of
<br>
every mind in the universe...
