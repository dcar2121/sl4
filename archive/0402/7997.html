Another possibility exists.

<br>
d) It has happened, perhaps numerous times, but they just haven't gotten
<br>
here yet. Space is big.

Subject: What of a Singularity fizzling out?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Hopefully I'm not rehashing old discussion here, but I don't remember
<br>
reading anything about this on any of the SIngularity-related pages I
<br>
looked through.  It seems to me that there would be a reasonable chance
<br>
of the Singularity ultimately resulting in... nothing.  Rather than
<br>
there necessarily being an explosion of technology sweeping over the
<br>
face of the planet, there seems a distinct possibility of an implosion;
<br>
either through the transhuman intelligence self-terminating (for
<br>
whatever reason we can't foresee now), or through it transcending into a
<br>
place or state undetectable by us, and choosing not to bring us along.
<br>
I guess I don't see any particular reason why a transhuman intelligence
<br>
would choose to do that, but then again, I can see no reason why it
<br>
wouldn't, either.  It's unknowable, but still a legitimate possibility
<br>
that should be acknowleged.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One argument supporting this, although weak and enormously speculative -
<br>
more just food for thought, I guess, is that it addresses the problem of
<br>
lack of detection of extraterrestrial life.  It always seemed
<br>
intuitively likely to me that there's probably intelligent life
<br>
scattered all over the universe, so one would think we'd have heard from
<br>
somebody by now.  If a transhuman intelligence did decide to bring us
<br>
all along with it when it crossed over to the other side, there will
<br>
most likely be some compelling fundmental logical or ethical reasons why
<br>
it would choose to do so.  And if it brings us along, why wouldn't it
<br>
also bring along any other straggling life on other planets?  Is there
<br>
some sort of rule that a transhuman omniscient intelligence can only
<br>
bring along the inhabitants that created it?  Possible, I guess, but it
<br>
doesn't make that much intuitive sense.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So, given that we haven't been &quot;transitioned&quot; by an extra-solar
<br>
superintelligence already, that we still have pain and hunger and war
<br>
here, it would stand to reason that:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) there haven't been any intelligent races to attain a Singularity
<br>
yet anywhere in the universe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) there have been, and for whatever reason, they didn't see fit to
<br>
altruistically ease our suffering over here on Earth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Singularities don't typically bring their creator species with
<br>
them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Again, hope this topic hasn't already been beaten to death or anything.
<br>
