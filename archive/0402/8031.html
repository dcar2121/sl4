Hi, I’ve been a lurker on this list for a couple of
<br>
months now, and this is my first real post.  By way of
<br>
introduction, I’m a recent graduate of the University
<br>
of Texas with a BA in English and minors in Philosophy
<br>
of Mind and Psychology.  I’ve been very impressed with
<br>
the quality of posts on this list, and I don’t wish to
<br>
pollute, so I’ll probably continue to keep fairly
<br>
quiet.
<br>
<p>Ben, I agree with many of the ideas in these essays,
<br>
however I do have a few questions, comments, and
<br>
nitpicks, for what they’re worth.  I hope they don’t
<br>
result from misunderstanding on my part.
<br>
<p>First, a question about the following passage from
<br>
“Virtual Multiverse,.,”:
<br>
<p>&quot;Libet (2000) has done experiments showing that, in
<br>
many cases, the “decision” to carry out an action
<br>
occurs after the neural signals directly triggering
<br>
the action have already occurred.  This observation
<br>
fits in perfectly with the virtual multiverse theory. 
<br>
Note that this time interval is sufficiently short
<br>
that the action and the decision occur within the same
<br>
subjectively experienced moment.  In fact, Libet’s
<br>
results, though often presented as counterintuitive,
<br>
are explained naturally by the current theory – it’s
<br>
the opposite result, that
<br>
perceived-virtual-multiverse-collapses occurred
<br>
*after* the corresponding actions, that would be more
<br>
problematic for the current theory.&quot;
<br>
<p>To me, it seems as though the &quot;opposite result&quot; would
<br>
be perceived-virtual-multiverse-collapses occuring
<br>
*before* the corresponding actions.  Is this a typo or
<br>
am I reading it incorrectly?
<br>
<p>Great work here, by the way.  Your virtual multiverse
<br>
theory makes a lot of sense to me.  Hopefully, new
<br>
imaging techniques such as second-harmonic generation
<br>
microscopy
<br>
(<a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Feb04/Optical_recording.hrs.html">http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Feb04/Optical_recording.hrs.html</a>)
<br>
will soon allow researchers to test abstract theories
<br>
such as this one.
<br>
<p>My current intuition is that while the conscious
<br>
experience of freewill is probably inextricably linked
<br>
to virtual multiverse modeling, as you suggest,
<br>
something like virtual multiverse modeling probably
<br>
takes place in many different areas of the brain at
<br>
once, many of which do not correspond to
<br>
&quot;consciousness.&quot;  For example, when one is playing a
<br>
sport and is &quot;in the zone,&quot; virtual multiverse
<br>
modeling seems to play an important part in
<br>
decision-making, yet the decision-making process is
<br>
subjectively unconscious.
<br>
<p>I also like your basic approach to the hard problem of
<br>
consciousness.  I agree with the statement: “When a
<br>
new (pattern,ground) pair appears in the universe, 
<br>
a quale is associated with it.”  However, I’m
<br>
skeptical about your further assertion that “patterns
<br>
providing massive simplification of the most complex
<br>
(non-simple) grounds are associated with the most
<br>
intense qualia.”  While I think this is a good
<br>
intuition, and that a strong correlation between a
<br>
pattern’s degree of simplification and a quale’s
<br>
degree of intensity probably does exist, it seems to
<br>
me that this correlation probably results from neural
<br>
feedback mechanisms rather than being essential to the
<br>
nature of patterns and qualia as you seem to suggest. 
<br>
Evolutionarily, it makes sense that the recognition of
<br>
relatively powerful patterns should correspond to
<br>
intense experiences.  And indeed “epiphanies” (isn’t
<br>
this what we generally call the recognition of a
<br>
powerful new pattern?) do seem to be among the most
<br>
powerful of all human experiences. 
<br>
<p>However, you seem to ignore in this essay the
<br>
possibility that factors other than degree of pattern
<br>
simplification may also mediate quale intensity.  For
<br>
example:
<br>
<p>Trial 1: Person X takes a sip of Coca Cola
<br>
(corresponding to physical occurence P1) while sober
<br>
and experiences taste sensation S1, which corresponds
<br>
to neural pattern N1
<br>
Trial 2: Person X takes a sip of Coca Cola
<br>
(corresponding to physical occurrence P2) under the
<br>
influence of MDMA and experiences taste sensation S2,
<br>
which corresponds to neural pattern N2
<br>
<p>Presumably, intensity of S2 &gt; intensity of S1 
<br>
<p>Which, according to your theory, would mean
<br>
<p>Degree of simplification of N2 &gt; degree of
<br>
simplification of N1
<br>
<p>Yet, it is not clear to me that this is the case.
<br>
<p>Rather, it seems that factors such as sheer number of
<br>
neurons and duration of firing involved in N1 and N2
<br>
account for the difference in intensity of S1 and S2.
<br>
<p>Note that I assume the functional equivalence of P1
<br>
and P2
<br>
<p>To me, one of the more interesting questions regarding
<br>
consciousness remains: &quot;what factors determine whether
<br>
a neural process is experienced consciously?&quot;   Likely
<br>
answers seem to include: duration, intensity (or
<br>
number of neurons involved), and location... 
<br>
<p>Any neuroscience experts care to weigh in on this
<br>
question?
<br>
<p>-	Owen
<br>
<p>P.s.  Ben, I think your definition of pattern is
<br>
unnecessarily confusing.  Wouldn’t it make more sense
<br>
to replace “simplicity” with “complexity” in the
<br>
statement:
<br>
<p>A pattern in some entity X is a function f that
<br>
computes X from some data D, with the property that
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
simplicity(f) + simplicity(D) &lt; simplicity(X)
<br>
<p><p>As it’s written here, it looks as though you’re saying
<br>
that the system itself is more simple than the
<br>
simplification.
