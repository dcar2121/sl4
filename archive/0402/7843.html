<p>
Hi,
<br>
<p>Please pardon the long e-mail; I had a bunch of thoughts about these issues
<br>
while lying in bed this morning slowly drifting toward the wakeful state...
<br>
<p>I'll begin in the abstract and get to concrete superhuman-AI issues by the
<br>
end...
<br>
<p>One distinction that seems to be missing in our recent discussions of
<br>
ethics, is the distinction between:
<br>
<p>-- specific ethical rules (e.g. don't kill people, be nice to humans, don't
<br>
eat the yellow snow, etc.)
<br>
<p>-- ethical systems (an ethical system contains a set of specific ethical
<br>
rules, and also some procedures for generating new ethical rules to deal
<br>
with new situations)
<br>
<p>-- abstract principles specifying what's desirable in the universe
<br>
<p>This is somewhat similar to the distinction between
<br>
<p>-- specific scientific theories
<br>
<p>-- scientific research programmes (Lakatos) or paradigms (Kuhn)
<br>
<p>-- abstract principles specifying what's the overall goal of science as
<br>
opposed to, say, witchcraft, juggling, prostitution or music
<br>
<p>An example of an abstract principle specifying the overall goal of science
<br>
is Popper's dictum: &quot;Create conjectures that have greater empirical support
<br>
than their predecessors.&quot;  Note that this is an informal statement, and it
<br>
may be formalized and interpreted in many different ways.  But nevertheless,
<br>
essentially everyone involved in the scientific enterprise will agree with
<br>
this abstract principle, even if they adhere to different research
<br>
programmes or interpret the terms slightly differently.
<br>
<p>The statement that &quot;there is no absolute morality&quot; has two interpretations:
<br>
<p>1) a very obvious interpretation, which is that nothing is absolute;
<br>
everything is ultimately relative and subjective, if you choose to view it
<br>
that way ... to derive anything (including a moral rule) you must assume
<br>
something...
<br>
<p>2) a slightly less obvious interpretation, which is that even given a
<br>
reasonable set of abstract guiding principles, there are LOADS of different
<br>
ethical systems that all plausibly attemtp to achieve these guiding
<br>
principles, and it's not always so clear how to choose between them
<br>
<p>But what are the right abstract principles for the ethical domain? --
<br>
principles analogout to Popper's &quot;Create conjectures that have greater
<br>
empirical support than their predecessors&quot; in science?
<br>
<p>Jef Albright has proposed &quot;growth&quot; (in a very general sense -- expansion of
<br>
complexity... emergence of new patterns from old ... etc.)
<br>
<p>Curzio has proposed &quot;abundance of positive qualia&quot;
<br>
<p>Habermas proposed &quot;free choice&quot;, in the sense that he wants individuals to
<br>
have the ability to choose which ethical systems to live by...
<br>
<p>It seems that accepting &quot;positive qualia&quot; only as an abstract principle
<br>
leads to very obvious problems (its ideal universe is a single, mindless,
<br>
endless orgasm?)
<br>
<p>On the other hand, putting it together with growth yields something less
<br>
obviously problematic.
<br>
<p>The overriding ethical principle:
<br>
&quot;Create situations that involve more positive experiences for sentient
<br>
minds, and more growth in the sentient and unsentient parts of the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>seems to me to have no obvious stupidities.  (Though defining &quot;positive
<br>
experience&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; are nontrivial problems to which there are
<br>
certainly many different approaches... the same is true of defining
<br>
&quot;empirical content&quot; in Popper's definition of science.)
<br>
<p>Let's call this the Principle of Joyous Growth ;-)
<br>
<p>You can add freedom and diversity in if you want, obtaining something like
<br>
<p>&quot;Create situations that involve more positive experiences and more
<br>
experiences of free-choice for sentient minds, and more growth and diversity
<br>
in the sentient and unsentient parts of the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, not everyone will agree that this kind of principle is good.  Some
<br>
folks might prefer a principle such as
<br>
<p>&quot;Preserve the current way of life for humans as closely as possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>This Principle of Human Stability is not so compatible with the Principle of
<br>
Joyous Growth... just as, for instance, the overriding goals of witchcraft
<br>
are not the same as the overriding goals of science.
<br>
<p>There are many different ethical systems that are compatible with the
<br>
Principle of Joyous Growth.  There are heuristics for choosing between them,
<br>
similar to Lakatos's heuristics for choosing between scientific research
<br>
programmers.  I suggested some heuristics in a previous email, namely: good
<br>
ethical systems should
<br>
<p>* generate new ethical rules in conjunction with progressive rather than
<br>
regressive scientific research programmes
<br>
* generate ethical rules compatible with the free-choice decisions of the
<br>
individuals who are constrained by their society to obey these rules
<br>
* generate positive experiences and growth for the individuals following the
<br>
ethical rules it generates, as well as for the universe at large
<br>
<p>I'm sure these are not the only useful heuristics one could formulate in
<br>
this context.
<br>
<p>These are overall criteria for assessing &quot;ethical systems&quot;, but they are
<br>
meaningful only in the context of the Principle of Joyous Growth.  In the
<br>
context of the Principle of Human Stability, for example, different criteria
<br>
for assessing ethical systems would be relevant.
<br>
<p>In a superhuman-AI context, perhaps the most important thing -- in my
<br>
view -- is to ensure that an AI about to launch the Singularity is fully
<br>
ensconced in the Principle of Joyous Growth.  One then wants to make sure it
<br>
understands how to evaluate ethical systems within the context of the
<br>
Principle.  And then, finally, one wants to give it a specific initial
<br>
ethical system to start off with.
<br>
<p>Eliezer's &quot;Friendly AI&quot; ethics seems to me like a specific ethical system,
<br>
which is basically compatible with the Principle of Joyous Growth.  I think
<br>
that the Friendly AI ethic is a reasonably good one (though I could quibble
<br>
with Eliezer about some specifics), but I think that for an AI to have a
<br>
stable desirable ethical position through repeated self-modification, it
<br>
needs to have solid grounding in the Principle of Joyous Growth and in the
<br>
art/science of evaluating alternative ethical systems, as well as in a
<br>
particular beneficent ethical system like Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>The Universal Mind Simulation approach that I described in a recent
<br>
document, would seem to be useful in terms of giving an AI a means to
<br>
*assess* joyous growth -- an intuitive sense for growth and positive
<br>
experience throughout the universe.
<br>
