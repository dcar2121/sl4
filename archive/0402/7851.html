<p>
My working hypothessis is that:
<br>
<p>-   the universe-at-large doesn't have any intrinsic ethical structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or purpose  
<br>
<p>-   entities-able-to-philosophise have to provide/adopt their own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ethical systems and sense of purpose 
<br>
<p>-   I think that it is likely to be common that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entities-able-to-philosophise will at a minimum hope to be satisfied
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their experience of today and will be want to able to look
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward to tomorrow and the unfolding future 
<br>
<p>-   That once there is more than one entity-able-to-philosophise then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social dynamics are introduced and cooperation/collaboration and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sharing/coevolution of ethical systems start to make sense
<br>
<p>With the emergence of humans and then the impending emergence of 
<br>
AGIs this move to develop and coevolve ethical systems has become 
<br>
possible and desirable.
<br>
<p>The alternative to a shared/cooperative/coevolved system is a 
<br>
philosophy of defending the in-group and exploiting or destroying the 
<br>
out-group.  I think that self-interest and bitter experience have taught 
<br>
many people that this sort of ethic offers less for now and in the future 
<br>
to each in-group - so a good ethical system is one that fosters 
<br>
continuity and continued evolution of each in-group in the context of 
<br>
mutual tolerance and co-existence between all the in-groups. My guess 
<br>
is that in time AGIs will find the same thing.
<br>
<p>Anything more than this and we are starting to tell entities-able-to-
<br>
philosophise what they should aspire to - ie. we are trying to intrude 
<br>
(unnecessarily?) on their subjective life.
<br>
<p>With the emergence of social dynamics entities-able-to-philosophise 
<br>
may find that it is satisfying to share/merge many features of their 
<br>
ethical systems as a way of enabling the smooth working-together of 
<br>
larger groups of entities.  That is one choice.  But there are likely to be 
<br>
other entities that see greater merit in pursuing their own directions in 
<br>
small groups or even in a solitary way.
<br>
<p>So in a universe with many entities-able-to-philosophise my guess is 
<br>
that they will evolve towards a 'universal' base ethic of tolerance and 
<br>
co-exisistence but beyond that ethical systems will evolve in many 
<br>
different directions - the universe is after all a big place/long duration.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
