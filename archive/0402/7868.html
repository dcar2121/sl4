<p>There are two sorts of response to morality. One is following a certain
<br>
set of morals personally, the other is enforcing your personal morality
<br>
on others. The second set is where the problems arise, any moral morality
<br>
must allow for others disagreement with it without requiring that they be
<br>
killed in terrible ways.
<br>
<p>Personally my morality is pretty simple, for the most part I'll take the
<br>
view that consent == moral. Morality is simply a respect for others beings
<br>
living the way they wish too. Of course there are all sorts of complications
<br>
when you start to form a society. For example housemates, couples, etc. 
<br>
need to be compatible since there territory is going to substantially overlap.
<br>
People in a city need to have a common set of rules, for example they can't
<br>
be free to drive on whatever side of the street you feel like (nor always 
<br>
free to drive at all when the population density is too high to support
<br>
cars). But people should recognize these as conventions and not morality,
<br>
people in another city/area who have another set of conventions are not
<br>
immoral.
