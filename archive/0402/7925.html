<p>You're natural-selection-o-morphizing here.  You deal with cognitive 
<br>
systems that tend to have &quot;utility functions&quot; (not real utility functions, 
<br>
of course, but cognitive dynamics that make choices) centered around their 
<br>
own physical locations.  Actually, the utility doesn't follow the 
<br>
location, it follows the genes - but one's own genes tend to be reliably 
<br>
located in the same place as one's own brain.  In biological cases where 
<br>
this is violated, and to the exact extent it is violated, the &quot;utility&quot; 
<br>
always follows the genes, not the physical location.
<br>
<p>&quot;Self&quot;-centered utility with copying deixis is an easy idiom for natural 
<br>
selection (though, even there, it is frequently violated).  It need not 
<br>
apply at all to superintelligences.  There is no reason why an 
<br>
optimization control process transforming distant matter into a copy of 
<br>
the optimization control process would need to imbue that copy of the 
<br>
control process with different optimization criteria than the original, 
<br>
i.e., an expected utility optimization process extending itself throughout 
<br>
space has no conflicts of interest with distant parts of itself.  This can 
<br>
hold true for arbitrarily great communication delays without introducing 
<br>
any obvious difficulties I can see.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; It also leads to some very interesting questions about how physically
</em><br>
<em> &gt; large a superhuman intelligence can be.  At some point there is no
</em><br>
<em> &gt; utility in absorbing more matter.
</em><br>
<p>I'm planning to talk about this part with Ben.
