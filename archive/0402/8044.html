<em>&gt; &gt; Zen in any meaningful way, you need to meditate a lot -- I guess there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other way.  Personally I do NOT meditate a lot -- I used to meditate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See, that is a concrete advice which contains information (you need to...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a zen master doesn't care for information he wants you to stop making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a big fuss out of the difference between needing to and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needing to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He would say that the best way is to not meditate at all, and then another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooler guy would come up and say that you must meditate but not meditate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then an older one would go still farther beyond categorization and propose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an absolutely unrelated concept such as wash your bowl, but right after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, the coolest guy would amputate the younger guy's finger which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely wipe out the categorizing ideas that were formed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his mind, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then he'd be enlightened and stop worrying about zen and go do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is an apparent paradox in Zen, which is that
<br>
<p>-- yeah, the rhetoric states that Zen practice is no more fundamental than
<br>
thumb-twiddling or lawnmower repair
<br>
<p>-- nonetheless, in fact, Zen masters set up monasteries and encourage
<br>
meditation practice, more so than above-mentioned alternatives
<br>
<p>This is one of many apparent paradoxes to be overcome along the Zen path, I
<br>
suppose...
<br>
<p>Personally, the paradox that took me a long time to deal with was: If
<br>
everything is an illusion, then why should I bother being compassionate to
<br>
all these illusory beings?  I finally solved this one after many years
<br>
(&quot;solved&quot; in a personal-understanding sense; these aren't paradoxes to be
<br>
solved rationally...)
<br>
<p>My favorite Singularity apparent-paradox is: Since once I've Transcended,
<br>
the being that I'll become will have next to nothing to do with Ben Goertzel
<br>
the human, why is it more interesting to me to Transcend personally, as
<br>
opposed to just killing myself and letting some other superior Transcendent
<br>
being take my place?  An obvious partial solution is: For the experience of
<br>
Transcending....  But this isn't a full solution...
<br>
<p>Anyway, I guess we should direct this conversation back to more
<br>
Singularity-focused themes or drop it; this isn't the right list for a
<br>
discussion of the plusses and minuses of Zen practice...
<br>
<p>-- Ben
