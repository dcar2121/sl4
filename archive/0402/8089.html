In case people are too busy to go to the source of the Millenium Project 
<br>
2003 State of the Future report, I've included it as plain text below.
<br>
<p>People might especially like to look at the summary of the four 
<br>
scenarios for the global handling of challenging future Science &amp; 
<br>
Technology issues.
<br>
<p>Warning: This posting is long.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip

<br>
<p>2003 State of the Future
<br>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
<br>
<p>After seven years of cumulative global futures research by the 
<br>
Millennium Project, it has become increasingly clear that humanity has 
<br>
the resources to address its global challenges; what is less clear is how 
<br>
much wisdom, good will, and intelligence will be focused on these 
<br>
challenges.  
<br>
<p>Dramatic increases in collective human-machine intelligence are 
<br>
possible within 25 years. It is also possible that within the next 25 years 
<br>
single individuals acting alone might use advances in science and 
<br>
technology (S&amp;T) to create and use weapons of mass destruction 
<br>
(WMD).  
<br>
<p>The increasing number of women with formal education or participation 
<br>
in the cash economy has substantially improved the nutrition condition 
<br>
of the world, reduced infant mortality and birth rates, and improved 
<br>
general welfare. Yet violence against women who are between 15 and 
<br>
44 years old causes more death and disability than cancer, malaria, 
<br>
traffic accidents, and even war.  
<br>
<p>Previous moral campaigns by one religion or ideology tend to give rise 
<br>
to “we-they” splits, making it difficult to solve world problems. 
<br>
Collaboration across national and institutional boundaries, as well as 
<br>
religious and ideological ones, seems necessary to address the global 
<br>
challenges described in this book. Globalization and advanced 
<br>
technology allow fewer people to do more damage, in less time, than 
<br>
ever before; hence, the welfare of anyone should be the concern of 
<br>
everyone. Such platitudes are not new, but the consequences of their 
<br>
failure will be quite different in the future than in the past. As the 
<br>
collective intelligence of humanity increases by responding to feedback 
<br>
from the “global electronic nervous system,” far more serious efforts 
<br>
are needed to make sure that global ethics are also improved in 
<br>
parallel with advances in mental capacity.  
<br>
<p>Most people do not appreciate how fast science and technology will 
<br>
change over the next 25 years. The synergies and confluence of 
<br>
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive 
<br>
science (NBIC) are a particularly important new merger of science and 
<br>
engineering supported by both government and venture capitalists. 
<br>
NBIC tools will dramatically increase individual and group performance 
<br>
and the support systems of civilization. NBIC products will range from 
<br>
biometrics to counterterrorism systems, from restoring brain functioning 
<br>
and eyesight to increased longevity.  
<br>
<p>The unprecedented speed of change makes people unsure about the 
<br>
future. Globalization is challenging philosophical and religious certainty. 
<br>
People are unsure of the basis on which to make decisions. As 
<br>
decisionmaking to address global challenges becomes too complex, it 
<br>
will appear chaotic until new decisionmaking systems emerge. New 
<br>
kinds of global institutions might appear to be massively complex 
<br>
games capable of matching solutions and problems. With the merger of 
<br>
Internet capabilities and mobile phones, swarms of people can quickly 
<br>
form, share information, coordinate actions, and disband. E-
<br>
government systems are growing rapidly to help automate administrivia 
<br>
and to facilitate public participation, but they also create new 
<br>
vulnerabilities to manipulation by organized crime and to cyber-
<br>
terrorism.  
<br>
<p>The leadership necessary for sustainable development has not yet 
<br>
emerged. Even with spectacular growth in alternative renewable energy 
<br>
sources, total fossil fuel use over the next 50 years is expected to triple 
<br>
the amount used over the last 50. Unless carbon sequestration or other 
<br>
methods to prevent or recycle greenhouse gas emissions are 
<br>
developed, the environmental movement may try to close down the 
<br>
fossil fuel industries, just as they stopped the growth of nuclear power 
<br>
30 years ago.  
<br>
<p>International responses to SARS, the September 11th attacks, and the 
<br>
Space Shuttle Columbia explosion have increased global long-term 
<br>
thinking, but their impacts seem short-lived.  
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, long-range goals like landing on the moon or eradicating 
<br>
smallpox that were considered impossible did excite many people who 
<br>
went beyond selfish, short-term interests to great achievements. The 
<br>
eight UN Millennium Development Goals could be the basis for eight 
<br>
international coalitions—each composed of the governments, 
<br>
corporations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), universities, and 
<br>
international organizations that are really willing to commit the 
<br>
resources and talent to address the goal.  
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, water tables are continuing to fall on every continent. About 
<br>
40% of humanity lives in the 260 major international water basins 
<br>
shared by more than two countries. Nearly half the world lives in cities, 
<br>
on just 2% of the world’s land. People are living longer, the world is 
<br>
increasingly urban, and population is growing fastest where people can 
<br>
least afford the necessities of life. By 2050 there may be more people 
<br>
over 60 than under 15 years old. Within the next two decades, 
<br>
hundreds of millions of people could be added to the 1.3 billion people 
<br>
who are living on $1 per day.  
<br>
<p>The digital divide between the industrial and developing worlds is 
<br>
closing rapidly. It fell from 40 to 1 users of the Internet in 1995 to 17 to 
<br>
1 in 2001, and by mid-2003 it had fallen to about 4 to 1.  
<br>
<p>In 2002, there were more Internet users in Asia and the Pacific than in 
<br>
the United States and Canada (187 million to 183 million). By the end 
<br>
of 2003, China could have 120 million users.  
<br>
<p>The majority of the world may be connected to the Internet within 15 
<br>
years, making cyberspace an unprecedented medium for civilization. 
<br>
This new distribution of the means of production in the knowledge 
<br>
economy is cutting through old hierarchical controls in politics, 
<br>
economics, and finance. It is becoming a self-organizing mechanism 
<br>
that could lead to dramatic increases in humanity’s ability to invent its 
<br>
future.  
<br>
<p>Democratization is a global long-term trend, even though the pace of 
<br>
democratization has not progressed for the past two years. Since 
<br>
democracies tend not to fight each other, the trend toward democracy 
<br>
should lead to a more peaceful future. Yet humanitarian crises within 
<br>
authoritarian regimes from North Korea to the Congo need far better 
<br>
international anticipation and response.  
<br>
<p>The world economy has grown from $5 trillion to $35 trillion during the 
<br>
last 50 years. Although significant growth has occurred for many in the 
<br>
developing world (especially in India and China), income per capita has 
<br>
been dropping steadily over the past 30 years in poorer countries.  
<br>
<p>Yet the number of Asians earning more than $7,000 annually exceeds 
<br>
the total population of the United States, Canada, and Europe—laying 
<br>
the foundation for unprecedented middle-class growth and 
<br>
consumption.  
<br>
<p>Transnational organized crime has grown to the point where it is 
<br>
increasingly interfering with the ability of governments to act. Nation-
<br>
states can be understood as a series of decision points.  
<br>
<p>People in these decision points are vulnerable to influence from the 
<br>
vast amounts of money available to crime groups; hence, a new line of 
<br>
business for organized crime could be buying and selling government 
<br>
controls, decisions, and departments, just as they buy and sell heroin.  
<br>
<p>Since hospitals, food storage, water supply, and other support systems 
<br>
of civilization increasingly depend on the Internet, cyber weapons can 
<br>
now be considered weapons of mass destruction. Because cyber and 
<br>
other WMDs may be available to single individuals over the next 
<br>
generation, we should begin to explore how to connect education and 
<br>
security systems in a healthy way to prevent their use.  
<br>
<p>New biological and technological sensory technologies will make 
<br>
detection and enforcement of tougher environmental regulations 
<br>
possible. Many environmental impacts that were tolerated 10 years ago 
<br>
will not be allowed 10 years from now. The cost of military operations to 
<br>
comply with environmental regulations may become so high that the 
<br>
nature of conflict and military operations could change.  
<br>
<p>The rapid and unprecedented international cooperation to control SARS 
<br>
is a step in the evolution of global systems necessary to reduce the 
<br>
threat of new and reemerging diseases and immune microorganisms. 
<br>
In the meantime, AIDS still looms as a global catastrophe: by 2012 the 
<br>
number of people dying early of AIDS could double or triple. Today, 
<br>
nurses and teachers in Africa are dying faster of AIDS than they can be 
<br>
replaced.  
<br>
<p>State of the Future Index (SOFI) software can be created to help 
<br>
countries, industries, and sectors assess their future on a more 
<br>
objective basis.  
<br>
<p><p>State of the Future Index
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>The State of the Future Index was created by the Millennium Project to 
<br>
quantify progress related to 15 Global Challenges as a whole and to 
<br>
assess whether the future is improving or getting worse. The future 
<br>
cannot be reduced to a number, but the process of developing this 
<br>
index forces people to consider what they mean when the say the 
<br>
future is getting better or worse.  
<br>
<p>According to the studies of the SOFI discussed in Chapter 2, the 
<br>
outlook for the future is getting better due to the past 20 years of 
<br>
improvements in: 
<br>
Ø the infant mortality rate, 
<br>
Ø food availability in low-income countries, 
<br>
Ø the gross domestic product per capita, 
<br>
Ø the share of households with access to safe water, 
<br>
Ø the adult literacy rate, 
<br>
Ø life expectancy, 
<br>
Ø the percent of world population living in countries that are free, 
<br>
Ø secondary school enrollment, and 
<br>
Ø the share of the population with access to local health care in the 15 
<br>
most populated countries.  
<br>
<p>At the same time, the forces that impede improvement include: 
<br>
Ø carbon emissions, 
<br>
Ø the share of the population unemployed, 
<br>
Ø loss of forestlands, 
<br>
Ø the ratio of global average income of the top 5% to the bottom 5%, 
<br>
Ø annual AIDS deaths, and 
<br>
Ø developing-country debt.  
<br>
<p>This year’s analysis found that the SOFI was sensitive to several key 
<br>
uncertainties, including the possibility of extending the lives of people 
<br>
infected with HIV, large-scale increases in the number of deaths due to 
<br>
terrorism resulting from the advent of a single individual using a WMD, 
<br>
and the continuing possibility of nuclear proliferation. These factors 
<br>
lead to a plausible and significant drop in the future SOFI and suggest 
<br>
an agenda for global attention.  
<br>
<p>The results are summarized in Chapter 2 of the print version, and full 
<br>
details and the methodology are in the accompanying CD in Chapter 2.  
<br>
<p>One graphic representation of the 2003 SOFI is shown in Figure 1.

<br>
<p>An exciting next step is the development of the Internet-based 
<br>
interactive SOFI software as a futures research and policy analysis tool 
<br>
supported over an open knowledge system. This initiative is already 
<br>
under way, spearheaded by the Millennium Project’s Silicon Valley 
<br>
Node.  
<br>
<p>The panel of leaders and senior members from the Silicon Valley 
<br>
software industry proposed an organic open-knowledge system 
<br>
architecture. Pending funding to complete the software development, it 
<br>
could be used to develop national SOFIs for country comparisons. 
<br>
Initial discussions have been held about creating a EuroSOFI.  
<br>
<p>Corporations could create their own SOFIs to help clarify what is 
<br>
important to measure about their future, and what success would look 
<br>
like in more than just financial measures. The SOFI software system 
<br>
comprises “server” software components that run on an Internet Server 
<br>
and a “client” software that runs on users’ personal computers. The 
<br>
application is designed to support multiple types of clients.  
<br>
<p><p>Future S&amp;T Management Policy Issues—2025 Global Scenarios
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>Over the past three years the Millennium Project has conducted a study 
<br>
of futures issues in science and technology management and policy. 
<br>
The full results and methods are in the CD Chapter 3. This third year 
<br>
produced four scenarios based on the previous research and a two-
<br>
round questionnaire on the scenarios’ construction.  
<br>
<p>In preparation to write the scenarios, an international panel of futurists, 
<br>
scientists, research and development (R&amp;D) managers, and S&amp;T 
<br>
policymakers were asked about potential future developments and 
<br>
scenario content. Over half of the international panel believed it was 
<br>
plausible that within the next 25 years: 
<br>
<p>Ø   there will be dramatic increases in collective human-machine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence; 
<br>
<p>Ø   organizations designed to regulate the course of S&amp;T will generally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fail to keep pace with accelerated advances of S&amp;T; 
<br>
<p>Ø   weapons of mass destruction will be available to single individuals;
<br>
<p>Ø   international S&amp;T treaties and regulations will have provisions for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enforcement by police or military intervention; 
<br>
<p>Ø   international systems (like the International Atomic Energy Agency)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be established to monitor and regulate biotechnology,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanotechnology, and other areas of scientific R&amp;D with enforcement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powers; 
<br>
<p>Ø   advances in cognitive science, information technology, and new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;educational systems and/or changes in older ones will be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly improve tolerance for diversity; 
<br>
<p>Ø   S&amp;T regulators and commissions will not be free from corruption; 
<br>
<p>Ø   an anti-science movement will not be as powerful or more powerful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the environmental movement; 
<br>
<p>Ø   cost-benefit trade-offs cannot be logically made when extreme
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unintended consequences are involved; 
<br>
<p>Ø   scientists will not unite into a global labor organization; and 
<br>
<p>Ø   science disciplines will not be able to effectively self-regulate.  
<br>
<p>The alternative scenarios produced seven different S&amp;T management 
<br>
approaches, many of which can exist in combination with others:  
<br>
<p>Ø   national regulation on a case-by-case basis; 
<br>
<p>Ø   a global organization dedicated to the collection and dissemination
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of S&amp;T information on risk and opportunities;  
<br>
<p>Ø   a global organization that has power to enforce regulations that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limit and direct S&amp;T; 
<br>
<p>Ø   a global commission to establish S&amp;T guidelines; 
<br>
<p>Ø   a global commission to assign priorities; 
<br>
<p>Ø   self-regulation of each field by organizations with the disciplines
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves; and 
<br>
<p>Ø   international treaties and sanctions. 
<br>
<p>The following are brief abstracts of the 2025 scenarios; the full text can 
<br>
be found in Chapter 3:  
<br>
<p>Scenario 1: S&amp;T Develops a Mind of Its Own
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>The rate of scientific discoveries and advanced technological 
<br>
applications exploded. A global science/social feedback system was at 
<br>
work: science made people smarter, and smarter people made better 
<br>
and faster science. Better and faster science opened new doors to 
<br>
discovery, and new doors led to synergies solving problems and 
<br>
creating new opportunities that created new science that made people 
<br>
smarter. S&amp;T moved so fast government and international regulations 
<br>
were left in the dust. Science and technology appeared to be taking on 
<br>
a mind of its own.  
<br>
<p><p>Scenario 2: The World Wakes Up
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>The murder of 25 million people in 2021 by a self-proclaimed Agent of 
<br>
God who created the genetically modified Congo virus finally woke the 
<br>
world up to the realization that an individual acting alone could create 
<br>
and use a weapon of mass destruction. This phenomenon became 
<br>
known as SIMAD—Single Individual Massively Destructive. Regulatory 
<br>
agencies and mechanisms were put into place to control the science- 
<br>
and technology-related dangers that became apparent. Education was 
<br>
a big part of the answer, but connecting the educational systems with 
<br>
the security systems was disturbing to some people. Nevertheless, 
<br>
further individual acts of mass destruction were prevented. International 
<br>
and government regulations did manage the S&amp;T enterprise for the 
<br>
public good.  
<br>
<p><p>Scenario 3: Please Turn off the Spigot
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>Science was attacked as pompous and self-aggrandizing, as 
<br>
encouraging excesses in consumption, raising false hopes 
<br>
and—worse—unexpected consequences that could destroy us all. 
<br>
Particularly worrisome was accidentally or intentionally released 
<br>
genetically modified organisms and the potential for weapons of mass 
<br>
destruction. The poor were ignored. A science guru arose to galvanize 
<br>
the public. A global commission was established but failed because of 
<br>
corruption. But a new commission with built-in safeguards seemed to 
<br>
be working.  
<br>
<p><p>Scenario 4: Backlash
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>Control was low and science moved fast, but negative consequences 
<br>
caused public alarm. The golden age of science was hyped by the 
<br>
media, but it all proved to be a chimera. Some of the most valued 
<br>
discoveries and new capabilities had a downside and surprises 
<br>
abounded. Rogue nations took advantage of some of these 
<br>
shortcomings. The level of concern rose. Mobs protested. Regulation 
<br>
failed. Progress stalled. And corporate (or government) scientists 
<br>
frequently felt pressure from within their organizations. Both corporate 
<br>
and government organizations could not be counted on to self-regulate.  
<br>
<p><p><p>Middle East Peace Scenarios Study
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>Although the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most analyzed 
<br>
issues today, there are no well researched, objective, plausible peace 
<br>
scenarios for the Middle East - not frameworks, proposals, treaties, or 
<br>
road maps, but scenarios - stories with causal links connecting the 
<br>
future and present. At the request of its Cairo Node, the Millennium 
<br>
Project has begun a study to “backcast” from peace to how it was 
<br>
achieved.  
<br>
<p>Seven preconditions were identified:
<br>
Ø secure borders for Israel,
<br>
Ø establishment of a viable and independent Palestinian state,
<br>
Ø resolution of the Jerusalem question,
<br>
Ø end violence by both sides and build confidence,
<br>
Ø social and economic development,
<br>
Ø education, and
<br>
Ø resolution of Palestinian refugee status.
<br>
<p>A set of actions to help achieve each of the seven preconditions was 
<br>
given, additional actions were requested, and all were rated by an 
<br>
international panel as to their importance to achieving the precondition, 
<br>
the likelihood that it could be done, and the backfire potential (the 
<br>
ability to make things worse). The highest combined score (importance, 
<br>
likelihood, and low backfire) from the two-round questionnaire was 
<br>
successful regional water negotiations in the Middle East. Hence, 
<br>
peace scenarios should have this as an essential element, and those 
<br>
working on the peace process in the Middle East should initiate regional 
<br>
water negotiations as soon as possible. The responses of the 
<br>
international panel composed of more than 180 futurists, social 
<br>
scientists, representatives of involved institutions, and decisionmakers 
<br>
in the Middle East and elsewhere to the two-round questionnaire are 
<br>
discussed in Chapter 4 and the complete results are in the CD Chapter 
<br>
4.  
<br>
<p>The study is now half completed. Draft scenarios will be constructed. 
<br>
To improve their plausibility, they will be used as a basis for interviews 
<br>
with opinion leaders in the Israeli- Palestinian situation. The rewritten 
<br>
scenarios will be published and offered for discussion among the 
<br>
interested parties.  
<br>
<p><p>Emerging Environmental Security Issues and International Treaties
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>Over the past year the Millennium Project’s scanning of the Internet 
<br>
and other sources has identified over 80 items that show emerging 
<br>
environmental security issues that may lead to changes in international 
<br>
agreements. These items are discussed in Chapter 5 and the full text of 
<br>
the items is in the enclosed CD in Chapter 9.1 on environmental 
<br>
security. It is clear from these items that environmental issues are 
<br>
moving higher on the agenda of governments, corporations, 
<br>
international organizations, NGOs, universities, the media, private 
<br>
institutions, and individuals around the world. Environmental 
<br>
regulations are increasing in scope, depth, and enforcement.  
<br>
<p>New and much more sensitive chemical and biological detection 
<br>
techniques will provide faster and more accurate monitoring of possible 
<br>
environmental violations. Many actions acceptable 10 years ago will 
<br>
not be tolerated 10 years from today. Because the international trade 
<br>
requirements about the content and production of products is becoming 
<br>
tougher, the countries and companies that cannot keep track of 
<br>
chemicals in their products and production could lose business to those 
<br>
who can.  
<br>
<p>Frameworks are needed for systematic exchange and analysis of 
<br>
information among law enforcement agencies, customs services, 
<br>
environmental regulatory agencies, trade agencies, and intelligence 
<br>
organizations in order to prevent and repair military damage to the 
<br>
environment as well as to prevent and respond to environmentally 
<br>
caused conflicts. As a result, new agreements are needed for data 
<br>
standards for better information sharing and integration to enforce 
<br>
compliance to current and coming international agreements related to 
<br>
environmental security issues. Environmental security and full national 
<br>
sovereignty may be a contradiction.  
<br>
<p><p>Some Findings from Previous Years’ Research
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>There are many answers to many problems, but there is so much 
<br>
extraneous information that it is difficult to identify and concentrate on 
<br>
what is truly relevant. Since healthy democracies need relevant 
<br>
information, and since democracy is becoming more global, the public 
<br>
will need globally relevant information to sustain this trend.  
<br>
<p>The great paradox of our age is that while more and more people enjoy 
<br>
the benefits of technological and economic growth, growing numbers of 
<br>
people are poor, ignorant, and unhealthy. World leaders are 
<br>
increasingly seeking a common platform among UN organizations, the 
<br>
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade 
<br>
Organization, multinational corporations, and other key actors of 
<br>
globalization to address this issue.  
<br>
<p>Creating global partnerships between the rich and poor to make the 
<br>
world work for all, whichseemed like an idealistic slogan before 
<br>
September 11th, may prove to be the most pragmatic direction as the 
<br>
possibilities increase that individuals may one day have access to 
<br>
weapons of mass destruction.  
<br>
<p>Scientists have slowed, stopped, and accelerated photons in low-
<br>
temperature gases and solid crystals. Construction of the International 
<br>
Space Station continues, and human genome research is changing the 
<br>
prospects for life. The factors that caused the acceleration of S&amp;T 
<br>
innovation are themselves accelerating; hence, the acceleration of 
<br>
scientific and technological accomplishments over the past 25 years 
<br>
will appear slow compared with the rate of change in the next 25. The 
<br>
process of scientific R&amp;D that uses peer-reviewed journals and 
<br>
government support is being challenged by those using venture capital 
<br>
to get products to the market more quickly. Since technology is growing 
<br>
so rapidly along several fronts, the possibility of it growing beyond 
<br>
human control must now be taken seriously.  
<br>
<p>National decision-makers have not been trained in the theory and 
<br>
practice of decision-making, and few know how advanced decision 
<br>
support software could help them. Formalized training for 
<br>
decisionmakers could result in a significant improvement in the quality 
<br>
of global decisions. In addition to policymakers needing training in how 
<br>
to make decisions, processes to set priorities (local, national, and 
<br>
international) need further development.  
<br>
<p>We know the world is increasingly complex and that the most serious 
<br>
challenges are global in nature, yet we don’t seem to know how to 
<br>
improve and deploy Internet-based management tools and concepts 
<br>
fast enough to get on top of the situation.  
<br>
<p>The hundreds of actions that were suggested over the years by the 
<br>
Millennium Project’s Global Lookout Panels could be organized into 12 
<br>
meta-strategies, which can also be used as a checklist to help identify a 
<br>
more complete set of specific strategies in other situations: Ø 
<br>
establishing new alliances, agreements, and treaties; Ø engaging in 
<br>
social marketing; Ø creating standards and permits; Ø enforcing or 
<br>
modifying laws and regulations; Ø performing scientific R&amp;D; Ø 
<br>
engaging in meetings, dialogues, or workshops; Ø creating and 
<br>
amending economic systems, sanctions, and incentives; Ø improving 
<br>
planning, accounting, and forecasting; Ø creating and improving new 
<br>
educational programs; Ø developing and sharing information; Ø 
<br>
modifying institutions, infrastructure, and priorities; and Ø initiating new 
<br>
institutions, projects, and programs.  
<br>
<p>The role of the state is more important where there is little private 
<br>
sector; hence policies that make sense in western industrial countries 
<br>
that include leadership from the private sector are less applicable in 
<br>
poorer regions.  
<br>
<p>The extent of national sovereignty continues to be a key element in the 
<br>
analysis of environmental security, terrorism, climate change, the 
<br>
International Criminal Court, and management of future S&amp;T risks.  
<br>
<p>Since education is one of the fundamental strategies to address most 
<br>
global challenges, it is important to identify the most effective 
<br>
educational materials, curricula, and distribution media for global 
<br>
education as well as institutional arrangements to accelerate learning.  
<br>
<p>The lack of ethical behavior and moral underpinnings has given rise to 
<br>
a new hunger for global ethics and the need to identify common ethical 
<br>
norms. Coupled with this is the extraordinary growth of global standards 
<br>
and those who seek to meet them through the International 
<br>
Organization for Standardization.  
<br>
<p>Environmental security is the environmental viability for life support, 
<br>
with three sub-elements: preventing or repairing military damage to the 
<br>
environment, preventing or responding to environmentally caused 
<br>
conflicts, and protecting the environment due to the moral value of the 
<br>
environment itself. Environmental security is rising on the military 
<br>
agenda of more nations due to new kinds of weapons and their ability 
<br>
to be used in asymmetrical conflicts; increasing demands on natural 
<br>
resources, with urbanization that is making more people dependent on 
<br>
vulnerable public utilities; continued advances in environmental law, 
<br>
with escalating environmental litigation; and globalization that is 
<br>
increasing interdependence.  
<br>
<p>Some military conflicts and many environmental problems are due to 
<br>
the lack of clean and abundant energy. Although the interdependence 
<br>
of economic growth and technological innovation made it possible for 
<br>
3–4 billion people to have relatively good health and living conditions 
<br>
today, unless our financial, economic, environmental, and social 
<br>
behaviors are improved along with our industrial technologies, the long-
<br>
term future could be more difficult.  
<br>
<p>The world is completing a convergence of information and 
<br>
telecommunications technologies to create a self-organizing 
<br>
mechanism to improve the collective intelligence of humanity. As 
<br>
mobile phones and the Internet merge, China is set to become a unique 
<br>
cyber phenomena: it has the largest number of mobile phone users in 
<br>
the world and by 2005 it will also have the most Internet users.  
<br>
<p>There is a growing awareness that nothing less than a declaration of 
<br>
information warfare against money laundering will be necessary to 
<br>
bring down transnational organized crime and political corruption.  
<br>
<p>Although many people criticize globalization’s potential cultural 
<br>
impacts, it is increasingly clear that cultural change is necessary to 
<br>
address global challenges. The development of genuine democracy 
<br>
requires cultural change, preventing AIDS requires cultural change, 
<br>
sustainable development requires cultural change, ending violence 
<br>
against women requires cultural change, and ending ethnic violence 
<br>
requires cultural change. The tools of globalization, such as the Internet 
<br>
and global trade, should be used to help cultures adapt in a way that 
<br>
preserves their unique contributions to humanity and yet helps improve 
<br>
the human condition.  
<br>
<p>The most important challenges are transnational in nature and 
<br>
transinstitutional in solution. They cannot be addressed by any 
<br>
government or institution acting alone. They require collaborative 
<br>
action among governments, international organizations, corporations, 
<br>
universities, and NGOs.  
<br>
<p>Trans-institutional mechanisms to focus these global actors are 
<br>
missing. The 15 global challenges discussed in Chapter 1 provide a 
<br>
framework to assess the global and local prospects for humanity 
<br>
(sustainable development could be discussed as a global or a 
<br>
neighborhood objective). The challenges are interdependent: an 
<br>
improvement in one makes it easier to address others; deterioration in 
<br>
one makes it more difficult to address others. There is greater 
<br>
consensus about the global situation as expressed in these challenges 
<br>
and the actions to address them than is evident in the news media.
