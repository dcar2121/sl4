<em>&gt; has proposed &quot;abundance of positive qualia&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Let's not forget the &quot;elimination of negative qualia&quot; which is to me even
<br>
more important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems that accepting &quot;positive qualia&quot; only as an abstract principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leads to very obvious problems (its ideal universe is a single, mindless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;endless orgasm?)
</em><br>
<p>Such a universe looks free of challenge, free of gain, and from the point of
<br>
view of evolved mammals it is not satisfactory. However I don't think any
<br>
one of us can appreciate the meaning of an endless cosmic-scale orgasm. I
<br>
think most would give up the small and temporary satisfactions they get with
<br>
growth, discovery and progress, in order to remain in such a state of
<br>
orgasmic, albeit thoughtless joy.
<br>
<p>This issue aside, I do not necessarily think that an ideal universe based on
<br>
maximization of positive qualia will be mindless. I don't know what kind of
<br>
brain is required in order to experience human-equivalent orgasms.
<br>
But I do know a lot of different types of joy that require the full human
<br>
cognitive architecture to be appreciated. It is reasonable to think that the
<br>
most intense qualia need a complex brain to exist. For example, a shrimp can
<br>
hardly appreciate music at all. A child can rejoyce with simple tunes, but
<br>
perhaps not cry listening to classical music. You need a modern day citizen,
<br>
who is also smart and educated, a scientist, to appreciate complex dynamic
<br>
systems such as cells and AI. Whether a shrimp's orgasm feels better than a
<br>
human orgasm, is completely beyond me :)
<br>
<p>Maximization of positive qualia also includes finding out new positive
<br>
qualia, for variety is just as important as quantity and intensity. The
<br>
universe may just, in the process of creating a universal orgasm, evolve to
<br>
the maximum level of awareness and intelligence, to the point in which it
<br>
simulates all transhuman heavens for all possible creatures. I doubt that a
<br>
homogeneous mindless substance can produce the most amount of positive
<br>
qualia, although this is indeed a possibility.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I am willing to sacrifice some absolutism on this side for the
<br>
sake of freedom, which is so important to most people. Part of the reason I
<br>
am willing to settle for something less is that my 'absolutistic' scenario
<br>
is so far away from what we have today than even a millimeter in the right
<br>
direction would be amazing, so there isn't a need to agree to 25 decimal
<br>
digits for now.
<br>
<p>What I can't compromise about are negative qualia...
