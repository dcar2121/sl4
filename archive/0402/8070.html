Hey Ben :)
<br>
<p>Yes.  It is a huge problem.  
<br>
<p>When I mentioned &quot;primitives&quot;, my meaning was only that once a complex
<br>
concept is represented, it can be used as a logical primitive for more
<br>
complex ideas.  
<br>
<p>I'd expect that maintaining a model of human equivalent understanding
<br>
WOULD be performed in some fashion, but perhaps subsumed as a special
<br>
case of a larger modeling system; supporting representations of the
<br>
AGI's past cognitive capabilities, and how they have changed over
<br>
time.  I find it very highly likely that an AGI diligently persuing
<br>
self-modification as an expected utility of it's supergoal would not
<br>
fail to implement satisfactory controls for arbitrary reversion to
<br>
previous content and structural states, if required.  This becomes
<br>
less important as the AGI's predictive horizon increases, but for an
<br>
error/correction interval greater than the predictive window in place
<br>
at the time of the error, it would seem to require this type of
<br>
mechanism in at least SOME of the important cases.
<br>
<p>I will agree with your position, from a few threads ago, that this
<br>
rapidly iterating self-modification should NOT occur before the AGI is
<br>
mature enough to near-perfectly predict programmer-generated
<br>
modifications, and always suggest better ones (with full programmer
<br>
review).  Once it has reached this level however, the conceptual
<br>
network represented in it's mind should be interlinked enough to
<br>
absorb serious errors and self-correct.  At least better than we could
<br>
correct it.  Tack on a healty safety margin, double it, and I am
<br>
starting to think the AGI might remain stable.  
<br>
<p>But it would not be a purely structural solution.  It would depend on
<br>
both structural and conceptual aspects.  Since it is looking like we
<br>
might have AGI before we have a complete structural theory, my
<br>
interest is turning toward how the combination of structural and
<br>
content components could interact to result in self-modifications that
<br>
progressively address structural ambiguities.
<br>
<p>Of course, the standard disclaimer applies: I'd say we have more gaps
<br>
than understanding, right now, so we should assume we ARE missing
<br>
something important, that we simply don't even recognize yet.

<p>Hi,

&nbsp;
<br>
I understand that your &quot;singly-rooted goal hierarchy&quot; refers to the
<br>
goal system only.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But a big problem is that the primitives in terms of which the goal
<br>
system is defined, are not really likely to be &quot;primitive&quot; -- they're
<br>
more likely to be complex human-culture concepts formed from complex
<br>
amalgams of other complex human-culture concepts ... not the sort of
<br>
thing that's likely to remain stable in a self-modifying mind....
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Of course, you can give the AI the goal of maintaining a simulacrum of
<br>
the human understanding of these primitives, even as it transcends
<br>
human understanding and sees the limitations and absurdities of human
<br>
&quot;primitive&quot; concepts ... but I'm doubting that *this* is a stably
<br>
achievable goal... for similar reasons...
