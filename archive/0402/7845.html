<em>&gt; One distinction that seems to be missing in our recent discussions of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jef Albright has proposed &quot;growth&quot; (in a very general sense --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion of complexity... emergence of new patterns from old ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm saying something a little more subtle than that, and I haven't yet done
<br>
the work necessary to make it clear regardless of audience background.
<br>
<p>What I'm trying to convey is that the universe is about synergetic growth of
<br>
complexity at all levels of organization.  What is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right&quot; is
<br>
actually what *works*, at any particular level of organization.  The best we
<br>
can do is understand the process and align with it at our own level.  This
<br>
will feel &quot;right&quot; in most cases because life evolved with these same rules
<br>
and so a large portion of our human nature is congruent with these basic
<br>
principles.  Some of it will not feel right to humans because humans do not
<br>
in fact hold any privileged position in the universe.  Its similar to the
<br>
child who feels unhappy about being unable to do something, while the adult
<br>
sees the bigger picture but can't explain sufficiently.
<br>
<p>Some parts that will feel right (expressed in human ethical terms) may
<br>
include the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;The distinction between Self and Other is to be respected.&quot;  At a very
<br>
basic level, it's all about interaction between a system and its
<br>
environment.  Both are important to life.  Our evolved nature is that this
<br>
is a fundamental survival value.
<br>
<p>&quot;Growth is the way of all life and is good.&quot;  Again a fundamental survival
<br>
value shared by all life.  Just staying alive is growth.
<br>
<p>&quot;The greatest overall growth is achieved through cooperation&quot;  Synergy is
<br>
present at all levels of organization.  Even competition at one level is
<br>
actually a form of cooperation a higher level.  Again, at the human level,
<br>
there are strong evolved tendencies toward cooperation.
<br>
<p>&quot;The greatest overall growth is achieved through maximizing diversity&quot;  At a
<br>
human level, we value greater freedom as a basic good and we recognize its
<br>
practical benefits.  This principle is in effect all levels of organization.
<br>
<p>How's this for a start?
