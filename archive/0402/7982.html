<p>
We are so predictable (me included).
<br>
<p>We don't want to live in a dictorship.  After all who wants other people 
<br>
telling you what to do or holding your life in their hands?.
<br>
<p>And we like democracy when *we* want to advocate something.
<br>
<p>But we don't want democracy if there's a risk that the majority will 
<br>
disagree with us and will stop us doing what *we* want.
<br>
<p>What we want is to be free ourselves but dictators over everyone else!
<br>
<p>In some of the earlier discussions people have pointed out how stupid, 
<br>
poorly educated, superstitious and irrational the majority of the 
<br>
population is.  While I can't disagree with this completely (since the raw 
<br>
data is rather overwhelming at times!!) I think we hide an even more 
<br>
important truth under this description/stereotyping.
<br>
<p>My personal experience is that people of very widely differing 
<br>
intelligence can collectively make quite good decisions about wider 
<br>
issues....if they have lots of experience of trying to make such 
<br>
decisions, if their education helps to gear them up for such decision-
<br>
making, if good information is provided as input to the thinking process 
<br>
and if they contemplate wider issues in a social context where people 
<br>
are careful, compassionate and rational in how they approach desision-
<br>
making and if there is good facilitation/mediation (by which I *don't* 
<br>
mean cleverly setting people up to accept a pre-determined decision).
<br>
<p>The terrible lack of capacity for wider-issue decision-making that we 
<br>
see in the community is I believe substantially the result of a lack of 
<br>
long-time-period investment in decision-making capacity.  And it's 
<br>
agravated by the shocking dumbing-down process that muh of the 
<br>
media fosters.
<br>
<p>So the more we dismiss the majority of people as being incapable of 
<br>
good decision-making, the more we create the actual incapacity that we 
<br>
complain of.  We are reaping what we sow on this to a very large 
<br>
extent.
<br>
<p>But now that we are in this mess, it's going to take some very carefully 
<br>
thought-out action to dig ourselves out - when we face such important 
<br>
issues as - what should we do about AGIs and transcension/the 
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>Maybe we have to start investing in community capacity for good 
<br>
decision-making?  - starting early so the capacity is more in evidence 
<br>
by the time we really need it.
<br>
<p>Maybe we can find the few oases where communities are appracntly 
<br>
more capable of thoughtful/ participatory decision-making and we could 
<br>
trial discussions on transcension etc. in these contexts.  this will seed 
<br>
some inform,ed ideas in the community and it will give us some 
<br>
experience in working democratically.  And the feed-back we'd get 
<br>
would be good for us.  We will get a much better idea of what people's 
<br>
concerns and hopes are and we get a mirror on our own ideas/ 
<br>
rationality.  
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
