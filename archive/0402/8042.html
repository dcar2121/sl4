<em>&gt; What I'm talking about are the kinds of realizations that you get from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plunging yourself deep into meditation....  You can get pretty far beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your individual self and you can feel the insubstantiality and
</em><br>
non-absolute
<br>
<em>&gt; nature of the everyday world....
</em><br>
<p>Ok you are talking about meditation, I am not saying that meditation is not
<br>
useful. Any highly mindful state is useful whether it is introspective as in
<br>
meditation or examining the outside as in scientific discovery.
<br>
<p>I am talking about what so-called zen masters passed down to us, the
<br>
&quot;stories&quot; and parables of zen. Those are not useful in my views.
<br>
<p>Hofstaedter correctly classifies zen stories as a kind of rethorical device
<br>
to take the listener outside of a system of categorization. They go as far
<br>
as possible to reject any kind of categorization. But we know that without
<br>
categorization sentience is impossible, so their attempt is not only futile
<br>
(can't stop thinking the way you do, it's your cognitive framework) but
<br>
misguided. Though entertaining!
<br>
<p>At any rate whatever you get out of zen by reading the loose and creative
<br>
translations of western authors is probably more than the original author
<br>
put into it! :)
<br>
To get the feeling behind this stuff you need to at least read it in the
<br>
original language, after some experience living with the natives. After I
<br>
drove my chinese girlfriend crazy with this stuff for years I finally had
<br>
the time to learn some chinese and now I agree with her that laozi is just
<br>
an old man and cool people don't quote him at dinner :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Zen in any meaningful way, you need to meditate a lot -- I guess there's
</em><br>
no
<br>
<em>&gt; other way.  Personally I do NOT meditate a lot -- I used to meditate
</em><br>
<p>See, that is a concrete advice which contains information (you need to...)
<br>
but a zen master doesn't care for information he wants you to stop making
<br>
such a big fuss out of the difference between needing to and not needing to.
<br>
He would say that the best way is to not meditate at all, and then another
<br>
cooler guy would come up and say that you must meditate but not meditate,
<br>
then an older one would go still farther beyond categorization and propose
<br>
an absolutely unrelated concept such as wash your bowl, but right after
<br>
that, the coolest guy would amputate the younger guy's finger which would
<br>
completely wipe out the categorizing ideas that were formed in his mind, and
<br>
then he'd be enlightened and stop worrying about zen and go do something
<br>
productive
<br>
