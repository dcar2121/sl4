<p><em>&gt;Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've been thinking a lot about ethical theory, and I'm wondering if anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knows of an ethical theory that has the same kind of structure as Imre
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lakatos's theory of &quot;research programmes&quot; (in the philosophy of science).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I'm thinking of would be a theory of &quot;ethical systems&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical acts.  It would agree that any one act may be ethical or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depending on the ethical system within which you view the act.  But it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give some high-level criteria for judging ethical systems as wholes.
</em><br>
<p>At the risk of sounding like someone with a new hammer . . . . I would look 
<br>
into the basics of evolutionary psychology and biology to analyze 
<br>
ethics.  That area has resolved a lot of questions to my satisfaction, 
<br>
though some of the answers are extremely unsettling--like the discovery 
<br>
that evolution has put no limit on irrational behavior in wars.
<br>

<br>
<p>The genes which lead to our feelings about what are thought of as good 
<br>
ethics/morals were shaped by our long evolutionary history in small tribes 
<br>
where the tribe members were mostly relatives.  Positive ethics and morals 
<br>
are actions that promotes survival of your genes, particularly in 
<br>
Hamilton's sense of &quot;inclusive fitness.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sometimes personal survival was &quot;contraindicated&quot; as it was for Leonidas 
<br>
king of Sparta who commanded 300 Greeks in one of the most important 
<br>
battles in human history: Thermopylae where his small force held up over 
<br>
100,000 Persians for six days while the Greeks mustered the forces that 
<br>
eventually won at 
<br>
Marathon.  <a href="http://users.erols.com/nolan/heroes.htm">http://users.erols.com/nolan/heroes.htm</a>  Sometimes as in the 
<br>
story of Horatio at the Bridge they took chances and survived.
<br>
<p>You can see at once where the (shared) genes of the relatives of these 
<br>
heros did better than they would have without their sacrifice.
<br>
<p>Turning to less drastic situations, a major drive for humans is seeking 
<br>
status.  We have genetically build brain reward systems that are switched 
<br>
on by attention following actions such as killing an animal large enough to 
<br>
feed the whole tribe.  Status the residue from many such episodes of 
<br>
attention.
<br>
<p>But status is more complicated than just being a good hunter.  It indicates 
<br>
a person who can be trusted, who can be counted on to do what they say they 
<br>
will, who will not be the first to defect (&quot;nice&quot; in the terms defined in 
<br>
Evolution of Cooperation).   Status and power more likely accrue to those 
<br>
willing to delay gratification.
<br>
<p>It is easy to see why the reward circuits behind these traits evolved in 
<br>
cooperative social primates, as Henry Kissinger said, &quot;Power is the 
<br>
ultimate aphrodisiac.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, non-zero cooperative situations--such as cleaner fish--can 
<br>
be exploited.  There is a fish that looks like a cleaner and takes 
<br>
advantage of larger fish by biting a chunk out of them when they are 
<br>
expecting to be cleaned.  Even though this has nothing at all to do with 
<br>
human ethics, humans react to it with disgust.
<br>
<p>So while I have not worked out a framework for ethical theories, this might 
<br>
provide a pointer to a possible solution.
<br>

<br>
<p>PS as a complete coincidence, I was looking to talk to Ben today before I 
<br>
saw his postings here.
<br>
<p>PPS  As a goal for friendly AI, seeking status (good opinion) in the eyes 
<br>
of humans and other AIs might be one part of the design.
