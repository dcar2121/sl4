<p>
Hopefully I'm not rehashing old discussion here, but I don't remember
<br>
reading anything about this on any of the SIngularity-related pages I looked
<br>
through.  It seems to me that there would be a reasonable chance of the
<br>
Singularity ultimately resulting in... nothing.  Rather than there
<br>
necessarily being an explosion of technology sweeping over the face of the
<br>
planet, there seems a distinct possibility of an implosion; either through
<br>
the transhuman intelligence self-terminating (for whatever reason we can't
<br>
foresee now), or through it transcending into a place or state undetectable
<br>
by us, and choosing not to bring us along.  I guess I don't see any
<br>
particular reason why a transhuman intelligence would choose to do that, but
<br>
then again, I can see no reason why it wouldn't, either.  It's unknowable,
<br>
but still a legitimate possibility that should be acknowleged.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One argument supporting this, although weak and enormously speculative -
<br>
more just food for thought, I guess, is that it addresses the problem of
<br>
lack of detection of extraterrestrial life.  It always seemed intuitively
<br>
likely to me that there's probably intelligent life scattered all over the
<br>
universe, so one would think we'd have heard from somebody by now.  If a
<br>
transhuman intelligence did decide to bring us all along with it when it
<br>
crossed over to the other side, there will most likely be some compelling
<br>
fundmental logical or ethical reasons why it would choose to do so.  And if
<br>
it brings us along, why wouldn't it also bring along any other straggling
<br>
life on other planets?  Is there some sort of rule that a transhuman
<br>
omniscient intelligence can only bring along the inhabitants that created
<br>
it?  Possible, I guess, but it doesn't make that much intuitive sense.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So, given that we haven't been &quot;transitioned&quot; by an extra-solar
<br>
superintelligence already, that we still have pain and hunger and war here,
<br>
it would stand to reason that:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) there haven't been any intelligent races to attain a Singularity yet
<br>
anywhere in the universe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) there have been, and for whatever reason, they didn't see fit to
<br>
altruistically ease our suffering over here on Earth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Singularities don't typically bring their creator species with them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Again, hope this topic hasn't already been beaten to death or anything.
<br>
