<em>&gt; If I understand you correctly, you now seem to be saying something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Create goals, and rules that, if followed, will lead to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievement of these goals&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Create goals, and rules that, if followed, will lead to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievement of these goals, with as few side-effects as possible.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the goals and rules are typically presented in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined format rather than separately, but I'm not sure it does harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to separate them, and it provides some conceptual simplification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that these statements are more meta-ethical than your previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposal, which in this language was basically like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Create goal-rule systems that will be accepted&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your new statement is indeed more general, and is inclusive of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous one.  &quot;Will be accepted&quot; seems to add a very substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional condition to your new, very abstract meta-ethic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because, consider the &quot;ethical&quot; system:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DESTROY ALL LIVING BEINGS BY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) FIRST STUDYING ALL OTHER LIVING BEINGS SCIENTIFICALLY TO DETERMINE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HOW TO KILL THEM MOST EFFECTIVELY AND AT LOWEST RISK, AND THEN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; KILLING THEM 2) FINALLY, KILLING ONESELF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This posits a goal and also some rules for how to achieve the goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is rational and consistent.  It obeys your new, more abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-ethic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, in practice, it fails your former, more concrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost-meta-ethic, because at least among MOST OF the sentient beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know, it is unlikely to be accepted.  (Now and then various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychopaths have of course accepted this &quot;ethic&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, to me, by further abstracting your meta-ethic, you have moved from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- a very abstract formulation of &quot;the good&quot; [&quot;Create goal-rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems that will be accepted&quot;]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- a very abstract formulation of the general process of goal-seeking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seeking the good is a special case of goal-seeking in general....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your previous formulation succeeded in getting about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract as &quot;ethics&quot; can get.  Your new formulation is *so* abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems more &quot;meta&quot; than &quot;ethical&quot; ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### I agree with your points. Indeed, in evaluation of an ethical system, a
<br>
whole gamut of rules should be used.
<br>
<p>It's reasonable to start with the most meta-ethical rules of rationality,
<br>
the totally impersonal and subject-independent forms of thought we all share
<br>
(except when under the influence of mind-altering substances and the like),
<br>
rejecting incoherent systems, but not differentiating between the system you
<br>
mention above and systems more congenial to humans.
<br>
<p>Subsequently, an individual's emotional presets come into play, like a
<br>
Bayesian prior, rejecting systems based on their outcomes or content, to fit
<br>
with the individual's wishes (at least with some of them). This is where the
<br>
usual devotion to one's own survival comes into play, and objectivity can no
<br>
longer be sustained. Then there are lower-level preferences, emotional
<br>
foibles and tastes.
<br>
<p>And finally, the ethical system (its representation in the prefrontal
<br>
cortex) itself acts on the remaining cortex, adjusting emotional responses,
<br>
and even influencing habits of thought and notions of rationality, thus
<br>
closing the circle (or many-stranded braid) of recursive self-modification.
<br>
<p>As long as there are new neurons generated in your subventricular zone,
<br>
prepare to be surprised with what happens in your own mind. As for myself, I
<br>
could have hardly imagined becoming who I am now, compared to who I was a
<br>
scant 25 years ago. An enemy of the International Space Station, budding
<br>
oenophile, and anti-environmentalist anti-democrat.... 'Nuff said.
<br>
<p>Rafal
<br>
<p>PS. Please do not take my last sentence above as bait for starting
<br>
non-sl4-level exchanges :-)
