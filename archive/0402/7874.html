Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### These two quotes from separate posts jibe with what I think about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial problem you posited, the description of methods for evaluation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical systems in the abstract, a metaethics. Metaethics would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of the qualia of desire and the application of these qualia to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation of outcomes - otherwise it would be identical to ethics itself.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you have expressed very well what I would like to see a &quot;metaethics&quot;
<br>
be...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet, most of the discussion so far focused on what we (or imaginary beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the Buddha AI or Friendly AI) might think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as tools for achieving goals that suit our fancy, such as joyous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth, enlightenment, the intellectual pleasure associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictions in thinking (consistency), etc - in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confining itself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer-dependent ethics.
</em><br>
<p>I agree -- rather than a true meta-ethics, something like &quot;joyous growth&quot; is
<br>
in fact a *maximally abstracted ethical principle*.  As compared to
<br>
particular ethical rules like &quot;don't kill people&quot;, this is moving in the
<br>
direction of a meta-ethic, but it's still not a meta-ethic...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me first observe that as you write above, a meta-statement can be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the overall goal of science - although instead of Popper's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; injunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say &quot;Create conjectures that come true&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously, Popper intentionally avoided this phrasing to avoid quibbles
<br>
about the philosophy of &quot;truth&quot;... your phrasing is fine with me though...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can we use the above observations for deriving a metaethics by analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to metascience, without direct recourse to desires and ethics itself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we could begin by making the metaethical statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Formulate rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which will be accepted&quot; (although this statement is actually a high-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link in a very long-term recursive mental process, rather than a starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical premise).
</em><br>
<p>That's interesting.  It's a little deeper than it seems at first, and I need
<br>
to think about it more.
<br>
<p>At first it seems a pure triviality, but then you realize what the
<br>
preconditions are, in order for the statement to be meaningful.  For &quot;be
<br>
accepted&quot; to be meaningful, one needs to assume there is some mind or
<br>
community of minds that has the intelligence and the freedom to accept or to
<br>
not accept.  So one is implicitly assuming the existence of mind and
<br>
freedom.  So your rule is really equivalent to
<br>
<p>&quot;Ensure that one or more minds with some form of volition exist, and then
<br>
formulate rules that these minds will 'freely' choose to accept&quot;
<br>
<p>If we define happiness_* (one variant of the vague notion of &quot;happiness&quot;) as
<br>
&quot;the state of mind a volitional agent assumes when it's obtained what it
<br>
wants&quot;, then your rule is really equivalent to
<br>
<p>&quot;Ensure that one or more minds with some form of volition exist, and then
<br>
formulate rules that these minds will 'freely' choose to accept, because
<br>
they assess that accepting these rules will bring them an acceptable level
<br>
of happiness_*&quot;
<br>
<p>My point in tautologously unfolding your rule in this way, is to show that
<br>
(as you obviously realize) it contains more than it might at first appear
<br>
to...
<br>
<p>However, the shortcoming it has, is that it doesn't protect against minds
<br>
being stupid and self-delusional.  Volitional agents may accept something
<br>
even if it's bad for them in many senses.  (This is because happiness_* is
<br>
not the only meaningful sense of happiness).
<br>
<p>The problem is that &quot;to accept&quot; is a vague and somewhat screwy notion,
<br>
particularly when you're dealing with  minds that are stupid and
<br>
self-conflicted (like most human minds).  Just because a human says &quot;I
<br>
accept X&quot; doesn't mean that all parts of them accept X -- it just means that
<br>
the subsystems that's grabbed control of the mouth says &quot;I accept X.&quot;  It
<br>
also doesn't mean they really understand what X means -- they may accept X
<br>
out of some dumb misunderstanding of what the consequences of X will be.
<br>
Acceptance becomes more and more meaningful, the smarter and more self-aware
<br>
the acceptor becomes.
<br>
<p>And this is where &quot;growth&quot; seems to play a role, if you interpret &quot;growth&quot;
<br>
as meaning &quot;minds becoming less stupid and self-delusional over time.&quot;
<br>
<p>So I want to say something like
<br>
<p>&quot;Iteratively create rule-sets that will be accepted, by a community of minds
<br>
that are increasingly intelligent and self-aware&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, you could argue that this veers further away from being a pure
<br>
meta-ethic.  Or, you could argue that &quot;accepting a rule&quot; means more for a
<br>
mind that is more intelligent and self-aware, so that it actually makes your
<br>
meta-ethic more powerful and meaningful.
<br>
<p>But of course my modified version is basically a variant of my Principle of
<br>
Joyous Growth -- since I have growth in there in the form of &quot;increasing
<br>
intelligence and self-awareness&quot;, and &quot;joyousness&quot; in the form of
<br>
happiness_*.
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben G
