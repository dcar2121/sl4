Hi,
<br>
<p>A brief essay that integrates some of the various ideas I've been posting
<br>
lately...
<br>
<p>(I can feel my recent bout of philosophy-disease about to pass though --
<br>
guess I'll be getting back to technical work!  Of course there is some
<br>
cross-pollination though... I started thinking about free will and ethics
<br>
and such due to some issues that were coming up in my current revision of
<br>
some chapters of the Novamente book... a revision which is going quite
<br>
slowly due to my greater focus on the actual Novamente system development
<br>
and its applications...)

<p>Growth, Choice and Joy
<br>
<p>Toward a Precise Definition of a Universal Ethical Principle
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p><p>In my recent essay Encouraging a Positive Transcension (Goertzel, 2004a), I
<br>
proposed an ethical principle of “Voluntary Joyous Growth” – which holds
<br>
basically that a good ethical system is one that tries to balance the three
<br>
factors of choice, joy and growth.   Defining these three concepts is not
<br>
easy – they’re all a bit slippery, and each one conceals a vast mass of
<br>
ambiguity, subtlety and human history.  This brief note indicates my line of
<br>
thinking regarding the definition of these concepts in terms of (human and
<br>
AI) psychology.
<br>
<p>I note that, in order to impart an ethic to another mind (AI, human,
<br>
whatever), explicit definitions are of limited use.  Examples are more
<br>
important, and most important of all are the collective exploration of
<br>
scenarios – living and working through the ethic in “real life.”  But
<br>
nevertheless, explicit definitions can be of some value in guiding these
<br>
more practical and essential aspects of ethics.
<br>
<p>Growth is the simplest of the three basic principles.  I conceive growth as
<br>
the creation of more and more pattern.  If one defines a simplicity measure,
<br>
one can mathematically define the “intensity” of patterns (Goertzel, 1997),
<br>
thus quantifying what it means to have more and more pattern.  Furthermore,
<br>
if one accepts the theory of consciousness I’ve presented in (Goertzel,
<br>
2004b), then more intense patterns correspond to more intense qualia, so
<br>
that more patterns means more experience.  So growth means that the universe
<br>
becomes more aware.
<br>
<p>Choice is a little more complicated: choice, as I analyze it in (Goertzel,
<br>
2004c), has to do with the maintenance within intelligent systems of a
<br>
“virtual multiverse model” of the universe, in which multiple potential
<br>
future universes are studied, and this study is used to guide system
<br>
dynamics.  Valuing choice means valuing systems that guide their actions
<br>
using internal virtual multiverse models.  In essence, then, choice means
<br>
valuing the explicit embodiment of the multiverse within the universe.
<br>
Valuing choice means valuing virtual multiverse creation.
<br>
<p>In brief: More pattern is good, more experience is good, and multiplicity of
<br>
possibility is good.
<br>
<p>Choice helps with growth, because systems that embody virtual multiverses
<br>
tend to be good at generating new patterns and experiences.  Growth helps
<br>
with choice, because it takes fairly complex patterned systems to spawn
<br>
internal virtual multiverses.
<br>
<p>Joy – as I analyze it in my essay on emotions (Goertzel, 2004d) – is what
<br>
happens when a system finds itself overwhelmed with system-wide response
<br>
patterns that occur in reaction to the successful achievement of its goals.
<br>
More specifically, what I refer to there as “spiritual joy” is what happens
<br>
when a system is overwhelmed with a complex dynamical pattern that embodies
<br>
harmony between the inside of the system and the world in which the system
<br>
is embedded.
<br>
<p>Valuing joy means valuing systems setting goals and achieving them.  Valuing
<br>
spiritual joy means valuing the quest for harmony between self and universe.
<br>
<p>Achieving goals is good; harmony with the universe is good.
<br>
<p>Successful goal-achievement, in combination with the values of choice and
<br>
growth, means that the values of choice and growth are propagated through
<br>
the various systems of the universe via their goal-systems.
<br>
<p>Spiritual joy is a reflection of the basic dynamic by which the universe
<br>
seeks to overcome the paradox of one-versus-many (for a poetic exploration
<br>
of this theme, see Goertzel, 1998).  All is one, yet each thing is separate
<br>
and distinct – this paradox lies at the heart of being, and one view of our
<br>
ultimate purpose is to overcome this distinction and completely manifest
<br>
both our unique separateness and our oneness at all times.  Seeking harmony
<br>
between the interior and exterior worlds is the way to fufill this purpose.
<br>
<p>One point to note is that, in my perspective, all of these three values are
<br>
defined in terms of the concept of “pattern” – but “pattern” is not an
<br>
objective concept.  The mathematical theory of pattern defines pattern in
<br>
terms of a more elemental concept of “simplicity.”  Thus, judgments of the
<br>
amount of choice, growth or joy in the world are ultimately dependent on the
<br>
simplicity measure implicit in the judging mind.  This leads to an important
<br>
point regarding the creation of nonhuman AI’s valuing growth, choice and
<br>
joy.  If these AI’s measure simplicity very differently from humans, they
<br>
will perceive different things as growing, joyful and free.  Of course, it’s
<br>
not viable to restrict a superhuman AI to have the same simplicity measure
<br>
as humans – but at very least, one can ensure that one’s AI has a simplicity
<br>
measure that’s inclusive of human assessments of simplicity, in the sense
<br>
that whatever humans perceive as simple, so does it.  This means that the AI
<br>
will see choice, joy and growth where humans do – but may also see it in
<br>
other places.
<br>
<p>Finally, a cautionary note is in order: Of course, I don’t claim to have
<br>
fully explicated any of my three basic values – joy, growth or choice – but
<br>
I hope to have elucidated a little bit of what lies inside them.  There is
<br>
much more to discover.
