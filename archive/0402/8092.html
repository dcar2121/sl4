</em><br>
<p>It appears Marc experienced a significant &quot;Aha&quot;.
<br>
<p>The key point, it seems to me, is that he postulates a system of 
<br>
Universal Morality, along with more limited Personal Moralities, and 
<br>
that goodness is measured by how closely PMs fit UM.
<br>
<p>I agree with what I see as this essential point.  (Apologies to Marc if 
<br>
I've oversimplified or mis-represented his meaning.)
<br>
<p>Ultimately, an ethical system must be grounded in &quot;what works&quot;.  This is 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in accord with those who say it must be grounded in &quot;survival&quot; or 
<br>
those who say it must be grounded in &quot;what must ultimately be accepted.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: This is not to be confused with the &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; of 
<br>
concluding ought from is.
<br>
<p>An effective ethical system is similar to any application of science. 
<br>
For example, to build a radio, one must have some understanding of 
<br>
electronics and electromagnetic wave propagation.  To build a better 
<br>
radio, one must understand Shannon information theory.  To build an even 
<br>
better communication system, one must understand the behavior of 
<br>
communication networks in terms of social dynamics and more.
<br>
<p>These increasingly nested context levels can be usefully compared to 
<br>
nested levels of moral wisdom.  As organisms grow in the scope of their 
<br>
interactions with &quot;Other&quot;, they become increasingly aware of the variety 
<br>
and value of the choices available to them (apologies for the excessive 
<br>
anthropomorphizing to make the point simply.)  In this growth, they 
<br>
approach, but never reach, the &quot;Universal Morality&quot; that I think Marc is 
<br>
also referring to.
<br>
<p>Ethics has been, and continues to be confusing for two general reasons. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lack of understanding of evolved basis for human values
<br>
As human culture has evolved, we have invented a progression of ideas 
<br>
about morality, from simple self-survival to survival and growth of 
<br>
kin/tribe/nation/..., and a progression of justifications for these 
<br>
values in terms of our understanding at the time such as &quot;might makes 
<br>
right&quot; or &quot;god-given laws&quot; or humanistic &quot;self-evident rights&quot;, etc.  Up 
<br>
until now, there has been little understanding of how virtually all of 
<br>
our values are rooted in our evolved state.
<br>
<p>(2) Lack of understanding of human point of view as *within* the 
<br>
process, not external to the process
<br>
Here is where we approach the confusion over &quot;observer-centered&quot; and 
<br>
non-observer-centered&quot; morality.  Western science and society has 
<br>
inherited a concept of Self as independent from the ongoing processes of 
<br>
the universe. This permeates our language and philosophy to the extent 
<br>
that it is very difficult to think about these things. The confusion 
<br>
over qualia, the so-called &quot;hard problem of consciousness&quot;, etc., are 
<br>
based on a fundamentally misleading belief in &quot;cogito, ergo sum&quot; that is 
<br>
only now rising to the level of awareness in science that it is being 
<br>
poked at and questioned anew.  There is increasing awareness -- based on 
<br>
scientific experiments, experiences with mind-altering substances, 
<br>
mystical experiences -- that the conscious experience of self is not as 
<br>
fundamental as assumed and that the experience of direct perception of 
<br>
reality (including Self)is an illusion, but there's a long road ahead 
<br>
before enough people understand this such that a more enlightened and 
<br>
scientifically accurate view of Self will play a significant role in 
<br>
human thinking and policy.
<br>
<p>In the bigger picture, it is naive to look for simple answers to moral 
<br>
questions, because they always depend on context. In Ben's question 
<br>
above, about whether or not he should kill the intruders, the decision 
<br>
will of course be a result of the details known and the values applied 
<br>
in that particular instance.  More specifically, early morality would 
<br>
have been simple:  &quot;I will react with deadly force when I perceive a 
<br>
deadly attack on my family.&quot;  More recent moral systems allow that there 
<br>
might be some question of the right thing to do, based on the dominant 
<br>
social and religious influences along with the underlying evolved 
<br>
instinct to defend with deadly force.
<br>
<p>At a more highly evolved context level, one would consider a wider range 
<br>
of choices and values. Such as: A greater ability to differentiate 
<br>
between risk level, risk probability, risk immanence;  the psychological 
<br>
state of the intruders as well as one's self;  assessment of the 
<br>
relative intelligence of the intruders and capability to reason with 
<br>
them or to fool them into changing their intentions; balanced against 
<br>
greater awareness of the value of the intruder's life in terms of future 
<br>
interactions (may be positive or negative, but it is considered) and so on.
<br>
<p>I agree with Marc that a Universal Morality can be said to exist as 
<br>
something that be measured against and approached, with Personal 
<br>
Morality the approximation that we have to deal with.  It's identical 
<br>
with the concept of a true physical reality existing and being measured 
<br>
against, but subjective reality being all we can experience and deal 
<br>
with.  My point is that these are actually one and the same, and that a 
<br>
future ethical system will be based on a science of complexity dynamics 
<br>
rather than a specific set of rules to be followed.
<br>
<p>As with any branch of science, there will be fundamental axioms.  These 
<br>
might be popularly taken as &quot;moral truths&quot; with an almost mystical 
<br>
flavor such as &quot;Self and Other are distinct and both are essential&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;Growth is essential and is achieved via interaction between Self and 
<br>
Other&quot;, &quot;Growth is maximized via interaction with adjacent Other prior 
<br>
to distant other&quot;, &quot;Growth is maximized via increasing diversity of 
<br>
interaction&quot;, and so on. During a period of transition, these might be 
<br>
adopted by some as the basis of a new pseudo-religious morality, but in 
<br>
the bigger picture will be a closer approximation to &quot;what works.&quot;
