<em>&gt; &gt; has proposed &quot;abundance of positive qualia&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's not forget the &quot;elimination of negative qualia&quot; which is to me even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important.
</em><br>
<p>OK, let's talk about &quot;relative abundance of positive qualia&quot; then
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It seems that accepting &quot;positive qualia&quot; only as an abstract principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;leads to very obvious problems (its ideal universe is a single, mindless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;endless orgasm?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a universe looks free of challenge, free of gain, and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of evolved mammals it is not satisfactory. However I don't think any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of us can appreciate the meaning of an endless cosmic-scale orgasm. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think most would give up the small and temporary satisfactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth, discovery and progress, in order to remain in such a state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orgasmic, albeit thoughtless joy.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess that you have a different meta-principle, that's all... I
<br>
articulated two
<br>
<p>-- Joyous Growth
<br>
-- Human Stability
<br>
<p>and you're insisting on another
<br>
<p>-- Pure Joy
<br>
<p>In my approach the arbitrariness is pushed up from ethical systems to
<br>
guiding principles.  If you choose a different guiding principle than me, I
<br>
have no way to argue against you...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is reasonable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most intense qualia need a complex brain to exist. For example, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shrimp can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardly appreciate music at all. A child can rejoyce with simple tunes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps not cry listening to classical music. You need a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day citizen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is also smart and educated, a scientist, to appreciate complex dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems such as cells and AI. Whether a shrimp's orgasm feels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human orgasm, is completely beyond me :)
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting line of thinking, but it's very hard to pursue due to
<br>
the ill-understood nature of &quot;qualia.&quot;  We don't really have a good
<br>
understanding of &quot;qualia intensity&quot;.
<br>
<p>Your examples seem to be of &quot;qualia complexity&quot; as much as of intensity --
<br>
for instance, are you sure crying listening to classical music is *more
<br>
intense* than laughing listening to children's music?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maximization of positive qualia also includes finding out new positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia, for variety is just as important as quantity and intensity.
</em><br>
<p>Well, now you're moving back in the direction of &quot;Joyous Growth&quot; ... again,
<br>
it's not clear to me that &quot;diverse qualia&quot; are necessarily more INTENSE or
<br>
more POSITIVE than &quot;homogeneous qualia.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I can't compromise about are negative qualia...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, you've said you value diversity of qualia.  What if the only way to
<br>
achieve diversity of qualia is to admit some negative qualia into the mix?
<br>
<p>Also, what if the MAXIMUM INTENSITY of positive qualia is achievable only in
<br>
a universe where the AVERAGE VALENCE of qualia is near zero?  I.e., what if
<br>
universes in which lots of positive AND negative qualia exist, are the ones
<br>
in which the most intensely wonderful positive qualia exist?
<br>
<p>And, what if the AVERAGE INTENSITY of positive qualia is higher in universes
<br>
where SOME (perhaps not that many) negative qualia also exist?
<br>
<p>There are a lot of things about qualia we don't understand... particularly
<br>
when talking about the universe-wide system of interlocking qualia...
