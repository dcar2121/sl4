Title:  The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making
<br>
Author:  Scott Plous
<br>
ISBN:  0-07-050477-6
<br>
<p>/The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making/ (PJDM) is a book 
<br>
written for use as an introductory text to the study of human judgment 
<br>
and decision making.  Although aimed at college students, the book 
<br>
should be accessible to anyone who has been human for at least several 
<br>
years (if you are not a human but know humans or, worse yet, know *of* 
<br>
humans, you'll probably get bored of their silly antics).
<br>
<p>Unlike classic texts in this field, such as /Judgment under 
<br>
uncertainty:  Heuristics and biases/, this book is light on details of 
<br>
experiments and heavy on explanations.  Very rarely PJDM gets into 
<br>
trouble because the explanations seem to contradict established 
<br>
experimental results reported elsewhere (sorry, I didn't make a note 
<br>
when I saw it so I can't tell you where this happens in the book), but 
<br>
the reasons for this are not clear.  Otherwise, the book is a great way 
<br>
to get into the field, especially for laymen who are unable to decipher 
<br>
more technical writing.
<br>
<p>The book's primary failure is to address the origin of human deviations 
<br>
from normative models discussed.  There's the occasional offhand remark 
<br>
that people probably have heuristics and biases that don't conform to, 
<br>
say, Bayes's Theorem, but I don't recall any mention of evolution or 
<br>
other causes in the book.  Although this is something I expect from 
<br>
volumes of technical literature because papers try to be modular and 
<br>
avoid overstepping their grounds, I hoped that an introductory text 
<br>
would at least mention some further reading on the subject.
<br>
<p>Here's a list of the book's sections to give you an idea of topics 
<br>
covered:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section   I:  Perception, Memory, and Context
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section  II:  How Questions Affect Answers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section III:  Models of Decision Making
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section  IV:  Heuristics and Biases
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section   V:  The Social Side of Judgment and Decision Making
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section  VI:  Common Traps
<br>
<p>Each of these sections is relatively short, with no chapter longer than 
<br>
15 or 20 pages.  The writing is engaging and draws you along, bit by 
<br>
bit.  If you get tired, there are frequent section breaks, so this book 
<br>
can easily be read over many short sittings.  I highly recommend PJDM 
<br>
to anyone who is interested in human judgment and decision making but 
<br>
unable to obtain or decipher more technical works.
