They aren't cheap (around $3-4k per Gb these days), but prices are
falling and this is still a few times cheaper than getting a machine
that supports large RAM sizes directly. The bandwidth is also very high
(e.g. 3Gb/s), and these storage arrays typically have an array of
interfaces so that you can utilize the bandwidth available.  The
alternative would be hack a network of cheap PCs into a single address
space, but to actually achieve the same level of performance, it would
cost you pretty much the same amount of money as just buying the storage
array, and less convenient to boot.
