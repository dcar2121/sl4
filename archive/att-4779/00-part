For the first aid - it is definitly not so. And for the medicine as well, also not. The latest should be bigger, yes. Still very finite.

It's not. But even if it was, it doesn't mean, it is noncomputable.

That is my point. You can do GA with them - can't you? Just see, what the evolution is capable of. Needs a lot of computation - but so what, if you have it?

With GA? It's quite easy. But not the only possible way.
