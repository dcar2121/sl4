</em><br>
<p>The weakness is that I am not finished, and the part that must be &quot;taken on 
<br>
faith&quot; (leaving aside certain objections to your terminology) is that I 
<br>
shall ever finish.  An example:  In my lap right now is a spiral paper 
<br>
notebook whose showing page contains an incomprehensible doodle of lines, 
<br>
filled and empty boxes, and the words &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;CV&quot;, and &quot;Motie&quot;.  This is 
<br>
the debris of me trying to figure out how to describe Fred's preference 
<br>
that a Fred-similar system (say, a collective volition) make a decision, 
<br>
rather than a Motie (an alien with a nonhuman goal system).  I know how to 
<br>
describe this problem if Fred can exactly simulate CV and Motie to 
<br>
extrapolate their decisions, and then extrapolate the consequences and 
<br>
expected utility of CV and Motie's decisions; Fred can then simply choose 
<br>
directly, by proxy, as predictable as pressing a button.  But if Fred 
<br>
doesn't know the choices faced by CV and Motie, or Fred can't personally 
<br>
extrapolate the consequences of the choices, or if Fred has only an 
<br>
abstract model of CV and Motie, then it will take some new theory I haven't 
<br>
seen to give a step-by-step walkthrough of exactly how Fred computes his 
<br>
preference for CV-decision over Motie-decision.  It's a problem directly 
<br>
related to the difficulty I posted with Schmidhuber's Godel Machine.  I 
<br>
don't presently know the solution, and it must be &quot;taken on faith&quot;, as it 
<br>
were, that I ever shall know.  I may know by the end of this day, or by the 
<br>
end of this year, or one of the other six billion humans out there may have 
<br>
already solved the problem and I haven't read the paper, or perhaps this 
<br>
will be the challenge that ultimately defeats me and I shall never know at 
<br>
all, though I rather doubt it.
