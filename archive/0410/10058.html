<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ask of SIAI's donors:  Speak up, and hold your heads high without shame!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sequence of events: dug through email, dug through method of donation 
<br>
(never used paypal before (more on that later)), set up donation, dug 
<br>
through more emails,  now typing about it. :)
<br>
<p>Figured I might as well say my observations on some of the forces and 
<br>
such that had gone on in my mind that had delayed me from donating until 
<br>
now, not as un excuse, but simply under the theory of &quot;I am sufficiently 
<br>
similar to other people that the data may be useful toward figuring out 
<br>
what the hech is going on in our heads with regards to this, and what 
<br>
can be done with it.&quot;
<br>
<p>One thing is that for a long time I've been meaning to donate, not 
<br>
necceserally waiting &quot;until I have enough money&quot; or whatever, but more 
<br>
&quot;when I get around to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>ie &quot;don't feel like finding the donation page and so on now, will do it 
<br>
tomorrow&quot; etc..., forget, wash, rinse, repeat.
<br>
<p>A related really strange thing I've found going on is this: I can easily 
<br>
see that if someone had been going door to door or something collecting 
<br>
for SIAI (gedanken experiment, don't jump in about practicalities here. 
<br>
:)) I would have, and gleefully, immediately grabed a blob of cash and 
<br>
handed it over.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is a bystander effect thing though:
<br>
<p>What I noticed in myself, which is really strange, is I have this 
<br>
feeling that, well, I guess the best way to describe it is &quot;boy, it will 
<br>
be so much effort to actually go to the page, enter the credit card 
<br>
number, etc...&quot;
<br>
<p>WTF? There is no huge effort here, when I'm doing it, I don't experience 
<br>
any kind of (de)illusion that is hard. I know rationally that this is 
<br>
not any effort or anything, so why does a part of me have the feeling 
<br>
that setting up the payment would be &quot;ugh... so much effort... later...&quot;?
<br>
<p>Methinks there are some really screwey psychological things going on 
<br>
here. I mean, even screwier than some of the stuff that's already been 
<br>
mentioned. (or maybe that just happens to me... All I'll say on this is 
<br>
that it affects many things in my life... would already be a physics 
<br>
grad student if I didn't have so many incompletes (not due to 
<br>
incomplrehension or such, but due to undone lab reports mostly. wheeee. 
<br>
Well, if there is anyone else that's noticed some of these mental 
<br>
patterns, well, let's figure out what in the name of all that is Baysian 
<br>
is going on and how to fix it. :))
<br>
<p>Also, another pattern that I think I've noticed in myself sometimes 
<br>
would be something that could be described by &quot;I ought to donate... but 
<br>
I wouldn't be donating too much right now... I can't make a small 
<br>
donation to this, this is IMPORTANT(tm)...&quot; so I end up not making a 
<br>
small donation.... or any other. And yes, I don't need to be told that 
<br>
this is not rational behavior, but there it is. :)
<br>
<p>As far as the original message/minicampaign, one other pattern I 
<br>
noticed. &quot;hrm... telling me about all these psych strings that delay 
<br>
donations and such... hrm.. trying to get me to donate... hrm... getting 
<br>
closer to donating... but if I do I'll have 'fallen for it.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Dang it! Even though it was just helping me actually do something I've 
<br>
been wanting to do, there was a bit of that. Still did get me to donate, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(yay! :)) but, for the sake of increasing the effectiveness of future 
<br>
requests for donations, perhaps see if there's any obvious way of fixing 
<br>
that reaction and such?
<br>
<p>Oh, also with regards to the Paypal thing. I'm not claiming it was a 
<br>
reason I had delayed, just that there have been many reports of problems 
<br>
with Paypal. If this is practical, perhaps set up a way to give 
<br>
donations online without having to go through paypal? I do know I'm not 
<br>
the only one that's hesitant about using them.
