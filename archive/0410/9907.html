</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics needed.  And in fact this explanation is *better* than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics explanation.
</em><br>
<p>Solomonoff induction is Bayesian probability plus a distribution over
<br>
priors that says that explanations with lower Kolmogorov complexity are
<br>
more probable, formalizing Occam's Razor.
<br>
<p>Solomonoff induction or even decent approximations of Solomoff induction
<br>
are intractable for human minds, because very simple explanations can be
<br>
intractably expensive to compute all the way out to actual predictions. 
<br>
Physics is extremely simple (in Kolmogorov complexity) and explains 
<br>
literally everything, but physics is unimaginably expensive to compute.
<br>
<p>Now, you, a human, can come up with a short explanation that is more
<br>
cheaply computable than physics.  And this explanation seems good to you,
<br>
since it enables you to actually compute a prediction and manipulate
<br>
reality, where the underlying equations of physics are intractable to you.
<br>
But reality itself does not care about your cheapo explanation.  Reality
<br>
cares only about the explanation that the universe itself uses, that
<br>
incredibly intractable process of quantum mechanics.  The computation you
<br>
have in your mind that lets you cheaply predict your nose is not part of
<br>
your nose; it exists only in the particles making up your brain.  Your
<br>
actual nose uses only physics.  And indeed, could you pay the cost of
<br>
computing, the equations of quantum mechanics would give you a more precise
<br>
(better calibrated) predictive distribution over the possible locations of
<br>
your nose, than anything you could do with mere explanation.  Even if the
<br>
explanation is simpler in the Kolmogorov sense, and not just cheaper to 
<br>
compute, reality itself still doesn't care about anything but physics.
<br>
<p>That's it.  That's the whole fuss silly philosophers make over reductionism 
<br>
and holism.  A computationally intractable physical phenomenon can have 
<br>
regularities that enable human minds to produce &quot;explanations&quot;, but the 
<br>
explanations are still only in the mind, not in the underlying physics. 
<br>
The explanations are not anything above or beyond the physics.  They are 
<br>
not anything extra that must be added to the physics.  They are just 
<br>
cheaper ways for humans to compute (almost) the same results.
<br>
<p>To understand a physical process is to absorb enough regularities in it 
<br>
that you can predict and manipulate it in real time.  To understand is to 
<br>
approximate-well-enough, using vastly less computing power than would be 
<br>
required for the best possible prediction.  But there is nothing mysterious 
<br>
about understanding.  There is nothing in &quot;wetness&quot;, as you call your cheap 
<br>
approximation, that is not already present in the water molecules - or, if 
<br>
there were, it would be an error of your approximation.  For the water 
<br>
molecules do not know that they are &quot;wet&quot;.
<br>
<p>Philosophers get all weirded out about how water appears to have this 
<br>
magical additional property of wetness.  This error is yet another case of 
<br>
Jaynes's &quot;Mind Projection Fallacy&quot;.  Philosophers think as if explanations 
<br>
were somehow real things, instead of explanations being cheap imperfect 
<br>
approximations of physics.  A human may discover the additional cheap 
<br>
approximation of wetness, and this will be an additional thought that was 
<br>
not there before.  But the map is not the territory.  The water molecules 
<br>
themselves are just water molecules, and have no additional property of 
<br>
wetness.  The apparent &quot;additional property&quot; exists in your explanation of 
<br>
the water, playing no role in the physics of the water itself.  The thought 
<br>
of &quot;wetness&quot; exists in you as a thought distinct from your thought about 
<br>
the low-level physics of water molecules.  But water molecules do not have 
<br>
an additional property of wetness apart from their low-level physics.  The 
<br>
notion of a &quot;holistic&quot; behavior is a property of a map, not a territory.

<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, it does. If wetness wasn't physically implementable, it would not

<em>&gt; You say that only the physical world &quot;exists&quot; -- but what is this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical world?  It's an abstraction that you learned about through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversations and textbooks.  I.e., it's a structure in your mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you built out of simpler structures in your mind -- simpler structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponding to sensations coming in through sights, sounds and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can take a point of view that the physical world is primary and your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind is just a consequence of the physical domain.  Or you can take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view that mind is primary and the very concept of the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is something you learn and build based on various mental experiences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither approach is more correct than the other; each approach seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be useful for different purposes.  I have found that a simultaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of both views is useful in the context of AI design.
</em><br>
<p>This from someone who accuses *me* of mere philosophy.
