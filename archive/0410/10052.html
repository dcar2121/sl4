<p>
First, I'd like to state that I also donated to the SIAI today.  Many of my
<br>
reasons for doing so are similar to Robin's.  Moreover, the potential of
<br>
SIAI, even assuming a slim probability of success, is so mind-bogglingly
<br>
massive that it seems insane not to take a supportive action that has
<br>
virtually no impact on my own life; a few more nights out at the movies
<br>
doesn't stack up too well against the chance of eternal godhood (or whatever
<br>
your personal vision of a successful singularity might be.)
<br>
<p>However, I am in total agreement with Wes; in fact, I think that ANY method
<br>
of raising funds is a good idea, so long as it happens faster than sitting
<br>
around and waiting for donations to amass.  I might draw the line at running
<br>
drugs across international borders, but only because my human side is more
<br>
persuasive than my rationalist side.
<br>
<p>I actually derive my income from playing poker online.  The amount of money
<br>
available there for very little expenditure of effort is amazing.  Assuming
<br>
you are a competent poker player and competent programmer (let alone a
<br>
programmer with AI expertise), creating a poker-playing bot is a walk in the
<br>
park.  I was able to write one that would break even online in about a day.
<br>
I've little doubt that with some tweaking, it could generate significant
<br>
profit.  (I did, however, have some moral objections to continuing any
<br>
further on the project.)
<br>
<p>My point is not &quot;The SIAI should flood the internet with poker-playing AIs,
<br>
with moral and possibly legal repercussions&quot;, but rather that this is a
<br>
large and rich world, and I am VERY skeptical that the best
<br>
effort-to-raising-capital ratio for the SIAI would be found through relying
<br>
solely on donors.  There are a zillion ways for intelligent people to make
<br>
relatively easy (or fast) money.
<br>
<p>It also occurs to me that there are a great many millionaires in the world.
<br>
Rather than soliciting donations piecemeal from average-income enthusiasts,
<br>
isn't it possible that time would be better spent targeting well-off
<br>
eccentrics and shooting for a couple million in one clean sweep?  There are
<br>
plenty of people rich enough to not even notice that kind of money, or are
<br>
already looking for tax-deductable charities to dump it on.  A lot of them
<br>
are in the tech sector, too, so I would imagine they're be more predisposed
<br>
to this kind of thing.
<br>
<p>At any rate, my two cents: at least seriously *consider* possible
<br>
fundraising alternatives.

<p>Indeed, I recall a recent news article about AIs playing online poker:

<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6002298/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6002298/</a>
<br>
<p>Similar projects could serve as both developmental platforms for the SIAI to
<br>
test research AND help to finance it.  Even though the immediate result
<br>
wouldn't be the desired end result, a successful project like this would
<br>
demonstrate the competence of the SIAI in the field and perhaps generate
<br>
some publicity.  I'm personally not an AI expert, and am hesitant to donate
<br>
money to an AI research institute that doesn't appear to have any record of
<br>
publication and citation in refereed scientific journals (although that's
<br>
not neccessarily a bad thing, it simply makes judging the
<br>
credibility/viability/productivity of the institute more difficult).
