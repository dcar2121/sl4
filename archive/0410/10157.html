<p>
Something of a meta-message, not on the topic of SL4 but on the topic
<br>
of some recent SL4 list gibberish...
<br>
<p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html</a>
<br>
<p>So far, a quick glance at Marc's most recent e-mail provides 87
<br>
points. And this isn't even taking into account the gibberish in the
<br>
earlier &quot;philosophical schemata&quot; e-mail, which would undoubtedly add
<br>
quite a few more. Mentafex indeed. How many points does one need
<br>
before sniper-moderation comes into effect, exactly?
<br>
<p>(#15) 10 points for each statement along the lines of &quot;I'm not good at
<br>
math, but my theory is conceptually right, so all I need is for
<br>
someone to express it in terms of equations&quot;.
<br>
[&quot;Not only is my theory a theory of FAI, it is also a kind of 'Theory
<br>
of Everything'. Of course, fundamental principles are one thing, hard
<br>
math is quite another.&quot;]
<br>
<p>(#18)  10 points for each favorable comparison of yourself to
<br>
Einstein, or claim that special or general relativity are
<br>
fundamentally misguided (without good evidence).
<br>
[&quot;What I have here is analogous to Einstein's 'Equivalence Principle'
<br>
of General Relativity&quot;...]
<br>
<p>(#3) 2 points for every statement that is clearly vacuous. (UCxPC=Q)
<br>
<p>(#10) 10 points for beginning the description of your theory by saying
<br>
how long you have been working on it.
<br>
[Ben asked for a description, reply began &quot;well, a long while back I
<br>
had a few ideas...&quot; Possibly contestable. Maybe I'll ask Baez to
<br>
arbitrate.]
<br>
<p>(#14) 10 points for each new term you invent and use without properly
<br>
defining it.
<br>
[Twice, for Universal Cognition and for Personal Cognition. Benefit of
<br>
the doubt as to whether the term Qualia is being used properly.]
<br>
<p>(#35)  50 points for claiming you have a revolutionary theory but
<br>
giving no concrete testable predictions.
<br>
[If claims that one has formulated a Theory of Everything don't count
<br>
here, what would? Exactly.]
<br>
<p>Start: negative 5.
