<em>&gt; 80% of all new businesses fail because of 80% of all people starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new businesses are new TO business  -- the distribution of who fails is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from random.  For people that have been around long enough to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figured out how it all works in practice (i.e. been through a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failures or marginal businesses), it seems that they have something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around an 80% *success* rate.  There is a learning curve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I can't speak to these exact statistics, but I think there's a great deal to
<br>
what you're saying here about novice entrepreneurs. The learning curve can
<br>
be critical, and is often helped along by painful lessons individuals may
<br>
have experienced in previous attempts. Or at least witnessed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is one of the reasons that it is always a good idea to hand over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reins to a competent and experienced executive if you are new-ish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the game if possible.  First-timers hate to do this because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel like they are losing control of &quot;their&quot; business, and they usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn the lesson the hard way by making all the same mistakes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first-timers do.  If you can't pull off both attracting competent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executive talent and giving up control of the company, you probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be betting the farm on a venture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is an interesting point, though I think you could add that with some
<br>
kinds of smaller business ventures (such as purchasing and renting out a
<br>
duplex for significantly more than the cost of taxes, upkeep, and general
<br>
property management), the learning curve isn't always so sharp. There are
<br>
definitely small start-ups that don't require you to get a seasoned, Harvard
<br>
or Yale-trained executive mastermind to run your pretzel stand, for example.
<br>
<p>Having said that, I've noticed that the venture I'm in has benefited greatly
<br>
from having a number of experienced people around -- generally speaking, a
<br>
team where just about everyone is extremely experienced and/or talented at
<br>
some key element of the business (the law, our specific field, the
<br>
underlying technology, the needs of our primary customers, revolutionary
<br>
product development, etc). We managed to start this company with relatively
<br>
little money but with several key people willing to put in enormous sweat
<br>
equity. How?
<br>
<p>We just handed out significant shares of the stock to our first generation
<br>
of key participants and went on from there. We've had enough stockholders
<br>
who were willing to work on this project either full-time or part-time over
<br>
the past three years to get things off the ground, and our prospects are now
<br>
looking quite bright. (Of course, business in inherently unpredictable, so
<br>
we'll just have to see.)
<br>
<p>My point is that if someone here were interested in starting an
<br>
AI-development or related business, there are avenues for attracting talent
<br>
that don't necessarily require bucketloads of up-front money. Just a
<br>
thought.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people are neither careful enough nor disciplined enough (or lucky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough) to be successful in business the first time around.  My first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts at starting companies were ridiculous failures.  I haven't had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a venture fail in many years (though some never really took off), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would *still* defer to a really experienced and competent executive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the opportunity to do so in a business.  After all this time, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most I can really say is that I am confident that when I start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; businesses they are unlikely to crash and burn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Though I think you have a point about a &quot;really experienced and competent
<br>
executive,&quot; I think you have to be careful about defining such a person. You
<br>
may have a gal/guy who's an absolutely terrific CEO of Exxon, but who is
<br>
utterly lost in trying to launch a small software company. Or you could have
<br>
someone who is great at managing a huge, status quo company but who lacks
<br>
the imagination or daring to try and disrupt existing markets with a new
<br>
innovation that renders old product lines (and the companies that produce
<br>
them) obsolete.
<br>
<p>Again, it all depends on what you're after. How does all this apply to an AI
<br>
research institute dealing with its own personnel issues? Well, it may not,
<br>
but it's worth remembering that if you do have the money to hire whoever you
<br>
need onto your staff, some place like the Singularity Institute might find
<br>
it useful to have one very effective manager actually running the
<br>
organization (at least in terms of the distracting details) while someone
<br>
like Mr. Yudkowsky focuses on basic research and the big picture.
