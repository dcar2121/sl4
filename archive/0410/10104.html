<em>&gt; waste of time to work on a project purely for profit, the benefits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI in terms of funding gains more than outweigh the time 'wasted',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my opinion... making such profit-seeking a moral imperative.
</em><br>
<p><p>At one time I was more of this opinion.  Then I examined my own 25 
<br>
years of commercial programming continuously believing that some day I 
<br>
would get far enough ahead or be around at the right IPO so that I 
<br>
would have the funds to do what I really believe is best for me to do 
<br>
with whatever remained of my life.    Bootstrapping is of course more 
<br>
direct than this.  But one must be careful not to get so involved in 
<br>
&quot;business&quot; that one forgets the real goal or has almost no time for it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion what is critically required is that Eliezer and others 
<br>
do precisely what is truly of maximal benefit and that they be 
<br>
supported in doing so regardless of whether that work has mostly inline 
<br>
marketable consequences or not.    The marketable consequences that are 
<br>
not dangerous should be exploited and some of the profit fed back in.  
<br>
But this is not likely the best use of Eliezer's time to obtain maximal 
<br>
benefit.
<br>
<p>A real strong evangelist or set of such is needed.   That individual or 
<br>
group can &quot;break it down&quot; to a case that wins the support of sufficient 
<br>
contributions.   Raising that kind of money is very doable we just 
<br>
don't have the right evangelist or evangelical approach yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine if a sub-unit of SIAI (or WTA, etc.) were devoted to *becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich* to help the cause; if a group can't *find* millionaires to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donate huge sums of money to its morally-critical campaign, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behooves that group to *create* millionaires to donate huge sums of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, if at all possible (and intelligent, motivated/passionate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard-working people quite plausibly can create millions if they set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their minds to it.)
</em><br>
<p>That is a round-about approach.  Millionaires aplenty already exist.  
<br>
Angel investors exists.  A faster approach is to learn how or find 
<br>
someone who knows how to successfully win them to the cause.  Nor 
<br>
should the efforts be limited to the relatively wealthy.  Many churches 
<br>
attempt to extract 10% in tithes.   If mystical (and usually watered 
<br>
down even for mysticism) believe systems can demand that much without 
<br>
everyone leaving in outrage, can we not donate so much as what we spend 
<br>
on our DSL or Cable TV a month?    If we cannot do we even honestly 
<br>
expect people to believe that even we take the problem seriously or 
<br>
believe there is any possibility of solution?
<br>
<p>I certainly have my own doubts about the current approach.  But I 
<br>
believe strongly that the problems we face are dire and urgent and that 
<br>
conventional solutions are not adequate.  I know that increased 
<br>
effective intelligence is required.   That doesn't mean that only SAI 
<br>
is a possible solution.   It is an attempt at a solution.   As such it 
<br>
deserves to be supported.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;While saving the world is, indeed, an infinite return on investment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a wiki posting is generally considered a poor return on an investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 6 months of donations.  For the foreseeable future, I see SIAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing more of the latter than the former.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This reminds me of a another approach to garnering research support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that SIAI has apparently eschewed and left me wondering why:  instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Wiki and intelligence.org publications, why not submit papers on AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and AI ethics / existential risk to peer-reviewed publications and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conferences? It seems to me there are a number of good ideas, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer is a sufficiently good writer of these ideas, to succeed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting a lot of work into the consciousness of academia (Artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence / Computing and Philosophy / Ethics &amp; Applied Ethics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Science &amp; Technology Studies, etc.). And from there, Eliezer et al.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would a decent shot at research positions in academia, basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; providing much of the funding toward research that is currently being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scrounged around for. Even a trade-off such as being required to teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI or ethics to undergraduates sounds worthwhile, esp. considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme-spreading one could do by devoting part of class time to SAI/FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Every academic I know tells of the death by a thousand cuts that is the 
<br>
academic life.  But I will defer to Dr. Ben Goertzel for a more 
<br>
considered opinion on whether academic standing, papers, symposia and 
<br>
so on leads to more funding and research opportunity for doing SAI.
