<em>&gt; A start toward this would be for Eliezer to write a systematic treatment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his ideas about FAI in the form of a (technical or semi-technical book), to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be published by a typical academic press.  It's easier to get eccentric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas published in book form than in academic journals, because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refereeing process is different.
</em><br>
<p>I have a suspicion that this would take a downright amazing amount of time 
<br>
- on the order of four years or more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may seem odd to recommend paper publication of ideas that are already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; online, but the fact is that paper publication is taken more seriously by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the powers that be.  And I think that the process of putting one's ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a more &quot;permanent&quot; form often forces one to tighten up one's lines of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that what &quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot; was for? 
<br>
It worked, too, but it took four times as long as I allocated.  And as for 
<br>
&quot;permanent&quot; form, it goes without saying that two years later I was 
<br>
sneering at the primitive naivete of my own theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, there are plenty of European universities that will give a PhD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on research only, no coursework.  After publishing a treatise on FAI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might well be possible to get a PhD on the basis of that book.  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some particular European university connections that might be helpful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this regard.  I also believe I could help with the publication of the book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I know a few editors at academic presses.
</em><br>
<p>Hm.  Sounds like a lot of conjunctive probabilities...
<br>
<p>...still, tempting enough that I might take you up on it, but only if the 
<br>
Singularity Institute completely bogged down otherwise.  It's the huge 
<br>
amount of time required that's the problem.  I'm a slow writer, and I seem 
<br>
to become a slower writer as I become a better writer.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't *do* FAI, I'd update LOGI to incorporate Bayes and information 
<br>
theory, and write the book on the evolutionary psychology of human 
<br>
&quot;significantly more generally applicable&quot; intelligence.  If I wanted 
<br>
academic respect and a PhD, I'd write on a subject that I already fully 
<br>
understood, people were already interested in, and that was at least 
<br>
theoretically possible to explain.
<br>
<p>But oh, the time required!  Gobs and endless gobs of time!  I shudder just 
<br>
to think of it.  And *it might still not work*, and I'd *still* have to do 
<br>
all the FAI theory and I wouldn't be as young when I did.  All my life has 
<br>
taught me the value of not being distracted.  That's why I account it a 
<br>
last resort.
<br>
<p>I wish I wasn't such a slow writer.  It would open up more options.  But 
<br>
that's not something I've figured out how to change.
