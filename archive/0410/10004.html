<p>It looks to me like this would require a special amendment to Schmidhuber's 
<br>
architectural specification - Schmidhuber spoke of proving only that the 
<br>
code modification had greater expected utility.  Even if you proved the new 
<br>
system would do exactly what the old system did, only faster, it would not 
<br>
follow that the new system was an *improvement* - it might be generating 
<br>
dreadfully wrong answers even faster - unless you included some kind of 
<br>
assumption about the system working.  For example, suppose that we start 
<br>
with a Godel Machine that, meta-level aside, starts with an object-level 
<br>
program that repeatedly presses a button delivering the equivalent of a 
<br>
nasty electrical shock.  If the meta-level speeds up the object level so 
<br>
that we get nasty electrical shocks twice as fast, this is not an expected 
<br>
utility improvement.  If you build the assumption into the meta-system that 
<br>
the object-system works, this is good knowledge if the object-system *does* 
<br>
work, but not otherwise.  Correspondingly, if the meta-system does work, 
<br>
but the meta-system cannot prove that the meta-system works, you will need 
<br>
to include an assumption in the meta-system that the meta-system works. 
<br>
Even presuming the basic strategy is correct, the next question is how to 
<br>
do this without trashing the meta-system due to Godel and Lob.
<br>
<p>One way that might succeed in salvaging the Godel-Machine formalism would 
<br>
be to isolate the rewriting of the theorem verifier from the rewriting of 
<br>
the rest of the Godel Machine.  When rewriting the remainder of the Godel 
<br>
Machine, we try to prove that the remainder rewrite improves expected 
<br>
utility, assuming that the verifier admits correct object-level theorems 
<br>
(I'm not sure you can get away with this).  When rewriting the verifier, 
<br>
the verifier has to pass a different test: proving that the new verifier 
<br>
accepts only theorems that are admissible under the old verifier.  I.e., 
<br>
any acceptable proof according to the new verifier, is an acceptable proof 
<br>
according to the old verifier.  We would not concern ourselves with whether 
<br>
the proofs are correct - no object-level questions of expected utility - 
<br>
just with proving an embedding of the new formal system in the old formal 
<br>
system.  But this requires a compartmentalization of the Godel Machine; it 
<br>
can no longer rewrite every part of itself using the same criterion of 
<br>
success, and there must be several hardcoded, non-modifiable aspects of the 
<br>
architecture (such as the interface between the proof verifier and the rest 
<br>
of the system).  This would weaken Schmidhuber's original claim that the 
<br>
Godel Machine was fully self-modifying.  It would also require some kind of 
<br>
diagonalization in the old formal system so that it can possess a full copy 
<br>
of itself, and prove embedding of the new formal system in &quot;the old formal 
<br>
system plus a copy of itself as an embedding criterion&quot;.  You'd have to 
<br>
prove an embedding of a new diagonalized formal system in the old 
<br>
diagonalized formal system.  This is all new math that doesn't appear in 
<br>
Schmidhuber's original paper, nor anywhere else I have yet encountered in 
<br>
reading about reflective formal systems.  And since I have not formalized 
<br>
this entire argument, the whole thing could contain some catastrophic flaw 
<br>
that isn't apparent in verbal discussion.
<br>
<p>Hence my request to see if there was anything on this in the existing 
<br>
literature.
<br>
<p>I would not be satisfied with the solution as given above for a true seed 
<br>
AI.  It seems to me that the difficulty with the Godel Machine reflects a 
<br>
very deep AI challenge, and I gave the example of the Godel Machine only to 
<br>
clarify the nature of the challenge, not to ask how to patch the Godel 
<br>
Machine specifically.  Hardcoding that all new proof-verifiers must embed 
<br>
their admissible sentences in the set of admissible sentences of the old 
<br>
proof-verifier is an interesting solution, but not as interesting as, say, 
<br>
an AI that could ponder the relative merit of intuitionistic versus 
<br>
classical mathematics, which is where I think the deep problem is heading.
