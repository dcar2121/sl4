<em>&gt; Marc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it would be great if you'd summarize your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas on AI, FAI, morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and life in general into a crisp &amp; coherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; document, and post the URL to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can see you've done a lot of deep thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these issues, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often hard for  me to piece together your ideas from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your various posts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a coherent point of view...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben G
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, a long while back I had a few ideas of my own
<br>
for a general FAI theory and I've basically just been
<br>
blurting out 'stream of consciousness' thoughts to
<br>
this list as I was developing my theory.   I’m gonna
<br>
stop now, so you'll have to take it or leave it ;) 
<br>
<p>Not so long ago I did post a quick summary of my
<br>
entire world-view on my web-site ('The
<br>
Libertarian-Transhumanist Philosophical Platform'). 
<br>
I've taken that down now, but you can still read the
<br>
draft that was posted at 'Transhumanity'. Here was the
<br>
link:
<br>
<p><a href="http://transhumanism.org/index.php/th/more/461/">http://transhumanism.org/index.php/th/more/461/</a>
<br>
<p>But that was not directly dealing with my FAI theory. 
<br>
Not only is my theory a theory of FAI, it is also a
<br>
kind of 'Theory of Everything'. 
<br>
<p>Of course, fundamental principles are one thing, hard
<br>
math is quite another.  I'm under no illusions on the
<br>
'hard maths' score.  That stuff would be well beyond
<br>
my ability.  What I've think I've got here is an
<br>
understanding of the fundamental principles.  But
<br>
formalizing those principles would be beyond me, and
<br>
would probably take many years.  What I have here is
<br>
analogous to Einstein’s 'Equivalence Principle' of
<br>
General Relativity, or the founders of QM's principle
<br>
of 'wave/particle duality'.  Obviously, an ordinary
<br>
person can understand fundamental principles.  But
<br>
equally obviously, fundamental principles are a long
<br>
way from rigorous formal solutions, which would
<br>
require the work of a genius over many years. 
<br>
<p>The main value of Singularity Institute was to get
<br>
people looking into these issues, to publicize any key
<br>
ideas of critical importance, like Bayesian reasoning,
<br>
the need for Friendliness, the importance of altruism
<br>
and volition etc.  Many things which I started off
<br>
knowing nothing about.  Sing Inst got me started
<br>
looking into these things.
<br>
<p>Eliezer certainly does have a terrifying intelligence
<br>
level, as others have noted ;)  But it can be *teeny*
<br>
bit 1-dimensional at times. In any event, it appears
<br>
that one doesn't need to be a *super-genius* to grasp
<br>
the fundamentals.  It just takes a brain of
<br>
*moderately good* intelligence and a lot of deep
<br>
thinking.  A fair number of people could get there in
<br>
the end I think.  Of course, as I mentioned,
<br>
fundamentals are one thing, hard maths is just
<br>
another.  Formalizing the fundamentals to a proper
<br>
rigorous theory will probably take years and *really
<br>
will* require a *super genius* I think. 
<br>
<p>I might try writing an E-Book, where I'll clearly and
<br>
logically lay down my theory.  This is less work and
<br>
one can self-publish. In fact this could be a good
<br>
idea for everyone with a theory of their own.  This
<br>
might also be an excellent option for Eliezer and
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>O.K, so here's a possible teaser for the E-Book
<br>
describing my theory:
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Universal Cognition x Person Cognition = Qualia
<br>
<p>A simple equation describing the relationship between
<br>
'Mind' and 'Universe'.  A simple equation fully
<br>
explaining reality in terms of the partitioning
<br>
between 'Self' and 'Other'
<br>
<p>One equation.  One solution.  One secret.  The secret
<br>
to FAI.  The secret to the universe!
