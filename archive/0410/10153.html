</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.  I have to do my thinking while I'm still young enough to think. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I have to use my annus mirabilis years on AI and nothing else.  Youth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a non-renewable resource for solving scientific problems.  I still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in fear of running out of youth before I run out of fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI problems requiring basic shifts in thinking and deep mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retraining.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This bit of ageism is probably not that strongly justified.  If you 
<br>
believe it is then please provide your evidence.   I seem to have gone 
<br>
through several basic shifts in thinking and deep retraining in my 30s 
<br>
and 40s and am on the edge of another at the ancient age of 50.   
<br>
Perhaps I am just odd in that way.   But I and other older folks I know 
<br>
still seem quite able to think mostly as well and as deeply as when we 
<br>
were in our 20s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, and fifty-five million humans die forever every year.  It's a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece of knowledge that sinks its way into you very slowly, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's so hard to comprehend.  But I understand more as time goes on.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll try and stay sane (well, reasonably sane) regardless, which is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most critical part of this job and the part that most people would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantly flub.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think you are loading yourself up with a lot of pressure that does 
<br>
not serve you or the work.  You are too good and have much too much to 
<br>
do to play super-hero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might make sense for other SIAI supporters to try and start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies with the goal of funding the Singularity Institute if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeed.  Some of them are.  It does not make sense for me to do so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless I am willing to entirely sacrifice my potential as an FAI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researcher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Entirely?  Hardly.   How much are you sacrificing now by spending year 
<br>
after year barely scraping by churning the theoretical space but 
<br>
incapable of even beginning to build the infrastructure much less the 
<br>
actual AI?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But mostly, I think people making the suggestion don't know how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely is a new company to succeed, how much energy it takes from a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, the cold statistics of technology startup survival rates, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wry psychology experiments showing that everyone thinks they can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beat the statistics because their plan is different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, don't start a company.  Find a niche to do consulting in or find 
<br>
people who do want to start a company using some of your ideas or 
<br>
attract a better evangelism team.   Just don't run so purist that you 
<br>
haven't a prayer of accomplishing much except maybe the theoretical 
<br>
foundation.   Only so much can be done in your head.   Only so much can 
<br>
be done in relative isolation no matter how brilliant you are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the comment about monks holding out begging bowls... either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a suggestion that all charities stay small and accomplish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing, which is false-to-fact, or it is a suggestion that begging is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneath a proud Earth's defender.  In which latter case the speaker 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not begin to comprehend the concept of &quot;existential risk&quot;.  Pride 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counts for nothing. It vanishes like a snowflake in the ocean, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feather buried under the weight of lives.  Yes, it hurt to ask for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help, just like it hurt to give up my dreams of being a millionaire.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did it anyway because people were dying.
</em><br>
<p>If SIAI doesn't find a deeper source of funding and get some actual 
<br>
building the tech traction the people will continue to die.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose that sounds hokey to some people, like I'm making a big deal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over nothing and feeling too much.  Fine.  Maybe someday you'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that it was all real, or maybe you'll die before then.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you'll die one day before the bus arrives.  If so, I'd like to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apologize now for not working just a little bit faster.
</em><br>
