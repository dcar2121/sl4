Response to Ben Goertzel re Universal Ethics
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought it was obvious that &quot;pattern-sympathy&quot;, in that essay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a *defined term*, like energy or force in physics, or like the notion
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; sympathetic resonance in physics.
</em><br>
<p>What is the point of redefining the English language to hide the fact that
<br>
your
<br>
*theory* about patterns *magically* creating something useful is just bogus.
<br>
<p>You say I &quot;displays such a basic lack of understanding&quot; but I think I
<br>
understood
<br>
your article quite well.  At least well enough to know that you are trying
<br>
to describe
<br>
a concept &quot;compassion&quot; which has a well defined English meaning into
<br>
something that
<br>
fits your concept of programming an AI.
<br>
<p>There is a huge difference to the method I described for creating an AI and
<br>
yours.  You
<br>
try to fit a number of different methods into an &quot;agent&quot; context where some
<br>
agents
<br>
degenerate and others stick around.  I said that there is some peripheral
<br>
usefulness to
<br>
this concept but you have made it the base of your implementation.  My
<br>
design
<br>
makes a set of models the basis for the AI and all of the other useful
<br>
techniques can
<br>
update and refine that model as they go.  The models can be arbitrarily
<br>
simple or complex.
<br>
With your agents coming and going, you have no stable place to try different
<br>
techniques or
<br>
even see if your teaching of the AI is progressing.
<br>
<p>I don't appreciate your condescending attitude at all.  Your paper didn't
<br>
sound too much
<br>
different than others I have read from Marc Geddes.  Eliezer has him pegged
<br>
quite
<br>
right in his last few emails.  Marc was castigated for comparing himself to
<br>
Einstein.
<br>
(and rightly so) but you say &quot;one has to look at evolution and ethics as
<br>
intertwined
<br>
manifestations of the same deeper phenomena.&quot;  You go on to argue your
<br>
&quot;deeper
<br>
phenomena&quot;.  Your document purports to be above the theory of Evolution and
<br>
ethics.
<br>
If I made such a grand statement, I think I would have backed it up with a
<br>
bit more
<br>
facts and rigor (if you will).
<br>
<p>Your document purports to have *arguments* for your hypothesis.  I made
<br>
points, IMHO
<br>
that showed your hypothesis to be wrong and your arguments to be nothing but
<br>
definitions or conclusions.  I think your take on Natural Selection is also
<br>
quite *novel*
<br>
approach and my textbooks from University (2000) on *phenotypic selection*
<br>
show
<br>
absolutely nothing on &quot;pattern-sympathy&quot;. (Human Evolution An Illustrated
<br>
Introduction
<br>
by Roger Lewin 1999 or The Origin of Moden Humans by Roger Lewin 1998)
<br>
<p>I wasn't the person that said your document was &quot;it just argues that some
<br>
degree of compassion
<br>
is natural and inevitable.&quot;, you were.  As my proof that compassion is *not*
<br>
inevitable I
<br>
call to the stand all the people I see around me that don't help little old
<br>
ladies across the street.
<br>
I call all the people in the Western World that have a car and a fancy house
<br>
when thousands
<br>
die of starvation all over the world.  If you want to make a hypothesis
<br>
about something
<br>
that we can all see around us all the time, don't you think you should at
<br>
least be somewhat
<br>
convincing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To write something to be potentially convincing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people with opposing points of view would require a lot more time, space
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; didacticism.
</em><br>
<p>Do you always just write for people who might already agree with you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who's your daddy indeed!!!
</em><br>
<p>I made this attempt at humor to show how silly I think your giving human
<br>
attributes
<br>
to a pattern to be.  I used the analogy that a fork doesn't *want* to pickup
<br>
food and put it in my mouth!  If you think a pattern is something so much
<br>
more
<br>
than what the dictionary says, then maybe you can point me to your own
<br>
personal
<br>
dictionary so I can figure it out.
<br>
<p>David Clark
<br>
<p>PS I took the time to respond to your paper and you obviously took offense.
<br>
I also
<br>
take offense to you saying I have a &quot;basic lack of understanding&quot;.  Are you
<br>
really so smart?
