<p>Interestingly, and FWIW, this formed the basis of what sf writer Samuel R. 
<br>
Delany called a `modular calculus' in a number of his deeply informed and 
<br>
playful fictions. Here is an extract on the topic (using Delany's sf and 
<br>
fantasy as the test bed, but that's not crucial) from my book READING BY 
<br>
STARLIGHT (Chapter 10), for anyone who cares:
<br>
<p>====================
<br>
<p>Beyond the play of unusual signifiers which index the virtual presence, and 
<br>
so construct or constitute the actual presence, of new signifieds 
<br>
articulated within new or renewed syntagms, Delany has recently focused on 
<br>
the cultural schemata or scripts which underlie or imbricate those 
<br>
inscribed discourses we `read' through our competency in cultural coding. 
<br>
Delany's own fictive discourse has increasingly involved a paradoxical 
<br>
search for rich (`valid') heuristic models of this kind which are 
<br>
immediately subjected to ceaseless revision, inversion and deconstruction.
<br>
<p>A Mirror for Observers
<br>
<p>The isomorphic or homological image of `the real' within the frame of a 
<br>
mirror, and the metaphorical `mirroring' of self in other, via projective 
<br>
empathy and identification, has been the traditional figure for any 
<br>
nearly-adequate model of one phenomenon by another. A mirror image, of 
<br>
course, is never fully adequate, being always at least bilaterally 
<br>
reversed. Yet this very figuration has been thoroughly assailed in recent 
<br>
theory. Delany's most substantial fiction, four genre-shattering volumes of 
<br>
poststructuralist `sword &amp; sorcery', contains an epigraph from Rodolphe 
<br>
Gasché's The Tain of the Mirror,[i] a formidable study that hangs its 
<br>
critique of Derrida's philosophical novelties precisely on the image of the 
<br>
mirror. The first book in the 1285-page sequence devotes many pages to an 
<br>
exposition, by a Neolithic wise-woman named Venn, of the logical and 
<br>
economic hazards of modular theory, using mirrors as the basis for her 
<br>
reflections. The entire Nevèrÿon tetralogy (to date) is a generous, 
<br>
self-subverting machine for modelling practically everything mundane and 
<br>
contentious in our contemporary epistemic and social order, including AIDS, 
<br>
semiotics, paraliteratures emphasising the object and, reflexively, 
<br>
Delany's own struggles to perfect such a craft.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shorthand figure for this program, introduced by Delany in 
<br>
his 1976 sf novel Triton and continued through other texts in a sort of 
<br>
serious running gag, is `the modular calculus'. Modular here is simply the 
<br>
adjective from model.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kathleen L. Spencer, in an exceptionally deft preliminary survey 
<br>
of this beguiling notion, lays out the philosophical questions which 
<br>
precede its invention:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how do we construct models? Especially, how does language 
<br>
function in the modelling process? How do the models adopted by individuals 
<br>
or cultures shape their perceptions and responses? How can we determine the 
<br>
relative coherence, accuracy, or appropriateness of competing models? To 
<br>
what extent can a model actually succeed in mastering the thing it models? 
<br>
All of these questions Delany has, as a writer of SF novels, raised in the 
<br>
context of yet another: in what ways can fiction model the real world?[ii]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One principal way, for Delany, is by refusing to respect 
<br>
conventional limits between fiction and reflections on fiction. The modular 
<br>
calculus - literally, a rigorous technique of modelling or simulation - is 
<br>
advanced, exemplified, explored and undermined in a series of fictions, 
<br>
parodies and theoretical ruminations, `Some Informal Remarks toward the 
<br>
Modular Calculus'.[iii] It is itself a model of what the mechanism of 
<br>
science fiction might be if sf were truly the bridge between science and 
<br>
literature, a notional gadget for postulating the hidden works of a black 
<br>
box which might hide the fundamental physical laws of the universe, or the 
<br>
obscure heart of a suffering human being.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Box and Finagle Factor
<br>
<p>`Modular calculus': the very sound, bearing connotations of `modal 
<br>
calculus' and other mysterious arcana, captures the cartoon-strip 
<br>
pretentiousness of sf, where giving a crazy idea a fancy name is equivalent 
<br>
to lending it reality. Scuffing his toe, Delany confesses as much:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[It] began as a science fictional notion that turns out to be 
<br>
somewhat related to the famous Finagle Factor (that illusory constant 
<br>
sought by all researchers, by which the wrong answer is adjusted to get the 
<br>
right one).[iv]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such wry candour does not last long. At once, Delany is 
<br>
expounding Quine's `fitting' and `guiding' grammars, systems of (emic, or 
<br>
empathetic) description and (etic, or detached) explanation respectively.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modular calculus is an [imaginary] algorithm or set of 
<br>
algorithms... that can be applied to any fitting grammar to adjust it into 
<br>
a guiding grammar.... In short, the problem of the modular calculus is: How 
<br>
do we know when we have a model of a situation; and how do we know what 
<br>
kind of model it is? (pp. 376-7)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich descriptions, Delany states, approach functional or 
<br>
explanatory force. In fact, many do not. One thinks of alchemy versus 
<br>
chemistry in respect of their empirical and theoretical competence to 
<br>
operate on the external world, outside of a closed textual system. One 
<br>
thinks of psychoanalysis: compellingly ornate in its accounting procedures, 
<br>
arguably irrelevant at any interesting explanatory level to the actual 
<br>
`black box' it seeks to model and manipulate.[v] Delany knows how 
<br>
implausible his `modular calculus' is, admitting that probably `such an 
<br>
algorithm is a total fantasy' p. 376). Even so, in terms of sf at least, he 
<br>
insists on this question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might there be an [algorithmic procedure] that would tell us how 
<br>
close or how far a given description is from explanation, or that would 
<br>
tell us, from a given description, what kind of explanation may eventually 
<br>
be possible from it , or where the description might be further enriched to 
<br>
achieve explanation. For a limited set of situations, such algorithms might 
<br>
be developed and generalized. (p. 377)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Nevèrÿon sequence a model of, with its playful, 
<br>
blatantly fake-historical `reconstructions' of Neolithic city life, sexual 
<br>
fetishism, revolt against slavery, ceaseless invention? Delany's answer 
<br>
would not offend a Jameson in search of historicism:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a model of late twentieth-century (mostly urban) America....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of relation does it bear to the thing modeled?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich, eristic, and contestatory (as well as documentary), I 
<br>
hope. (Idem)[vi]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence is an archive, then, which places itself under 
<br>
scrutiny. By the nature of the problem it can hardly expect to escape its 
<br>
epistemic bonds, but it may challenge them to the hilt (to conscript a 
<br>
figure apt to sword &amp; sorcery), using as its cutting instrument the conceit 
<br>
of the modular calculus. A search of the greater archive which is Delany's 
<br>
oeuvre to date reveals, interestingly, that he has not always viewed the 
<br>
notion so blithely. In a somewhat rambling assemblage of journal notes 
<br>
published in 1974/5, he declares with almost embarrassing fervour:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mistake at Tractatus 2.261 is heartrending:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be something identical in a picture and what 
<br>
it depicts to enable the one to be a picture of the other at all.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for must be and identical he had substituted is obviously and 
<br>
similar - and then taken up the monumental task of running these down to 
<br>
their propositional atomization - he would have solved the problem of the 
<br>
modular calculus (i.e., the critical problem).[vii]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wittgenstein's error, in short, was to search for essential 
<br>
identity rather than reception-determined homology between `sets of 
<br>
internal relations' (p. 52) in systems which were marked solely, on 
<br>
Delany's proto-Saussurean structuralist understanding, by patterns of 
<br>
difference. But these structural similarities are chosen from an indefinite 
<br>
number of features by the observer. A model's validity is tested 
<br>
pragmatically not ontologically, by `the use you are putting it to - the 
<br>
context you are putting it into'. Its validity within a context may depend 
<br>
on the model's internal structure, but whether it functions at all `has to 
<br>
do with the structure of the context' (p. 57).
<br>
<p>The Rudder of Language
<br>
<p>A useful consequence of Delany's interdisciplinary interests, common to 
<br>
most sf writers and many sf readers though far less common, perhaps, in 
<br>
`literary' circles, is his early realisation that cognitive science had 
<br>
already answered certain traditional philosophical puzzles. Empirical 
<br>
evidence points
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a revitalization of the concept of mental occurrences as 
<br>
brain processes. [...I]t seems as silly to say that the brain contains no 
<br>
model of what the eye sees... as it is to say that the circuitry of a TV 
<br>
camera... contains no model of what is in front of the image orthicon tube. 
<br>
... We can not only locate [`mental events'], we can measure them, map 
<br>
them,... cut them out, and put them in backwards! (p. 49)[viii]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such models might be in the head, and stabilised, as Delany 
<br>
would come to stress, by language,[ix] but they must be objective to be 
<br>
useful: they must be self-critiquing (`Shadows', p. 68). When models are 
<br>
constructed in a marketplace context of story-telling, especially the 
<br>
science fictional variety, that set of contextual or reception constraints 
<br>
tends, despite writer's and reader's best efforts, to stabilise aspects of 
<br>
the text which each might wish to criticise. If sf is a kind of 
<br>
rough-and-ready approximation to a modular calculus (of the object, 
<br>
perhaps, rather than of the subject or, better, of the subject 
<br>
interactively constituted with the object), must the story it tells us 
<br>
about the hidden innards and workings of the black box (whatever it is) 
<br>
inevitably `reinforce commonly accepted prejudices'? No, says Delany, but this
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is certainly an inherent tendency of the medium. To fight it, 
<br>
and triumph over it, I must specifically go into the world I have set up 
<br>
far more thoroughly..., and treat it autonomously rather than as merely a 
<br>
model of a prejudiciary situation. I must explore it as an extensive, 
<br>
coherent reality - not as an intensive reflection of the real world where 
<br>
the most conservative ideas will drain all life out of the invention. (p. 41)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Delany's search is for an order of formal representation 
<br>
which is neither wholly arbitrary in its coding, like the digital pits 
<br>
burned into the surface of a compact disc that are related to acoustic 
<br>
analog signals only via a complex transduction, nor `transparently' 
<br>
isomorphic. In the words of his imaginary metalogician Ashima Slade, 
<br>
Mars-born and repeatedly sex-changed inventor of the modular calculus,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A modular description allows us reference routes back to the 
<br>
elements in the situation which is being modeled. A nonmodular description 
<br>
is nonmodular precisely because, complete or incomplete as it may be, it 
<br>
destroys those reference routes: it is, in effect, a cipher.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that still remains... is the generation of formal 
<br>
algorithms for distinguishing incoherent modular descriptive systems from 
<br>
coherent [versions]. (Triton, p. 369)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing in Phase Space
<br>
<p>More than a decade later, Delany's ludic stipulations had a somewhat 
<br>
different goal: a hyperspace or phase space of signification matrices 
<br>
capable of modelling and permitting transcoding between all conceivable 
<br>
subject positions and interactions. (This is my figure, not Delany's, 
<br>
introduced in chapter 2, above.) Frye's and Todorov's generic ambitions 
<br>
pale. Delany does not initially challenge the cultural parameters he 
<br>
attempts to graph, because he asserts that some version of this grid 
<br>
sustains `[a]ll novelistic narrative' (Flight From Nevèrÿon, p. 378). The 
<br>
chart
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must eventually specify every possible racial/ social/ age/ 
<br>
gender/ sexual type, all of which become ideally equal through their ideal 
<br>
accessibility.... Like the novel itself, this chart has nothing to do with 
<br>
the statistical prevalence of any one group in our society.... Next, we 
<br>
must consider a set of novelistic relations: Friendship; sexual love; 
<br>
enmity; economic antagonism; religious approval; etc.... Given any two 
<br>
characters, in any relation, that relation must be seen as having the 
<br>
potential to change into any other. (pp. 378-9)[x]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed against this vast virtual combinatoire, any given fiction 
<br>
reveals what it excludes. A random sampling of any culture's texts will 
<br>
provide a telling display in phase space of its ideological contours. But 
<br>
Delany proposes this thought-experiment under a more generous impulse than 
<br>
doctrinal self-criticism:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grid is what allows us to ask of any fiction: precisely 
<br>
what does it have to say in excess of its ideological reduction... and the 
<br>
subsequent revelation of vast and overdetermined elements? The 
<br>
deconstructionists have led off this set of new readings most energetically 
<br>
by asking of certain texts: &quot;What do they have to say that specifically 
<br>
undermines and subverts their own ideological array?&quot;[xi]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wryly, Delany adds that `we must remember that there are still 
<br>
going to be many texts for which we can expect the answer: &quot;Not much&quot;.' In 
<br>
his `K. Leslie Steiner' persona, Delany defines deconstruction thus: `an 
<br>
analysis of possible (as opposed to impossible) meanings that subvert any 
<br>
illusions we have of becoming true masters over a given text',[xii] a not 
<br>
wholly disseminative definition that attempts to sidestep well-founded 
<br>
strictures against deconstruction. Of course, possible/ impossible, in this 
<br>
context, is itself a binary opposition which deconstructors would find a 
<br>
suitable case for treatment. `Steiner' identifies a necessary 
<br>
auto-deconstruction of Delany's regnant narrative voice in the Return To 
<br>
Nevèrÿon sequence - `benevolent, oppressive, insistent' (p. 304)[xiii] - 
<br>
between the Master's (Marxist) claim that history `is intellectually 
<br>
negotiable' and can be changed for the better, and his contrary (Hegelian) 
<br>
`lie' that history is fixed and normative. `Steiner' comments:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it always bears that double message, that voice has 
<br>
value only in a dialectical, if not dialogic, process.... But if we cannot 
<br>
silence the lie completely - for it is too intimately bound up with 
<br>
experience, language, and desire - at least the writer can worry over how 
<br>
to articulate the truth of that voice; and can try to write up the lie for 
<br>
what it is.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recourse here is always to form. (Idem)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Delany's self-interrogative devices, used increasingly 
<br>
through Return To Nevèrÿon, is the delightful if fey running exchange 
<br>
between K. L. Steiner, a mathematician specialising in `Naming, Listing, 
<br>
and Counting Theory'[xiv] (a version, it seems, of the modular calculus), 
<br>
and the gay but conservative archaeologist S. L. Kermit; like the initials 
<br>
of their names, their positions mirror each other in reverse. Putting 
<br>
forward every objection likely to occur to the sceptic, Kermit complains: 
<br>
`even in terms of his own allegory, just look at what he's done. 
<br>
[...S]lowly and inexorably the Discourse of the Master displaces everyone 
<br>
else's... for all his marginal numbers, his Benjaminesque montage, or his 
<br>
Bakhtinian polylogue, or whatever, there's not a new - much less radical - 
<br>
thing in it.... &quot;Allegoresis&quot;, my ass!'[xv] Steiner's defence is that `It's 
<br>
just fun - to sort of play with in your mind', and that perhaps Delany's 
<br>
allegory is of a feeling rather than of a political situation in this long 
<br>
AIDS-echoing `Tale of Plagues and Carnivals' (pp. 330, 333). Ultimately the 
<br>
burden is placed back with the reader, where Delany would claim it has 
<br>
always rested:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as far as the allegory, well... you have to read the textual 
<br>
shape as just the kind of conservative reification you do, but at the same 
<br>
time opposing it with a vigorous deconstruction.... (p. 328)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the task Delany charges his new readers with when 
<br>
they turn back to his early books. If these texts retain interest two 
<br>
decades on, he tells them,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is where, in terms of the old stories, they fight with 
<br>
themselves, where they come up against the contradictions, where they stall 
<br>
at some moment of metaphor or within some narrative aporia or allegorical 
<br>
ambiguity - where, as science fiction, the world of the story organizes 
<br>
itself in some way in which the fictive subject becomes, momentarily, 
<br>
elusively objective.[xvi]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is in precisely this self-reflexive distancing, I would 
<br>
argue, that at last we are sure how appropriate it is to read Delany's 
<br>
fictions as allegories of their own production and consumption.
<br>
<p>Conceptual Breakthrough
<br>
<p>This may be extended to all sf texts, even that huge majority `in a 
<br>
commercially fixed form the writers themselves would be the first to admit 
<br>
was dead from the outset'.[xvii] It is a strategy which in turn allegorises 
<br>
the historically specific experience of industrial/postindustrial epistemic 
<br>
crisis. That experience - however clouded, resisted, impalpable to the 
<br>
`common-sense' of a majority of subjects - is the defining characteristic 
<br>
of our century. At the expressly cognitive level, it is a function of what 
<br>
Peter Nicholls terms `conceptual breakthrough', the very hallmark of sf:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quest for knowledge remains sf's central vision.... Of all 
<br>
the forms [it] takes in modern sf, by far the most important, in terms of 
<br>
both the quality and the quantity of the work that dramatizes it, is 
<br>
conceptual breakthrough. [Samuel Johnson's Rasselas] - which recognises 
<br>
that even though the new world-picture may be uglier than the old we need 
<br>
to know about it - captures exactly the accepting tone which was to 
<br>
permeate so much sf [...which] is pre-eminently the literature of the 
<br>
intellectually dissatisfied, the discontented, those who need to feel there 
<br>
must be more to life than this, and therein lies its maturity, which by a 
<br>
paradox can be seen as a perpetual adolescent yearning.[xviii]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Elizabethans, we are notoriously in the centre of a 
<br>
change from one episteme to another, or so it is argued by observers as 
<br>
various as Foucault, Jameson and Prigogine. If this much is granted, 
<br>
nonetheless its details are hidden from us, by the very nature of the 
<br>
crisis. It is an affliction of our cognitive (I do not exclude ideological 
<br>
and affective) strategies. Delany draws a similar comparison with the 
<br>
native reception of Shakespeare's Tempest:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[C]ontemporary play-goers who did not `believe' in the roundness 
<br>
of the Earth... and had no feeling for the new distinctions between 
<br>
fantasy/ magic/ reality/ science that were then being etched on the modern 
<br>
English-speaking consciousness [...would be] totally at sea. They would 
<br>
simply not be able to make the storm-tossed landing on that tropical 
<br>
island, nor read properly the emblems of what is real and what is not and 
<br>
the dialogue between them which are the structure, significance, and charm 
<br>
of the play. It is not that they would miss the surface plot: they would 
<br>
miss the sub-text which gives the surface plot its reason for being what it 
<br>
is.[xix]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without denying the real, the referent which kicks back, one can 
<br>
agree with Delany that fiction within today's played-out but persistent 
<br>
episteme `begins as a response to an industrial phenomenon.' Mechanical and 
<br>
electronic reduplication, as semioticians have told us for decades, 
<br>
drenches the world in signs. Even for the classic bourgeois novelist
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to describe an object was to generate a web of commentary... on 
<br>
the politics, economics, and religion of both the material and the fictive 
<br>
world....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire visible surface of every urban landscape..., as well 
<br>
as ninety-nine per cent of the visible surface of every human being in it, 
<br>
is constituted of signs of specifically human actions [and histories], 
<br>
ordered in informative, syntactic relations.... Nature, or the study of 
<br>
nature, as soon as we turn to a book to help us pursue it, is absorbed in 
<br>
the implied discourse of human technology. (pp. 21-2)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delany's complaint with modern canonical literature is its 
<br>
epistemic inertia. While the complaint is largely justified, of course this 
<br>
does not, by some automatic corollary, validate science fiction as the 
<br>
alternative of choice:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes modern fiction so uninteresting is that the causality 
<br>
and analysis implied... is demonstrably not the matrix... the writers 
<br>
themselves could possibly believe in. We are at a point in history where 
<br>
the basic models proposed by the objective discourse of sociology and 
<br>
psychology - even in their most vulgarized, cocktail party version - are 
<br>
more accurate and interesting than the basic models that underlie the most 
<br>
`serious' novels. (p. 34)[xx]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That modular calculus instantiated in `literature', in short, is 
<br>
giving inadequate answers. The fictive models it yields fail to project 
<br>
`rich' or `oppositional' shadows[xxi] over the signification spaces we 
<br>
inhabit like half-formed ghosts from Lobey's world of The Einstein 
<br>
Intersection, trapped in an epistemic labyrinth which lends our path shape 
<br>
even as it restricts, labels and even brutalises our possibilities. The 
<br>
question remains whether science fiction does offer more plenteous 
<br>
options,[xxii] or whether it is finally locked into the most miserable role 
<br>
available to any writing practice: narcotising the dissatisfied. Positioned 
<br>
somewhere between contested genre formulae and the postmodern, novels such 
<br>
as Triton, Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand and the Return To 
<br>
Nevèrÿon sequence suggest that, however despicable by properly literary 
<br>
standards sf's tropes and concerns are bound to remain, it escapes the twin 
<br>
temptations, so rarely refused, of current `serious' fiction: sensitive 
<br>
benediction of the quotidian, hieratic bliss of intertextual self-approval.

173-353 of Flight from Nevèrÿon, Bantam, 1985. It does not include the

`Appendix: Return... A Preface', by `K. Leslie Steiner', a Delany 
<br>
alter-ego, which concludes the latest (last?) volume, The Bridge of Lost 
<br>
Desire, Arbor House, 1987, p. 297; this offers some useful if immodest 
<br>
hints on how to read `Delany's mega-fantasy, ... a fascinating fiction of 
<br>
ideas, a narrative hall of mirrors, an intricate argument about power, 
<br>
sexuality, and narration itself' (Ibid., p. 302). Certain other Appendices 
<br>
in these books, as Delany remarks in Appendix B of the third volume (p. 
<br>
381-2) are, suitably, of undecidable status (like those very remarks).
<br>
[iv].Flight from Nevèrÿon, p. 375.
<br>
[v].Delany disagrees: `The Nevèrÿon series takes place at the edge of the 
<br>
shadow of the late French psychiatrist Jacques Lacan', though he objects to 
<br>
an essentialising tendency in Freud. In `vulgar Freudianism', he notes, 
<br>
`metonymies are interpreted as metaphors for their originary terms and 
<br>
situations. The valid Freudian enterprise is rather to discern the several 
<br>
social and psychological systems (clearly distinguishing which is which) by 
<br>
which metonymies exfoliate. [...I]t is precisely within social 
<br>
sedimentation that these battles must be fought' (Ibid. pp. 359, 361, 365).
<br>
[vi].I doubt that Delany really sees his work as `eristic' - that is, aimed 
<br>
at rhetorical victory rather than truth - although that is a fashionable 
<br>
way to construe the relativist ascendancy in his favoured theories.
<br>
[vii].Section 25, `Shadows', in The Jewel-Hinged Jaw, pp. 51-2.
<br>
[viii].Delany cites his own observation of Vikki Sperling's mapping of a 
<br>
salamander retina image from its visual tectum; personal encounter with the 
<br>
scientifically-mediated real had changed Delany's philosophical signifieds 
<br>
in a drastic fashion.
<br>
[ix].Flight From Nevèrÿon, p. 362: `Language is first and foremost a 
<br>
stabilizer of behavior, thought, and feeling, of human responses and 
<br>
reactions .... Its aid in intellectual analysis and communication are (one) 
<br>
secondary and (two) wholly entailed .... When the world is projected 
<br>
through the hierarchical oppositions available to the sensory and sensual 
<br>
body ... it produces a spectacularly unstable text ....'
<br>
[x].This notional chart brings to mind the useful questions which underlie 
<br>
a complex fiction, as Delany understood when he was only 17: how does each 
<br>
character react alone or in a group by reference to such crucial 
<br>
commonplaces as food, sleep, money and social status (see `Characters', in 
<br>
The Jewel-Hinged Jaw, p. 158. His own sf is notable for dramatising 
<br>
character within a full matrix of social factors.

<br>
[xiii].John Clute, as noted previously, is less kind to late Delany's 
<br>
typical narrative presence, while Patrick Neilsen Hayden, in Gunn's New 
<br>
Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, calls the auctorial voice `authoritative, 
<br>
good-humored (even fey), and ornate' (p. 124).
<br>
[xiv].Described (somewhat hazily) in the Appendix to Tales of Nevèrÿon, pp. 
<br>
256-8: its `third level order', nicknamed `language', is `a non-commutative 
<br>
substitution matrix', which is a set of rules `that allows unidirectional 
<br>
substitutions of listable subsets of a collection of names'; `these rules 
<br>
will sometimes make complete loops of substitution. Such a loop will be 
<br>
called, by N/L/C/ theoreticians, a &quot;discourse&quot;' (p. 257). Applying it to 
<br>
the uninterpretable `Missolonghi Codex', `Steiner has been able to offer a 
<br>
number of highly probable (and in some cases highly imaginative) revisions 
<br>
of existing translations based on the theoretical mechanics of various 
<br>
discursive loopings' (p. 258). This sounds like an unholy cross between 
<br>
information theory decipherment and `nothing outside the text' deconstruction.

the cultural and individual need for, and the endlessly inevitable failure

to find, just such a calculus.
