</em><br>
<p>Why the off-list reply?
<br>
<p>Let me try this approach to the issue, and see if it's helpful. Consider
<br>
the following thought experiment. You're a disembodied brain living in a
<br>
jar, with remote control of a telepresence robot. You just heard that the
<br>
storage warehouse housing your jar is on fire, and rush the robot back
<br>
to save yourself. The bad news is there are thousands of brains in the
<br>
warehouse, and you don't know which one is yours. The good news is there's
<br>
a brain scanning machine with resolution down to individual neurons, and 
<br>
you can try to use it to find out which brain is you. Question is, how to 
<br>
do it?
<br>
<p>How do you take a bunch of neurons and figure out what it's experiencing? 
<br>
Would the answer to this question also answer Mitchell's question, or is 
<br>
he asking something else? 
<br>
<p>Is this question worth trying to answer? A mind with full access to its
<br>
self-state presumably wouldn't have this problem with determining which
<br>
brain is itself. It would just directly compare the scanner output with
<br>
its own self-inspection. Assuming that we'll get this feature soon,
<br>
is there some other scenario where the answer would be useful?
