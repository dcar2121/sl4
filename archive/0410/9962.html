Hi Bill,
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; You are right that I do not demonstrate a mathematical
</em><br>
<em> &gt; error in Penrose. Rather, his overall argument is wrong,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; based on an unrealistic model of human brains.
</em><br>
<p>I restate it the last time: if you write that the human mind can
<br>
be computationally modelled by a finite state machine, then
<br>
you implicitely agree with him that it can be modelled by
<br>
a Turing machine.
<br>
<p>Your refutation attempt is analogous to:
<br>
<p>&quot;Penrose assumes that the humans are mammals, but of course,
<br>
this is absurd, since they are clearly apes. So his argument that
<br>
we can do something that mammals can't do is flawed, since
<br>
we are not mammals, but apes.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that your argumentation is wrong, since it does not matter
<br>
whether we can be modelled by FSMs or TMs. (whether we are
<br>
apes or mammals) but whether we can do something what a TM
<br>
(mammal) can not. This is the really weak point in his
<br>
argumentation.  And this would remain a weak point even if the
<br>
human brain could perform arbitrarily long computations.
<br>
<p>So I think that your refutation is flawed since it attacks at the
<br>
wrong point. You do not exhibit the real weakness in his
<br>
consideration. The real weakness has nothing to do with
<br>
finiteness, it is a much more basic matter.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>Let me illuminate the error in his arguments on another analogue.
<br>
<p>(Now, I will play the his role and try to convince you that you are
<br>
not a computer.)
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Computers cannot factor numbers with large prime factors
<br>
efficiently, can they?
<br>
<p>Let us take a the smallest prime number with 100 digits
<br>
and multiply it with the smallest prime number with 200
<br>
digits. If you were a computer it would be a hard job for
<br>
you to factorize their product.
<br>
<p>Hah...! But is not it quite clear to you what the factors of
<br>
the product are?
<br>
<p>Since you can factor so efficiently, it is highly improbable
<br>
that you are a computer. Perhaps, you are quantum-coputer,
<br>
since they can factorize efficiently too!
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>The flaw in the above arguments has nothing to do with
<br>
finiteness, or whether I have enough time or
<br>
brain-capacity to work with 300 digit numbers. It is simple
<br>
a question of input-formats. If the factors are apriori
<br>
told, than it is not a big deal to factorize their product.
<br>
In fact, you did not have to factorize at all. This is the same
<br>
in his original argument.
