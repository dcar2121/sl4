<p>I think you're right that there are big unsolved problems lurking in the
<br>
choice of axioms. I don't know if Schmidhuber has responded to this thread
<br>
yet, but I bet he wouldn't deny that. Maybe choosing the right axioms
<br>
is no easier than programming a self-improving AI using a procedure 
<br>
approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's the entire problem of Friendly AI in a nutshell, isn't it?
</em><br>
<p>It's a slightly more general problem. How does the AI programmer make sure 
<br>
the AI will do what he wants it to do, which may not necessarily be 
<br>
&quot;friendliness&quot;? I think we need some other term for this more general 
<br>
problem, as solving this problem will automatically solve Friendly AI, but 
<br>
not vice versa. Perhaps &quot;safe AI&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, but then the FAI problem is generally overlooked or treated as a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't see why its unfair to zap him, as long as we zap everybody else
<br>
for it. The safety issue needs to be part of every paper on AI, even if
<br>
it only says &quot;no safety considerations were included in this work&quot; or
<br>
&quot;safety is still an unsolved problem&quot;, just to remind potential
<br>
implementors that it's not safe to actually build the AI as described.
