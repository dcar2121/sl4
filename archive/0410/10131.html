Oh, and by oldest, I meant possibly the first here to have ever shifted into
<br>
that mindset, but I will humbly accept Mr. Broderick's implication that he
<br>
and others may have me beat, one way or another, by decades.
<br>
<p>Having said that, has it occurred to anyone trying to generate interest in
<br>
transhumanist/extropian/singulatarian ideas to try to reach out to other
<br>
groups who are interested in radical self-improvement of one kind or
<br>
another?
<br>
<p>I'd imagine this group has already considered the simple idea of recruiting
<br>
from &quot;fertile fields&quot; (science fiction fans, AI researchers, cybernetic
<br>
enthusiasts, longevity/health fanatics). But for people interested in
<br>
promoting a whole range of transhumanist ideals, perhaps there's something
<br>
to be said for forming specific alliances in order to advance specific
<br>
interests.
<br>
<p>For example, a group focused on the benefits of meditation may have
<br>
absolutely no interest in implanting &quot;microchips in the brain.&quot; They might,
<br>
however, be quite interested in an in-depth study of the brain in various
<br>
stages of meditation, as versus controls in normal modes of awareness.
<br>
People interested in creativity may want to see the brain in creative
<br>
states; people trying to develop lie-detectors may want to examine the
<br>
brains of accomplished (and un-accomplished) liars.
<br>
<p>Why not work together with such groups to find support for elements of
<br>
projects such as analyzing the brain down to the cellular level as a prelude
<br>
to uploading?
<br>
<p>Similarly, many religious or humanitarian groups may be hostile to or at
<br>
least disinterested in physical immortality. But quite a few are interested
<br>
in decreasing pain and suffering, curing illness and significantly extending
<br>
human lifespans. These are obvious potential partners for longevity-related
<br>
projects.
<br>
<p>As others have pointed out on this list, the Transhumanist movement is
<br>
hardly overburdened with millionaires who have money to burn. But there are
<br>
plenty of wealthy philanthropists supporting other movements, and some of
<br>
them might be willing to fund what are ultimately transhumanist goals if
<br>
they were presented as the far-reaching aims of their favored cause.
<br>
<p>I think breaking down transhumanist goals into their constituent parts and
<br>
tackling them (or having someone else tackle them) one-by-one might be a
<br>
useful to not only make progress on immediate tasks but to encourage a
<br>
groundswell of support for further, more advanced goals as the initial
<br>
research bears fruit.
<br>
<p>Obvious areas for potential partnership include:
<br>
<p>Expert systems -- for conducting scientific research (which they have),
<br>
detecting and repairing software problems, voice/facial/retinal
<br>
identification, etc.
<br>
Industrial and service robots
<br>
Neural networks, atomic-scale processor or chip components, etc
<br>
Any detailed analysis of the brain, but particularly anything that would
<br>
give clues as to the best way to simulate sentient thought or to upload an
<br>
existing consciousness.
<br>
Nootropic or gene therapy methods for enhancing intelligence
<br>
Any non-invasive technologies with the potential to enhance effective brain
<br>
function (sensory deprivation tanks, etc)
<br>
Accelerated learning or creativity-enhancing techniques
<br>
<p>Etc, etc. The above may seem relatively prosaic, given the fund-raising
<br>
discussions already hosted on this list. I would suggest, however, that
<br>
there is an untapped vein of resources here -- not so much in
<br>
transhumanist-&quot;outsider&quot; partnerships, but by joining &quot;outsider to
<br>
outsider.&quot; Hence, you have neurology researchers getting funded by
<br>
meditation schools to study said schools' adepts. You have disease-fighting
<br>
philanthropists funding research into drugs for the mentally disabled, or to
<br>
enhance the immune systems of AIDS victims (something Bill and Malinda Gates
<br>
might take an interest in, and which dovetails with transhumanist interests
<br>
in an expanded lifespan). You have car companies funding the next generation
<br>
of industrial robots. You have software companies exploring &quot;smart&quot; search
<br>
engines and other (supposedly) AI-precursor technology.  (Actually, most of
<br>
those examples have already happened.)
<br>
<p>Now obviously some of this would occur with or without outside help. But one
<br>
thing that transhumanist organizations might become effective at is helping
<br>
to organize general fundraising deals for projects of clear value to
<br>
achieving their goals. If just one organization could maintain the
<br>
professional or two needed to guide such work, they could become a means of
<br>
linking up researchers in relevant fields with funders -- be they corporate
<br>
sponsors, angel investors, government agencies, etc.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, transhumanists could serve as an informal network of support
<br>
for these researchers, especially for those whose work is considered too
<br>
radical for many funding sources. By offering a venue where
<br>
transhumanist-related ideas can be aired in front of an intelligent and
<br>
receptive audience, international transhumanist conferences could serve as
<br>
the seed for such relationships to evolve. Indeed, if the overall movement
<br>
was consciously trying to promote these kinds of partnerships, then the
<br>
various students, supporters, researchers and other professionals could
<br>
&quot;keep their ears to the ground&quot; for any new opportunities and pass them
<br>
along to their contacts. This might even be a good subject for a separate
<br>
discussion group, but could certainly serve as the topic for numerous
<br>
threads on the various transhumanist lists.
<br>
<p>Just a thought.
<br>
