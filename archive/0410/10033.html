</em><br>
<p>You're right, I was trying to be polite. It's the apriori plausibility of 
<br>
the solution. You expressed bafflement at a psychological conundrum, but 
<br>
it's only a puzzle if those hold-outs agree with both the urgency of the 
<br>
threat *and* with the high likelihood that you, personally, can resolve it 
<br>
(and therefore deserve having some of their money donated to your efforts).
<br>
<p>As far as I can tell, the disconnect is in the second factor. You, Eliezer, 
<br>
appear utterly persuaded of your [nearly unique] capacity to address this 
<br>
challenge. My suspicion is that those holding back from sending you bucks 
<br>
big and small might not share this conviction. If that is possible, it 
<br>
would provide an explanation for the apparent inconsistency you are baffled 
<br>
and infuriated by.
<br>
<p>This comment offers no opinion pro or con concerning the truth of either 
<br>
factor. You might be right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I am dealing with a major existential risk, one that seems to incorporate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a loss by default if nothing is done.  If that doesn't qualify as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;sufficiently desperate&quot; I don't know what does.
</em><br>
<p>You're `dealing' with it? I think you're (1) proposing that it exists, 
<br>
providing various evidences for that opinion (somewhat plausibly, in my own 
<br>
view), and (2) telling people that you are on track to containing the risk 
<br>
(rather less plausibly, perhaps), and then (3) seeking donations to help 
<br>
you continue to do both. Wringing your hands over the `weird psychology 
<br>
that needs explaining' of those who fail to send you money seems to me 
<br>
either disingenuous or unnervingly innocent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;please grant me a probability high enough that you don't want to actively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get in my way while I'm working.
</em><br>
<p>Get in your way? You were the one soliciting an explanation for the `weird 
<br>
psychology that needs explaining'. Unless, of course, you weren't, and it 
<br>
was just a rhetorical ploy to browbeat laggardly donors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let me emphasize again that if you choose not to donate, you have no need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to justify that choice to me, or to anyone.  If you're satisfied with your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choice, do it without apology. ... You have no need whatsoever to post 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your justifications to this or any other mailing list!
</em><br>
<p>Apparently you can't hear how... Garner Ted Armstrong... this sounds to 
<br>
anyone not persuaded of your One Ring-bearer candidature. Oh well. (I speak 
<br>
as someone who invested more than a decade of intense self-funded effort in 
<br>
a research project done almost entirely alone that seemed to me to deal 
<br>
with one of the most terrible threats and opportunities the world had ever 
<br>
known. Rich or learned men gazed at me with kindly mockery or 
<br>
incomprehension as I solicited their [non-financial] assistance. Around the 
<br>
time I finally abandoned it, I learned that millions of dollars had been 
<br>
spent by the US government, in classified research, on precisely the same 
<br>
approach *at the same time I was doing my work* without any more success, 
<br>
it seemed, than I had attained. So it goes.)
