<p>
&quot;For example, suppose that we start with a Godel Machine that,
<br>
meta-level aside, starts with an object-level program that repeatedly
<br>
presses a button delivering the equivalent of a nasty electrical
<br>
shock.  If the meta-level speeds up the object level so that we get
<br>
nasty electrical shocks twice as fast, this is not an expected utility
<br>
improvement.&quot;
<br>
<p>In your analogy, &quot;pushing a button that produces nasty electrical
<br>
shocks&quot; is meant to correspond to &quot;proving theorems&quot;, and is bad
<br>
(results in a net utility loss), and is meant to be plausible because
<br>
the theorem-proving our theorem-proving machine is doing may be
<br>
fundamentally unsound (in that it may be proving some theorems true
<br>
that are actually false.) Correct?
<br>
<p>If so, then your problem arises without introducing the possibility of
<br>
our rewriting its own theorem-prover. Specifically, if one can solve
<br>
the current problem (roughly, &quot;How can we prove that a new
<br>
theorem-prover is an improvement, when that theorem-prover might be
<br>
wrongly proving falsehoods to be truths (pushing the electric shock
<br>
button)?&quot;) then one can also solve the problem &quot;How can we prove that
<br>
our original theorem-prover's proofs correspond to (and only to) true
<br>
propositions?&quot;
<br>
<p>We can't expect to prove that a theorem-prover's proofs correspond to
<br>
(and only to) true propositions, on pain of infinite regress (because
<br>
we can always question the fallibility of the meta-theorem-prover we
<br>
decided to use to prove the truth-correspondence of the object-level
<br>
theorem-prover).
<br>
<p>So the answer is, as you mentioned in passing, that we must assume, at
<br>
some level, correctness of our proof theory, even though the level at
<br>
which we make said assumption might be the proof-theoretic equivalent
<br>
of jabbing red zappy buttons in an unfortunate, catastrophe-birthing
<br>
manner. Our theorem-proving machine can only ever hope to rewrite its
<br>
theorem-prover with a performance-level improvement, not a
<br>
truth-correspondence-level improvement (other than accidentally, that
<br>
is).
<br>
<p>You won't ever find anything in the literature on how to prove that a
<br>
system of proof is infallibily truth-producing outside of the context
<br>
of said system of proof (or even how to prove that system-of-proof A
<br>
is more consistently truth-producing than system-of-proof B; not
<br>
outside of the context of system-of-proof A, B, or X) because even if
<br>
someone were to come up with something that looked like a proof that
<br>
&quot;wraps around&quot; as you put it, they (or the journal editors/referees)
<br>
would reject it as unsound, due to a reductio ad absurdum. Namely,
<br>
because it would contradict that which the rest of proof theory claims
<br>
is true; that wrap around is impossible -- truth is forever uncertain
<br>
at its base. We cannot avoid inserting potentially unsound
<br>
assumptions.
