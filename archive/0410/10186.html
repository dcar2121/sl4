<p>
I have done some thinking on the possibility to create a transhumanist
<br>
consulting firm. The rationale is that both large firms and
<br>
governments will need information and advice on how things will
<br>
change, how to make money with forthcoming changes, and what public
<br>
policies to implement. There are plenty of futurist think tanks, but
<br>
few willing to study radical medium/long term scenarios, still
<br>
considered like SF by the mainstream, including radical life
<br>
extension, conscious AIs, cryonics, brain implants, uploading, etc. We
<br>
do a lot of thinking on these issues for fun, it would be good doing
<br>
it also for money, and with the brainpower of some folks on
<br>
transhumanist lists I am sure we can provide a very useful service.
<br>
What I have in mind is a flexible partnership of indepedent
<br>
consultants where the income minus expenses is redistributed to
<br>
partners according to the
<br>
previously agreed amount of work done. If things develop well I will
<br>
be looking forward to doing this full time, and I hope to assemble a
<br>
team with a few core staff and a larger network of people available to
<br>
collaborate on a specific project basis.
<br>
Now I plan to start looking for partners and brainstorm to elaborate a
<br>
detailed plan.
<br>
I am not sure of the name and it is better not to rush, so to fix
<br>
ideas I have chosen the temporary name &quot;Transwer ltd&quot; and reserved the
<br>
domain transwer.biz.
<br>
We will switch to a better name if we find one.
<br>
<p>I have created the Yahoogroup transwerbiz:
<br>
<a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/transwerbiz/">http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/transwerbiz/</a>
<br>
<p>as a planning workspace, please join if you are interested as the
<br>
brainstorming will take place there.
<br>
Things to discuss are:
<br>
- Business model (what to sell to whom and how)
<br>
- Partnerships e.g. Foresight, CRNano, SIAI, the transhumanist
<br>
non-profit think tank under formation, etc.
<br>
- Where to incorporate and in which form
<br>
- Name and domain name
<br>
- Organization
<br>
- Business development
<br>
While I am mainly interested in the European market, a possibility is
<br>
incorporating branches in different places.
<br>
I have many ideas, some I believe quite promising, but I prefer
<br>
disclosing them on the Yahoogroup which is restricted and not visible
<br>
to the world. Also, I assume that many people on the lists are not too
<br>
interested, so the polite thing to do is continuing the discussion on
<br>
a separate list. So again, please join if you are interested.
<br>
