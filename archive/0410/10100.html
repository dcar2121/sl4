</em><br>
<p>Whilst agreeing that SIAI's illumination of these to aspects of AI has been 
<br>
a high point, I cannot agree that it is the greatest accomplishment.  Both 
<br>
the difficulty of AI and the danger of unsafe AI have been pointed to 
<br>
numerous times by numerous people in the past.
<br>
<p>The various documents Eliezer has put together, including CFAI, LOGI and 
<br>
more recently the CV postings to the Wiki are innovative and contain new 
<br>
insights.  Surely these would qualify as greater accomplishments than the 
<br>
aforementioned illustrations.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What conflict are you referring to?  Please be specific.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do we really want to live under the control of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI with a rigid set of goals, even if those goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow represent the average of all humanity?
</em><br>
<p>Straw man.  No one at SIAI has suggested this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; An AI that may be incapable of considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative merits of intuitionist vs classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathmatics, because we don't know how to program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such capabilities into the AI, or considers this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity a waste of time, because we don't know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to embed such pursuits into its goal structure?
</em><br>
<p>More phantoms... where are you getting this stuff?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Many of us are interested in the Singularity partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the hope of one day being able to solve or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least explore with greater intelligence long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing moral and philosophical problems.
</em><br>
<p>These goals I share.  SIAI's plans do not disallow this outcome, on the 
<br>
contrary they enable it.
<br>
<p><p>[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; Since AI is only a means, and not an end, even to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SIAI (despite &quot;AI&quot; in its name), I wonder if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's time to reevaluate its basic direction.
</em><br>
<p>I have seen no reasonable arguments for a change of direction.  Greater 
<br>
intelligence that is friendly to humans will give us the tools 
<br>
(intelligence) needed to avoid existential disasters that loom larger every 
<br>
day.  What is your alternative?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps it can do more good by putting more resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into highlighting the dangers of unsafe AI, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore other approaches to the Singularity, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example studying human cognition and planning how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do IA (intelligence amplification) once the requisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies become available.
</em><br>
<p>There are others already doing this.  See Kurzweil et al.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Of course IA has its own dangers, but we would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting with more of a known quantity.
</em><br>
<p>We currently do not know all of the details about how humans work.  Of what 
<br>
we do know we have already identified many areas and occasions where our 
<br>
cognition is irrational.  I for one do not wish to place my fate in the 
<br>
hands - mind, rather - of irrational beings.  To the extent that this 
<br>
happens already (modern political system) I am unnerved, to put it mildly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Even if things go bad, we end up with something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is at least partly human and unlikely to want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fill the universe with paper clips.
</em><br>
<p>If 'things go bad' it doesn't matter if the UFAI is partly human or not: you 
<br>
will be just as dead.
<br>
<p><p>Let us face the problem (of UFAI) squarely, and solve it (with FAI).  Just 
<br>
because it is a big problem that we don't currently have a clear answer to 
<br>
doesn't mean we should flinch from tackling it.
