This statement is already 1000 pts worth according to my

own scoring scheme. ;)

Altough Barbour's ideas are already mathematically formulated
<br>
for the non-quantum case, he does not pretend to have
<br>
an exact theory for the case incorporating quantum-mechanics.
<br>
He wrote down his intuition, but he clearly indicates where
<br>
the formally justified thinking ends and where the intuitive part
<br>
begins. He is quite honest to admit that he is not sure about
<br>
the general case which is an open problem.
<br>
<p>In fact Barbour's ideas would be rightly stamped foolish had not
<br>
he already demonstrated the viability of his approach by
<br>
giving a novel description of Einsteins general relativity.
<br>
This is his real achievment. Barbour can tell the difference
<br>
between mathematically backed part and and speculative part.
<br>
<p>Your postings however show a complete lack of differentiation.
<br>
You talk about mathematics, where there is none, instead you
<br>
bore us with psudo-equations and pontification.
