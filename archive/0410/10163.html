<p>Indeed.  There is little evidence that thinking ability declines with age, 
<br>
and the evidence that we have indicates a very slow tailing off affecting 
<br>
mostly the speed of processing rather than the depth.  I have personally 
<br>
observed, in myself and many others, that changing habits of thought have 
<br>
far more effect on the level of mental output than any other factor.  These 
<br>
habits may be affected by one's age and socio-economic situation, but a 
<br>
great deal of wilful control (of ones habits) is possible.

</em><br>
<p>Pressure, and expectations for particular behaviour, have a profoundly 
<br>
negative affect on ones cognitive processes.  This is a well established 
<br>
experimental result.  I second Samantha's wise advice: concentrate on the 
<br>
job.  You are not alone in this thing, although at times it might seem that 
<br>
way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Only so much can be done in your head.
</em><br>
<p>Agreement.  There is so much to learn by implementation of various parts of 
<br>
FAI.  Not the least of which is the deeper understanding of the problem by 
<br>
the ones doing the implementing.  There is a significant probability that 
<br>
such partial implementations would help improve theory.  At the very least 
<br>
problem areas would be thrown into stark relief.

<p><p><em>&gt; If SIAI doesn't find a deeper source of funding and

</em><br>
<p>It has to be said, and thank you Samantha for saying it this time.  It is 
<br>
definitely not too soon to start &quot;building the tech traction&quot;.  Who cares if 
<br>
great gobs of code have to be thrown out if the theory needs to be revised? 
<br>
Its almost certain to happen anyway, as that is the nature of blue sky 
<br>
projects.
