Hi Christian,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, why do I think that your refutation attempt is flawed:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your wrote that the construction of Penrose can not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be performed since the human mind is not a Turing machine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a finite state machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, every finite state-machine can be modelled by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Turing machine, so I think that the the construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Penrose can be still performed.
</em><br>
<p>But his argument depends on a property of Turing machines, namely
<br>
the ability to do arithmetic with arbitrary integers, not shared
<br>
by finite state machines. So his argument fails by assuming a
<br>
capability that humans do not have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More concretely, you wrote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here is where the argument breaks down. With Turing machines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we said there must be some integer k such that the Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; TM_k will give the same answer to the question encoded by n that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; TM_b gives to question Q2. The integer k exists because we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; construct a Turing machine TM_x that converts any positive integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; n into the index of question Q2, and we can combine TM_x and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; TM_b to get TM_k. But there is no finite state machine that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convert an arbitrary integer n into the index of question Q2'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, for  Penrose's argument to work, it is irrelevant whether TM_k
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a finite state-machine. The only important point is whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reader can be modelled by a Turing machine TM_b or not. Everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that his argument depends on assuming an ability
<br>
in his Turing machine model not possessed by the human brains
<br>
being modeled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't solve anything by answering that his argument is flawed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the human brain is an even more restricted type of Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine. Then, he could ask: &quot;How comes that an even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restricted type of Turing machine can solve such a hard problem?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does not it really show that the human brain in fact is *not* a finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state machine?
</em><br>
<p>This is the funny thing about infinite sets: they have
<br>
very different properties than finite sets. By assuming
<br>
that humans can do things that require infinite sets of
<br>
states, he has moved his argument into a realm irrelevant
<br>
to human brain behaviors.
<br>
<p>I would note that some of the most interesting approaches
<br>
to AI, such as those by Pei Wang and James Rogers, are
<br>
based on the very explicit assumption that brains have
<br>
finite capacities and avoid the implicit infinite states
<br>
assumed in things like traditional stack recursion and
<br>
list processing.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Bill
