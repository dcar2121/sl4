<br>
<p>That absolutely *does not* rule out this avenue of approach. Many
<br>
respected journals and conferences in the relevant areas are
<br>
blind-reviewed (such that the academic credentials of the author of
<br>
the paper is made irrelevant, because the author's identity &amp; other
<br>
info is kept secret), and even among the many which are not quality
<br>
submissions are never rejected or looked down upon simply due to the
<br>
lack of a Ph.D. by the author.
<br>
<p>As for gaining a research position at a university, while a Ph.D. is
<br>
commonly thought to be a prerequisite, there are a number of points to
<br>
keep in mind:
<br>
<p>1.  Having a track record of doing quality research is more important
<br>
than having any particular degree. Bureaucratic morons who would
<br>
refuse a great researcher just because of lack of PhD are not
<br>
ubiquitous (e.g., Freeman J. Dyson, of Dyson Sphere fame, who spent
<br>
his career as a physics professor at Princeton and Cornell, never
<br>
received his Ph.D.)
<br>
<p>2.  If lacking a PhD really becomes a problem... well, why not get
<br>
one? PhD students get living stipends and support for their research.
<br>
So even being a PhD student may well put Eliezer in a better position
<br>
to pursue his research than the current scenario allows. Further, if
<br>
he (or anyone else involved) doesn't like the idea of being forced to
<br>
take 2 years of coursework for the PhD, he could always pursue the PhD
<br>
outside of the U.S., where PhDs are pure research degrees with no
<br>
course requirements.
<br>
<p>3.  There are a couple of schools (e.g., The University of Technology,
<br>
Sydney, in Australasia) that award PhDs by prior publication. After
<br>
applying, you put together a portfolio of your research, and write an
<br>
overarching paper that illustrates your contribution to the field of
<br>
study, and if deemed PhD-level, you are granted a PhD. I've come
<br>
across at least a few professors in the UK and elsewhere who have
<br>
received their doctorates in this manner. (I've also seen quite a few
<br>
professors with just Master's, but this falls back to point 2 above).
<br>
<p>Of course, most people aren't aware of some or all of the above, so
<br>
your reason may be Eliezer's reason. But I hope that, if it is, it
<br>
ceases to be in light of these facts.
<br>
<p>Jeff
