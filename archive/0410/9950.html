Hi Bill,
<br>
<p>Now I have read your writing thorougly and my opinion is
<br>
that neither your nor Penrose's arguments are conclusive.
<br>
<p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>First, why do I think that your refutation attempt is flawed:
<br>
<p>Your wrote that the construction of Penrose can not
<br>
be performed since the human mind is not a Turing machine,
<br>
but a finite state machine.
<br>
<p>However, every finite state-machine can be modelled by
<br>
a Turing machine, so I think that the the construction
<br>
of Penrose can be still performed.
<br>
<p>More concretely, you wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is where the argument breaks down. With Turing machines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we said there must be some integer k such that the Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TM_k will give the same answer to the question encoded by n that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TM_b gives to question Q2. The integer k exists because we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct a Turing machine TM_x that converts any positive integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; n into the index of question Q2, and we can combine TM_x and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TM_b to get TM_k. But there is no finite state machine that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convert an arbitrary integer n into the index of question Q2'.
</em><br>
<p><p>In fact, for  Penrose's argument to work, it is irrelevant whether TM_k
<br>
is a finite state-machine. The only important point is whether the
<br>
reader can be modelled by a Turing machine TM_b or not. Everything
<br>
else is irrelevant.
<br>
<p>You don't solve anything by answering that his argument is flawed
<br>
because the human brain is an even more restricted type of Turing
<br>
machine. Then, he could ask: &quot;How comes that an even more
<br>
restricted type of Turing machine can solve such a hard problem?&quot;
<br>
Does not it really show that the human brain in fact is *not* a finite
<br>
state machine?
<br>
<p>Still, I don't think that Penrose is right on this point.
<br>
But my opinion is that it does not have anything to do with
<br>
the question whether we are FSMs or not.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Now, let me come to my refutation of the argument of Penrose:
<br>
<p>Assume that we have a Turing Machine AFRM (average formal
<br>
reasoning machine) which is capable of formal reasoning about
<br>
as well as an average theorem prover today
<br>
(it can even be a finite state machine, but it does not matter).
<br>
<p>Furthermore, we formalize the situation described by Penrose
<br>
informally in his book. Then ask AFROM the same question
<br>
formally we were asked informally by Penrose.
<br>
<p>I would bet that AFRM would find the correct answer quite
<br>
quickly. (This is an experiment that could be
<br>
performed in reality and would be a very impressive
<br>
demonstration why his argument fails)
<br>
<p>How does it come? Simply, because the correct answer can be
<br>
easily formally deduced from the premises that are the
<br>
*real input*.
<br>
<p>I think that the error in the argument of Penrose is that the
<br>
problem was posed to the reader in a different format than he
<br>
pretended to pose it.
<br>
<p>This format is easily interpreted and solved. In its real format:
<br>
when k is explicitely written down (assuming of course that
<br>
we are Turing machines, since k depends on the index of the
<br>
TM modelling the reader)  it can not be answered (and this is a
<br>
mathematical fact).
<br>
<p>So, the reason why his argument fails is that he does not
<br>
actually ask the reader the question
<br>
&quot;Will TM_k stop on input k?&quot;
<br>
,but:
<br>
&quot;Take an extremely complicated true statement S the answering
<br>
of which  exceeds your mental capabilities.  Is S true or not?&quot;
