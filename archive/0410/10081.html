Eliezer asks to those who donated to speak up. I just donated 50
<br>
bucks, I am sorry I was not able to donate more at this time. What
<br>
Eliezer is doing is good, and we should support it.
<br>
I am replying to the message with the question, why the Raelians are
<br>
so much more successful than us. In another message in another thread
<br>
(only on sl4), Ben Goertzel writes:
<br>
&quot;Religion is the one major case of people taking things distant from
<br>
their everyday life seriously ... but this is arguably because
<br>
religion gives people a lot of psychological comfort, and helps build
<br>
comforting social structures.&quot;
<br>
and I reply:
<br>
&quot;I think Ben is making a very, very good point here.
<br>
Is there a way we could edit our message, without compromising it of
<br>
course, in such a way as to provide *also* psychological comfort?
<br>
I will risk heresy and confess that I am beginning to think current
<br>
projects to &quot;engineer a transhumanist religion&quot; (see e.g.
<br>
universalimmortalism.org) are actually good ideas.&quot;
<br>
Now I wish to reply to the inevitable accusations of heresy before
<br>
they are formulated, and elaborate some more.
<br>
Imagine a Tiplerian omega-point scenario. Or if you think Tipler's
<br>
physical assumptions are wrong, imagine some other scenario with the
<br>
omega-point property: at some point in the future, a human
<br>
civilization may develop the capability to acquire detailed high
<br>
resolution information from the past (not against casuality), and use
<br>
it to retrieve the information content of human minds in their past,
<br>
perhaps including ourselves here and now. It seems plausible that a
<br>
civilization with that kind of technology will also be able to easily
<br>
upload such information to another body or a virtual environment.
<br>
So we can build a worldview that includes a concept of resurrection
<br>
while at the same time staying compatible with our rational scientific
<br>
worldview. We can derive standard moral principles: for this to happen
<br>
it is necessary that our specie survives, and, assuming resources will
<br>
be large but limited, it seems reasonable to think that Mother Theresa
<br>
will be revived before Hitler. Also, we can derive transhumanist moral
<br>
principles: for this to happen it is necessary that our species
<br>
evolves fast and acquires more and more control on mind and matter.
<br>
All that and more in Tipler's book.
<br>
Perhaps if this universal immortalism were a part of our message, or
<br>
maybe even its front-end for those who need a religious worldview, it
<br>
would be much easier to win minds and hearts.
<br>
