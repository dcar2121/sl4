<p>
I thought this would be of interest to a number of people on this
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>It would appear that a new strategy has been submitted, that can
<br>
consistently outperformed tit-for-tat in the Iterated Prisoner's
<br>
Dilemma(IPD).  The strategy involves a predetermined authentication
<br>
sequence of initial moves to identify colluding agents in each
<br>
iteration.
<br>
<p>Here a link to the IPD competition's results:

<p>News Release
<br>
<em>&gt;From the University of Southampton
</em><br>
<p>Ref: 04/151

<br>
<p>University of Southampton team wins Prisoner's Dilemma competition
<br>
A solution that allows computer agents to collude, rather than compete
<br>
with each other, has won this year's recreation of Axelrod's classic
<br>
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma competition. 
<br>
<p>The winning solution was devised by a team from the University of
<br>
Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) which
<br>
met the competition's 20th anniversary challenge to resolve the
<br>
original dilemma in a noisy environment where moves could be
<br>
misinterpreted.
<br>
<p>Professor Nick Jennings, a member of the ECS winning team said: 'We
<br>
developed ways of looking at the Prisoner's Dilemma in a more
<br>
realistic environment and we devised a way for computer agents to
<br>
recognise and collude with one another despite the noise. Our solution
<br>
beats the standard tit-for-tat strategy.'
<br>
<p>The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has been of interest to the world of
<br>
computer science since the publication of Robert Axelrod's seminal
<br>
book in the 1980s. It presents a simple game between two prisoners, in
<br>
which their combined choices to co-operate or defect, determines
<br>
whether they are imprisoned or walk free. Both players make a choice
<br>
and then their decisions are revealed and both receive scores.
<br>
<p>Up to this year, the most common strategy applied to the dilemma was
<br>
tit-for-tat which consistently outperformed every strategy entered in
<br>
the original competition. It starts out by co-operating, and then
<br>
punishes any strategy that defects by defecting on the next move.
<br>
<p>The solution devised by ECS uses coding theory to enable agents to
<br>
recognise one another and to transmit messages reliably over noisy
<br>
communication channels. No outside communication is allowed so the
<br>
agents have to recognise one another by playing a specific sequence of
<br>
moves at the start of each game.
<br>
<p>Dr Alex Rogers, another ECS team member said: &quot;A key question in
<br>
future computing systems is how the different agents within the system
<br>
should interact and co-operate. Working on simple models such as the
<br>
Prisoner's Dilemma gives a fundamental understanding of how to tackle
<br>
these problems.&quot;
