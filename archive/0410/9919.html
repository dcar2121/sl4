There is a relevant table and graph about 40% of the
<br>
way down this page:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.markelowitz.com/exobiology.htm">http://www.markelowitz.com/exobiology.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The definition of a planet (&lt;13xJupiter Mass) vs
<br>
brown dwarf (13-70x Jupiter mass) is that a planet
<br>
never gets hot enough in formation to cause
<br>
deuterium fusion (~2M Kelvin), while a brown
<br>
dwarf fuses deuterium but not hydrogen.
<br>
<p>The masses quoted on the page are M sin(i) where
<br>
i is the unknown inclination.  The radial velocity
<br>
doppler shift of the primary star is how most of
<br>
these objects are being found.  If the secondary
<br>
object orbits edge on (i=90 deg), the doppler shift
<br>
is maximized.  If the object orbits face-on (i=0
<br>
deg), the shift would be zero. Since we don't
<br>
know the inclination (for now), we only know
<br>
M sin(i).  Therefore the actual mass is larger by
<br>
some unknown amount.  So some of the objects
<br>
listed will turn out to be brown dwarfs rather than
<br>
planets.  The significance of that is brown
<br>
dwarfs got hot from gravitational collapse and
<br>
deuterium fusion, and have not had time to cool
<br>
off to a temperature that supports life as we
<br>
know it, i.e. T(surface)&gt;1000K at present.
<br>
<p>As a side note, our Jupiter is still cooling off
<br>
from it's formation too.  It releases twice as
<br>
much heat from the interior as it receives from
<br>
the sun.  But it is small enough that it is no
<br>
longer glowing hot at the surface.
<br>
<p>You can see the number of objects gets larger
<br>
as the M sin(i) gets smaller, which is the encouraging
<br>
trend I noted previously.  
<br>
<p>The table lists:
<br>
<p>M sin (i) which I have discussed above,
<br>
P(d) - orbital period in days.  We are biased towards
<br>
short orbital periods because orbits like Jupiter's
<br>
have a half period (6 years) which is longer than
<br>
the time we have had instruments this good to observe
<br>
with.  You need to observe a half orbit or more to
<br>
measure the maximum doppler shift
<br>
a - semimajor axis of orbit.  In a circular orbit
<br>
that is just the radius.  In an elliptical orbit that
<br>
is the half the long axis.  We are biased towards
<br>
small orbits because they increase the doppler shift
<br>
e - eccentricity, defined as ratio of ellipse focus
<br>
distance from center/semimajor axis.  Values are
<br>
0 for circle to 1.0 for parabola. A sizeable fraction
<br>
are in the range of our solar system's planets
<br>
(0 to 0.2 neglecting Pluto).
<br>
K(m/s) is the doppler shift in meters/sec.  Since
<br>
the width of a star's spectral line is at least
<br>
due to the random motion of the atoms that create
<br>
the line, which is several km/s, what is actually
<br>
being measured is a doppler shift of a few percent
<br>
of the width of the line, which is why these
<br>
measurements are hard to do.
<br>
<p>The web page talks a lot about how narrow the
<br>
range of conditions is for 'life as we know it' to
<br>
develop, since most stars get hotter over time.
<br>
Therefore the orbit range over which liquid water
<br>
can exist shifts.  Thus the range over which
<br>
liquid water exists for the 3.5 billion years of
<br>
evolution time is narrow.
<br>
<p>I suggest he failed to account for large moons of
<br>
large planets or brown dwarfs (see Europa), where
<br>
the combination of tidal heating and direct
<br>
radiation from the larger object (cooling over time)
<br>
counteracts the star's brightening.
<br>
<p>As I had said in an earlier message, the data are
<br>
not quite good enough to say much about Earthlike
<br>
planets yet, but give it another 5-10 years and it
<br>
will be.
