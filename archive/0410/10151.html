<p>
<em>&gt;&gt;  And no, I'm not trying to imply anything about cults here, but I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; trying to point out the common factor between the two organizations which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is that, assuming it's next to impossible to truly understand CFAI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; LOGI, commitment to these projects requires faith in implementation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; belief that the means will lead to intended end. One cannot aspire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rationalism and rely on faith at the same time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; But it is not impossible to understand CFAI or LOGI.  Some stretches in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places, lots of questions that might be answered but the answer is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately obvious, but certainly not impossible to understand.
</em><br>
<p><p>It isn't impossible to understand CFAI and LOGI, but only *next* to 
<br>
impossible. Obviously, it's possible to understand both, but there is an 
<br>
awful lot of prerequisite material one needs be familiar with to comprehend 
<br>
the papers. Far too much for any average donor who doesn't plan on becoming 
<br>
a Seed AI programmer. As I said before, I suspect there are only two people 
<br>
on this list who seem to truly understand the theory of AI and Friendliness. 
<br>
One of them is Eliezer, and the other is not me. The rest is hoping 
<br>
everything will turn out fine.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But why exactly is full comprehension necessary?  Isn't all that is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary sufficient understanding to see the rightness of the Cause plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reasoned believe that SIAI can actually achieve or take a good stab at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving it?
</em><br>
<p><p>Not when you start thinking about the consequences of the cause you are 
<br>
supporting. SIAI failing to build safe and humane SI is not the worst thing 
<br>
that can happen. The worst thing that can happen is, actually, SIAI 
<br>
succeeding at making SI that would later turn Unfriendly. It makes sense to 
<br>
support the cause when it is shown how the project won't lead to UFAI in a 
<br>
way potential donors can understand. In absence of comprehension, the only 
<br>
thing left is trust.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Increased donations give you greater power to influence the world. Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; see anything wrong in entrusting a small group of people with the fate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entire human race? What would you tell people objecting to that idea? Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we have the right to end the world as we know it without their approval?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you see anything wrong with people going about their merry way without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bothering to note or respond to imminent disaster?
</em><br>
<p><p>What's the imminent disaster?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Do you see harm in those that do see it coming deciding to do nothing at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all?
</em><br>
<p><p>Depends on what they see. If the threat of disaster is real and imminent, 
<br>
then, yes, they should be doing something about it. However, what if the 
<br>
threat isn't real or likely?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Do you require that a very large group be present and democratically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable to everyone, including all those you said were incapable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding, before anything can be done to address the situation?
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm just saying that there's something wrong with letting 10-15 people who 
<br>
we barely even know, let alone trust, decide the fate of all humanity while 
<br>
120 million people will soon have their voice heard on the issue as trivial 
<br>
in comparison as 2004 U.S. presidential election.
