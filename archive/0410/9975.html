</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, what I object to is your using &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; in your problem

<p>You are a reflective system constructed in such a way as to allow explicit 
<br>
self-reference, permitting me to name you to yourself without providing you 
<br>
a copy of your data.  Or do you seriously mean to tell me that you don't 
<br>
know what I refer to by &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you try to formalize &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; using computation theory, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're already assuming the thing Penrose is trying to prove -- so the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Diagonalization is odd here here because we don't know anything about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cardinality of the set of possible statements, since we don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cardinality of the set of possible beings such as &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are postulated to live in some huge space of uncomputably complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities.
</em><br>
<p>I just meant diagonalization in the sense of, &quot;When Ben Goertzel is asked 
<br>
the question produced by substituting 'When Ben Goertzel is asked the 
<br>
question produced by substituting X for &quot;X&quot; in X, will his answer be no?' 
<br>
for 'X' in 'When Ben Goertzel is asked the question produced by 
<br>
substituting X for &quot;X&quot; in X, will his answer be no?', will his answer be no?&quot;
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Penrose would say that the correct formalization of &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; involves some unknown physics, and plausibly involves uncomputably large
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sets of propositions...
</em><br>
<p>Penrose requires that there be no way to describe a human with any kind of 
<br>
physically realizable map such that I can isolate a variable X in the map, 
<br>
copy the map and perform the diagonalization trick.  Otherwise I can still 
<br>
present you with the question.
<br>
<p>Penrose thinks we know that Godel's Statement is true when we don't, and 
<br>
that's a definite error on his part, and my reason for saying that Penrose 
<br>
misunderstands Godel's Theorem.
<br>
<p>Penrose also asserts with no proof whatsoever that humans are not subject 
<br>
to diagonalization, and backs it up by asserting that humans are 
<br>
uncomputable (and presumably physically indescribable); he gives us 
<br>
absolutely no reason to believe this assertion, but uses it as his argument 
<br>
that humans have a mystical ability (why? he hasn't shown that we can 
<br>
*solve* our diagonalization, just argued that we somehow physically don't 
<br>
have one), which in turn is his sole basis for asserting humans to be 
<br>
uncomputable.
