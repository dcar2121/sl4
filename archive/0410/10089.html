&lt;Comments on Intelligenesis/Webmind snipped&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Eli, I pretty much agree with all your comments -- except with the comment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Webmind Inc. got further than my current businesses before it failed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Webmind Inc. had more money and staff, based on venture funding, but it
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; never profitable; whereas my current businesses are small but profitable,
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure they're really less far along than Webmind Inc. by business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not arguing that what I'm doing now with Novamente is a great strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in general, and I'm not necessarily recommending it to others.  I think
</em><br>
it's
<br>
<em>&gt; a reasonably decent strategy for me and Novamente right now, but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on a host of particular contextual factors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
For those of us in business, those contextual factors can obviously be
<br>
all-important. For example, I was talking to some people in the company I'm
<br>
in about a very limited, non-obvious use of technology based on existing
<br>
facial recognition programs (whatever the state-of-the-art happens to be in
<br>
those areas). Though I do work in a computer-related field, developing AI is
<br>
definitely _not_ on our agenda or one of our areas of core competency. On
<br>
the other hand, we could conceivably be a market for certain kinds of
<br>
primitive-AI-related programming, or subcontract such work from other
<br>
enterprises. And in that fashion, we could help AI projects at the fringes.
<br>
<p>Or AI projects being developed by for-profit enterprises, anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I have not yet succeeded in getting rich nor in completing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman AGI, I *am* succeeding in paying some clever folks to work on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Novamente AGI system via my AI-based startup businesses.  That was my
</em><br>
point,
<br>
<em>&gt; which is valid whether or not I ever get rich or ever succeed in creating
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; superhuman AGI (though I hope to do both!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do think that others could follow this same sort of strategy.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance that James Rogers is doing so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think creating limited AI programs -- expert systems, voice recognition,
<br>
facial recognition, etc -- may be a good route for businesses and academics
<br>
who want to contribute to this field but don't have a clue where to begin on
<br>
the big issues and can't join an institution which does. That way, they
<br>
could at least be putting together useful products that are pointing in the
<br>
right direction, and thus proving the utility of such &quot;blue-sky&quot; research
<br>
and also helping to maintain a pool of talent that is working on problems
<br>
relevant to AI researchers.
<br>
<p>On a related subject -- could anyone say what the approximate budget and/or
<br>
revenues are for any of these AI researching institutions or businesses? For
<br>
example, if someone had a lot of excess cash, what kind of contribution
<br>
would pay for the Singularity Institute's entire annual budget? I know
<br>
someone who may be coming into a considerable amount of money over the next
<br>
few years, and who has a notable interest in these matters.
