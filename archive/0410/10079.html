<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;80% of all new businesses fail.  Even with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;excellent business plan, I think Eliezer is right, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;chances of success wouldn't rise above 50%.  Also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;correct is that the business would become your life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;You'd have to do nothing else for at least 5-10 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I am doing AGI research plus running 2 small narrow-AI-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; businesses.  It's hard but not impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Duly noted, but I must point out that you have not yet *succeeded* in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making lots of money off the narrow businesses and simultaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing a successful AI.  So you haven't quite proved it's a workable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea, at least not yet, even leaving aside all safety issues.  The two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small businesses might be a good beginning, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligenesis/Webmind got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much farther than that before it failed.  Even if some AI progress was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvageable into Novamente, that probably was not the outcome you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originally had in mind when you founded Intelligenesis.  Meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no offense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by it, just pointing out that there's farther to go before the for-profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy is validated as one that can succeed all the way to the end.
</em><br>
<p>Eli, I pretty much agree with all your comments -- except with the comment
<br>
that Webmind Inc. got further than my current businesses before it failed.
<br>
Webmind Inc. had more money and staff, based on venture funding, but it was
<br>
never profitable; whereas my current businesses are small but profitable, so
<br>
I'm not sure they're really less far along than Webmind Inc. by business
<br>
standards.
<br>
<p>I'm not arguing that what I'm doing now with Novamente is a great strategy
<br>
in general, and I'm not necessarily recommending it to others.  I think it's
<br>
a reasonably decent strategy for me and Novamente right now, but that's
<br>
based on a host of particular contextual factors.
<br>
<p>While I have not yet succeeded in getting rich nor in completing a
<br>
superhuman AGI, I *am* succeeding in paying some clever folks to work on the
<br>
Novamente AGI system via my AI-based startup businesses.  That was my point,
<br>
which is valid whether or not I ever get rich or ever succeed in creating a
<br>
superhuman AGI (though I hope to do both!).
<br>
<p>I do think that others could follow this same sort of strategy.  I believe
<br>
for instance that James Rogers is doing so.
