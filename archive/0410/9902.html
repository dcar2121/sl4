My understanding of the issue was seriously muddled. I still don't

understand it, but at least I don't incorrectly think that I understand

it anymore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regardless, all the people I know of who are actually developing AGI and

</em><br>
I agree. It was mainly an answer (based on a muddled understanding of
<br>
the relevant issues) to a specific question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;All-Work-And-No-Fun&quot;-mind may well be among the first things I'd do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;after uploading, so some of my possible future selves would likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;penalized by an implementation of your suggestions. My opinion on those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;suggestions is therefore probably biased...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I don't think that what I would (intuitively) call 'consciousness' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by definition eudaemonic, but since I don't have any clear ideas about
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Argh. Firstly, intuition is worse than useless for dealing with these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts. Secondly, you shouldn't even be considering self-modification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you don't have a clue about the basic issues involved. Without that
</em><br>
I wasn't seriously considering it. An FAI shouldn't allow me to do any
<br>
self-modifications that would lead to undesirable consequences;
<br>
predictions about what I would do after uploading assume that a present
<br>
FAI would allow (and, for that matter, not actively discourage) it. If I
<br>
uploaded without there being an FAI present, I probably wouldn't play
<br>
with internal variables of my mind until I understood enough about the
<br>
system to do it reasonably safely.
<br>
Thanks for the warning about intuition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you might as well adopt the principle of indifference regarding what you
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve?)
</em><br>
Well, I mentioned what it was (&quot;objective morality&quot;), blissfully unaware
<br>
that it didn't make any sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Why? I don't understand why the activities mentioned before the quoted part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;(&quot;humor, love, game-playing, art, sex, dancing, social conversation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;philosophy, literature, scientific discovery, food and drink, friendship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;parenting, sport&quot;) are relevant for the value of human life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What else does human life (as distinguished from say a theorem proving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program running on your PC) consist of?
</em><br>
Aside from complexity? Nothing important, morally (for some values of
<br>
moral) speaking. I didn't (and still don't) assume that there was any
<br>
fundamental difference in moral relevance between the two.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;From the perspective of an agent, that is striving to be non-eudaemonic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;(me) the proposed implementation looks like something that could destroy a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;lot of efficiency at problem-solving. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From the perspective of the majority of humanity, why should we care? Being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less efficient just means that things take longer. Assuming we've dealt with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the competition problem, what's the hurry?
</em><br>
You shouldn't care. Agents striving to be non-eudaemonic are afaict
<br>
currently very rare, and unlikely to get significantly more numerous in
<br>
the future. There are plenty of other people with more resources at
<br>
their disposal who may perceive your research as a threat; seriously
<br>
considering this unimportant a group of potential enemies undoubtedly
<br>
isn't the best use of your resources.
<br>
As for the moral aspect, if you assume that all eudaemonic agents are
<br>
intrinsically morally relevant and all non-eudaemonic ones are not, any
<br>
eudaemonic agent striving to become non-eudaemonic will simply be
<br>
considered insane. Whether that means that you should try to stop them 
<br>
from becoming non-eudaemonic, or let them do it, and, assuming they 
<br>
succeed, then severely limit their rights, is imho a comparatively minor 
<br>
issue; in any event, seriously considering the opinions of lunatics is 
<br>
also a waste of resources.
