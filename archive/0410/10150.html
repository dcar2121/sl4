</em><br>
<p>I think it's more enlightening and more important to ask whether
<br>
consciousness involves strange *meta*physics, and whether an AI
<br>
can be expected to notice this.
<br>
<p>In the 20th century, physics was elevated above metaphysics; indeed,
<br>
metaphysics was variously attacked as unknowable, meaningless, or
<br>
irrelevant. Within academic philosophy, metaphysics has made a quiet
<br>
comeback, but it continues very much to play second fiddle to physics.
<br>
Metaphysics today (at least in the English-speaking world) cringes before
<br>
physics; it is an exercise in clarification and interpretation. Cause, 
<br>
property,
<br>
substance, space, time, being - these were the concerns of metaphysicians,
<br>
before mathematical physicists ever came along. Now we have the new
<br>
phenomenon of tenth-decimal-place agreement between experiment
<br>
and equation, but an equation by itself is not a theory. Even a set of rules
<br>
relating experimental measurements to an equation is not much of a theory.
<br>
A &quot;theory of everything&quot; is a statement about existence. It should say what
<br>
exists, what sort of things exist, why they exist, it should even say 
<br>
something
<br>
about what existence itself &quot;is&quot;. By that criterion, we are nowhere near
<br>
having a theory of everything. We have an empirically adequate &quot;standard
<br>
model&quot;, we have a variety of mathematical conceptions touted as the next
<br>
or final theory, and then we have a variety of conflicting metaphysical or
<br>
anti-metaphysical opinions regarding the meaning of the equations, which
<br>
form a new chapter in the long history of philosophy's inability to reach
<br>
consensus on anything.
<br>
<p>Do we have any idea how to make an AI that can answer metaphysical
<br>
questions? We don't. At best we know how to get it to work within a
<br>
pre-ordained philosophical framework - and most likely that will be a
<br>
framework derived from the 20th-century storehouse of anti-metaphysical
<br>
systems (pragmatism, positivism, linguistic philosophy). If aspiring AIers
<br>
want a concrete benchmark, I'd suggest Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*.
<br>
If you can produce a cognitive-scientific account of what Kant was doing
<br>
when he wrote that book, you may be making progress towards AI that
<br>
is philosophically capable.
