</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But it is not impossible to understand CFAI or LOGI.  Some stretches in

places, lots of questions that might be answered but the answer is not 
<br>
immediately obvious, but certainly not impossible to understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've noticed a Matrix quote in your essay, (&quot;Don't think you are, know

</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I'm convinced that Matrix trilogy is an overlooked masterpiece, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much farther ahead of its time than Blade Runner ever hoped to be, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think Mr. West was correct. Comprehension is indeed a requisite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for cooperation, and as long as you are unable to find a way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome the &quot;comprehension&quot; requirement, I don't think you should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to find donors who don't understand exactly what you are doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer will no doubt answer this.  But why exactly is full 
<br>
comprehension necessary?  Isn't all that is really necessary sufficient 
<br>
understanding to see the rightness of the Cause plus a reasoned believe 
<br>
that SIAI can actually achieve or take a good stab at achieving it?   
<br>
Now, I don't know that SIAI will succeed.  I believe Eliezer is a 
<br>
brilliant theorist but that he cannot succeed without either becoming 
<br>
or recruiting some very strong software architects and implementation 
<br>
experts.   I am not at all sure he is able to or interested in the 
<br>
leading of such a team.
<br>
<p>I also believe that much more effective evangelism that reaches people 
<br>
of various levels of understanding will be required to raise sufficient 
<br>
funds and sufficient passion in the required very gifted people.  
<br>
Eliezer has expressed a lack of interest in this area.   Possibly he is 
<br>
correct that he can't do this work or that it is a terrible 
<br>
distraction.  Without such multiplying effect of an effective 
<br>
evangelistic spread of support there will not be much hope of turning 
<br>
even the best of theories into actual reality.
<br>
<p>Donating to the SIAI at least gives it a chance to get strong enough to 
<br>
recursively self-improve into an organization fully equipped for the 
<br>
work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's say I'm a potential donor. How do I know, despite sincere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentions of the organization to save the world, that the world won't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;drift toward tragedy&quot; as a result of FAI research made possible in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part by my donation? How do I know what you know to be certain without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending next 5 years studying?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You don't.  But you probably do know that the world as it is currently 
<br>
drifting is all too likely bound for great disaster - disaster large 
<br>
enough to potentially destroy humanity or at least set it back 
<br>
generations and kill billions.    I have thought that there must be 
<br>
other ways to avoid such an outcome, ways that do not involve something 
<br>
as quickly beyond our control.  But the world is already evolved beyond 
<br>
our control and is inadequately intelligent and inadequately 
<br>
intelligible to minds as limited as our own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why SIAI team would need so much money to continue building FAI if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty of creating it does not lie in hardware? What are the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Besides the obvious that this current request was to retain a favorable 
<br>
tax status, the work  requires a great deal of very fine brains working 
<br>
quite hard and effectively for some time.  That takes working capital 
<br>
to create and maintain.   That the hardware is not the difficult part 
<br>
does not mean that a considerable sum in mostly currently existing 
<br>
hardware is not required.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Increased donations give you greater power to influence the world. Do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you see anything wrong in entrusting a small group of people with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fate of entire human race? What would you tell people objecting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that idea? Do we have the right to end the world as we know it without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their approval?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you see anything wrong with people going about their merry way 
<br>
without bothering to note or respond to imminent disaster?   Do you see 
<br>
harm in those that do see it coming deciding to do nothing at all?   Do 
<br>
you require that a very large group be present and democratically 
<br>
accountable to everyone, including all those you said were incapable of 
<br>
understanding, before anything can be done to address the situation?
