<p>Ah, you are probably writing like the scribes of Ancient Egypt. :)
<br>
<p>Stand back and think laterally for a minute. With all our modern
<br>
technology and literary training, what techniques do we have that
<br>
might speed up the process?
<br>
<p>You may be confusing the research and thinking process with the
<br>
writing process. They are not the same thing and don't have to be done
<br>
at the same time. Once you have done the research, the actual writing
<br>
can indeed be done more efficiently.
<br>
<p>You can research this for yourself, now that I've drawn your attention
<br>
to it, but here are a few suggestions.
<br>
<p>First, you don't have to do it all yourself.
<br>
The most prolific authors dictate to a secretary or voice recorder.
<br>
The menial job of keying all the data into a word processor is then
<br>
taken away from you. The secretary can also do grammar and spell
<br>
checking, page layout, etc.
<br>
<p>Second, it's one thing to be a writer, it's quite another actually doing it. 
<br>
For many, writing well in a compressed period of time seems impossible. 
<br>
But you can write quickly and write well.
<br>
<p>Here are some hints that might help.
<br>
<p># Do the research first. Collect your facts and examples. Research
<br>
thoroughly before you begin writing. Get what you need to address who,
<br>
what, when, where, why, and how. Be sure to verify names, titles, and
<br>
anything else you'll need to include.
<br>
<p># Organize your research data. Make a map connecting each piece of information.
<br>
It might be a simple or elaborate outline -- whatever works for you.
<br>
Write the headings on 3 x 5 cards and organize your research
<br>
(clippings, notes, etc.) beside each card.
<br>
<p># Write it / Dictate it. Quickly. Stack your research and start
<br>
working through the pile as fast as you can. Don't worry about
<br>
transitions or try to write perfectly the first time. Relax, have fun,
<br>
and get something into the word processor. Just keep writing all the
<br>
thoughts that occur as you work through your research, even if they
<br>
are incomplete.
<br>
<p># Leave it. Walk away. When you've exhausted your research pile and/or
<br>
feel you're struggling, stop. Take a break. Let it cool off. Your
<br>
secretary will do all the transcribing while you have a run round the
<br>
park.
<br>
<p># Clean it up afterwards. Good writing is concise. Use no more and no
<br>
fewer words than necessary. Cut the fluff. No matter how magical a
<br>
phrase seems, cut it if it doesn't fit the flow or the core point.
<br>
Rewrite and rearrange your paragraphs. Often a buried paragraph makes
<br>
the best lead. Double check your facts and attribute all your quotes.
<br>
<p># Say what you need to say and then stop! Stick to the point and don't
<br>
write past it.
<br>
<p># Read what you've written out loud and fix what doesn't sound right. 
<br>
The ear hears what the eye misses. You will be amazed at how this
<br>
dramatically improves the quality of your writing.
<br>
<p># Know when to let it go. Stop tweaking it to death. You're good at
<br>
what you do so have confidence in what you've written.
<br>
<p><p>Best wishes, BillK
