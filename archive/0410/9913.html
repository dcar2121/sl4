<em>&gt;The situation you mention is also a limited wireheading event, since

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I only said that happiness was a more important goal than most. I didn't
<br>
claim that it should be treated as a super-goal, and I don't think I
<br>
understand myself well enough to know how to describe my super-goal.
<br>
Resolving conflicts such as those between happiness and a long life is
<br>
a normal (even if unpleasant) task.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That might not be a good idea if you consider consistency to be a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I consider consistency to be a good subgoal.

<p>&nbsp;I didn't intend to imply that becoming fully informed was simple. Omniscience

is sufficiently unusual that bemoaning its absence seems odd.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;something more intelligent than you has to take your preferences and apply

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;discontinuities, but that further complicates the problem of not letting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge that the CV process is a simulation affect the result.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Ok, that's a clearer explanation of a possible problem. If that's the
<br>
biggest problem with CV, I'm not terribly scared of CV (although I'm still
<br>
thinking about the alternatives).
