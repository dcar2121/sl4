<em>&gt; Here's a thought experiment:  If I offered people, for ten dollars, a pill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that let them instantly lose five pounds of fat or gain five pounds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muscle, they'd buy it, right?  They'd buy it today, and not sometime in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indefinite future when their student loans were paid off.  Now, why do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few people get around to sending even ten dollars to the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute?  Do people care more about losing five pounds than the survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the human species?  For that matter, do you care more about losing five
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pounds than you care about extending your healthy lifespan, or about not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying of an existential risk?  When you make the comparison explicitly, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds wrong - but how do people behave when they consider the two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in isolation?  People spend more on two-hour movies than they ever get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around to donating to the Singularity Institute.  Cripes, even in pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entertainment we provide a larger benefit than that!
</em><br>
<p><p>Eliezer, I think your involvement in this project has caused you to lose a 
<br>
bit of the sense of objectivity necessary to evaluate true options included 
<br>
in your thought experiment, and I infer that from your question: &quot;Do people 
<br>
care more about losing five pounds than the survival of the human species?&quot; 
<br>
What this question implies is the assumption that donating to SIAI equates 
<br>
to preventing existential risks from happening. Your question has an obvious 
<br>
answer. Of course people care more about survival of human species than 
<br>
losing five pounds, but how do we know that SIAI, despite its intentions, is 
<br>
on a straight path to implementing humanity-saving technology? What makes 
<br>
your organization different from, say, an organization that also claims to 
<br>
save the world, but by different means, like prayer, for instance? And no, 
<br>
I'm not trying to imply anything about cults here, but I'm trying to point 
<br>
out the common factor between the two organizations which is that, assuming 
<br>
it's next to impossible to truly understand CFAI and LOGI, commitment to 
<br>
these projects requires faith in implementation and belief that the means 
<br>
will lead to intended end. One cannot aspire to rationalism and rely on 
<br>
faith at the same time.
<br>
<p>I've noticed a Matrix quote in your essay, (&quot;Don't think you are, know you 
<br>
are&quot;). There is an equally interesting quote from Reloaded you might agree 
<br>
with, and it is when Cornel West responds to one of Zion's commanders, 
<br>
&quot;Comprehension is not requisite for cooperation.&quot; And even though I'm 
<br>
convinced that Matrix trilogy is an overlooked masterpiece, much farther 
<br>
ahead of its time than Blade Runner ever hoped to be, I don't think Mr. West 
<br>
was correct. Comprehension is indeed a requisite for cooperation, and as 
<br>
long as you are unable to find a way to overcome the &quot;comprehension&quot; 
<br>
requirement, I don't think you should expect to find donors who don't 
<br>
understand exactly what you are doing and how.
<br>
<p>Let's say I'm a potential donor. How do I know, despite sincere intentions 
<br>
of the organization to save the world, that the world won't &quot;drift toward 
<br>
tragedy&quot; as a result of FAI research made possible in part by my donation? 
<br>
How do I know what you know to be certain without spending next 5 years 
<br>
studying?
<br>
<p><p>Other questions:
<br>
Why SIAI team would need so much money to continue building FAI if the 
<br>
difficulty of creating it does not lie in hardware? What are the real costs?
<br>
<p>Why the pursuit of fame has now become a just reason to support SIAI? Are 
<br>
you suggesting that SIAI has acknowledged that ends justify means?
<br>
<p>Increased donations give you greater power to influence the world. Do you 
<br>
see anything wrong in entrusting a small group of people with the fate of 
<br>
entire human race? What would you tell people objecting to that idea? Do we 
<br>
have the right to end the world as we know it without their approval?
<br>
<p>These are difficult questions which perhaps illustrate the difficulty of the 
<br>
deceptively simple choice to support, or not to support SIAI.
<br>
