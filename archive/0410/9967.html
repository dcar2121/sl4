<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, it's not true that Penrose misinterprets Godel's Theorem.  Not at

</em><br>
<p>I posted this to wta-talk on July 28th:
<br>
<p>****
<br>
<p>I don't have the time to dissect Penrose's Godelian argument in detail, but
<br>
many, *many* others have done so; you can find it by Googling, e.g.,
<br>
Penrose refutation.  I'd recommend the refutations found in PSYCHE:
<br>
<p><a href="http://psyche.csse.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-23-penrose.html">http://psyche.csse.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-23-penrose.html</a>
<br>
<p>A *fast* summary of Penrose's math error is this:
<br>
<p>Godel actually did prove:
<br>
<p>1)  If and only if first-order arithmetic is consistent, a certain
<br>
sentence, the Godel sentence, is true but not provable in first-order
<br>
arithmetic.
<br>
<p>The above statement is, itself, provable in first-order arithmetic - it is
<br>
*not* something that humans can see but machines can't!
<br>
<p>2)  Because the above statement *is* provable in first-order arithmetic, it
<br>
follows that a proof in first-order arithmetic of the consistency of
<br>
first-order arithmetic could be used to prove the Godel sentence in
<br>
first-order arithmetic.  Therefore first-order arithmetic can prove the
<br>
consistency of first-order arithmetic if and only if first-order arithmetic
<br>
is inconsistent.
<br>
<p>Which is to say:
<br>
<p>1)  If first-order arithmetic is consistent, it contains sentences which
<br>
must be either true or false (by the Law of the Excluded Middle, a theorem
<br>
of classical logic albeit not intuitionistic logic), but which cannot be
<br>
proved or disproved in the system (neither the sentence nor its negation
<br>
has a proof within first-order arithmetic).
<br>
<p>2)  If first-order arithmetic is consistent in the sense that the formal
<br>
system will never produce a theorem stating &quot;P and not-P&quot;, first-order
<br>
arithmetic will never produce a proof of its own consistency.  (Because the
<br>
proof of consistency could be used to prove the Godel sentence which states
<br>
that no proof of the Godel sentence exists, thus creating a contradiction
<br>
within the system, thus contradicting our beginning assumption that
<br>
first-order arithmetic was consistent.)
<br>
<p>Or to summarize even further:
<br>
<p>1)  If first-order arithmetic is consistent there are true sentences that
<br>
cannot be proven within the system, such as Godel's sentence.
<br>
<p>2)  If first-order arithmetic is consistent, it cannot prove its own
<br>
inconsistency.
<br>
<p>Penrose's Big Mistake:
<br>
<p>Penrose assumes that humans know first-order arithmetic to be consistent,
<br>
in which case we could conclude Godel's sentence to be true, and we would
<br>
have access to a knowledge not provable in first-order arithmetic.  Penrose
<br>
also assumes, completely without justification, that no program can share
<br>
the human outlook which leads us to this knowledge; but it is not needful
<br>
to go into that.  Penrose's primary premise is wrong.  Humans don't know
<br>
that first-order arithmetic is consistent.  We just have faith in it
<br>
because it has always worked so far.
<br>
<p>Humans *know* (can prove, as opposed to taking on faith) that first-order
<br>
arithmetic is consistent if and only if it cannot prove its consistency.
<br>
This statement is itself provable in first-order arithmetic.
<br>
<p>Godel's Theorem does not establish that humans know anything not knowable
<br>
to first-order arithmetic - let alone establish that human intelligence is
<br>
beyond all mechanism, whatever that is supposed to mean.
<br>
<p>****
<br>
<p>Today I would add that, although it is possible to prove the consistency of
<br>
first-order arithmetic in ZF, whether you trust that proof depends on
<br>
whether you believe in the consistency of ZF - I think.  If not, substitute
<br>
ZF (and the appropriate Godel statement) for &quot;first-order arithmetic&quot; in
<br>
all sentences above.
