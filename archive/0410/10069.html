Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 80% of all new businesses fail.  Even with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent business plan, I think Eliezer is right, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances of success wouldn't rise above 50%.  Also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct is that the business would become your life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'd have to do nothing else for at least 5-10 years.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I am doing AGI research plus running 2 small narrow-AI-based
<br>
businesses.  It's hard but not impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, and this is probably the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, but wasn't mentioned by Eliezer, running a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful business requires a certain mind-set, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone said that there are lots of clever people, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't they get rich quick?  Well, brains aren't what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required.  Business is all about people skills I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think.  I judge that Eli does not have the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology for business.  Asking him to run a business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about as sensible as asking a hard-arse Hollywood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exec to become an FAI researcher.  Wrong psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I'd be the first to admit that I don't have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology for business either.
</em><br>
<p>I basically agree with this -- I think Eliezer probably isn't cut out for
<br>
business, and I would not recommend him to pursue a business path unless he
<br>
were inspired to do so.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, no one ever thought I was cut out for business either --
<br>
and, although I'll never be a typical businessman nor a world-class one, I
<br>
believe that after many years of learning I'm finally doing a decent job in
<br>
the business domain....  Sometimes you don't know what you have inside you
<br>
until you plunge into a situation and force yourself to find out ;-)
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
