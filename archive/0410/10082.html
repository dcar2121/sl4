<p><p>80% of all new businesses fail because of 80% of all people starting  
<br>
new businesses are new TO business  -- the distribution of who fails is 
<br>
far from random.  For people that have been around long enough to have 
<br>
figured out how it all works in practice (i.e. been through a few 
<br>
failures or marginal businesses), it seems that they have something 
<br>
around an 80% *success* rate.  There is a learning curve.
<br>
<p>This is one of the reasons that it is always a good idea to hand over 
<br>
the reins to a competent and experienced executive if you are new-ish 
<br>
to the game if possible.  First-timers hate to do this because they 
<br>
feel like they are losing control of &quot;their&quot; business, and they usually 
<br>
learn the lesson the hard way by making all the same mistakes 
<br>
first-timers do.  If you can't pull off both attracting competent 
<br>
executive talent and giving up control of the company, you probably 
<br>
shouldn't be betting the farm on a venture.
<br>
<p><p>Most people are neither careful enough nor disciplined enough (or lucky 
<br>
enough) to be successful in business the first time around.  My first 
<br>
attempts at starting companies were ridiculous failures.  I haven't had 
<br>
a venture fail in many years (though some never really took off), but I 
<br>
would *still* defer to a really experienced and competent executive 
<br>
given the opportunity to do so in a business.  After all this time, the 
<br>
most I can really say is that I am confident that when I start 
<br>
businesses they are unlikely to crash and burn.
