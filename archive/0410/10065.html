<p>
80% of all new businesses fail.  Even with an
<br>
excellent business plan, I think Eliezer is right, the
<br>
chances of success wouldn't rise above 50%.  Also
<br>
correct is that the business would become your life. 
<br>
You'd have to do nothing else for at least 5-10 years.
<br>
<p>Finally, and this is probably the most important
<br>
point, but wasn't mentioned by Eliezer, running a
<br>
successful business requires a certain mind-set, a
<br>
certain psychology.
<br>
<p>Someone said that there are lots of clever people, why
<br>
can't they get rich quick?  Well, brains aren't what's
<br>
required.  Business is all about people skills I
<br>
think.  I judge that Eli does not have the right
<br>
psychology for business.  Asking him to run a business
<br>
is about as sensible as asking a hard-arse Hollywood
<br>
Exec to become an FAI researcher.  Wrong psychology. 
<br>
And I'd be the first to admit that I don't have the
<br>
psychology for business either.   
<br>
<p>I really really don't know what the solution to the
<br>
funding problem is.  I do wish Sing Inst well.
<br>
I can only point out again the reasons why I think few
<br>
are donating:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) most people don't understand Sl4 concepts
<br>
and (2) those who have the right psychology for SL4
<br>
concepts are highly individualistic and skeptical of
<br>
authority by nature, which makes co-operation
<br>
difficult.  I think Eli correctly analysed the problem
<br>
here in the Raelian discussion.  Dangerous to be
<br>
half-rationalistic and so forth.
<br>
<p>Can I just say, I recognize that a Singularity is
<br>
*quite likey* and that there is *quite possibly* an
<br>
Existential risk in the not too distant future.  But
<br>
this is still far from clear.
<br>
<p>I think that Sing Inst supporters have to admit to
<br>
themselves they can't be *very sure* that this is , in
<br>
fact, the case.  Even Eliezer cannot possibly know
<br>
what the actual time-line for existential risk is, and
<br>
what will, in fact, actually happen at Singularity.
<br>
<p>It is not in fact the case that the risk is something
<br>
that is *really obvious*.  Only a far bit of thinking
<br>
can persuade one that there is in fact, a real risk
<br>
here.  And it is not in fact the case that we know
<br>
that the risk is actually near-term.  Personally I do
<br>
not think that there is any real significant
<br>
existential risk until around 2030 and beyond.  This
<br>
could be wrong.  The probability of the extinction of
<br>
humanity could rise significantly far earlier than
<br>
this date.  But who can honestly say they can make
<br>
accurate risk assessment?  So the situation does not
<br>
appear to one to be as *obvious* as say a big asteriod
<br>
coming towards one (although the situation could quite
<br>
definitely be just as urgent).
