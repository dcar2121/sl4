<em>&gt;&gt;That's it. That's the whole fuss silly philosophers
</em><br>
make over reductionism 
<br>
and holism.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Philosophers get all weirded out about how water
</em><br>
appears to have this 
<br>
magical additional property of wetness. This error is
<br>
yet another case of 
<br>
Jaynes's &quot;Mind Projection Fallacy&quot;. Philosophers think
<br>
as if explanations 
<br>
were somehow real things, instead of explanations
<br>
being cheap imperfect 
<br>
approximations of physics. 
<br>
<p>I would like to publicly take offence at the wild generalization about
<br>
Philosophers. As an amatuer Philosopher, much like yourselves, I think
<br>
it absurd that 'Philosophers' as a group - as if they were some sort of
<br>
entity - are being singled out and labelled as silly and all of the same
<br>
opinion. What you're talking about is the distinction between measuring
<br>
reality with instruments that are standardised (empiricism) and using
<br>
the un-standardised tool we all have in our heads. I like to think that
<br>
anyone can understand that as long as we assume the unchanging nature of
<br>
reality, which we have to, then empirical measurements are a more
<br>
reliable way of finding out information that we can use in future. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Physicists think as if 'physics' was somehow a real
</em><br>
thing which could exist independently of a mind to
<br>
comprehend it....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is the distinction between 'explanations' and
</em><br>
'physics'?  I must confess I do not see it.
<br>
<p>Physics is testable. Anyone anywhere in the world could follow
<br>
instructions for an experiment in physics and find out exactly the same
<br>
results as anyone else, understanding an explanation relies upon
<br>
understanding language which is vague at the best of times - and most
<br>
concepts, like the concept of wetness depend upon previous experience of
<br>
the concept itself. Hopefully the idea that to understand wetness one
<br>
has to have experienced it, helps you understand the force of something
<br>
empirical as oppose to just an explanation. The reason that even
<br>
concrete experience of 'wetness' for example is still inadequately
<br>
reliable is that everyone has a different instrument to measure it with
<br>
- their body (including their brain and therefor their mind). Physics is
<br>
only superior to simple explanations because of instruments used in
<br>
experiments, and maths is another fine example of a standardised
<br>
instrument.
<br>
<p>Steve, A Philosopher.....
