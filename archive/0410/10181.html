I was quite annoyed by Ben's put down and dismissal of my comments on his
<br>
paper.  For the record, he didn't dispute even one of the arguments that I
<br>
posted.  He could have just said he disagreed and left it at that or just
<br>
ignored my post.  If his goal in posting the essay to this list wasn't to
<br>
get comments, then why post it?
<br>
<p><p><p>My primary disagreement with his essay had to do with *defining* a pattern
<br>
as having sympathy. (My other major disagreement is his relating patterns
<br>
and evolution to compassion but I will leave that one for now.)  Contrary to
<br>
what he wrote in reply, I think I *do* understand what he means by
<br>
&quot;pattern-sympathy&quot;.  If you look at historical data, you can see
<br>
correlations on a consistent basis between similar patterns.
<br>
<p><p><p>I think I understand why Ben thinks of AI and (from the article) many other
<br>
topics in terms of patterns and why he gives these patterns human qualities.
<br>
(erroneously!)
<br>
<p><p><p>When we look into the past, all we see are patterns.  We might see a pattern
<br>
of a hungry lion just about to catch the gazelle and then see the pattern of
<br>
the gazelle being eaten.  If we looked at a large number of these examples,
<br>
we would see a pattern that some might say was one pattern predicating (if
<br>
not creating) the next pattern.  After all, if we usually see a dead gazelle
<br>
pattern after seeing a charging lion pattern, you might be lead to that
<br>
conclusion.  I have seen this first hand at a large &quot;Financial Wealth
<br>
Company&quot; that tried to predict future bond trends by looking at the past.
<br>
(Very limited success and not better than many good analysts, the company
<br>
already had!)
<br>
<p><p><p>The problem is that history is all about the patterns.  These patterns are
<br>
static and easy to see,  but they display the results of the algorithms from
<br>
the past that we can't see.  The patterns don't generate each other, the
<br>
algorithms do.  We can guess about these algorithms but we can only be sure
<br>
of algorithms that exist right now. (Even this is not so easy.)  If the
<br>
pattern we see is a runny nose, that pattern by itself cannot tell us
<br>
whether the cause was a virus, pollen in the air, a little bug or some other
<br>
cause.  All we know is that the nose is running.  The problem is the classic
<br>
chicken and egg.  Do patterns create algorithms or do algorithms create the
<br>
patterns?  If we take a pattern and look at it, no matter how long you look
<br>
at it, it does nothing.  No matter how fancy!  Algorithms are the *do* but
<br>
patterns are the results we are looking for.  One is not useful without the
<br>
other but there is an arrow of causality.
<br>
<p><p><p>A program that just looks at patterns and has no algorithms to work and
<br>
change the patterns will result in the old adage &quot;garbage in is garbage out&quot;
<br>
.  The way to get the machine to increase it's intelligence is by making use
<br>
of existing (programmed algorithms) in novel contexts.  The other way is to
<br>
have more and better algorithms put into the computer so that it has
<br>
something to work from.  I am not talking about the method used to build
<br>
&quot;Cyc&quot;.  I am talking about strategies for arriving at objectives given a set
<br>
of constraints. (This short desciption defines what a model can do.)  This
<br>
is why I believe that the inside, the base of AI will be in modeling.
<br>
Modeling can bring together any useful input and depending on the model, you
<br>
can see the intermediate results.  This cannot be said for neural nets,
<br>
agent systems, formal logic, expert systems etc.
