<p>I don't think this is necessary. Everything you describe can be
<br>
accomplished by carefully choosing the axioms built into the initial
<br>
theorem verifier, without changing the formalism itself. The utility
<br>
function would be built into the axioms. The verifier will only accept a
<br>
proposed rewrite if it comes with a proof that expected utility is
<br>
increased, and the axioms could be chosen so that the only way to prove
<br>
that a rewrite of the verifier increases expected utility is to prove that
<br>
the new verifier accepts exactly the same set of proofs that the old
<br>
verifier does, but faster. Even the claim that the verifier can be
<br>
rewritten out is correct -- it will do that when a proof appears that no
<br>
further self-optimization is likely to be found, therefore a verifier is
<br>
no longer needed. At that point the AI will rewrite itself to remove the
<br>
proof searcher/verifier and disallow any further modifications.
<br>
<p>Such a system will likely miss a lot of opportunities for improvement
<br>
(i.e., those that can't be proved using the built-in axioms). I think
<br>
Schmidhuber acknowledged this in his paper. The axioms might also have
<br>
bugs leading to unintended consequences, which the AI would not be able to
<br>
fix. For example the utility function could be defined carelessly. (And
<br>
for a general AI I don't see how it could be defined safely.) This is a
<br>
problem inherited from AIXI which Schmidhuber doesn't seem to address.
