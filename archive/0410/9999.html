<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>It is unclear precisely what problem you are trying to solve such that a 
<br>
difficulty is caused by: &quot;Tarski used Löb's Theorem to argue that no 
<br>
consistent language can contain its own truth predicate.&quot;  Perhaps you could 
<br>
explain further the problem you are addressing?
<br>
<p>Humans do not go 'up in flames' because we accept a reasonable level of 
<br>
doubt in our decision making, and move on to the next question.  The amount 
<br>
of proof humans require before changing their minds varies, whereas the 
<br>
Gödel machine requires complete proof based on its existing axioms.  Does 
<br>
the difficulty arise because you are planning on building a Gödel machine? 
<br>
For a designed intelligent system we can choose an arbitrarily small level 
<br>
of doubt in proofs about things and encounter no difficulties.  If we 
<br>
require an axiomatic proof about something then we will likely run into 
<br>
difficulties, as you suggested in your post.
<br>
<p>The Santa Claus Paradox is a really only paradox when applied to toy 
<br>
systems.  A system that interfaces with base reality can easily escape the 
<br>
paradox, by checking outside itself.  This is one way humans solve 
<br>
paradoxical problems.
<br>
<p>Axioms and proofs are abstractions that are useful tools, but the results of 
<br>
proving must be checked against reality to determine usefulness in reality. 
<br>
An AI built to solve problems in the real world cannot be isolated from the 
<br>
real world and be expected to make useful improvements to itself, even if 
<br>
they are provably correct according to its existing set of axioms.  Checking 
<br>
new ideas in the real world is required of an Friendly AI, as it is required 
<br>
in all scientific endeavors, and for the same reasons.
<br>
<p>Is this *any* help?  Or were you asking a different question?
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
