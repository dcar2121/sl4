<p>
Hello, all. I suppose I may be the oldest SL4 on the list. As a nine-year
<br>
old kid, I used to dream about how I would create machines so small they
<br>
were built out of atoms, and use those machines to achieve feats that would
<br>
demonstrate my effective omnipotence. This idea emerged, incidentally,
<br>
because I wanted to be able to use &quot;real&quot; magic. And with no &quot;real magic&quot;
<br>
being discussed in my science books, I turned to the subtlest super-machines
<br>
I could imagine. Reasoning that if the means by which something were done
<br>
were sufficiently invisible and effortless, it would somehow count as magic
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>What's more, I used to dream of a great ship full of &quot;men&quot; who had
<br>
transformed themselves into perfect, ultra-powerful robots. They &quot;fought&quot;
<br>
with a ruthless force of evil cyborgs who were, despite their cunning and
<br>
ruthlessness, nothing more than an angry butterfly to their &quot;human AI&quot;
<br>
protectors. No matter how outrageous or stupid a tactic they might try,
<br>
lightspeed reactions and nigh-infinite intelligence could always gently
<br>
thwart it at the last possible moment. The &quot;good guys always won.&quot; =)
<br>
<p>By the time I was twelve, these superwarriors had evolved into a band of
<br>
seemingly omnipotent AIs that were effectively sentient black holes, and
<br>
looked suspiciously like giant, shape-shifting Muppets. At this point, I was
<br>
convinced that in order to build them, I'd have to start with the
<br>
near-infinite computing power made possible by constructing computers on the
<br>
atomic scale, and evolve them from there. With possible stages including
<br>
atomic scale optical computers, integrated bio-chips, etc. In the final form
<br>
in which they served me -- they doubled as actors for the characters in
<br>
elaborately constructed books, movies, TV shows, comics and so forth in my
<br>
head, as I was an unusually creative kid -- they were simultaneously
<br>
independent minds as well as a collective, and they had an unimaginably
<br>
powerful supercomputer backing them up (the ominously named, &quot;Omnus&quot;) who
<br>
spent time as a Dyson Sphere before evolving into a higher, far denser form
<br>
back in their transdimensional Vault (hey, they were living black holes with
<br>
perfect control over their own gravity fields. They used wormholes to go
<br>
_everywhere._ Wouldn't you? =) ). So my vision of myself was as a seemingly
<br>
unmodified human (or _extremely_ subtle cyborg) who had the knowledge and
<br>
powers of an entire species of AIs constantly on tap, as well as the service
<br>
of an absolutely loyal &quot;god-computer.&quot;
<br>
<p>This all took place prior to the Engines of Creation, of course (basically
<br>
between 1979 and 1982 or so). Aside from the Technarch species in the comic
<br>
book The New Mutants (early 80s) I can't really think of any proper nanotech
<br>
(assemblers and all) floating around in the popular culture before Drexler's
<br>
book. I suspect my own ideas were fed, at least in part, by Feynman and some
<br>
version of his lecture in one of the books I used to read about atoms and
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p>But the point of all that is to say that the Singularity is kind of an old
<br>
idea for me -- it went without saying that my imaginary AIs were improving
<br>
all the time, with incomprehesible swiftness. Such was the pace of their
<br>
thoughts.
<br>
<p>Moving up towards the present, I've had a great interest in a wide variety
<br>
of human enhancement methods for over ten years now, have been working to
<br>
launch a business in cooperation with some other entrepreneurs, and tend to
<br>
focus on getting rich and doing a great deal of good through for-profit
<br>
works as well as outright charitable gestures. I believe that having (and
<br>
using) substantial financial resources is the best way to position myself to
<br>
impact human evolutionary questions.
<br>
<p>I am quite interested in human advancement and evolution, suspect that true
<br>
AI may prove extremely challenging but still feel it should be explored
<br>
intensively, and consider the likelihood of some kind of &quot;slow Singularity&quot;
<br>
happening in the 10 to 25 years to be fairly high, if certain actors move as
<br>
I expect they will over the next several years and nothing untoward (like a
<br>
global thermonuclear war) interferes.
<br>
<p>Ralph
