<p>
I think SIAI's greatest accomplishment so far is to illustrate how hard it
<br>
would be to build a safe AI, and how dangerous an unsafe AI would be. To
<br>
me, its critical work has been a lot more persuasive than its constructive
<br>
work. So much so that I no longer think that building a safe AI is the
<br>
best route to the Singularity. It's too hard, the the cost of failure is
<br>
too great. Further work in the same direction may be counterproductive. It
<br>
will increase the probability of a safe AI slightly, but could increase
<br>
the probability of an unsafe AI more, especially if SIAI were to publish
<br>
results that could be used by others less concerned with safety, as some
<br>
are suggesting.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it seems there is a conflict between safety and other
<br>
desirable qualities, such as open mindedness and philosophical curiosity.  
<br>
Do we really want to live under the control of an AI with a rigid set of
<br>
goals, even if those goals somehow represent the average of all humanity?
<br>
An AI that may be incapable of considering the relative merits of
<br>
intuitionist vs classical mathmatics, because we don't know how to program
<br>
such capabilities into the AI, or considers this activity a waste of time,
<br>
because we don't know how to embed such pursuits into its goal structure?
<br>
<p>Many of us are interested in the Singularity partly in the hope of one day
<br>
being able to solve or at least explore with greater intelligence long
<br>
standing moral and philosophical problems. How will we be able to do that
<br>
if we're all under the control of an AI with built-in moral and
<br>
philosophical certainties (i.e., axioms or the equivalent of axioms)?  
<br>
But how can we make probable that it's safe without such axioms? Not to
<br>
mention that we have little idea what these axioms ought to be.
<br>
<p>Since AI is only a means, and not an end, even to the SIAI (despite &quot;AI&quot;  
<br>
in its name), I wonder if it's time to reevaluate its basic direction.  
<br>
Perhaps it can do more good by putting more resources into highlighting
<br>
the dangers of unsafe AI, and to explore other approaches to the
<br>
Singularity, for example studying human cognition and planning how to do
<br>
IA (intelligence amplification) once the requisite technologies become
<br>
available. Of course IA has its own dangers, but we would be starting with
<br>
more of a known quantity. Even if things go bad, we end up with
<br>
something that is at least partly human and unlikely to want to fill the
<br>
universe with paper clips.
