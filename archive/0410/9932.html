<em>&gt; Eliezer, I've often asked myself what your new, non-mysterious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of consciousness *is*. You tell us to embrace mundane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reductionism, but that doesn't answer the question. Everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is, is physical, you seem to say. So: does consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist or not? If it does exist, what sort of physical entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it, and how are the various subjective attributes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness explained? If it does not exist, then in what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms am I to interpret the fact of my own existence, and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Consciousness&quot; is that vague term we use to describe being aware of 
<br>
being aware.  Many dynamic systems can be said to be aware of their 
<br>
environment, since they react and respond to it.  Some of the more 
<br>
complex systems, such as humans, can introspect, and are thus aware of 
<br>
being aware.  All of this appears to be explainable in reductionist 
<br>
terms -- there is no need to posit an elan vital or any other mysterious 
<br>
element.
<br>
<p>When you say &quot;the fact of my existence&quot; you are making the same 
<br>
assumption as Descartes.  You are assuming that there is a Self that is 
<br>
somehow an independent observer.  Yet the simplest explanation (meaning 
<br>
the one that doesn't require anything mysterious) is that your sense of 
<br>
self is exactly what would be reported by such a mechanistic system.  
<br>
When you ask your self how you feel, you are using exactly those 
<br>
mechanistic process to ask and to answer the question.  All gaps, 
<br>
distortions, delays, discontinuities, etc., in your processing are 
<br>
handled by the system as determined by its structure, and at some point, 
<br>
the system reports how it feels.  You can't not feel like a Self, 
<br>
because &quot;you&quot; are the result of that system. 
<br>
<p>But the system has evolved the capacity of abstract reasoning to the 
<br>
level that it can conceive of such a structure without an independent 
<br>
observer, without any mysterious Self, and can consider the mounting 
<br>
evidence that the &quot;direct of experience of Self&quot; that so many take as a 
<br>
given, is an illusion.
