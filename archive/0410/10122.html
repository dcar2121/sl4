</em><br>
<p><p>I don't actually know if 80% of ventures by &quot;experienced&quot; entrepreneurs 
<br>
are successful, but that is my anecdotal experience.  Assuming you can 
<br>
put together a reasonably good idea, ventures are all about execution, 
<br>
and that usually gets better with time such that each venture is more 
<br>
successful (or less screwed up) than the last.  There are always those 
<br>
that don't learn, but they usually stop trying eventually.
<br>
<p>After a couple ventures, you've already learned most of the painful 
<br>
lessons of running a venture AND you are well-known to the venture 
<br>
capitalists and money people, which is a very significant resource in 
<br>
itself.  A lot of VCs are wary of people who have never failed, as that 
<br>
tends to indicate a lot of luck and a lack of practical experience with 
<br>
worst case scenarios.  Also, experienced entrepreneurs tend to run in 
<br>
herds, and when they want to start something, they'll bring in and 
<br>
attract other experienced folks that they worked with at other 
<br>
successful ventures, improving the quality of the initial team.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is an interesting point, though I think you could add that with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of smaller business ventures (such as purchasing and renting out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplex for significantly more than the cost of taxes, upkeep, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property management), the learning curve isn't always so sharp. There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely small start-ups that don't require you to get a seasoned, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Yale-trained executive mastermind to run your pretzel stand, for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.
</em><br>
<p><p>I was referring to startups that deal primarily with technological 
<br>
innovation, the specialty of Silicon Valley and presumably the class of 
<br>
startup that would be dealing in AI.  My prognostication has only 
<br>
limited application to other lines of business.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Having said that, I've noticed that the venture I'm in has benefited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from having a number of experienced people around -- generally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; team where just about everyone is extremely experienced and/or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talented at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some key element of the business (the law, our specific field, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying technology, the needs of our primary customers, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product development, etc). We managed to start this company with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little money but with several key people willing to put in enormous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equity.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is precisely how it is done.  No dead weight whatsoever -- a 
<br>
startup cannot afford it.
<br>
<p>A common problem is the useless executive.  There are herds of people 
<br>
that exist to only do &quot;executive-like&quot; things but which bring no 
<br>
measurable benefit, and survive by hiring their other executive 
<br>
friends, moving from company to company.  These people are often hard 
<br>
to weed out too until you see them in action.  A successful tactic used 
<br>
at one of my ventures by the CEO and founder when looking for 
<br>
executives (including his own replacement) was to ruthlessly hire and 
<br>
fire, forcing them to deliver.  Even with a careful screening process 
<br>
up front, only about one out of three executives actually made the 
<br>
grade when the pressure was on and the rest had to be fired.  A lot of 
<br>
startups find &quot;experienced&quot; execs but never have the courage to can the 
<br>
guys when they don't deliver.
<br>
<p>That said, the benefit of having a top-notch experienced executive team 
<br>
cannot be overstated.  The founders of most companies are not suited 
<br>
for the job.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My point is that if someone here were interested in starting an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI-development or related business, there are avenues for attracting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that don't necessarily require bucketloads of up-front money. Just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.
</em><br>
<p><p>For good talent, upfront money is generally never a factor.  The 
<br>
professionals at this game believe they are making a bet that will pay. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if they are good, it often does pay.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Though I think you have a point about a &quot;really experienced and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executive,&quot; I think you have to be careful about defining such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have a gal/guy who's an absolutely terrific CEO of Exxon, but who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly lost in trying to launch a small software company. Or you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who is great at managing a huge, status quo company but who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the imagination or daring to try and disrupt existing markets with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation that renders old product lines (and the companies that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them) obsolete.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yeah, experience has context.  Ignoring the incompetent executives, you 
<br>
still have three classes of executive that tend to be mutually 
<br>
exclusive:  the guys that run established businesses, the guys that 
<br>
rescue established businesses, and the guys that build businesses.  You 
<br>
find that the executives who are really good at building a company tend 
<br>
to leave when things start to level off, to be replaced by an executive 
<br>
that runs established companies, and are the kind that startups need.  
<br>
Like other startup junkies, they thrive on the stress and dynamics of 
<br>
building a new venture but get bored after most of the really serious 
<br>
challenges on the horizon start to evaporate.  Finding really 
<br>
experienced and competent startup executives is quite difficult, but 
<br>
the reputation and experience they bring with them can easily make or 
<br>
break a startup.
<br>
<p>No startup requires an optimal executive team and you can get away with 
<br>
a lot if everyone is a competent startup veteran, but it substantially 
<br>
improves the odds of success if only through the acquired credibility.
