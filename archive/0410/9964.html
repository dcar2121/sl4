One more comment:
<br>
<p>So, it's not true that Penrose misinterprets Godel's Theorem.  Not at all.
<br>
<p>What he does is to make physics hypotheses that are completely unmotivated
<br>
by any data in contemporary physics, or any theoretical ideas in
<br>
contemporary physics -- but are motivated *solely* by the consequences that
<br>
these physics hypotheses would have for the philosophy of mind.  Not even
<br>
for cognitive psychology in terms of predicting the results of any
<br>
experiments on human beings -- purely for the philosophy of mind.
<br>
<p>I think this is a pretty bad way to go about generating physics hypotheses.
<br>
My view is, if your philosophy of mind contradicts physics, probably it's
<br>
your philosophy that's wrong rather than the physics.
<br>
<p>But in a sense, Penrose's hypothesis is legitimate science, in the sense
<br>
that Penrose would consider himself refuted if someone came up with
<br>
<p>a) an elegant, unifying theory of quantum gravity, that did not involve
<br>
uncomputable entities
<br>
b) a detailed theory of neurodynamics in terms of the physics in a)
<br>
<p>So his hypothesis is falsifiable, not by particular experiments but via the
<br>
conception of certain sorts of theories ;-)
<br>
<p>-- Ben
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The problem with Penrose's argument is pretty simple.  He argues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Premise 1) FOR EACH computer, THERE EXISTS some problem which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Premise 2) NOT [ FOR EACH human, THERE EXISTS some problem which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't solve ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conclusion) Therefore, humans are not computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that his premise 2 is false
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I can't prove that his premise 2 is false.  So I can't prove he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, he doesn't give any kind of reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premise 2 is true, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that both premise 1 and premise 2 are based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealizations.  Neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them is based on an argument about some particular physical system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carrying out particular actions -- if so, they'd have to be weaker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements like &quot;FOR EACH human, THERE EXISTS some problem which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never solve in practice during its life, no matter how long.&quot;  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaker statements are less interesting.  So both of Penrose's premises are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on making idealized models of certain systems -- idealized abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers and humans -- and then making statements about these.  We have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard and well-accepted ways of talking about idealized, abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers (Turing machines, combinatory logic, whatever,...), but we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really have standard and well-accepted ways of talking about idealized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract humans....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One way to talk about idealized, abstract humans is to talk about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special case of idealized, abstract physical systems -- but then you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the problems with current theories of physics.  Physicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree on how to formalize the notion of an idealized abstract physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, so Penrose is left with the possibility of saying &quot;hey --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the correct physics theory is found, it'll involve an idealization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract humans that will validate my Premise 2.  In effect, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require is that some future physics theory says that humans are *infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems* (infinite in the sense of algorithmic information)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereas physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digital computers are finite systems (again in the sense of algorithmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information).  It's hard to say this is *impossible*, but it's clearly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that Penrose has no particular reason to believe this, except his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitive feeling that his Premise 2 should be true.

<em>&gt; &gt; Hi Christian,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You must refute the *original proof*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are right that I do not demonstrate a mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; error in Penrose. Rather, his overall argument is wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; based on an unrealistic model of human brains. They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properly modeled by finite state machines. I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inability of Penrose's argument to work using finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state machines indicates that he has just uncovered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property of infinite sets that is not relevant to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bill
</em><br>
