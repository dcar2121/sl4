</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is this question worth trying to answer? A mind with full access to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-state presumably wouldn't have this problem with determining which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain is itself. It would just directly compare the scanner output with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its own self-inspection. Assuming that we'll get this feature soon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is there some other scenario where the answer would be useful?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
We have methods (MRI, for example), that allow us to correlate some 
<br>
physical brain activity with some conscious experience.  In the 
<br>
hypothetical warehouse on fire, the problem of identification could be 
<br>
as simple as consciously driving motor control in a unique timing 
<br>
pattern and looking for the brain with a matching pattern of neuronal 
<br>
activity.
<br>
<p>But what people get hung up on is that they see this mechanistic 
<br>
description of brain activity and still want to know &quot;where&quot; the &quot;real 
<br>
self&quot; is in this picture.  Where's the experiencing happening? 
<br>
<p>The answer is that it's one of those cases where the question is wrong.  
<br>
The experiencing is not happening in any exalted location within the 
<br>
brain, and there is no separate &quot;self&quot; to have the experience.  It's a 
<br>
mechanistic system that has a capability for limited introspection -- 
<br>
awareness of being aware.  The usual way it has to &quot;experience&quot; itself 
<br>
is through its own internal mechanisms which naturally report back in 
<br>
terms that are perceived and recorded as real and complete.
<br>
<p>However, we now have less subjective ways to observe the functioning of 
<br>
our brains and their environment.  Our instruments show us that the 
<br>
processing of the brain and the human perceptual system has many gaps, 
<br>
distortions, discontinuities, etc., that are not apparent to the system 
<br>
we think of as Self.
<br>
<p>We now have very substantial information obtained through scientific 
<br>
observation and reasoning showing us that our conventional sense of self 
<br>
is an illusion, but since we are immersed in this illusion, and our 
<br>
evolved nature is to instinctively protect this Self, and our culture 
<br>
and language support this illusion, it is difficult for many people to 
<br>
fully consider.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, a dualistic approach to living is most effective, 
<br>
applying either the subjective stance or the objective stance as 
<br>
appropriate to the situation.  Wisdom consists in knowing which and when.
