<em>&gt; You won't ever find anything in the literature on how to prove that a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; said system of proof (or even how to prove that system-of-proof A is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more consistently truth-producing than system-of-proof B; not outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the context of system-of-proof A, B, or X) because even if someone were
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you put it, they (or the journal editors/referees) would reject it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsound, due to a reductio ad absurdum. Namely, because it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradict that which the rest of proof theory claims is true; that wrap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around is impossible -- truth is forever uncertain at its base. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot avoid inserting potentially unsound assumptions.

<p>If you meant something else by this than that no consistent system can 
<br>
prove its own consistency, then sorry for the misattribution.  I also 
<br>
acknowledge that you did not suggest any specific literature.
<br>
<p>I wish people would realize that I know the basics, but sometimes I do make 
<br>
embarassing mistakes, as with the recent discussion of fleeing an UFAI at 
<br>
near-lightspeed.  (It's not that I didn't know the math, it's that I 
<br>
guessed intuitively, instead of taking ten seconds to derive quantitatively 
<br>
the subjective lifespan of the escapee... stupid of me.)
