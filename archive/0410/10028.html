I liked Schmidthubers paper. It contains several important ideas that could
<br>
be important for construction of a practical AI.
<br>
<p>However, there are some important issues to be criticized&gt;
<br>
<p>Schmidthubers paper is a greatly modified version of Levins (and Hutters)
<br>
universal search algorithm. If one understands the original idea, it becomes
<br>
immediately clear that although the universal search is a very simple and
<br>
provably almost optimal algorithm (at least asymptotically), its 
<br>
practical value
<br>
is simply zero: the unimaginably huge additive constant makes it practically
<br>
untractable.
<br>
<p>Schmidthuber tries to cure this shortcoming by using arbitrary proof- and
<br>
algorithm-search methods and combine it by provably optimial rewrite 
<br>
techniques.
<br>
In fact, he retains the same optimality guarantees as Levins/Hutters 
<br>
algorithm,
<br>
but with a hope that the algorithm *may* work practically, with 
<br>
*suitable plugins*.
<br>
<p>However there is an astronomically huge gap between the theoretical
<br>
optimality and the practical feasibility. If algorithm/proof-search 
<br>
techniques
<br>
a similar method would work, then they could be modified to work in his
<br>
&quot;provably optimal&quot; framework. The plugins would work *without*
<br>
his framework equally well. This means that the *practical tractability*
<br>
would depend on  factors that are completely untreated in his exposition.
<br>
<p>For me, it appears to be some kind of cheating.
<br>
Assume that  some people develop by hard work some really good
<br>
program-/proof-generation techniques, then we simply puts their
<br>
plugins into his framework and gets provable optimality and practical
<br>
performance at the same time and can reap the credits for his
<br>
&quot;important contribution&quot;
<br>
<p>The problem is that the optimality he promises may be completely
<br>
impractical and never reached in real-life, while the practical
<br>
tractability would not be his achievement at all.
