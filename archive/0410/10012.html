<p>
Jeff Medina, Christian Szegedy:
<br>
<p>Thank you for your suggested reading, but I'm already quite extremely aware 
<br>
that no consistent formal system can prove its own consistency.  If you're 
<br>
not clear on why this presents a unique challenge for reflective theorem 
<br>
provers, I recommend John Harrison's &quot;Metatheory and Reflection in Theorem 
<br>
Proving: A Survey and Critique.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mostly Harrison concludes that reflection is not needed in modern 
<br>
engineering theorem-provers (he doesn't consider it as an AGI problem). 
<br>
Insofar as Harrison does suggest a solution, he suggests taking a theory 
<br>
Theory-0 and then creating a new system, Theory-1, which has the new rule 
<br>
that if a theorem is proved provable in Theory-0, then it is proved in 
<br>
Theory-1.  This is not exactly the same as adjoining the assumption of 
<br>
Theory-0's consistency to Theory-0 to form a new Theory-1 - the new theorem 
<br>
prover cannot prove that the old theorem prover is consistent, for example.
<br>
<p>The new theorem prover is not inconsistent because it does not contain the 
<br>
rule that any theorem proved provable in Theory-1 may be added as a theorem 
<br>
in Theory-1; this would run straight into Lob.  Instead, the new theorem 
<br>
prover only contains a rule that whatever is provably provable in the *old* 
<br>
theorem prover may be added as a theorem in the *new* theorem prover.  This 
<br>
does not change the set of admissible theorems if Theory-0 is consistent. 
<br>
What it does is enable *much shorter proofs* of some theorems.
<br>
<p>The unique, new problem comes when we ask the theorem prover to rewrite 
<br>
itself entirely.  Even if we adjoin to Theory-1 the assumption that 
<br>
Theory-0 is consistent, if a Theory-1 prover were to write a provably 
<br>
consistent (in Theory-1) prover, it would write a Theory-0 prover.  This 
<br>
prover would then be unable to approve any further rewrites.
<br>
<p>We may be able to rescue Schmidhuber's Godel Machine by compartmentalizing 
<br>
it into an object system that provably has expected utility for solving 
<br>
problems, and a meta-system that can only be rewritten if the rewrite 
<br>
provably admits only theorems admissable in the original meta-system.  That 
<br>
is, we use *two different* criteria for modifying *two different* 
<br>
components of the Godel Machine.  I don't regard this as a good solution to 
<br>
the deep AGI problem, since I wasn't planning to build a Godel Machine.  It 
<br>
would also be an additional requirement over and above the strategy given 
<br>
in Schmidhuber's original paper, which claimed total self-modifiability 
<br>
including modifiability of the proof-verifier or even the fact that the 
<br>
system contained a proof-verifier.  It is furthermore unclear as to how a 
<br>
rewrite of the meta-system would be adjudged *superior* to the prior 
<br>
system, even if it were proven admissible.
<br>
