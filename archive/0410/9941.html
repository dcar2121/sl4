From: &quot;Marc Geddes&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:marc_geddes@yahoo.co.nz?Subject=Re:%20Reductionism%20(was:%20future%20of%20human%20evolution)">marc_geddes@yahoo.co.nz</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the case of reductionism versus holism, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various levels of organization and explanation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not clear why we should the bottom level as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow 'fundamental reality' whilst dismissing upper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels as simply 'cheapo explanations arising from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intractability and existing only in the mind'.
</em><br>
<p>This seems obvious to me. If you run a bottom level simmulation you will get
<br>
all those higher level phenomena happening. This is a prove that all higher
<br>
level phenomena are contained in the bottom level description of reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For starters, how can we be sure we know what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'bottom' or 'fundamental' level is?  We can't.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example early philosophers thought 'atoms' were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental level of matter, and then it transpired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were divisible into electrons and protons.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later still it appears that even the protons may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still further divisible into quarks.  Who is to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that what we currently think of as 'fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics' doesn't have some still deeper physical level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneath it?  And would the discovery of a deeper level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then make current physics simply 'unreal' or a 'cheapo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation'?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Our description of reality which is most fundamental is our working
<br>
hypothesis on how the universe does its thing, but it's just a description,
<br>
at the end of the day, and not the real thing. If we discover that the
<br>
universe is actually a cellular automata (just to put a silly (?) example)
<br>
the rules of such automata would be the real thing, and the physics
<br>
explanations we would have been using would be only approximations and cheap
<br>
(or perhaps expensive, actually) explanations on how the universe works.
<br>
Would this mean we have to get rid of physics? No, but it would mean we'd
<br>
have to push down the stack in search of explanations for it, chemistry,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, in many instances it simply doesn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to regard higher level concepts as 'cheapo'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental constructs.  For example take the concept of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Mind'.  We do not regard minds as cheapo constructs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help us understand complex electrical firing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns in brains.  We regard a 'Mind' as an actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *real* entity.  So it appears that some higher level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts are just as real as lower level ones.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're making the mistake of believing that &quot;we regard&quot; is something
<br>
the universe cares about. Just because &quot;we regard&quot; minds as real doesn't
<br>
make it so, just because &quot;we regard&quot; God as the greatest being that can be
<br>
conceived and that includes existence, doesn't make God exist.
<br>
