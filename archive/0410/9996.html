<p>
I must say, that I did not have time to thoroughly read the Godel Machine
<br>
paper, so it may be completely stupid what I will write.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; In more familiar terms, it would seem that Schmidhuber's Gödel Machine
</em><br>
<em> &gt; must prove a new proof system is consistent in order to accept it, 
</em><br>
and that
<br>
<em> &gt; runs smack dab into Gödel's original theorem.  Any system that can prove
</em><br>
<em> &gt; its own consistency is inconsistent.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I misunderstand what you want, but it seems to me that you want too
<br>
much from yor self-rewriting AI. It does no have to prove absolute 
<br>
consistency,
<br>
only consistancy relative to its original system.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Maybe the Gödel Machine's first proof system would start with ZFC set 
</em><br>
theory.
<br>
<em> &gt; ZFC suffices to prove the consistency of Peano Arithmetic, and might 
</em><br>
accept a
<br>
<em> &gt; rewrite implementing a proof verifier that accepted PA proofs
</em><br>
<p>I don't really understand, what you want to accomplish. I don't think 
<br>
that a self
<br>
rewriting AI should really enhance or restrict the theorems it accepts:
<br>
it must typically improve the run-time of its parts.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Lest any despair of AI, remember that humans can think about this
</em><br>
<em> &gt; stuff without going up in flames, ergo it must be possible somehow.
</em><br>
<p>Humans (even mathematicians) are far from theorem proving systems.
<br>
Humans are error tolerant systems and a mathematician says that
<br>
a theorem is proven, if it can be embedded into his mindset seamlessly.
<br>
Of course, there are a lot of mistakes, but fortunately I do not go up
<br>
in flames if I produced a wrong proof.
