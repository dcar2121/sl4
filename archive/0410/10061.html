<p>Well put. I thought I'd drop in my 2 cents, now that we have those here
<br>
in Finland and all. I don't know if all I'm about to say is good PR, but
<br>
it's true, and it might provoke some helpful thinking in some people.
<br>
Hopefully.
<br>
<p>I have very little shame. I have rather little pride too, though I do
<br>
have a distinct knowledge of being &quot;better&quot; than most people in many
<br>
ways - intellectually, rationally and from an altruistic ethical
<br>
standpoint, for instance. But all this is unimportant.
<br>
<p>I have been a regular SIAI donor since the time they first started
<br>
soliciting them. Some time later I outed myself by adding SIAI onto my
<br>
signature. I didn't really care about the (doubtful) prestige, but I
<br>
thought providing a link there might be useful. In the same spirit,
<br>
while I'd personally usually rather not draw attention to myself, I
<br>
later allowed the publication of my name, with amounts contributed, on
<br>
SIAI's newsletters, to perhaps provide inspiration to others.
<br>
<p>I used to have some aspirations to doing actual work towards the
<br>
Singularity, but I've pretty much dumped those mostly due to clinical
<br>
depression accompanied by certain issues with attention span and
<br>
motivation. Since then I've also come to the conclusion that I wouldn't
<br>
want people like me in an AI team anyway. To be more precise, us
<br>
misanthropes would introduce some unwanted risks into such a project.
<br>
<p>Yes; though I may be fond of certain spesific portions of humankind, as
<br>
a whole I rather dislike it. &quot;Hate&quot; might be too strong a word for my
<br>
general emotional intensity. &quot;Loath&quot; or &quot;detest&quot; might be more accurate.
<br>
I certainly don't feel (note the choice of word) that humanity
<br>
&quot;deserves&quot; to live, let alone reach Singularity, and I very much suspect
<br>
I'd derive no small amount of pleasure from witnessing an observable end
<br>
of the world closing in. (No, my own survival isn't much of an issue.)
<br>
But all this is unimportant.
<br>
<p>I am, by choice, an altruist - a choice originally made when my
<br>
misanthropic tendencies were more on the background, but a choice I'm
<br>
sticking with nevertheless. I also aspire to rationality, as far as is
<br>
possible for me. As an aspiring rationalist, I see the usual Existential
<br>
Risks looming near. I also see no other plausible defense scenario than
<br>
a successful, friendly Singularity - never mind the intrinsic
<br>
desirability of such a scenario even ignoring Existential Risks
<br>
altogether.
<br>
<p>I find that SIAI's Friendliness approach is by far the best that I have
<br>
means to know about. I don't think SIAI has a good chance of success -
<br>
rather the opposite - but that is irrelevant when facing an Existential
<br>
Risk. I therefore ignore any unhelpful feelings of generic animosity and
<br>
helplessness and contribute. I do this currently at a rate of $400 a
<br>
month, probably due for yet another increase at year's end. This
<br>
represents a significant portion of my net income as a sysadmin in a
<br>
government university.
<br>
<p>So, what I guess I'm getting at is that, as far as saving the world
<br>
goes, if so few seem to be able to even try to do as much as a
<br>
Singularity-pessimistic and clinically depressed misanthrope living on a
<br>
midrange government salary, there's something wrong with this picture.
<br>
<p>But hey, though the way there may be frustrating, it's all win/win for
<br>
me in the end. Cheers.
