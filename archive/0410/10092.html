<em>&gt; This is also why millionaires don't jump in and fund popular existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects.  Most of them fund their own tangent precisely because there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a serious lack of perceivable comparative substance between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing projects, regardless of nominal popularity, and choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either sit out (not knowing enough to start their own project) or fork
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a new project that at least they will perceive as having some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until there are obviously substantive ventures, the smart money won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be betting at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I tend to agree that much of the capital that could otherwise flow into this
<br>
field needs solid, specific projects to coalesce around. These would be
<br>
programs or innovations with a reasonable time horizon and logical plan for
<br>
their economic exploitation, because these investors need to know they'll be
<br>
getting something definable at the end of the rainbow -- and where the end
<br>
of that rainbow _is_, actually.
<br>
<p>Please don't take this comment as an argument to halt projects like the
<br>
Singularity Institutes. It may be that going after the larger problem will
<br>
prove far more productive that working on it piecemeal. I suspect that the
<br>
piecemeal strategy will bring other benefits in terms of funding, attention,
<br>
and assembling talent.
<br>
<p>Something Jim Collins wrote in either Built to Last or Good to Great is that
<br>
getting a company started is like pushing relentlessly on a giant flywheel
<br>
to get it moving. You push for days and days and _finally_ get it to move.
<br>
And then you keep pushing frantically to keep it moving. And eventually you
<br>
push it so far that you make a whole revolution, and then it gets a little
<br>
easier and then at last its own momentum kicks in and keeping it moving and
<br>
getting it to accelerate become much, much easier.
<br>
<p>Well, he carries that analogy over to executives who make disastrous changes
<br>
of direction in either healthy or failing firms -- when you abruptly reverse
<br>
everything that the company has been doing for years, it's like you just
<br>
tried to reverse that massive flywheel. Instead of using all that momentum a
<br>
large company builds up over the years, you're trying to work against it.
<br>
<p>I think that if someone like Mr. Yudkowsky were to reverse everything they
<br>
were committed to and shifted over to an entrepreneurial or academic game
<br>
plan, s/he might find themselves working against their past momentum
<br>
(including their existing skill sets, work practices, comfort/confidence
<br>
zones, stable of contacts, authority as a non-profit, and what-have-you). So
<br>
it's probably not something to do at a whim, any more than reversing that
<br>
flywheel. =)
