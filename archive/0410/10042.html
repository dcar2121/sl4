<p>
The opinions shared on this board are way too complex for most people to
<br>
understand.  I have been watching for a few months and many comments are not
<br>
in my areas of study and make no sense.  Further, it appears that instead of
<br>
simplifying responses to get more people to understand, Eliezer and others
<br>
seem to write as complex as possible, which goes against my training to
<br>
write things as much as possible so an 8th grader could understand (which is
<br>
sometimes impossible, but could be a goal for your writing or at least a
<br>
plea from me to help me understand what is going on).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I say the above to share that most people including me have not contributed
<br>
to this cause, because:
<br>
<p>1) They don't understand enough about what you are doing (they would have to
<br>
do it on faith).  I do understand this point. 
<br>
2) They don't know why Eleizer is better than anyone else and should
<br>
contribute to him rather than someone else.  I am not convinced.
<br>
3) It seems hard to believe that a small group with even a genius at its
<br>
lead is going to change the world much before it was ready to happen anyway.
<br>
I am not convinced.
<br>
4) Why are you relying on donations instead of concurrently doing something
<br>
useful for humanity and make profits along the way so you don't have to rely
<br>
on hand-outs so much?
<br>
<p>If the bottom 3 points are answered satisfactorily in a simplified manner
<br>
that convinces me, I would be willing to donate some of my hard earned
<br>
funds.
