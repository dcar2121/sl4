Michael Wilson wrote: &quot;I characterise qualia and subjectivity in general as
<br>
flaws because they are both irrational (don't map onto a consistent
<br>
Bayesian prior) and based on lack of information (poor human
<br>
introspective capability).&quot;
<br>
<p>Qualia are arational, not irrational. There is a critical difference.
<br>
Water, e.g., is not rational, but not irrational either.
<br>
Neurons and nanobots &quot;don't map to consistent Bayesian priors&quot;, yet
<br>
minds that incorporate neurons or nanobots are not -as necessary
<br>
consequence- irrational.
<br>
<p>Qualia are not based on lack of information. Introspective perfection
<br>
-- the ability to know as much about one's own internal structure as
<br>
the nature of reality allows -- and qualia, the &quot;what it's like&quot;
<br>
associated with various methods of information processing are not
<br>
mutually exclusive. Short of a reason to believe they are, this is the
<br>
rational default. If you disagree, you must provide reasoning to that
<br>
effect, not just declarations that &quot;this is how I characterize qualia,
<br>
and this is their nature&quot; as if you were writing a Bible.

I wrote: &quot;But this sort of example misappropriates responsibility to
<br>
qualia for the unwanted result, when the problem is the cognitive
<br>
association between a particular phenomenal experience and a
<br>
particular negative behavior or loss of ability.&quot;
<br>
<p>Michael Wilson wrote: &quot;That statement is a Gordian knot of
<br>
philosophical and cognitive
<br>
confusion. Briefly, you can't reengineer associations without changing
<br>
the qualia involved; the associations are a large part of the
<br>
definition.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm afraid you'll need to be less brief, my good man. Specifically,
<br>
you'll need to give reasons for anyone reading to believe such claims
<br>
as &quot;associations [e.g., the example of green associated with
<br>
depression because of a traumatic experience] are a large part of the
<br>
definition&quot;. You speak as though you're teaching the list about qualia
<br>
from some place of authority, repeatedly declaring rather than
<br>
justifying, yet the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the
<br>
Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind, and Wikipedia all disagree with your
<br>
construal of the meaning of qualia.

<br>
<p>So whose statements are confused, given that you're not even clear on
<br>
what 'qualia' means? Right.

I wrote: &quot;Aside: It remains to be seen whether it is even
<br>
theoretically possible to remove phenomenal consciousness from a
<br>
sufficiently intelligent, metacognitive being.&quot;
<br>
<p>Michael Wilson wrote: &quot;It's possible (if silly), but you're looking at
<br>
this the wrong way.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again with the prophetic, unsupported answers on what is and isn't
<br>
possible. Argue it or leave it out. It certainly contributed nothing
<br>
to the actual contention of the paragraph, which was that I was
<br>
looking at the problem the wrong way.
<br>
<p>= 4 =
<br>
I said: &quot;Some form of panpsychism may yet be true, meaning qualia may
<br>
be an intrinsic property of all existence, even though it's only
<br>
recognizable by a certain class of mind-like, reflective structure.&quot;
<br>
<p>Michael Wilson replied: &quot;I used to be that open minded once, but then
<br>
I learned that philosophy is just confused psychology and cosmology.
<br>
Repeat after me; 'qualia are
<br>
not ontologically fundamental' (or rather not more ontologically
<br>
fundamental than any other class of causal process).&quot;
<br>
<p>Hmm... how about...
<br>
&quot;I used to be open minded to your argument, but then I discovered it's
<br>
just confused philosophy. Repeat after me; 'this argument form is
<br>
invalid'.&quot;
<br>
<p>You've provided no justification for the claim that panpsychism is
<br>
false (nor for the much broader, stronger, drastically ignorant claim
<br>
that philosophy is &quot;just confused psychology and cosmology&quot;). Rational
<br>
agents require justification prior to accepting such claims as true,
<br>
or even likely. So you've three options now -- (1) include rational
<br>
argument in defense of your points, especially ones as contentious as
<br>
the aforementioned, (2) withhold your &quot;rebuttals&quot; until you've figured
<br>
out how to put such an argument together, or (3) take your empty
<br>
rhetoric to the postmodernists where it belongs.

Michael Wilson wrote: &quot;free will as implicit in the shape of your
<br>
self-reference class's distribution across universes as derived from
<br>
the root cause for anything existing
<br>
at all (yeah, I'm still working on that one too :).&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm not &quot;still working on that one&quot;, and you shouldn't be either,
<br>
because it provides a severely incomplete definition of what is meant
<br>
by free will in its context, and is therefore unproductive gibberish.
<br>
<p>= 6 =
<br>
Michael Wilson wrote: &quot;Legal systems are a red herring as they will be
<br>
either nonexistent or changed beyond recognition after a Singularity
<br>
anyway, and legality is functionally irrelevant to the desirability of
<br>
post-Singularity outcomes. Speculation on the legal consequences of
<br>
transhumanism and AI is an SL3- topic.&quot;
<br>
<p>?... Ahem... Then perhaps *you* shouldn't have brought up the topic of
<br>
speculation on the legal consequences of transhumanism and AI in your
<br>
originating &quot;Siren Song&quot; post, eh?
