<p>Ben, you've made comments before on how, since you spent a dozen years 
<br>
trying to work out a mathematical theory of mind / philosophy of mind, and 
<br>
didn't get far enough to satisfy you, you doubt that I can get any farther 
<br>
myself without significant empiric input.
<br>
<p>What exactly would you say is the difference between &quot;philosophical&quot; 
<br>
understanding and &quot;mathematical and rigorous and definite&quot; understanding? 
<br>
Do you think you've come far enough, whether through your years of 
<br>
philosophizing on mind, or your more recent AGI research, to describe the 
<br>
difference?  If you don't know, would you say that the difference is the 
<br>
sort of thing on which we can only say words in the philosophy of mind 
<br>
until we get significantly more empirical input?  Or do you think it ought 
<br>
to be possible to work out a mathematical and rigorous and definite 
<br>
description of the difference between philosophical understanding and 
<br>
rigorous understanding?  Obviously if you can give an exact description of 
<br>
the difference between philosophical understanding and rigorous 
<br>
understanding, it will be of great help in moving past philosophy...
