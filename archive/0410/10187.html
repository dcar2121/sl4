<p><em>&gt;So far, a quick glance at Marc's most recent e-mail

provides 87 points. And this isn't even taking into
<br>
account the gibberish in the earlier &quot;philosophical
<br>
schemata&quot; e-mail, which would undoubtedly add quite a
<br>
few more. Mentafex indeed. How many points does one
<br>
need before sniper-moderation comes into effect,
<br>
exactly? 
<br>
<p>Ah, well I won't say anything in future until it's
<br>
written up into a form backed by proper logical
<br>
arguments.
<br>
<p>But bear in mind that the difference between a
<br>
crack-pot and a genius may not be *immediately*
<br>
obvious at first ;)
<br>
<p>Since I was silly enough to post that schematic, I
<br>
will reply once more in an attempt to explain what my
<br>
gem of idea actually is.  What I need to do here is
<br>
give away enough to be *comprehensible*, wihout
<br>
actually giving away my secrets until I'm ready to do
<br>
so.  I said I'd beaten Eliezer to the fundamentals.  I
<br>
need to back that up.  So here goes:
<br>
<p>O.K.  If you read the work of Julian Barbour, you'll
<br>
learn of his theory that time is an illusion.  He
<br>
subscribes (as do I) to the multiverse theory of
<br>
quantum mechanics.  But the relationship between the
<br>
human perception of a single quantum branch and the
<br>
entire *multiverse* has always been somewhat
<br>
mysterious.  Why if all these alternative time-tracks
<br>
are there do humans only perceive a single branch?
<br>
<p>Barbour's idea was to treat different times as special
<br>
cases of different universes (read his book for a
<br>
detailed explanation of the theory).
<br>
<p>Now in my own theory of FAI (and everything!) I've
<br>
taken something like Barbour's idea and generalised it
<br>
to a higher level of abstraction.  I've then carried
<br>
over the same abstract logic to areas of science
<br>
outside quantum physics.
<br>
<p>My idea was to try to explain the whole of reality in
<br>
terms of the relationship between the various aspects
<br>
of a sentient mind and the external universe.  I have
<br>
postulated a general *partitioning mechanism* which
<br>
explains this relationship (between an individual
<br>
'mind' on one side, and some aspect of the 'external
<br>
universe' on the other). 
<br>
<p>Consider Barbour's idea about time and the qauntum
<br>
multiverse.  What need to be explained there?  Well,
<br>
'the external universe' is the quantum multiverse, and
<br>
'the perception of a sentient mind' is the single time
<br>
track you currently perceive.  So Barbour is really
<br>
attempting to explain time by explaining the
<br>
relationship between the entire multiverse, and the
<br>
fact that a mind can only percieve one particular time
<br>
track.  In my schematic I stated:
<br>
<p>Multiverse x Time = Prediction 
<br>
<p>This was simply referring to a generalzied version of
<br>
Barbour's scheme.  The term 'Multiverse' is obviously
<br>
referring to the quantum multiverse.  The term 'Time'
<br>
is referring to the perception of a sentient mind that
<br>
only one time track is present (Don't worry about the
<br>
'Prediction' term at the moment).  The 'x'
<br>
(multiplcation side) was short-hand referring to the
<br>
relationship between the two.  Clearly there is a sort
<br>
of division or 'partitioning' going on.  We do not
<br>
directly perceive multiple time tracks.  We only
<br>
perceive one particular time track.  So our perception
<br>
is 'partitioned' up into the (largely) seperate
<br>
time-tracks of the multiverse.  'x' is a tranformation
<br>
referring to the way that the multiverse has been
<br>
partitioned into largely seperate time-tracks, due to
<br>
the way that sentients perceive reality.
<br>
<p>Now does my equation make more sense to you?  If not,
<br>
read Barbour's book about time for a fuller
<br>
explanation.
<br>
<p>O.K, now as I said, I generalized Barbour's idea.  I
<br>
think that (taken to a higher level of abstraction)
<br>
the same *general logic* applies to all the other
<br>
mysteries of the world, which can be explained in
<br>
terms of a 'general partitioning mechanism' , which
<br>
sets up a relationship between an 'external reality'
<br>
and an 'individual sentient mind'.
<br>
<p>Look at what I said in the next line of my schematic:
<br>
<p>Probability x Reflection = Explanation
<br>
<p>In my theory, this is simply the analogy of Barbour's
<br>
scheme for metaphysics, carried over to epistemology.
<br>
<p>The term 'Probability' was referring to the 'Bayes
<br>
scape' (which is a range of possible 'a priori'
<br>
probabilities  for use with Bayes Theorem).  This is
<br>
directly analogous to the quantum multiverse.  There
<br>
is a 'landscape of possibilities' in an analogous way
<br>
to a 'landscape of different qauntum time tracks'  
<br>
<p>The term 'Reflection' was referring to the way a
<br>
sentient mind cuts down the range of probabilities to
<br>
only a single  probability.  The landscape of
<br>
possibilities (which exists in external reality) is
<br>
cut to only a single possibility (which exists in a
<br>
sentient mind).   The 'x' multiplication sign, is
<br>
referring to this proccess.  This is directly
<br>
analogous to the way that the entire qauntum
<br>
multiverse is 'cut down' by a sentient mind, to a
<br>
perception of only a single time track.
<br>
<p>And the same general scheme carries over to everything
<br>
else.  For instance look at the last line of my
<br>
schematic:
<br>
<p>Market x Volition = Freedom
<br>
<p>The term 'Market' here is referring to Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky's Collective Volition, which is really 'a
<br>
landscape of possible future volitions', directly
<br>
analogous to the qauntum multiverse, or the Bayes
<br>
scape of possible probabilities.  The term 'Volition'
<br>
is referring to a single individual volition.  So in
<br>
the left hand side there is a 'Collective Volition' of
<br>
possibilities, on the right hand side an 'Individual
<br>
Volition' and there is a 'x' sign referring to the way
<br>
the field of external possibilities is cut by a single
<br>
sentient mind to a possibilility referring to a
<br>
specfic individual volition. 
<br>
<p>My theory is  that *exactly the same logic and
<br>
mathematics* (suitably generalized) that applied to
<br>
Barbours scheme for quntum physics, applies to
<br>
everything else in reality.
<br>
<p>For instance I think that the same general logic
<br>
describing the 'qauntum multiverse', carry over to the
<br>
'Bayes Scape' , which in turn carry over to
<br>
'Collective Volition' and so on.  
<br>
<p>And the same general logic describing how only a
<br>
sentient mind cuts the range of perception from the
<br>
whole multiverse to only a single time track, carries
<br>
over to how a sentient mind cuts the range of
<br>
possibility from Collective Volition to an Individual
<br>
Volition for instance.  Exactly the same general
<br>
mechanisms are at work, I'm saying.
<br>
<p>So for instance I think that:
<br>
<p>MULIVERSE is to SINGLE TIME TRACK as
<br>
BAYES SCAPE is to SINGLE PROBABILITY  as
<br>
COLLECTIVE VOLITION is to INDIVIDUAL VOLITION
<br>
<p>Exactly the same principles, and the same 'general
<br>
partitioning mechanism'
<br>
<p>You'll notice I'd even named what I think the 'general
<br>
partitioning mechanism' is for each area of reality.
<br>
<p>For instance, I think that 'Induction' is the
<br>
manifestion of the mechanism for epistemology.  It is
<br>
'Induction' that cuts the Bayes scape from a range of
<br>
a priori probabilities, to only a single probablity. 
<br>
And I said that 'Person hood' was the manifestation of
<br>
the mechanism for politics.  I thought that the
<br>
determination of 'Person-hood' is what cuts the range
<br>
of possibilities represented by Collective Volition
<br>
down to a single choice made by an Individual
<br>
Volition.
<br>
<p>Anyway, my theory lies in generalizing Barbour's
<br>
scheme for qauntum physics, and coming up with a
<br>
'general partitioning mechanism', which describes the
<br>
relationship between aspects of the external universe,
<br>
and aspects of an indivudual sentient mind.
<br>
<p>See if my schemata makes more sense to you now.
