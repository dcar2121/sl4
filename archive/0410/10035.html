</em><br>
<p>I would have to disagree.  Kurzweil has published a number of books, 
<br>
articles, and runs a website.  He's been a very effective public face 
<br>
for the transhumanist movement, but that doesn't at all qualify him to 
<br>
be the &quot;winner&quot; of the race any more than the PR firm of Microsoft is 
<br>
qualified to write software.
<br>
<p>He's invented a few useful products, but mostly in the realm of 
<br>
&quot;classical&quot; AI.  If there's anything SL4 seems to be able to agree on, 
<br>
it's the realization that something much more than classical AI will be 
<br>
required to (a) create AGI, and (b) create FAI.
<br>
<p>I used to believe that De Garis would &quot;win&quot; ( and probably initiate a 
<br>
planet kill in the process ), but he has about as much access to capital 
<br>
as Eliezer does, so I don't think we'll see connectionist success 
<br>
stories from him anytime soon.
<br>
<p>Instead, I see the recent interest of the USDOD in autonomous everything 
<br>
to be a curious development.  That is an organization that has not only 
<br>
the motivation, but also the means to brute force AGI - a very scary 
<br>
proposition, indeed.
<br>
<p>Novamente looks promising, but it is also perpetually plagued by funding 
<br>
issues, and has strong potential to become unfriendly.
<br>
<p>To Eliezer's credit, he seems to be the only one who is pursuing AGI 
<br>
with an eye to minimizing existential risks as a *requirement* rather 
<br>
than an afterthought, or not at all.
<br>
<p>But:
<br>
<p>Collective Volition is scarier than any of the above.  As has been 
<br>
pointed out on this list, CV is tantamount to slavery in the minds of 
<br>
those on the receiving end of the dispensation of the collectively 
<br>
volitional SI.  EVEN THOUGH there is a critical distinction between 
<br>
imposing volition and extrapolating volition, MOST people will NOT grok 
<br>
that distinction, and they will be even less likely to donate to a cause 
<br>
that, in their minds, plans to &quot;enslave&quot; them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To rely on public donations is not much different than a monk holding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a bowl (you never know where the next meal is going to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from).  Unless idealistic individuals in the upper classes can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlisted to support the cause, it might be more productive to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital through some sort of technological innovation.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a few clever minds on the SL4 list that could do this.
</em><br>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with this, and it is one of the many reasons I 
<br>
believe SIAI is a dead-end.  The singular focus on altruism appears to 
<br>
have blinded them to acknowledging the dominant means of motivation in 
<br>
human beings.  By eschewing the profit motive, they have effectively 
<br>
relegated themselves to barely scraping by on a few paltry donations. 
<br>
While saving the world is, indeed, an infinite return on investment, a 
<br>
wiki posting is generally considered a poor return on an investment of 6 
<br>
months of donations.  For the foreseeable future, I see SIAI producing 
<br>
more of the latter than the former.
