<p>
First, I, too, am a (modest) financial supporter of SIAI. It would certainly
<br>
be good if a few people could give Eliezer's institute several thousand
<br>
dollars apiece. But based on what Eli wrote about the criteria the IRS
<br>
applies to non-profits at SIAI's stage of development, it might be even
<br>
better if several hundred, or several thousand, people each gave a $100 or
<br>
even just $50 or $10 or so dollars each. That would show a more broad base
<br>
of public support.
<br>
<p>Second, I think we should be circumspect about making religious appeals. The
<br>
Tiplerian scenario that Giulio described does, indeed, activate some of the
<br>
same meme-receptors that respond to the memes promulgated by the major world
<br>
religions. However, those religions claim to guarantee delivery of a
<br>
paradisiacal afterlife in exchange for strict adherence to their doctrinal
<br>
tenets, while any transhumanist claim can only be probabilistic and must
<br>
admit to the need for a lot of very difficult work to have been accomplished
<br>
over the course of a very long time in order for any hope of success to be
<br>
realized. In short, the religions promise salvation through faith, while
<br>
transhumanists can, at best, only promise paradise through works, and even
<br>
then without any guarantees that any particular individual will ever see the
<br>
promised land.
<br>
<p>Another aspect to religion is community. I suspect that very many so-called
<br>
&quot;believers&quot; do not really believe all that strongly in the quite incredible
<br>
claims of their religion, but they do enjoy being with fellow members of
<br>
their religious community, sharing meals, sharing joys and sorrows, and
<br>
experiencing the emotional support and comfort that comes from &quot;being one of
<br>
us.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is something that the few, scattered transhumanists around the Earth
<br>
today cannot currently offer or enjoy (except in a few large urban areas and
<br>
during the annual conferences). Building face-to-face transhumanist groups
<br>
should be a major priority for us.
<br>
<p>Finally, I believe that a transhumanist spirituality (which I call
<br>
Trans-Spirit) will be possible on the basis of rational, scientific
<br>
investigation into the psycho-neurological bases of spiritual experience.
<br>
This is a more personal, individual aspect of religion that does not
<br>
necessarily entail any group activity, but which is at the core of every
<br>
religious tradition. Spiritual experience supplies the foundational impetus
<br>
in which the founders (and major figures in the later development of) every
<br>
religion are rooted. (For more information about this, please go to my page
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: [wta-talk] Re: [extropy-chat] Re: SIAI: Donate Today and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tomorrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer asks to those who donated to speak up. I just donated 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bucks, I am sorry I was not able to donate more at this time. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer is doing is good, and we should support it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am replying to the message with the question, why the Raelians are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much more successful than us. In another message in another thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (only on sl4), Ben Goertzel writes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Religion is the one major case of people taking things distant from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their everyday life seriously ... but this is arguably because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion gives people a lot of psychological comfort, and helps build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comforting social structures.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I reply:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I think Ben is making a very, very good point here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a way we could edit our message, without compromising it of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, in such a way as to provide *also* psychological comfort?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will risk heresy and confess that I am beginning to think current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects to &quot;engineer a transhumanist religion&quot; (see e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universalimmortalism.org) are actually good ideas.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I wish to reply to the inevitable accusations of heresy before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are formulated, and elaborate some more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a Tiplerian omega-point scenario. Or if you think Tipler's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical assumptions are wrong, imagine some other scenario with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omega-point property: at some point in the future, a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization may develop the capability to acquire detailed high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution information from the past (not against casuality), and use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to retrieve the information content of human minds in their past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps including ourselves here and now. It seems plausible that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization with that kind of technology will also be able to easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload such information to another body or a virtual environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we can build a worldview that includes a concept of resurrection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while at the same time staying compatible with our rational scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worldview. We can derive standard moral principles: for this to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is necessary that our specie survives, and, assuming resources will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be large but limited, it seems reasonable to think that Mother Theresa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be revived before Hitler. Also, we can derive transhumanist moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles: for this to happen it is necessary that our species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolves fast and acquires more and more control on mind and matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All that and more in Tipler's book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps if this universal immortalism were a part of our message, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe even its front-end for those who need a religious worldview, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be much easier to win minds and hearts.
</em><br>
