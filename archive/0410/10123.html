<p>&lt; In this essay I present a somewhat novel approach to the philosophy of 
<br>
science, to which I give the awkward name &quot;sociological/computational 
<br>
probabilism&quot; (SCP)[1].
<br>
<p>My main goal in formulating this approach has been to develop a 
<br>
philosophical perspective that does justice to both the relativism and 
<br>
sociological embeddedness of science, and the objectivity and rationality 
<br>
of science.  I have also been motivated by an interest in clarifying the 
<br>
relationship between probability theory and the validation of scientific 
<br>
theories.
<br>
<p>The SCP philosophy has its roots in several different places, most notably:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* contemporary mathematical learning theory, particularly probability 
<br>
theory and the theory of algorithmic information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Imre Lakatos' and Paul Feyerabend's conflicting but related 
<br>
philosophies of science
<br>
<p>It draws ideas from these sources, but adheres precisely to none of them.&gt;
<br>
<p>Which reminds me a little of what I dubbed, equally lumpishly, `stochastic 
<br>
emergent schematism', in THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS (1997):
<br>
<p>&lt;If one had to give it a name (although my suggested name, alas, is not 
<br>
very catchy), one might dub it `stochastic emergent schematism'. In common 
<br>
with current cognitive science, my approach emphasises the role in all 
<br>
complex adaptive systems - including individual humans, and our various 
<br>
cultural surrounds - of schemata or models mapped within the brain and 
<br>
nervous system. Organised systems that evolve to use such schemata are 
<br>
notably emergent, generating regular patterns by no means simply 
<br>
predictable from a `bottom-up' reductive analysis of their elementary 
<br>
components. And this unpredictable predictability is why one needs to 
<br>
stress the stochastic or random aspect of complex phenomena, which occur on 
<br>
a boundary between crystalline order and chaotic turbulence. In the recent 
<br>
summary of Nobel laureate physicist Murray Gell-Mann:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The common feature of all these processes is that in each one 
<br>
a complex adaptive system acquires information about its environment and 
<br>
its own interaction with that environment, identifying regularities in that 
<br>
information, condensing those regularities into a kind of `schema' or 
<br>
model, and acting in the real world on the basis of that schema. In each 
<br>
case, there are various competing schemata, and the results of the action 
<br>
in the real world feed back to influence the competition among those 
<br>
schemata.&quot; &gt;
