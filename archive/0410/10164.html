<p>Worst case of megalomania I've ever seen; the poor soul thinks he's Eliezer 
<br>
Yudkowsky.
<br>
<p>Actually, I rather take it as a compliment that people go mad and claim to 
<br>
be me.  Maybe someday I'll be one of the forbidden comparisons on Baez's 
<br>
Crackpot Index.  I wonder how many crackpot points I could get for 
<br>
suggesting that?  Maybe Baez would add a little note saying I'd gotten the 
<br>
all-time high score and the other crackpots could stop trying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mentifex indeed. How many points does one need

</em><br>
<p>I did snipe Geddes, but then Ben Goertzel seemed to feel that there was 
<br>
something there worth replying to.  It's not fair to Geddes to ask him not 
<br>
to reply if Ben speaks.  Though personally I would just as soon that Marc 
<br>
Geddes and Ben Goertzel carried on this conversation off-list, unless some 
<br>
third party is interested.  One of Ben's greatest weaknesses is that he has 
<br>
something nice to say about everyone.
<br>
<p>Apparently, one of my greatest weaknesses is that my writing can drive 
<br>
poorly prepared minds insane, like the Necronomicon.
