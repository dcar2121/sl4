<p>(Paraconsistent: A reasoning system that does not prove everything if a 
<br>
contradiction is proved within it.)
<br>
<p>I view paraconsistency as a desirable property of an AGI for obvious safety 
<br>
reasons.  Also, humans are paraconsistent in a way that seems to reflect 
<br>
important structure in our reasoning, such as considerations of relevance; 
<br>
if 2 + 2 = 5 this does not seem to imply that Gertrude Stein is Queen of 
<br>
England.
<br>
<p>Inconsistency, on the other hand, seems to me undesirable in the sense that 
<br>
it should always indicate a mistake of some kind; I can't see a situation 
<br>
where a sane AI *should* believe P and not-P.  Inconsistent systems may be 
<br>
able to prove much more than consistent systems, why, some of them can even 
<br>
prove everything.  But I don't call that power, or additional work being 
<br>
accomplished, unless you can show me that an inconsistent system somehow 
<br>
tends to prove *useful* things, true things, preferentially.  Easy enough 
<br>
to prove the consistency of PA if we use inconsistent logic, but it's also 
<br>
easy enough to prove that your momma is consistent, and there's no obvious 
<br>
reason why one proof would be favored over the other.
<br>
<p>How a formal system adjoined to expected utility decides which proofs to 
<br>
try and prove is another question I didn't see addressed in the Godel Machine.
