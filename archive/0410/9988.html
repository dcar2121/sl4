Hi Tim,
<br>
<p>I would think one of the obvious next steps is to build autonomous 
<br>
robots that we can send into
<br>
space. Capable of building more robots from native materials and 
<br>
programmed to build human
<br>
habitats awaiting our arrival on the Moon, Mars, any number of moon 
<br>
belonging to the gas
<br>
giants and large asteroids. These robots can also collect vital 
<br>
materials for human technology
<br>
and bring them back to earth (as well as our or inhabited outposts.) The 
<br>
benefit of such economy,
<br>
and the value of spreading terestrial life to as many places as 
<br>
possible, make this a high priority.
<br>
<p>The fact that brilliant and creative men can produce unprecedents 
<br>
results on a shoe string budget,
<br>
indicates we should be empowering such men and women to explore, invent, 
<br>
and create from
<br>
whole cloth new technology.
<br>
<p>One of the major problems encountered was Government interference and 
<br>
beaurocracy. We're
<br>
a nation of inventors and tinkerers... we need to create an environment 
<br>
where our best and
<br>
brightest can play, and make amazing things far all people.
<br>
<p>I can imagine dozens of possible prizes... cheap, renewable, 
<br>
nonpolluting energy. Of equal or
<br>
even greater importance, small, light, nonpolluting, efficient means to 
<br>
store and transport said
<br>
energy.
<br>
<p>Effective neural interfaces (you can't get better VR than directly 
<br>
driving the brain.) Better displays
<br>
and immersive VR technology will get better fast, with or without an X 
<br>
Prize. Figure gaming and
<br>
sexual interest will probably keep pushing the tech until it's gone as 
<br>
far as it can go.
<br>
<p>The cure for cancer is so close it's not even funny... as we unpeel the 
<br>
secrets of our genome, the
<br>
cure for cancer and every other genetic ailment will naturally fall out. 
<br>
I'm not at all certain an X
<br>
Prize there will make a difference.
<br>
<p>Addressing Global Challlenges will require addressing Global assumptions 
<br>
about being human,
<br>
and more importantly addressing human endeavor at it's most basic level. 
<br>
As long as we exist in
<br>
a world given by greed, nationalism, corporatism, ethnic cleansing, 
<br>
religious conflict, death vs.
<br>
survival, desease, environmental degradation, and scarcity mentality, we 
<br>
will have a terrible time
<br>
making profound changes in the nature of humanity and it's institutions. 
<br>
It is time for humanity to
<br>
address itself. Design a better future by choice and engineering rather 
<br>
than one that simply lands
<br>
on us like Dorothy's house landed on the wicked witch. It will take more 
<br>
than an X Prize to make
<br>
a dent in the mess that humanity is. However, a multinational project 
<br>
with the backing of the X
<br>
Prize, to begin to design economic and sociopolitical models that are 
<br>
sustainable, productive, and
<br>
generate the kind of world that would make being human worthwhile for 
<br>
all people, might indeed
<br>
be a worthwhile endeavor. Clearly to sociological hangover we currently 
<br>
suffer from needs to end
<br>
before it kills us all.
<br>
<p>Cool conversation.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.wtnxprize.org/">http://www.wtnxprize.org/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... and here's the relevant part:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;About The WTN X PRIZE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The concept of the WTN X PRIZES is to utilize the concepts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;procedures, technologies and publicity developed X PRIZE Foundation's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ansari X PRIZE competition for space and the global science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology innovators identification process and community developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by the World Technology Network (WTN) to launch a series of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prizes seeking to meet the greatest challenges facing humanity in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;21st century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The X PRIZE competition focused on jumpstarting a private space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;industry has re-proven the principle – strongly proven in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of the 20th century for the aviation industry – that innovation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can indeed be catalyzed. That principle can and should be extended to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other global challenges and opportunities and together we at the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technology Network (WTN) and the X PRIZE Foundation are committed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing just that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What challenges/opportunities should be selected?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Although the idea of using the X PRIZE concept work in other areas is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at first glance a simple and attractive one, a great deal of up-front
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought needs to go into what challenges/opportunities would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selected. One could argue that there were certain qualities about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;challenges and opportunities in both the aviation field and the space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;field that lent themselves extremely well to a private sector
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competition of the sorts which have occurred. Variables to be looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at might include:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The maturity (or lack thereof) of the technology around which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the competition would be based?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The maturity (or lack thereof) of the related industries from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which a new industry would be born
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The number of potential &quot;competitors&quot; potentially able to meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the challenge or at least the depth of the pool from which potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competitors could be drawn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The level of the specificity of the challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The financial resources potentially available to finance the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potential competitors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The financial resources potentially available to finance the Prize itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * How potentially compelling and exciting is the field around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which the challenge would be based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The amenability of the target area to a threshold change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public expectation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The replicability of the challenge to other areas?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * The level of the presumed long-term benefit to business and society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The list of questions above is by no means exhaustive, but does give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense of how the selection of a new challenge is not as first as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple as it may seem. It is absolutely key that the right challenges
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are selected – sufficiently exciting to compel hearts and minds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficiently ambitious to reach beyond what is already likely going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occur soon and to have a truly substantial impact, and sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;focused to have a good chance of succeeding within a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;timescale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Potential types of challenges?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is a very rough and incomplete list of the sorts of challenges
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that might be appropriate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * Medical challenges, such a cure for cancer or other major diseases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * Technological &quot;holy grails&quot;, such as artificial intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teleportation, molecular assemblers (true nanotechnology), cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fusion, or a believable virtual reality system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    * Major global challenges, such as the various UN Millennium
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Development Goals (MDGs) announced by the world's leaders at the UN in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2000 at the Millennium Summit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why We Are Asking You For Suggestions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are over billions of people on the planet, almost each of whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has a dream for a better world. The chances of us finding a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worthwhile series of challenges for the WTN X PRIZE competitions over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the coming years are that much greater the more suggestions we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;receive. We are asking you because your dreams are the repository of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an enormous amount of creativity and hope. In the spirit of man's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first reach into space, we ask you to stretch your imagination to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take humanity to the next level. Are you up to the challenge?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
