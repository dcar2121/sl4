I have explicitely stated that I am not convinced by the arguments of 
<br>
Penrose.
<br>
However, it find it not just an overstatement but a completely irrelevant
<br>
statetement that he is hopelessly confused about the Theorem of Goedel.
<br>
It is a very simple theorem and I am quite sure that
<br>
he understands it at least as well as we do. Of course, the way he 
<br>
applies it
<br>
to the real world can and should be disputed.  I am not irritated by
<br>
criticisms on established scientists, but I don't think it is justified if
<br>
*anyone* states that the things are so and so and therefore someone else
<br>
(in this case, Penrose, who is a brilliant mathematician) is completely
<br>
wrong. A correct attitude is to say, that the observations A,B and C
<br>
combined with arguments D,E and F speak against his position on X.
<br>
(Exactly the way you did.)
<br>
<p>If I am on it, I am not at all sure that the finite-state-machine model is
<br>
much better than the Turing machine model. The human mind is in
<br>
interaction with a practically infinite universe, so I think that both
<br>
models of computations have their specific flaws.
<br>
<p>I found your last argument most convincing that the human thinking is
<br>
not  based on any consistent formal model, but on a combination of
<br>
experimentation, probabilistic reasoning and formal logic - an inconsistent
<br>
system (not even a model in mathematical sense) but still effective for
<br>
a lot of tasks.
<br>
<p>However I would not rule out the opinion of Penrose, after all his position
<br>
can be correct, even if some of his arguments are not convincing.
