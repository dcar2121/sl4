<p>
If a planet-killer asteroid were headed our way and expected to impact in 25
<br>
years, we *could* go on with business as usual.  We *could* trust that
<br>
market forces would drive aerospace development on their own, with
<br>
intermediate applications paying for the development of more advanced
<br>
applications, until finally some firm was capable of stopping the asteroid.
<br>
And we *could* trust that firm to actually do the right thing when it
<br>
achieved this capability -- or to at least sell impact prevention services
<br>
to humanity.
<br>
<p>But I don't think we would. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And if I found myself in a world taking the &quot;let things develop naturally&quot;
<br>
approach, you had better believe I would listen to the only person I had
<br>
heard who seemed to be trying to *directly* tackle the problem *now*.  I
<br>
probably wouldn't understand all the rocket science he was spouting.  I
<br>
wouldn't have any way of knowing whether he could do the things he said he
<br>
needed to do. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
But because he was the *only* one who seemed to take the problem at least as
<br>
seriously as I did, and seemed to understand it better than I did, I would
<br>
consider him to be worth helping in any way I could.  I certainly would
<br>
*not* tell him to &quot;get a real job in aerospace like everyone else so that we
<br>
can continue our inevitable march to asteroid-stopping technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, we're not in such an obviously crazy world only because most people
<br>
don't know about or don't believe in the metaphorical asteroid that is
<br>
technologically initiated existential risk.  And many that do believe in the
<br>
risk don't know about or don't believe in the possibility of friendly AI as
<br>
a solution to that risk.
<br>
<p>But this crazy world *is* the world *I* live in because my path has led me
<br>
to believe that the risk is real and that the friendly AI solution is
<br>
possible.  To everyone in this list, I say that maybe this is your world
<br>
too, and maybe it isn't.  But even if you think that there's only a credible
<br>
chance you live in this world, then it makes sense to hedge your bets and
<br>
send SIAI a little something.
<br>
<p>Of course, I've been aware of these issues for a few years now, and
<br>
following SIAI for the same amount of time.  And when it comes right down to
<br>
it, my reasons for not donating have not really had anything to do with the
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>And I could continue at some length, explaining how my perfectly ordinary
<br>
reasons for not donating to SIAI have been temporary, well intentioned, and
<br>
undoubtedly shared by dozens of others.  But this would be tantamount to
<br>
excusing myself by saying, &quot;the bystander effect is perfectly real, and as a
<br>
bystander, I am subject to it myself.  Watch me do nothing, just like
<br>
everyone else.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I've decided I will not be this person.  Not today.  And not tomorrow.
<br>
