Marc,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;My skepticism about the solidity of this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be borne out by the history of Eliezer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking so far -- each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year he argues quite vehemently and convincingly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective; then, a year later, he's on to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different perspective.... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think he's wrong to change his views as he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learns and grows, but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think he's wrong to think any kind of near-definite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI is going to be arrived at without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimentation with serious AGI's... Until then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions will shift and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow and retreat, as in any data-poor area of inquiry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben Goertzel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  It looks like Eliezer has consumed a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of science books and papers, and then had a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rush of blood to the head, fooling himself into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that excellent general knowledge about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic can substitute for deep understanding.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact all that is present is a half-arsed 'pop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding' of many disconnected bits and peices.
</em><br>
<p>Hey -- this is a much stronger critique of Eliezer's work than I made, or
<br>
would make.
<br>
<p>I think Eliezer's thinking is often deep and excellent, not half-arsed or
<br>
even half-assed.
<br>
<p>I just think it's very speculative -- and that a really solid understanding
<br>
of Friendly AI and related issues is very unlikely to be achievable via
<br>
theorizing alone, but is more likely to be achieve via a combination of
<br>
theorizing &amp; careful experimenting...
<br>
<p>To put it another way: based on what I've seen of his work so far, I think
<br>
Eliezer is a very good *philosopher*, but I don't think philosophy is all
<br>
that's needed.  I know he's trying to move beyond philosophy and make his
<br>
work more mathematical and rigorous and definite, but I have my doubts about
<br>
how far this can go without significant empiric input...
<br>
<p>But I don't want to diminish the power and importance of philosophy either.
<br>
Philosophy is essential, it's just not enough.  Not even when it's
<br>
philosophy that's strongly guided by science and adopts much of the language
<br>
of science.  And I say this as someone who spent many years working hard on
<br>
science-guided philosophy, esp. philosophy of mind...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
