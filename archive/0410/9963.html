The problem with Penrose's argument is pretty simple.  He argues as follows:
<br>
<p>Premise 1) FOR EACH computer, THERE EXISTS some problem which that computer
<br>
can't solve
<br>
Premise 2) NOT [ FOR EACH human, THERE EXISTS some problem which that human
<br>
can't solve ]
<br>
Conclusion) Therefore, humans are not computers
<br>
<p>The problem is that his premise 2 is false
<br>
<p>Now, I can't prove that his premise 2 is false.  So I can't prove he's
<br>
wrong.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, he doesn't give any kind of reasonable argument that his
<br>
premise 2 is true, either.
<br>
<p>Note that both premise 1 and premise 2 are based on idealizations.  Neither
<br>
of them is based on an argument about some particular physical system
<br>
carrying out particular actions -- if so, they'd have to be weaker
<br>
statements like &quot;FOR EACH human, THERE EXISTS some problem which that human
<br>
will never solve in practice during its life, no matter how long.&quot;  These
<br>
weaker statements are less interesting.  So both of Penrose's premises are
<br>
based on making idealized models of certain systems -- idealized abstract
<br>
computers and humans -- and then making statements about these.  We have
<br>
standard and well-accepted ways of talking about idealized, abstract
<br>
computers (Turing machines, combinatory logic, whatever,...), but we don't
<br>
really have standard and well-accepted ways of talking about idealized
<br>
abstract humans....
<br>
<p><p>One way to talk about idealized, abstract humans is to talk about them as a
<br>
special case of idealized, abstract physical systems -- but then you get
<br>
into the problems with current theories of physics.  Physicists don't quite
<br>
agree on how to formalize the notion of an idealized abstract physical
<br>
system, so Penrose is left with the possibility of saying &quot;hey -- maybe once
<br>
the correct physics theory is found, it'll involve an idealization of
<br>
abstract humans that will validate my Premise 2.  In effect, what this will
<br>
require is that some future physics theory says that humans are *infinite
<br>
systems* (infinite in the sense of algorithmic information) whereas physical
<br>
digital computers are finite systems (again in the sense of algorithmic
<br>
information).  It's hard to say this is *impossible*, but it's clearly the
<br>
case that Penrose has no particular reason to believe this, except his
<br>
intuitive feeling that his Premise 2 should be true.

<em>&gt; Hi Christian,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You must refute the *original proof*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are right that I do not demonstrate a mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error in Penrose. Rather, his overall argument is wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on an unrealistic model of human brains. They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properly modeled by finite state machines. I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inability of Penrose's argument to work using finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state machines indicates that he has just uncovered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of infinite sets that is not relevant to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill
</em><br>
