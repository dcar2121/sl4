<em>&gt; Steve, A Philosopher.....
</em><br>
<p><p>Empiricial data-Explanation is a continuum, not a
<br>
clear-cut division.  The philosopher of science Karl
<br>
Popper once famously asked students in a lecture to
<br>
simply sit and 'observe'.  Of course they had no idea
<br>
what it was they were meant to be observing.  
<br>
<p>It would be impossible to set up an experiment at all
<br>
without some theoretical understanding of what one was
<br>
doing, and what one was looking for.  Then the
<br>
interpretation of results also requires theoretical
<br>
knowledge. 
<br>
<p>Exactly how are measuring devices to be used?  How are
<br>
the results to be interpreted?  The most rabid
<br>
empiricist cannot escape the need for theory.
<br>
<p>In the case of reductionism versus holism, there are 
<br>
various levels of organization and explanation, and
<br>
it's not clear why we should the bottom level as being
<br>
somehow 'fundamental reality' whilst dismissing upper
<br>
levels as simply 'cheapo explanations arising from
<br>
intractability and existing only in the mind'.
<br>
<p>For starters, how can we be sure we know what the
<br>
'bottom' or 'fundamental' level is?  We can't.  For
<br>
example early philosophers thought 'atoms' were the
<br>
fundamental level of matter, and then it transpired
<br>
they were divisible into electrons and protons.  And
<br>
later still it appears that even the protons may be
<br>
still further divisible into quarks.  Who is to say
<br>
that what we currently think of as 'fundamental
<br>
physics' doesn't have some still deeper physical level
<br>
beneath it?  And would the discovery of a deeper level
<br>
then make current physics simply 'unreal' or a 'cheapo
<br>
explanation'?
<br>
<p>Further, in many instances it simply doesn't make
<br>
sense to regard higher level concepts as 'cheapo'
<br>
mental constructs.  For example take the concept of a
<br>
'Mind'.  We do not regard minds as cheapo constructs
<br>
to help us understand complex electrical firing
<br>
patterns in brains.  We regard a 'Mind' as an actual
<br>
*real* entity.  So it appears that some higher level
<br>
concepts are just as real as lower level ones.
