</em><br>
<p>I was once a Penrosian noncomputationalist, for much the same reasons then 
<br>
as my friend Mitchell Porter is now:
<br>
<p><a href="http://sl4.org/wiki/ConsciousnessResidesInQuantumPhenomena">http://sl4.org/wiki/ConsciousnessResidesInQuantumPhenomena</a>
<br>
<p>i.e., &quot;Consciousness is so darned mysterious, and yet we already understand 
<br>
the nature of computation very well, so if consciousness were computable we 
<br>
would understand it already; plus the nature of computation seems 
<br>
incompatible with the nature of consciousness; no matter how we manipulate 
<br>
computing elements they'll never add up to quales.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would be hard put to pinpoint the exact time when my opinion changed, but 
<br>
my guess would be in the vicinity of late 2002.  IIRC, that was when my 
<br>
understanding of human cognition reached the point where I could start to 
<br>
see that the answer didn't have the form I'd initially assumed.  My 
<br>
rationalist's postmortem (i.e., the rule I should have followed to have 
<br>
never made the mistake in the first place) is that I saw a mysterious gap 
<br>
in my knowledge, and I looked for a mysterious substance to fill the gap. 
<br>
In retrospect, the blindingly obvious historical analogues include 
<br>
&quot;phlogiston&quot; and &quot;elan vital&quot;, the mysterious substances once postulated to 
<br>
explain the mysterious phenomena of chemistry and biology.  It seems to be 
<br>
a flaw in human psychology; it's certainly a very common episode in the 
<br>
history of science.  &quot;Emergence&quot; as an explanation for intelligence is 
<br>
another example of the same mistake.
<br>
<p>I underestimated the power of the mundane.  The problem with reading the 
<br>
history of scientific revolutions, rather than living through the 
<br>
experience, is that we don't assign the same weight to dry history as 
<br>
living experience.  It's just something we read about that happens to 
<br>
strange people in books, much like Tolkien is an account of things that 
<br>
happen to strange people in books.
<br>
<p>Only now do I appreciate how reasonable the mistake of the vitalists must 
<br>
have seemed *at the time*, how *surprising* and *embarassing* it was for 
<br>
reality to come back and say:  &quot;Yep, *still* just mundane physics.&quot;
<br>
<p>By &quot;mundane&quot;, I mean here to say, same 'ol same 'ol physics; an explanation 
<br>
that doesn't push the mystery into the level of organization dealt with by 
<br>
physics; the explanatory burden, the unweaving of the mystery, carried out 
<br>
on a higher level, rather than exporting the mystery into the low-level 
<br>
elements.  Perhaps the vitalists would also have protested, just as did my 
<br>
earlier self, that to say 'consciousness involves quantum gravity' is not 
<br>
going outside physics.  But there is definitely a whiff about it of the 
<br>
mysterious, the non-mundane, just like incorporating elan vital into 
<br>
physics.  And it pushes the explanatory burden into involvement with the 
<br>
lowest level of then-known physics; this is almost always a mistake when 
<br>
the impetus comes from a non-physics field.  The only successful example I 
<br>
can think of is Darwin versus Kelvin on the age of the sun.  And even 
<br>
there, the answer was just more of the same math; nothing *mysterious*. 
<br>
And so I specify 'mundane physics'.
<br>
<p>Mundane reductionism always, always, ALWAYS wins.  If you think that is too 
<br>
much emphasis, I should put in a few hundred repetitions of &quot;always&quot;, one 
<br>
for every historical case in which reductionism won.
<br>
<p>In every generation it is the same plea:  &quot;No, this time it really *is* too 
<br>
mysterious for science.&quot;  The children grow up in a world where stars and 
<br>
chemistry and life have always been mundane and previous generations were 
<br>
just being silly mystics.  And when they encounter something that's 
<br>
*really* inexplicable, like consciousness, why, such a mystery has never 
<br>
happened before, it is wholly unlike such non-mysterious things as stars 
<br>
and life forms.  Surely if there were a mundane explanation we would have 
<br>
found it already.  As if stars and life forms had not been great mysteries 
<br>
for millennia on end, until one day someone solved them, and then they were 
<br>
not mysteries any more.
<br>
<p>I did not comprehend the power of the mundane explanation.  It's a common 
<br>
enough human problem.  Now that I know what to look for, I see people doing 
<br>
it all the time.  Lesson after lesson after lesson of mere history, even if 
<br>
the universe repeats the point a thousand times over, don't have the same 
<br>
emotional force as a single personal experience.
<br>
<p>But now I know better.
