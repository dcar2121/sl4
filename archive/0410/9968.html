<em>&gt; I agree that Finite State Machines are not the issue. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What *is* the issue is the empirical fact that as far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we know, there is no such thing as an uncomputable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite physical process.  That is, we think that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite physical processes are computable.
</em><br>
<p>I have explicitely avoided discussing this problem,
<br>
since it was not needed to refute that special line
<br>
of argumentation and starting with it would have only
<br>
increased the confusion. There are other arguments of
<br>
Penrose that revolve around this question and they are
<br>
much harder nuts and I would not try to refute them
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p>I don't know who is included in *we* that think
<br>
that all finite physical processes are Turing-computable.
<br>
Most thoughtful people seem to avoid taking a definite
<br>
positions on this issue (and with good reasons).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There is an ambiguity in the word 'solve'.  Look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) again:...
</em><br>
<p>I think, you are right on this. But I don't think
<br>
that it is the correct refutation.  &quot;Solving
<br>
something&quot; in computational sense means producing
<br>
the correct (expected, specified mathematically)
<br>
answer. It is irrelevant wheter you are 100% 
<br>
or only 0.0001% sure about your answer.
<br>
<p>In his arguments he tried to exhibit *one specific* input
<br>
on which you *can not reach* the right conclusion 
<br>
(assuming you can be modelled by a TM).
<br>
<p>The real problem is that he 
<br>
*pretended the you were exposed to that particular input*.
<br>
Then he tries to argue, that you could produce the
<br>
right answer to *that specific input*. 
<br>
(It does not matter, whether you are only 51% sure,
<br>
or whether you are completely wrong on any other 
<br>
issues.) If you produce the correct answer on something
<br>
you are *never supposed to*, then it would be a valid
<br>
contradiction.
<br>
<p>However, there is a mistake at this point: the reader
<br>
was *never tested on that particular confusing input*.
