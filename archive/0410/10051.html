<p>This does seem to be a question that swiftly occurs to most people 
<br>
encountering SIAI, but it might be as unfair as asking a string theorist to 
<br>
tinker up some small table-top fusion motors in her days off, or perhaps 
<br>
some decorative string bags, to fund her theoretical work.
<br>
<p>The kind of investigation Eliezer and associates are engaged in probably 
<br>
*has* no direct, market-applicable, practical spin-offs, any more than the 
<br>
papers from a nuclear strategy think-tank did 40 years ago. Certainly Kahn 
<br>
et al didn't run up some home ICBM plans for Walmart to support their RAND 
<br>
work. It's true that they held out their hand to the government/military, 
<br>
and were paid handsomely, and perhaps Eliezer could follow suit--if working 
<br>
in secret for black programs was not a detestable option, likely to lead to 
<br>
precisely the fate he wishes to avert.
<br>
<p>Well, how about getting funding from a university? From a national 
<br>
endowment of some kind? The Macarthur Foundation? Maybe, but no, that 
<br>
probably would require wasting time going to school and getting the 
<br>
sheepskin. Of course it's true that if Eliezer had done that when he was 
<br>
17, and breezed through, he'd now be a moderately well-set-up postdoc or 
<br>
more likely a professor. But that option was not chosen, and there's no 
<br>
sense crying over spilled PhD scholarships.
<br>
<p>Now, as someone else noted, it might be argued that
<br>
<p>&lt;for the love of Pete it's been
<br>
many years; let's see some kind of code. You'll
<br>
get money from my pocket.
<br>
And I'm not equating code with progress. No. I'm
<br>
equating it with a higher quality form of exploration
<br>
and demonstration. That's what I want to see.&gt;
<br>
<p>But again, rock/hardplace: if you're fearful that your unique insights 
<br>
might unleash Doomsday, or bring it on sooner, you're well advised to keep 
<br>
your damned mouth buttoned. On the other hand, you also want to keep your 
<br>
mouth fed. So the monk holds out his soup bowl. Very understandable.
