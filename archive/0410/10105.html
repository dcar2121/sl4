<em>&gt; If what I ask has been beaten to death already, then please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone direct me to the appropriate archive threads.
</em><br>
<p>It's been beaten to death already, but I don't have the archive indexed by
<br>
topic and I don't feel like searching it for you ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But Ben, what I asked was basically what part of FAI is least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported by evidence, and taken most on faith? (I didn't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say it so baldly because it sounds insulting.)
</em><br>
<p>None of Eliezer's FAI theories are supported by evidence.  They are all
<br>
basically supported by his conceptual, logical argumentation.
<br>
<p>As Wei Dai pointed out in a recent message, Eliezer has made a lot of strong
<br>
conceptual arguments as to why creating Friendly AI is a hard problem.  He
<br>
has outlined the problem very nicely.  However, his proposed solutions to
<br>
this problem have not been convincing to very many people -- and he has
<br>
generally tended to reject his own solutions not too long after formulating
<br>
them.  His current sketch of a solution -- &quot;collective volition theory&quot; --
<br>
seems both wildly impractical and severely frightening to me and many
<br>
others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand you to believe that Eliezar may have some nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories but has yet to produce code and validate himself?
</em><br>
<p>It is certainly true that Eliezer has not published or described any
<br>
interesting software systems of his creation or conception.  The only
<br>
software design he's made public (so far as I can recollect) was for the
<br>
Flare programming language, which I personally didn't care for much, but
<br>
which was anyway only peripherally related to FAI.
<br>
<p>However, his explicit goal is to create a solid theory of FAI before coding
<br>
an AI.  Furthermore, I believe he is now working with some software
<br>
engineers on implementing some of his ideas.
<br>
<p>I think it is important to have smart people like Eliezer thinking hard
<br>
about FAI and related issues.  And I have generally found Eliezer's writings
<br>
more insightful than those of other folks who write about these topics ...
<br>
even though he hasn't, in my view, come up with any real &quot;answers,&quot;
<br>
conceptually let alone code-wise.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
