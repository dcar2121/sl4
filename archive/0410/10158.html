</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm 37 and as far as I can tell I think *better* than I did 5 or 10 or
<br>
20 years ago.  Heck, I'm improving all the time ;)   My analytical powers
<br>
are just as good as they were when I was young, but I know more and have
<br>
better intuitive judgment and better cognitive self-control.  I'm betting
<br>
I'm going to take a path of making my biggest achievements in my early 40's
<br>
;-) ...
<br>
<p>I have taken a lot of lateral moves in my intellectual career so far, which
<br>
have probably prevented me from achieving what I could have in any one
<br>
area -- as soon as I've really mastered some domain, I've always moved on to
<br>
something else, even before this mastery is really proved to the outside
<br>
world.... But AI integrates all the different areas I've explored, and I
<br>
don't plan to move on from it till I've actually succeeded...
<br>
<p>In some disciplines there is a tradition of the big achievements being made
<br>
by people in their 20's.  But this is only a statistical phenomenon -- and I
<br>
also note that these tend to be disciplines that are highly formal in nature
<br>
(math, physics, music), in which a lot of wide and deep information
<br>
integration isn't needed for achievement.  Cleverness and vision are enough
<br>
in these areas.  In biology, philosophy, visual art and literature, for
<br>
example, there is a lot of disparate, fuzzy and ambiguous knowledge to be
<br>
gathered together, which -- to make a broad overgeneralization -- often
<br>
requires broad+deep knowledge and wisdom as well as cleverness and vision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If SIAI doesn't find a deeper source of funding and get some actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building the tech traction the people will continue to die.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it may be that some other people -- maybe even some old people ;) --
<br>
will do the actual tech work involved in singularity-ward technology, and
<br>
Eliezer will continue to serve the valuable role of coming up with
<br>
interesting ideas and guiding peoples' thinking in worthwhile directions...
