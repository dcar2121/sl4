&quot;Sigh.  I mean the following:  I don't care if you prove that, based
<br>
on some assumption or other, you can fly when you step off a cliff, if
<br>
you actually plummet to the ground and go splat.  My goal is to
<br>
outguess the mysterious agent &quot;reality&quot; which produces the actual
<br>
experimental results we compare against our predictions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Good good. So you actually don't have &quot;little use for conclusions that
<br>
are absolutely certain given their assumptions.&quot; You have little use
<br>
for conclusions that are absolutely certain given *dubious*
<br>
assumptions. So say that. Pardon, but I am sometimes a bit of a
<br>
literalist when it comes to interpreting others' meaning.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a Bayesian, Medina.  I don't assign probabilities of 0 or 1 to
<br>
anything.  My math goes kerplooey when it tries to handle infinite
<br>
certainties.  The suggestion that I ever claimed anyone could be
<br>
absolutely certain of anything is base calumny verging on deliberate
<br>
insult.&quot;
<br>
<p>I figured. But that just exacerbated my confusion over your repeatedly
<br>
stated disdain for assumptions. The sought-after &quot;conclusions that are
<br>
correct&quot; are a subset of &quot;conclusions that are absolutely certain
<br>
given their assumptions&quot;; the subset corresponding to true assumptions
<br>
and valid rules of inference.
<br>
<p>If the word 'assumptions' is replaced by 'unjustified assumptions',
<br>
your statements no longer put me off. I just don't think you should be
<br>
using the word 'assumption' to mean this. I think Ben's recent reply
<br>
is relevant here, wherein he said (paraphrasing) that while rigor is
<br>
important, it isn't the only thing that's important. I think we all
<br>
agree that correspond to fact is quite an important feature of a
<br>
theory. This requirement does not speak against Ben's point about the
<br>
importance of rigor.
