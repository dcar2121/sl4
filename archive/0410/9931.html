<em>&gt; While this was very interesting reading, it completely fails to tell

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Penrose isn't trying to explain quantum physics; he's trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     persuade you that the human mind isn't Turing-computable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     (Penrose is right about this, although purely by coincidence.)
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with 1.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  [snip] the laws of physics to arbitrary precision [are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Turing computable]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.  [snip] the human brain to arbitrary precision [is not Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     computable]
</em><br>
<p>2 and 3 aren't yet my business; but as I understand the current consensus 
<br>
in physics, most physicists think physics is computable to arbitrary 
<br>
precision, and at least a few think physics is digital.  If you pinned me 
<br>
to a wall and held a gun to my head, I'd be forced to admit a sneaking 
<br>
philosophical preference for digital physics, but IANAP.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From your spiel I gather that you now disagree with statements 1 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3, but I'm not totally certain, and I know no more about your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position on statement 2.  No matter what, you should certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; update those pages I think.
</em><br>
<p>The pages need such a major update that I've just sort of given up on it 
<br>
entirely.  Maybe I'll get around to it after the Singularity.  Tick tick 
<br>
tick.  There's a hell of a lot of things I &quot;should&quot; be doing.

<em> &gt; Eliezer, I've often asked myself what your new, non-mysterious

</em><br>
<em> &gt; reductionism, but that doesn't answer the question. Everything
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that is, is physical, you seem to say. So: does consciousness
</em><br>
<em> &gt; exist or not? If it does exist, what sort of physical entity
</em><br>
<em> &gt; is it, and how are the various subjective attributes of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; consciousness explained? If it does not exist, then in what
</em><br>
<em> &gt; terms am I to interpret the fact of my own existence, and my
</em><br>
<em> &gt; awareness of it?
</em><br>
<p>...like this, for example.
<br>
<p>Yes, I need to write this up.  And so, when I saw that this conversation 
<br>
was starting yet again, I went back to working on... an old paper that 
<br>
doesn't even explain this issue, and is only peripherally related to this 
<br>
issue, but that I'd need to finish before I could start working on a 
<br>
document that explains this issue.  The paper is called &quot;A Human's Guide To 
<br>
Words&quot;; it's currently 170K of HTML, and almost finished I think, but going 
<br>
very slowly.  I've been fiddling with it occasionally for about a year.
<br>
<p>I find it increasingly hard to justify any effort that is not on a direct 
<br>
line to FAI.  It's a fascinating problem, but *explaining* the problem is 
<br>
not on a direct line to FAI, unless someone offers me a large incentive to 
<br>
do so.  If I can finish and publish &quot;A Human's Guide to Words&quot;, that would 
<br>
provide a reader some conceptual equipment that would hopefully enable me 
<br>
to explain my answer in not too great a time.
<br>
<p>But briefly:  Qualia are not ontologically basic.  &quot;Qualia&quot; are the result 
<br>
of the human brain doing something weird in how it processes reflectivity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For any puzzle that is apparently about qualia, you need to replace it 
<br>
with a puzzle about the behavior of intelligent minds in talking about 
<br>
qualia or discussing qualia.  If I ask &quot;Why does Mitchell claim the sky is 
<br>
blue, rather than green?&quot; I can transparently eliminate Mitchell's 
<br>
cognition from the problem and the question reduces directly to &quot;Why is the 
<br>
sky blue, rather than green?&quot;  You can't do this with problems that appear 
<br>
to be about something called qualia.  &quot;Why do I think qualia are unitary?&quot; 
<br>
does not reduce to &quot;Why are qualia unitary?&quot;
