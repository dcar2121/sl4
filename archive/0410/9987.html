This is exactly the point... the ontology is distinct and transcendant 
<br>
of the meat, that is
<br>
self does not exist per se in the meat. The meat provide the necessary 
<br>
environment for
<br>
self to occur and function. It's like describing the distinctions 
<br>
between hardware and
<br>
software. The relationship is indeed intimate and the boundary unclear, 
<br>
and yet,
<br>
software is purely language(process and data), hardware is purely 
<br>
physical/structural.
<br>
<p>The nature of human being exists purely within language (Heidegger - 
<br>
&quot;Language is the
<br>
house of Being.) Without language, the network of conversations that 
<br>
distinguish self,
<br>
and relationship to others, vanishes.
<br>
<p>This is not to say that the hardware has no influence on the expression 
<br>
of self, simply
<br>
that what we perceive and experience as identity, history, personality, 
<br>
are all functions
<br>
of conversations delimiting and expressing the context of self.
<br>
<p>Perception is indeed a fascinating illusion. We are literally the end 
<br>
result of several
<br>
billion years of survival. We take in billions of bit of data, while our 
<br>
nervous systems
<br>
busily throw out all but the most interesting and urgent data. Our meat 
<br>
is designed to
<br>
filter out useful information. Then our &quot;World View&quot;, beliefs, opinions, 
<br>
habituations,
<br>
and predelictions filter out most of the rest.
<br>
<p>Recent PET and precision MRI scans tell us that conversations  and 
<br>
experience don't
<br>
exist in a single given location, but happen all over the brain. That a 
<br>
single thought may
<br>
impact any or all of the senses, logic, emotion, memory, survival, 
<br>
language, meaning,
<br>
and any of dozens of linked experiences in a cascade. This tells us that 
<br>
our perception
<br>
of consciousness is indeed complex, multilayered, and involves dozens of 
<br>
unique
<br>
cognitive systems working transparently in concert. That is the nature 
<br>
of how the meat
<br>
makes the conversations of self possible. The content of those 
<br>
conversation is distinct
<br>
nonetheless from the meat.

<p><em>&gt; We have methods (MRI, for example), that allow us to correlate some

<em>&gt; pattern and looking for the brain with a matching pattern of neuronal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of brain activity and still want to know &quot;where&quot; the &quot;real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self&quot; is in this picture.  Where's the experiencing happening?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answer is that it's one of those cases where the question is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.  The experiencing is not happening in any exalted location 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the brain, and there is no separate &quot;self&quot; to have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.  It's a mechanistic system that has a capability for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited introspection -- awareness of being aware.  The usual way it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to &quot;experience&quot; itself is through its own internal mechanisms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which naturally report back in terms that are perceived and recorded 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as real and complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we now have less subjective ways to observe the functioning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our brains and their environment.  Our instruments show us that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing of the brain and the human perceptual system has many gaps, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distortions, discontinuities, etc., that are not apparent to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system we think of as Self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We now have very substantial information obtained through scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation and reasoning showing us that our conventional sense of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self is an illusion, but since we are immersed in this illusion, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our evolved nature is to instinctively protect this Self, and our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture and language support this illusion, it is difficult for many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to fully consider.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my opinion, a dualistic approach to living is most effective, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applying either the subjective stance or the objective stance as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate to the situation.  Wisdom consists in knowing which and when.
