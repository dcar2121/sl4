Hi Mitchell,
<br>
<p>Part of the problem here is that people confuse the internal 
<br>
conversation people have about reality, with reality itself. In fact, as 
<br>
human beings develop, their internal conversations actually filter and 
<br>
shape their perceptions (and even their brain development), so they 
<br>
literally see and hear what their internal conversations allow them to 
<br>
see and hear, and little else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look, do you agree that blue patches, loud noises, etc., exist, or not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If yes, explain what's blue about a bunch of cortical neurons. If not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain how I can interpret my experience without blueness, loudness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. In my world, these things are *epistemically* basic, whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not they're ontologically basic. 
</em><br>
<p><p>There is no intrinsic &quot;Blueness&quot; in the universe. There is a wavelength 
<br>
of optically visible radiation, that our society agreed is blue, vs the 
<br>
longer wavelength that the chlorphyll in the grass reflects, that we all 
<br>
agreed was green. Even if a person perceived one as the other, the 
<br>
context of their perception, associated with the conversations that 
<br>
person has had all there life would have them describing the sky as blue 
<br>
and the grass as green. In that context, the personal perceptions 
<br>
becomes moot, because inside language, it all becomes the same by 
<br>
agreement. Language causes concensus. Causes reality by concessus.
<br>
<p>You want to take this one step further, without the languaging to convey 
<br>
a reality, there is only raw experience and instinct. All meaning comes 
<br>
from the conversations we have with ourselves and other. Helen Keller 
<br>
spoke about the moment her universe was born, when she got that very 
<br>
first word, she literally got an entire universe, because she got the 
<br>
distinction that is literally born from language, the ability to speak 
<br>
of, including the ability to speak of one self.
<br>
<p>Marie
