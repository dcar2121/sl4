<p>*Ahem*.
<br>
<p>I did not, in fact, donate in this round, but at $200/month I wasn't
<br>
the target, was I?  I think my post does count as congratulations
<br>
and agreement, however, although it was couched in the language of
<br>
skepticism.
<br>
<p>(Of course, you haven't likely seen my post yet)
<br>
<p>On the off chance that I was too skeptical in my last post, here's
<br>
the more enthusiastic version.
<br>
<p>I donated.
<br>
<p>The SIAI rocks, and I am pleased as punch to be supporting them, and
<br>
quite proud of myself for doing so.
<br>
<p>All the rest of you whiners need to be quiet.  Feel free to not
<br>
donate, but quit pissing in the punch the rest of us are trying to
<br>
drink. Thanks. HTH.  HAND.
<br>
<p>However, bear in mind that &quot;I donated, and I/the SIAI rock!&quot; is
<br>
actually off-topic as the list is defined, and that the list intro
<br>
page is *very* harsh about what is an appropriate post, and gives
<br>
the impression that such a post might get one immediately banned.
<br>
<p>Consider having a checkbox on your paypal form for &quot;all comments
<br>
attached to this donation can be commented to the list&quot;.  I think
<br>
that would go a *long* way to encouraging more donatinos.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have to be strong without being certain, by a deliberate act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will, by the conscious decision that certainty is not required for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strength.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to act in unison without being conformist, by an act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will, by the conscious choice that it makes sense to cooperate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even when we aren't in full agreement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to forsake peer pressure and the instinct to believe what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others are saying, and consciously evaluate the probability that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else knows more than we do, taking into account neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal like nor personal dislike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to reject the common misconception that the art of finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the correct answer to questions of fact - the art some call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rationality&quot; - means cynicism, ironic detachment, and the refusal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to feel emotion.  Let us choose our beliefs on the sole basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspondence with reality.  If those beliefs call forth our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passions, then let us feel!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to learn to express our unity as well as our disagreement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak our rational agreement along with our rational criticism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show newcomers *both* sides of the issue, swallow hard and defy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our fear of public harmony.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ask of SIAI's donors:  Speak up, and hold your heads high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without shame!
</em><br>
<p>This was absolutely beautiful, and I'm quoting it just because it
<br>
bears repeating.
<br>
<p>-Robin
