<em>&gt; Every academic I know tells of the death by a thousand cuts that is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic life.  But I will defer to Dr. Ben Goertzel for a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered opinion on whether academic standing, papers, symposia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so on leads to more funding and research opportunity for doing SAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>There is, in my view, very little chance of Eliezer or anyone else getting
<br>
significant research funding for FAI from the typical academic grant funding
<br>
sources (NSF, DARPA, etc.).
<br>
<p>However, if Eliezer were to go the academic route, he could probably get
<br>
grant funding for AI research (without mentioning his FAI focus in his grant
<br>
applications); and this funding could then be used to support AI research
<br>
with a strong FAI aspect.
<br>
<p>Politics!
<br>
<p>While I think that academia would be a decent place for Eliezer, it's clear
<br>
that he has a strong bias against following this path, so I'm going to
<br>
propose another suggestion.
<br>
<p>Without actually getting a PhD, Eliezer could increase his reputation among
<br>
academic thinkers via presenting his ideas in a more traditionally
<br>
acceptable form.  This is important for fundraising because when you
<br>
approach a wealthy potential donor for donations, they will often check with
<br>
their &quot;pet academics&quot; to see if you're kosher or not.  So it's better if you
<br>
have a decent reputation among the academics.
<br>
<p>A start toward this would be for Eliezer to write a systematic treatment of
<br>
his ideas about FAI in the form of a (technical or semi-technical book), to
<br>
be published by a typical academic press.  It's easier to get eccentric
<br>
ideas published in book form than in academic journals, because the
<br>
refereeing process is different.
<br>
<p>It may seem odd to recommend paper publication of ideas that are already
<br>
online, but the fact is that paper publication is taken more seriously by
<br>
the powers that be.  And I think that the process of putting one's ideas
<br>
into a more &quot;permanent&quot; form often forces one to tighten up one's lines of
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there are plenty of European universities that will give a PhD
<br>
based on research only, no coursework.  After publishing a treatise on FAI,
<br>
it might well be possible to get a PhD on the basis of that book.  I have
<br>
some particular European university connections that might be helpful in
<br>
this regard.  I also believe I could help with the publication of the book,
<br>
as I know a few editors at academic presses.
<br>
