<em>&gt;From the WTN Xprize site:
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://www.wtnxprize.org/">http://www.wtnxprize.org/</a>
<br>
<p>... and here's the relevant part:
<br>
<p>About The WTN X PRIZE
<br>
<p>The concept of the WTN X PRIZES is to utilize the concepts,
<br>
procedures, technologies and publicity developed X PRIZE Foundation's
<br>
Ansari X PRIZE competition for space and the global science and
<br>
technology innovators identification process and community developed
<br>
by the World Technology Network (WTN) to launch a series of technology
<br>
prizes seeking to meet the greatest challenges facing humanity in the
<br>
21st century.
<br>
<p>The X PRIZE competition focused on jumpstarting a private space
<br>
industry has re-proven the principle – strongly proven in the early
<br>
years of the 20th century for the aviation industry – that innovation
<br>
can indeed be catalyzed. That principle can and should be extended to
<br>
other global challenges and opportunities and together we at the World
<br>
Technology Network (WTN) and the X PRIZE Foundation are committed to
<br>
doing just that.
<br>
<p>What challenges/opportunities should be selected?
<br>
<p>Although the idea of using the X PRIZE concept work in other areas is
<br>
at first glance a simple and attractive one, a great deal of up-front
<br>
thought needs to go into what challenges/opportunities would be
<br>
selected. One could argue that there were certain qualities about the
<br>
challenges and opportunities in both the aviation field and the space
<br>
field that lent themselves extremely well to a private sector
<br>
competition of the sorts which have occurred. Variables to be looked
<br>
at might include:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The maturity (or lack thereof) of the technology around which
<br>
the competition would be based?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The maturity (or lack thereof) of the related industries from
<br>
which a new industry would be born
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The number of potential &quot;competitors&quot; potentially able to meet
<br>
the challenge or at least the depth of the pool from which potential
<br>
competitors could be drawn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The level of the specificity of the challenge
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The financial resources potentially available to finance the
<br>
potential competitors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The financial resources potentially available to finance the Prize itself
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How potentially compelling and exciting is the field around
<br>
which the challenge would be based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The amenability of the target area to a threshold change in
<br>
public expectation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The replicability of the challenge to other areas?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The level of the presumed long-term benefit to business and society
<br>
<p>The list of questions above is by no means exhaustive, but does give a
<br>
sense of how the selection of a new challenge is not as first as
<br>
simple as it may seem. It is absolutely key that the right challenges
<br>
are selected – sufficiently exciting to compel hearts and minds,
<br>
sufficiently ambitious to reach beyond what is already likely going to
<br>
occur soon and to have a truly substantial impact, and sufficiently
<br>
focused to have a good chance of succeeding within a reasonable
<br>
timescale.
<br>
<p>Potential types of challenges?
<br>
<p>Here is a very rough and incomplete list of the sorts of challenges
<br>
that might be appropriate:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Medical challenges, such a cure for cancer or other major diseases.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Technological &quot;holy grails&quot;, such as artificial intelligence,
<br>
teleportation, molecular assemblers (true nanotechnology), cold
<br>
fusion, or a believable virtual reality system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Major global challenges, such as the various UN Millennium
<br>
Development Goals (MDGs) announced by the world's leaders at the UN in
<br>
2000 at the Millennium Summit.
<br>
<p>Why We Are Asking You For Suggestions?
<br>
<p>There are over billions of people on the planet, almost each of whom
<br>
has a dream for a better world. The chances of us finding a truly
<br>
worthwhile series of challenges for the WTN X PRIZE competitions over
<br>
the coming years are that much greater the more suggestions we
<br>
receive. We are asking you because your dreams are the repository of
<br>
an enormous amount of creativity and hope. In the spirit of man's
<br>
first reach into space, we ask you to stretch your imagination to help
<br>
take humanity to the next level. Are you up to the challenge?
