Thanks Anne Marie
<br>
<p>Just to clarify:  that text was not mine - it was from the WTN X prize site.
<br>
<p>I posted it because I imagined that the SIAI would be interested in
<br>
ensuring (as rapidly as possible) that the WTN people were educated to
<br>
ensure that:
<br>
<p>1)  there is not an X-prize encouraging an UNSAFE simple
<br>
brain-copy-upload style AI; and that concomitantly
<br>
2)  there is an X-prize for the various concrete steps leading towards
<br>
SAFE friendly seed AI.
<br>
<p>(An X-prize for actually achieving friendly seed AI would obviously
<br>
never need collection!)
<br>
<p>Enjoyed your thoughts, although I'm not sure how much of that will
<br>
happen prior to singularity.

<em>&gt; Hi Tim,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would think one of the obvious next steps is to build autonomous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots that we can send into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space. Capable of building more robots from native materials and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to build human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habitats awaiting our arrival on the Moon, Mars, any number of moon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belonging to the gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giants and large asteroids. These robots can also collect vital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials for human technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bring them back to earth (as well as our or inhabited outposts.) The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit of such economy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the value of spreading terestrial life to as many places as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, make this a high priority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that brilliant and creative men can produce unprecedents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results on a shoe string budget,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates we should be empowering such men and women to explore, invent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and create from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole cloth new technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the major problems encountered was Government interference and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beaurocracy. We're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nation of inventors and tinkerers... we need to create an environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where our best and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brightest can play, and make amazing things far all people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can imagine dozens of possible prizes... cheap, renewable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonpolluting energy. Of equal or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even greater importance, small, light, nonpolluting, efficient means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store and transport said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Effective neural interfaces (you can't get better VR than directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driving the brain.) Better displays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and immersive VR technology will get better fast, with or without an X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prize. Figure gaming and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sexual interest will probably keep pushing the tech until it's gone as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as it can go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The cure for cancer is so close it's not even funny... as we unpeel the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secrets of our genome, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cure for cancer and every other genetic ailment will naturally fall out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not at all certain an X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prize there will make a difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Addressing Global Challlenges will require addressing Global assumptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about being human,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more importantly addressing human endeavor at it's most basic level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As long as we exist in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a world given by greed, nationalism, corporatism, ethnic cleansing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious conflict, death vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival, desease, environmental degradation, and scarcity mentality, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have a terrible time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making profound changes in the nature of humanity and it's institutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is time for humanity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address itself. Design a better future by choice and engineering rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than one that simply lands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on us like Dorothy's house landed on the wicked witch. It will take more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an X Prize to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dent in the mess that humanity is. However, a multinational project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the backing of the X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prize, to begin to design economic and sociopolitical models that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustainable, productive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate the kind of world that would make being human worthwhile for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all people, might indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a worthwhile endeavor. Clearly to sociological hangover we currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer from needs to end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it kills us all.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Cool conversation.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... and here's the relevant part:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;About The WTN X PRIZE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The concept of the WTN X PRIZES is to utilize the concepts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;procedures, technologies and publicity developed X PRIZE Foundation's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ansari X PRIZE competition for space and the global science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;technology innovators identification process and community developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by the World Technology Network (WTN) to launch a series of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;prizes seeking to meet the greatest challenges facing humanity in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;21st century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The X PRIZE competition focused on jumpstarting a private space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;industry has re-proven the principle – strongly proven in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;years of the 20th century for the aviation industry – that innovation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;can indeed be catalyzed. That principle can and should be extended to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;other global challenges and opportunities and together we at the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Technology Network (WTN) and the X PRIZE Foundation are committed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;doing just that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What challenges/opportunities should be selected?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Although the idea of using the X PRIZE concept work in other areas is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at first glance a simple and attractive one, a great deal of up-front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thought needs to go into what challenges/opportunities would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;selected. One could argue that there were certain qualities about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;challenges and opportunities in both the aviation field and the space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;field that lent themselves extremely well to a private sector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;competition of the sorts which have occurred. Variables to be looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at might include:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The maturity (or lack thereof) of the technology around which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the competition would be based?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The maturity (or lack thereof) of the related industries from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which a new industry would be born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The number of potential &quot;competitors&quot; potentially able to meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the challenge or at least the depth of the pool from which potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;competitors could be drawn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The level of the specificity of the challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The financial resources potentially available to finance the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;potential competitors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The financial resources potentially available to finance the Prize itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * How potentially compelling and exciting is the field around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which the challenge would be based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The amenability of the target area to a threshold change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;public expectation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The replicability of the challenge to other areas?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * The level of the presumed long-term benefit to business and society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The list of questions above is by no means exhaustive, but does give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sense of how the selection of a new challenge is not as first as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;simple as it may seem. It is absolutely key that the right challenges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are selected – sufficiently exciting to compel hearts and minds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sufficiently ambitious to reach beyond what is already likely going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;occur soon and to have a truly substantial impact, and sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;focused to have a good chance of succeeding within a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;timescale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Potential types of challenges?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Here is a very rough and incomplete list of the sorts of challenges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that might be appropriate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * Medical challenges, such a cure for cancer or other major diseases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * Technological &quot;holy grails&quot;, such as artificial intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;teleportation, molecular assemblers (true nanotechnology), cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fusion, or a believable virtual reality system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    * Major global challenges, such as the various UN Millennium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Development Goals (MDGs) announced by the world's leaders at the UN in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;2000 at the Millennium Summit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why We Are Asking You For Suggestions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There are over billions of people on the planet, almost each of whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;has a dream for a better world. The chances of us finding a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;worthwhile series of challenges for the WTN X PRIZE competitions over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the coming years are that much greater the more suggestions we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;receive. We are asking you because your dreams are the repository of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;an enormous amount of creativity and hope. In the spirit of man's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;first reach into space, we ask you to stretch your imagination to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;take humanity to the next level. Are you up to the challenge?
</em><br>
