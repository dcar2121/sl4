<em>&gt;&gt; Actually, let me amend that question.  According to your given

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; real-world issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The empirical probability of a physicist's prediction is not certainty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; - it can't be, not in an uncertain universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real-world observations made by experimental physicists go into the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; derived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So when I ask you to accept my physics theory as rigorous, I'm asking

<p>All men are mortal.
<br>
Socrates is a man.
<br>
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
<br>
<p>This is a valid syllogism.  Is it a rigorous, technically sophisticated 
<br>
theory of biology?
<br>
<p>Suppose I &quot;axiomatized&quot; Friendly AI in such a way that my conclusions 
<br>
followed from my assumptions, but using silly verbal definitions as of 
<br>
Greek philosophy.  Would you call that rigorous?  Rigorous but wrong?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You could consider it rigorous but wrong, if you disagree with me about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what experimental data is valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said, the notion of rigor is in part cultural, therefore tricky to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define in a rigorous way  ;-)  I don't think this makes the notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, math theorems as published in math journals aren't 100% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rigorous -- they're not fully formalized like in Mizar -- yet they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culturally accepted as rigorous...
</em><br>
<p>Is this the kind of rigor that you *want* from Friendly AI theory?  I have 
<br>
little use for conclusions that are absolutely certain given their 
<br>
assumptions.  I want conclusions that are correct.  A Friendly AI is a 
<br>
physical object in a physical universe, not a mathematical theorem.  We 
<br>
need a way to predict the real-world behavior of the physical object.  In 
<br>
particular, I would consider it a bad idea to build a Friendly AI that goes 
<br>
mad given one bitflip.  Yet the very same Friendly AI might (we can 
<br>
imagine) be provably Friendly *assuming* that no bitflip ever occurs in any 
<br>
transistor.
<br>
<p>But mostly, my objection to your definition of &quot;rigor&quot; (and if you change 
<br>
your mind and decide that you want something other than &quot;rigor&quot; from a 
<br>
Friendly AI theory, feel free to say so) is that (a) it seems to rule out 
<br>
probabilistic conclusions of very high probability, which is the best we 
<br>
can ever do in the real world, and (b) it doesn't detect the difference 
<br>
between Aristotle and Newton so long as both use technically valid 
<br>
syllogisms.  It could even penalize Newton, if he didn't bother to pretend 
<br>
that his experimental predictions were absolutely certain syllogisms.
