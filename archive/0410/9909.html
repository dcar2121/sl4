<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, you, a human, can come up with a short
</em><br>
explanation that is more 
<br>
cheaply computable than physics. And this explanation
<br>
seems good to you, 
<br>
since it enables you to actually compute a prediction
<br>
and manipulate 
<br>
reality, where the underlying equations of physics are
<br>
intractable to you. 
<br>
But reality itself does not care about your cheapo
<br>
explanation. Reality 
<br>
cares only about the explanation that the universe
<br>
itself uses, that 
<br>
incredibly intractable process of quantum mechanics.
<br>
The computation you 
<br>
have in your mind that lets you cheaply predict your
<br>
nose is not part of 
<br>
your nose; it exists only in the particles making up
<br>
your brain. Your 
<br>
actual nose uses only physics. And indeed, could you
<br>
pay the cost of 
<br>
computing, the equations of quantum mechanics would
<br>
give you a more precise 
<br>
(better calibrated) predictive distribution over the
<br>
possible locations of 
<br>
your nose, than anything you could do with mere
<br>
explanation. Even if the 
<br>
explanation is simpler in the Kolmogorov sense, and
<br>
not just cheaper to 
<br>
compute, reality itself still doesn't care about
<br>
anything but physics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That's it. That's the whole fuss silly philosophers
</em><br>
make over reductionism 
<br>
and holism. A computationally intractable physical
<br>
phenomenon can have 
<br>
regularities that enable human minds to produce
<br>
&quot;explanations&quot;, but the 
<br>
explanations are still only in the mind, not in the
<br>
underlying physics. 
<br>
The explanations are not anything above or beyond the
<br>
physics. They are 
<br>
not anything extra that must be added to the physics.
<br>
They are just 
<br>
cheaper ways for humans to compute (almost) the same
<br>
results. 
<br>
<p>I am not at all sure you are right about this.  I
<br>
think these statements of yours probably sum up the
<br>
reason why I seriously doubt your current approach.
<br>
<p>What is 'physics'?  All of the current concepts of
<br>
physics started with human attempts to *explain* the
<br>
universe. I don't see why what you call *cheapo*
<br>
explanations are any less fundamental than physics
<br>
explanations.  Remember even quantum physics started
<br>
out as a form human explanation.
<br>
<p>You say (of higher level explanations) that 'the
<br>
explanations are only in the mind', but I don't see a
<br>
clear-cut distinction between the physics  explanation
<br>
and a higher-level more holistic explanation.
<br>
Following your line of reasoning you'd have to say
<br>
that quantum physics is only in the mind as well.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Philosophers get all weirded out about how water
</em><br>
appears to have this 
<br>
magical additional property of wetness. This error is
<br>
yet another case of 
<br>
Jaynes's &quot;Mind Projection Fallacy&quot;. Philosophers think
<br>
as if explanations 
<br>
were somehow real things, instead of explanations
<br>
being cheap imperfect 
<br>
approximations of physics. 
<br>
<p>Are you sure about this?
<br>
<p>Physicists think as if 'physics' was somehow a real
<br>
thing which could exist independently of a mind to
<br>
comprehend it....
<br>
<p>What is the distinction between 'explanations' and
<br>
'physics'?  I must confess I do not see it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A human may discover the additional cheap 
</em><br>
approximation of wetness, and this will be an
<br>
additional thought that was 
<br>
not there before. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the map is not the territory
</em><br>
<p>Isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The water molecules 
</em><br>
themselves are just water molecules, and have no
<br>
additional property of 
<br>
wetness. The apparent &quot;additional property&quot; exists in
<br>
your explanation of 
<br>
the water, playing no role in the physics of the water
<br>
itself. The thought 
<br>
of &quot;wetness&quot; exists in you as a thought distinct from
<br>
your thought about 
<br>
the low-level physics of water molecules. But water
<br>
molecules do not have 
<br>
an additional property of wetness apart from their
<br>
low-level physics
<br>
<p>The very concept of 'water molecules' is just a human
<br>
explanation for complex quantum wave functions isn't
<br>
it?  So why is 'the physics of water molecules' any
<br>
more fundamental than the property of 'wetness'?
