</em><br>
<p>Please don't.  That action potentially has catastrophic public relations 
<br>
consequences for SIAI, even if we never knew and never approved.  I said it 
<br>
in 1996 when I first published &quot;Staring into the Singularity&quot;, and I'll say 
<br>
it again:  Don't go robbing banks!
<br>
<p>If I had no ethics that I held to even in the face of existential risk, I'd 
<br>
have no ethics at all, and I don't think that would work out well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My point is not &quot;The SIAI should flood the internet with poker-playing AIs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with moral and possibly legal repercussions&quot;, but rather that this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large and rich world, and I am VERY skeptical that the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort-to-raising-capital ratio for the SIAI would be found through relying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely on donors.  There are a zillion ways for intelligent people to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively easy (or fast) money.
</em><br>
<p>Great.  Step onto the stage and take up that role.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also occurs to me that there are a great many millionaires in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than soliciting donations piecemeal from average-income enthusiasts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't it possible that time would be better spent targeting well-off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eccentrics and shooting for a couple million in one clean sweep?  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of people rich enough to not even notice that kind of money, or are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already looking for tax-deductable charities to dump it on.  A lot of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in the tech sector, too, so I would imagine they're be more predisposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this kind of thing.
</em><br>
<p>It's damned near impossible to talk to these people.  You don't go to them, 
<br>
they come to you.  But if you think you can do it: step onto the stage, 
<br>
fill the empty role.  Don't chide the actors for failing to fill it, when 
<br>
you have your own hands.
<br>
<p>People call out such brilliant advice for the actors upon the distant 
<br>
stage.  If it's a good idea, go ahead, don't let me stop you.  It's your 
<br>
planet too.
