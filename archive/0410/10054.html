<p>
Along with the freedom to question authority, must come the realization 
<br>
that authority is sometimes busy (I'm moving to a new apartment within 
<br>
Atlanta within the next week) and may not be able to answer *all* of your 
<br>
questions, so pick a criterion that says it's okay to just answer some.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why not invent a business, make enormous loads of money like everyone who 
<br>
founds a technology startup, and use that to fund the AI effort?&quot;
<br>
<p>I used to think that way.  In 1998, when I published &quot;Coding a Transhuman 
<br>
AI&quot;... it feels like centuries ago... Brian Atkins wrote me and said, d'you 
<br>
suppose this is something that a small team of programmers could do?  And I 
<br>
said, nah, the Singularity is thirty years off, wanna start a business 
<br>
instead?  Then we'd have enough money to launch the planet-sized Manhattan 
<br>
project it would take to shorten the Singularity ETA by a few years.  And 
<br>
Brian Atkins said, sure.  It was the summer of the dot-com era.  So I came 
<br>
up with a bright idea I'd never seen done before, and spent the next six 
<br>
months studying venture capital, marketing, markets, IPOs, corporate 
<br>
structures, and writing a business plan.  I can't remember whether it was 
<br>
Brian Atkins or me who first realized it wasn't going to work, but the 
<br>
realization was nearly simultaneous.
<br>
<p>Developing a new technology and launching a corporation is really, really, 
<br>
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, 
<br>
really, hard.
<br>
<p>If you start a company, it's your life.  You don't do it on the way to 
<br>
something else.
<br>
<p>No matter how hard you try, you can't possibly have more than a fifty 
<br>
percent chance of success.  A realistic number would be more like ten 
<br>
percent for technology companies.  Everyone believes they're going to beat 
<br>
the odds.  At that point in my life, at the age of eighteen, I hadn't read 
<br>
my Tversky and Kahneman and I didn't know how absurdly optimistic people 
<br>
who start businesses are (experimental result, please note).  If I'd known 
<br>
in 1998 I wouldn't even have dreamed of trying.  Well, maybe I would, with 
<br>
the Singularity comfortably ensconced thirty years in the future.
<br>
<p>It was hard to make the mental shift to planning to work for a nonprofit. 
<br>
I had dreams, fantasies of fantastic wealth.  I let go.  It had been a 
<br>
child's thought.
<br>
<p>If you insert the attempt to start a new technology company into the set of 
<br>
chained probabilities leading up to a successful Singularity, it has to 
<br>
reduce the final probability of success by at least three-quarters. 
<br>
Probably more.  The more innovative the technology, the newer the market, 
<br>
the less the probability of success.
<br>
<p>In the very unlikely event you succeed at the business and are not shot 
<br>
down by any of the dozen different causes of failure, the business becomes 
<br>
your life.  &quot;Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.&quot; 
<br>
If you want to accomplish your plans, you have to stick to them, and not 
<br>
get sidetracked by life.  This is a truth harsh enough that most people 
<br>
aren't willing to face up to it, and so their life happens to them while 
<br>
they are making other plans.
<br>
<p>And even if you succeed, you lose years.  I don't think the human species 
<br>
has that kind of time.  If we win, and we may not win, it's going to be 
<br>
close.  We need the difficult cure before the easy disease.  Add a delay of 
<br>
six years (and probably more) to start a corporation, assume the unlikely 
<br>
event of success, and by the time we were done it would probably be just 
<br>
too late.  Also, *I* don't have time.  I have to do my thinking while I'm 
<br>
still young enough to think.  I have to use my annus mirabilis years on AI 
<br>
and nothing else.  Youth is a non-renewable resource for solving scientific 
<br>
problems.  I still live in fear of running out of youth before I run out of 
<br>
fundamental AI problems requiring basic shifts in thinking and deep mental 
<br>
retraining.
<br>
<p>Oh, and fifty-five million humans die forever every year.  It's a piece of 
<br>
knowledge that sinks its way into you very slowly, because it's so hard to 
<br>
comprehend.  But I understand more as time goes on.  I'll try and stay sane 
<br>
(well, reasonably sane) regardless, which is the most critical part of this 
<br>
job and the part that most people would instantly flub.
<br>
<p>It might make sense for other SIAI supporters to try and start companies 
<br>
with the goal of funding the Singularity Institute if they succeed.  Some 
<br>
of them are.  It does not make sense for me to do so, unless I am willing 
<br>
to entirely sacrifice my potential as an FAI researcher.
<br>
<p>There is only one thing that I can try to accomplish with my life and it is 
<br>
solving the FAI problem.  Try to do anything else, and I throw away my 
<br>
chance, assuming I have one.
<br>
<p>But mostly, I think people making the suggestion don't know how unlikely is 
<br>
a new company to succeed, how much energy it takes from a person, the cold 
<br>
statistics of technology startup survival rates, and the wry psychology 
<br>
experiments showing that everyone thinks they can beat the statistics 
<br>
because their plan is different.
<br>
<p>As for the comment about monks holding out begging bowls... either this is 
<br>
a suggestion that all charities stay small and accomplish nothing, which is 
<br>
false-to-fact, or it is a suggestion that begging is beneath a proud 
<br>
Earth's defender.  In which latter case the speaker does not begin to 
<br>
comprehend the concept of &quot;existential risk&quot;.  Pride counts for nothing. 
<br>
It vanishes like a snowflake in the ocean, a feather buried under the 
<br>
weight of lives.  Yes, it hurt to ask for help, just like it hurt to give 
<br>
up my dreams of being a millionaire.  I did it anyway because people were 
<br>
dying.  I suppose that sounds hokey to some people, like I'm making a big 
<br>
deal over nothing and feeling too much.  Fine.  Maybe someday you'll 
<br>
understand that it was all real, or maybe you'll die before then.  Maybe 
<br>
you'll die one day before the bus arrives.  If so, I'd like to apologize 
<br>
now for not working just a little bit faster.
