Eli,
<br>
<p>Honestly, getting a PhD, getting and holding a professor job, and getting
<br>
offers of tenure was pretty easy for me to do in my &quot;spare time&quot; while
<br>
working on my own whacky research with  most of my time.  I reckon the same
<br>
would be true for you.  I could be wrong, of course.  But I note that  my
<br>
opinion here is based on a lot of actual knowledge about real universities,
<br>
gained via experience....  On this particular topic your opinions don't seem
<br>
well-grounded in experience.
<br>
<p>About recruiting a PhD to be your spokesperson -- I guess the only way this
<br>
would work, would be if you found someone who was an intellectual and
<br>
visionary roughly equal to you, and wanted to collaborate with you and be
<br>
the spokesperson for your collective work.  That would be great.  But short
<br>
of that, I don't think that recruiting a spokesperson will work.  People
<br>
don't want to talk to the spokesman, they want to talk to *da man*, the
<br>
visionary genius behind it all....  Eliezer-with-academic-legitimacy would
<br>
be a far better money magnet than
<br>
Eliezer-plus-a-buddy-with-academic-respectibility-but-no-genius....
<br>
<p>But anyway, I can see you're determined to follow your own idiosyncratic
<br>
path regardless of all this sage advice of mine ;-) ... and of course, I
<br>
wish you good fortune!
<br>
<p>-- Ben G

<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, knowing you moderately well as I do, I think that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks, but no thanks.  I'd love to live on a college campus, ideally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within easy walking distance of the main technical library.  I'd hate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually *work* there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Getting the PhD would be fairly easy for you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am skeptical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and once you had it, you could get a job as a professor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am highly skeptical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guaranteeing you a lifetime income,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Getting tenure isn't difficult or anything, is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with fairly minimal duties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Join the Army, learn to repair trucks.  (And kill people, but that almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never happens.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beyond doing and publishing your research.  And, perhaps more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; importantly, you having a PhD would make it significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier for SIAI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; raise money for your research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I benefited a lot from the research-time I obtained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; academic for 8 years; and in my business pursuits now, I'm taken more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seriously than I would be otherwise because I have a PhD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There's something to be said for boldly forging your own path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in life, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there's also some value to playing the games of the society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're embedded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's also something to be said for thinking outside the box.  Much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster to recruit an existing PhD as spokesperson than take the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuitous uncertain route.
