<p>I seriously doubt this is possible.  Regardless of what input goes
<br>
into an 8-year old's senses, and regardless of how patient you are or
<br>
how good of an explainer you are, they have a lot of prerequisite
<br>
stuff to learn--years of it, in fact--that is going to take time to
<br>
sink in.  Their own neural firing rates only happen at a certain rate.
<br>
&nbsp;If you're a really good explainer, maybe you can speed up someone's
<br>
learning curve by a factor of 2 or 3, but not by a factor of 100 which
<br>
is more like what it would take to get your average 8 year old (or
<br>
even an exceptionally bright 8-year-old) to understand GR better than
<br>
an expert who has spent his entire life learning it and working in the
<br>
field, before they turned 9.  Regarding your qualification &quot;better
<br>
*intuitive* understanding&quot; I think you gain intuition for a subject
<br>
the best by spending years working on it.
