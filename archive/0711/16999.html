Some thoughts and comments. Open to anybody's reply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for nanotechnology and hard AI, those fields have run into brick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walls so complete that there's no more point in discussing those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusions than in debating the claims of scientologists or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alchemists.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Brick walls so complete that there's no point&quot; - then why write this at 
<br>
all? It would be much more useful to write a review paper (i.e., doing) 
<br>
to show the many (as I am sure) thousands of tactics that have failed. 
<br>
That would be useful- I might have to do this myself. Would anybody be 
<br>
interested in helping me compile &quot;failed AI techniques&quot; and &quot;failed 
<br>
nanotech&quot; ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No one knows what intelligence is or how to measure it — and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for that failure is overwhelming:
</em><br>
<p>It is interesting to go through your day and not use the &quot;intelligence&quot; 
<br>
concept. Try this out, you might not be missing much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; just starting to reesarch these areas.&quot; The exact same kinds of vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand-waving you get when you confront ufologists and ask them for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof of their wild claims.
</em><br>
<p>When men go out to explore the wild frontiers and make their destinies, 
<br>
many do not come back; the wild consumes them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can debunk the assertion that these technologies don't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and haven't worked and can't work, great…do it. Do it now. Do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now. Give us the hard evidence that hard AI works. Give us the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard evidence that nanotechnology works and produced operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drexlerian assembler. Give us the hard evidence that genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering can reliably enhance human intelligence. Give us that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard evidence that claims about people &quot;uploading their minds into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers&quot; are anything more than a foolishly ignorant delusion
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Do it now&quot; deserves repeating. Do it now. Do it now. Go join a graduate 
<br>
school, purchase access to as many scientific journals as you can 
<br>
handle, find labs or make your own. (Take me on for the ride, too.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet what has Ray Kurzweil and his transhumanist extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarian followers given us? Nothing. Just a bunch of PR.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe we need another type of PR: the rise of the 
<br>
transhumanist-scientist/programmer. &quot;Any PR is bad PR.&quot; So maybe we 
<br>
should leave it at that and move on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I want hard evidence for transhumanism
</em><br>
<p>What? Is this really an issue? I do not understand. Transhumanism, the 
<br>
commitment to self-creation, is more of a mindset. Unless there is 
<br>
something that I am missing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise, shut up, because you're spouting ignorant tripe.
</em><br>
<p>We need to drown them out with more technical works. Hopefully the 
<br>
internet/the-Signal will not become poisoned with this 'ignorant 
<br>
tripe'.
<br>
<p>- Bryan
