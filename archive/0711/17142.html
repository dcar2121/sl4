</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wasn't this already covered several years ago, by Eli &amp; Co.? This
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI.html#design_generic_stomp">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI.html#design_generic_stomp</a>). To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Scenario:  The Riemann Hypothesis Catastrophe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You ask an AI to solve the Riemann Hypothesis. As a subgoal of solving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem, the AI turns all the matter in the solar system into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computronium, exterminating humanity along the way.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You missed the point I was making. A human scientist asked to solve a
<br>
technical problem would be able to understand that this means working
<br>
within certain constraints (or if he didn't understand that, the
<br>
constraints could be explicitly satisfied). The scientist might be
<br>
able to see that the problem could be best tackled if he spends his
<br>
time lobbying for increased research funding rather than doing
<br>
mathematics, but that doesn't mean that is what he will do. He is able
<br>
to understand the difference between directly working on the problem
<br>
and other, indirect means of working on the problem. An AI should be
<br>
smart enough to understand what this means too. Therefore, an obedient
<br>
AI which is asked to work on a problem should understand what that
<br>
means, and do it. It's not a problem if its goal is just to be
<br>
obedient, and it can understand human language at least as well as a
<br>
human.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is still the possibility that the obedient AI will
<br>
through human malice or stupidity attempt to destroy the world anyway,
<br>
but that's something we have always had to deal with with any
<br>
technology.
