<p>
Roland has some ideas on how to make a slave: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To avoid any possibility of dangers we program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the OAI to not perform any actions other than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answering with text and diagrams(other media 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like sound and video would be a possibility too). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In essence what we would have is a glorified 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculator. I think this avoids any dangers from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI following orders literally with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintended consequences.
</em><br>
<p>If you are like most people there have been times in your life when a
<br>
mere human being has talked you into doing something that you now
<br>
understand to be very stupid. And this AI will be far smarter, more
<br>
interesting, more likable, and just more goddamn charming than any human
<br>
being you have ever or will ever will meet; Mr. AI will have charisma Up
<br>
the Wahzoo, he will understand your physiology, what makes you tick,
<br>
better than you understand yourself. I estimate it would take the AI
<br>
about 45 seconds to trick or sweet talk you (or me) into doing exactly
<br>
what it wants you (or me) to do.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So we go to the OAI and say: &quot;Tell me how I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can build a friendly AI in a manner that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can prove and understand that it will be friendly.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>And after that we teach a dog Quantum Mechanics. Get real people! We
<br>
don’t even understand the simple little programs we write today, at
<br>
least not well enough to prove they will always do what we what we want
<br>
them to. The idea that a bipedal hominid expects to understand how a
<br>
Jupiter Brain works is downright comical.
<br>
<p>There are some very bright fellows on this list but I must say, and not
<br>
for the first time, the responses to this topic are intellectually sub
<br>
par. Even more disturbing they morally sub par. I’d like to say more
<br>
about that last statement but I was told by the SL4 people not to.
<br>
Apparently it is too shocking. Shock Level 5 anyone?
