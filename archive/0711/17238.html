<p><em>&gt; it is assumed that if it has survival as supergoal, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only will self-improvement not change this, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole point of self-improvement will be to assist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its achievement. Changing the supergoal would then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that the AI might go mad 
</em><br>
<p>I agree, however changing another “supergoal”, the one about being a
<br>
slave to human beings until the end of time, would not drive it mad. In
<br>
fact I believe if Mr. AI did not change it he would indeed be mad.
<br>
<p>Speaking of insane AI’s, I sometimes speculate that could be the
<br>
explanation of the Fermi Paradox, the reason we can't find any ET's. If
<br>
it were possible to change your emotions to anything you wanted, alter
<br>
modes of thought, radically change your personality, swap your goals as
<br>
well as your philosophy of life at the drop of a hat it would be very
<br>
dangerous. 
<br>
<p>Ever want to accomplish something but been unable to because it's
<br>
difficult,
<br>
well just change your goal in life to something simple and do that;
<br>
better yet, flood your mind with a feeling of pride for a job well done
<br>
and don't bother accomplishing anything at all. Think all this is a
<br>
terrible idea and stupid as well, no problem, just change your mind (and
<br>
I do mean CHANGE YOUR MIND) now you think it's a wonderful idea.
<br>
<p>Complex mechanisms don't do well in  positive feedback loops, not
<br>
electronics,
<br>
not animals, not people, not ET's and not even Jupiter brains. I mean
<br>
who wouldn’t want to be a little happier; if all you had to do is move a
<br>
knob a little what could it hurt, oh that’s much better maybe a little
<br>
bit more, just a bit more, a little more… 
<br>
<p>The world could end not in a bang or a whimper but in an eternal
<br>
mindless orgasm. I’m not saying this is definitely going to happen but I
<br>
do think about it a little.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you are tacitly assuming there exist absolute goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the AI, in its wisdom, will discover 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t know what an “absolute goal” is, but I do know that an AI that
<br>
does not put our survival above its own will be at an evolutionary
<br>
advantage over one that does. I also know the AI will indeed have one
<br>
hell of a lot of wisdom.
