</em><br>
<p>False. Fix n = 1. There are exactly two sequences of complexity 1, call
<br>
them A and B. Here's a predictor that makes at most one mistake on these
<br>
two sequences: guess the values of A until you see that you're not in
<br>
sequence A (this takes 1 bit), and then guess the values of B.
<br>
<p>Now take the infinite class of programs that are identical to the
<br>
predictor above, except that each such program P_n will make n
<br>
deliberate mistakes by reversing its guess. There are infinitely many of
<br>
these, and you can prove that each of them makes only finitely many
<br>
mistakes on all infinite sequences of complexity 1.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is my interpretation right?  If so, does it support Wolfram's empirical

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No. This would mean that only finitely many computable functions are
<br>
non-universal. Here's an infinite class of non-universal computable
<br>
functions: {f_n(x) := n + x | n in N}.
<br>
<p>In a previous e-mail I said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Matt, you've been consistently misusing Shane Legg's results. I'd
<br>
suggest asking Shane about what you need to study before you can
<br>
understand his research.&quot;
<br>
<p>This wasn't just a random nasty comment. I was serious.
