<p>I definitely expect better results than that. At least some of the questions 
<br>
are clearly not &quot;mysterious&quot;. For example we already have a completely 
<br>
non-mysterious (but imperfect) answer to &quot;How does induction work?&quot; in the 
<br>
form of Solomonoff Induction. If human beings can discover Solomonoff 
<br>
Induction, shouldn't an SI be able to do better?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that we can expect a more advanced intelligence to demonstrate
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Take Solomonoff Induction again. Sure you need a certain level of 
<br>
intelligence to understand it, but not SI-like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It could provide the **appearance** of a satisfactory answer.
</em><br>
<p>I realize this is a possibility, and stated it myself as &quot;search for the
<br>
string that maximizes intellectual satisfaction for the questioner&quot;. However 
<br>
this is an outcome that I would really like to avoid.
<br>
<p>The rest of alternatives that you suggest either represent more mundane 
<br>
failures of Friendliness or are covered by my response above.
