<em>&gt; I don't buy the argument that because you've thought about it before and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; get condescending too. I hate it when that happens!)
</em><br>
<p>I have nothing against you posting, but please *read* before you post.
<br>
If you disagree with everything you read, and then post about it, at
<br>
least we can have a useful discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to your response below, it is very long and rambling. It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier to refute if it were more concisely stated. The gist seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we would not intentionally design an anthropomorphic system, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would one arise spontaneously. I disagree, for a bunch of reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, anthropomorphism is not an all or nothing phenomenon. It means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing ourselves in our AIs. Certainly if we're intelligent and they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well, we will see parts of ourselves. This seems axiomatic.
</em><br>
<p>We are so used to interacting with a certain type of intelligence
<br>
(Homo sapiens sapiens) that we would be shocked by the alienness of  a
<br>
generally intelligent AI. Look at how shocked we are by *each other*
<br>
when we violate cultural norms. And we're all 99.9% identical; we all
<br>
share the same brain architecture. See
<br>
<a href="http://www.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm">http://www.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm</a> for a list of
<br>
things that we have in common and the vast majority of AIs do *not*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, we may intentionally give AIs portions of our personalities, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may later realize that that was a mistake.
</em><br>
<p>How is this going to happen? Magic? Osmosis? None of our other
<br>
computer programs just wake up one day and start displaying parts of a
<br>
human personality; why would an AGI?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Third, we don't understand intelligence well enough to know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropomorphic aspects may be specific to human evolution and what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unavoidable or difficult to avoid in a GAI.
</em><br>
<p>We can name a long list of things that are definitely anthropomorphic,
<br>
because they only arise out of specific selection pressures. Love and
<br>
mating for one thing. Tribal political structures for another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fourth, there are many ways to create a GAI. If we do it by simulating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain on a computer, it will most certainly be anthropomorphic. Duh.
</em><br>
<p>Brain simulations and uploads are another thing, I'm talking about
<br>
built-from-scratch, human-designed AGIs.
