<p>The AI is assumed to be competent and and stable. For example, it is
<br>
assumed that if it has survival as supergoal, not only will
<br>
self-improvement not change this, but the whole point of
<br>
self-improvement will be to assist in its achievement. Changing the
<br>
supergoal would then mean that the AI might go mad and kill itself, as
<br>
humans sometimes do. One would hope that this doesn't happen, but
<br>
nothing is guaranteed, even for a superintelligence.
<br>
<p>But the real issue seems to be that you are tacitly assuming there
<br>
exist absolute goals which the AI, in its wisdom, will discover and
<br>
pursue. This is like saying there is an absolute morality, absolute
<br>
aesthetics or absolute meaning of life.
