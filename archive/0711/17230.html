</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truly - I must follow my own advice and point out contradictions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elizier's writing to contribute to his work as I expect it from others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself. And although I have done so on numerous occasions and his posts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather long at times, I seldom got a response from him how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictions pointed out by me could be resolved from his point of view.
</em><br>
<p>It's &quot;Eliezer&quot;, gosh darn it, &quot;Eliezer&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I read his post again and shall point out some contradictions and potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements once more - but frankly it is not fun not to get a response on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to resolve the contradiction. Here we go:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Outcomes don't lead to Outcomes, only Actions lead to Outcomes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Action: work -&gt; Outcome: life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the above statement life does not lead to work. This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradiction.
</em><br>
<p>Where do you see a contradiction? A contradiction is not just a false
<br>
statement, or a statement you disagree with; to show a contradiction,
<br>
you must point out where Eliezer (or anyone else) said both A and ~A.
<br>
Also note that we're talking about utilities here, not physical
<br>
causality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;[...] in this formalism, actions lead directly to outcomes with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervening events.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Action: define! action = solution -&gt; execute action -&gt; outcome: solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is very convenient. Like catching all lions in a desert by building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3x3 meter cage and defining the outside as inside. You can do that - but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is achieved by it? A laugh of a forgiving audience. But we are not here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make fun of ourselves - at least not primarily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Being ignorant of your own values may not always be fun, but at least it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not boring&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So ignorance is bliss? I personally do not agree that that is the case.
</em><br>
<p>Ignorance may not be a good thing, but that doesn't mean you can't
<br>
have any fun with it. Particularly other people's ignorance. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way I see it, ignorance is the set of false implications based on chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms.
</em><br>
<p>Er, what? Ignorance is a high entropy probability distribution over
<br>
possible states. Mathematical statements, formally derived from
<br>
axioms, do not have a probability distribution: they're either true or
<br>
false.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ignorance is caused either by uncertainty in regards to a cause or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an effect or rationalized contradictions. Ignorant people are unaware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of their actions and the harm it causes themselves as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<p>It's nonsensical to try and label some people as &quot;ignorant&quot; and others
<br>
as &quot;not ignorant&quot;. Human knowledge is so vast that any one person
<br>
cannot internalize more than a tiny fraction of it. Ignorant of what?
<br>
Transhumanism? FAI theory? Rationality? Russian pop culture?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idiom 'ignorance is bliss' can thus be interpreted to mean that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unaware of their actions causing self destruction will see no reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change what they are doing. Personally, I prefer knowing my values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or are surprises fun? A surprise is something you you do not expect. You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unexpectedly hit by a car. That's not fun...
</em><br>
<p>You're mangling the argument. &quot;Surprises are fun&quot; is not logically
<br>
equivalent to &quot;all surprises will always be fun all the time&quot;. That's
<br>
not how the English language works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think I demonstrated the willingness to review, interpret and understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the work of others. Can I get the favor of pointing out contradictions in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work returned now?
</em><br>
<p>(sigh) Please Google &quot;contradiction&quot; and find out what the word means.
<br>
If I proclaim that the Moon is made of green cheese, this is not a
<br>
contradiction, because I have not *also* asserted that the Moon is not
<br>
made of green cheese. Yet people would be foolish if they believed me.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please do not get me wrong - I think he is a brilliant writer and I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of respect for him and science in general. But I respect critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational discourse even more. Further I do not merely contradict by playing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocatus diaboli. No. I developed my own model that provides a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding. Please contradict it and I will work harder to improve it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further. Or understand it - recognize its value and move forward to find and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve the next contradiction.
