<p>How does it *know*, ahead of time, to explain it to you, rather than
<br>
just doing it? This kind of thing is what requires FAI engineering in
<br>
the first place. If you program it to tell you what it will do in
<br>
order to figure out the problem, it will turn the planet into
<br>
computronium to figure out how it will turn the planet into
<br>
computronium. And so on, and so forth; the problem is that the vast
<br>
majority of minds will see more computronium as a good thing, and will
<br>
therefore seek to convert the entire planet into computronium. It
<br>
doesn't even really matter what the specific goals of the AGI are,
<br>
because computronium is useful for just about anything. To quote CEV:
<br>
<p>&quot;Friendliness is the end; FAI theory is the means. Friendliness is the
<br>
easiest part of the problem to explain - the part that says what we
<br>
want. Like explaining why you want to fly to London, versus explaining
<br>
a Boeing 747; explaining toast, versus explaining a toaster oven.
<br>
Friendliness isn't the hardest part of the problem, or the one we need
<br>
to solve right now, but all attention tends to focus on that which is
<br>
easiest to argue about.&quot;
