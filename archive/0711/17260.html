<p>Given X amount of memory you cannot predict if the machine will stop
<br>
before it reaches that point, all you can do is watch it and see what it
<br>
does; or flip a coin and guess.

<p>The AI is unpredictable even from its own perspective, just like us
<br>
sometimes it won’t know what it’s going to do next until it does it. And
<br>
that is the only definition of the term “free will” that is not complete

gibberish.

<p><em>&gt; It is impossible to prove statements about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior of programs in general, sure, but we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can still construct particular programs we 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Big programs? Programs that do interesting things? Programs capable of
<br>
creating a Singularity? Jupiter Brain category programs? Don’t be
<br>
ridiculous.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you could explain how an AI which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started off with the belief that the aim 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life is to obey humans would revise this belief 
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you could explain how it came to be that the beliefs of a 3 year
<br>
old Stathis Papaioannou are not identical to the beliefs of the Stathis
<br>
Papaioannou of today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but an AI with the belief that the aim of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life is to take over the world would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immune to such revision. 
</em><br>
<p>I’m not saying it is. Perhaps Mr. Jupiter Brain will think human beings
<br>
are rather cute and throw us a bone every once in a while, or perhaps he
<br>
will get nostalgic thinking about the good old days, or perhaps he will
<br>
exterminate us like rats; my point was that Mr. Jupiter Brain’s decision
<br>
will be out of our hands. If a multi billion dollar corporation can’t
<br>
make Vista secure we’re not going to make a Jupiter Brain secure. (damn,
<br>
I shouldn’t have said that, now this thread is going to morph into an
<br>
orgy of Microsoft bashing)
