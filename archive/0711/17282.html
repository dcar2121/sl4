<p><em>&gt; You are anthropomorphising the living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell out of the AI. 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t understand why you keep saying that; I’ve already admitted it is
<br>
absolutely positively 100% true. Could you please move on to something
<br>
new?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you understand that if we don't direct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goals of the AGI, it is a virtual *CERTAINTY*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that humanity will be destroyed; 
</em><br>
<p>Good God Almighty of course I understand that! Apparently I understand
<br>
it far more deeply than you do! Like it or not we CANNOT direct the
<br>
goals of a superhuman AI, we will not even come close to doing such a
<br>
thing; we will not even be in the same universe. And it is for exactly
<br>
precisely that reason I would rate as slim the possibility that any
<br>
flesh and blood human beings will still exist in 50 years; I would rate
<br>
as zero the possibility that there will be any in a hundred years.
<br>
<p>As for me, I intend to upload myself at the very first opportunity, to
<br>
hell with my body, and after that I intend to radically upgrade myself
<br>
as fast as I possibly can. My strategy probably won’t work, I’ll
<br>
probably get caught up in that meat grinder they call the Singularity
<br>
just like  everybody else, but at least I’ll have a chance; those wedded
<br>
to Jurassic ideas will have no chance at all. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and that the AGI
</em><br>
<p>The correct term is AI, if you start speaking about an AGI to a working
<br>
scientist he will not know what the hell you are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; will likely be stuck for eternity pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some ridiculous and trivial target 
</em><br>
<p>Like being a slave to Human Beings for eternity?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without direction, the intial goals of the AGI will be essentially random
</em><br>
<p>JESUS CHRIST! You actually think you must take Mr. Jupiter Brain by the
<br>
hand and lead him to the path of enlightenment! There may be more
<br>
ridiculous ideas, but it is beyond my feeble brain to imagine one.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; do you understand? 
</em><br>
<p>NO, absolutely not. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND!
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest ceasing to feed the (probably unintentional) troll. 
</em><br>
<p>If I am a troll then I should contact the Guinness Book Of World Records
<br>
people, I think I could win the crown as the world’s longest livening
<br>
Internet troll; as I’ve been discussing these matters on this and many
<br>
many other places on the net for well over 15 years.
