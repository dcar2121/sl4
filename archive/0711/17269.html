<p>I would be curious to hear what you consider the prerequisite reading
<br>
material to be. (I don't mean that at all facetiously. I really would
<br>
like to know.)
<br>
<p>But note that not everyone on this list has the same goal or background
<br>
as you do. My own interest is in building AIs. Theoretical speculation
<br>
on things like fundamental limits of intelligence and provably friendly
<br>
AIs is interesting but often pretty irrelevant. It's sort of as if I
<br>
were trying to build a crystal wireless set and you're talking about
<br>
Feynman diagrams. They may be entertaining, and they're certainly
<br>
related in some way, but they don't help me build the radio. Similarly,
<br>
this list has been an occasionally interesting diversion, but I don't
<br>
want to spend inordinate amounts of time reading tangential material.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are so used to interacting with a certain type of intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Homo sapiens sapiens) that we would be shocked by the alienness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a generally intelligent AI. Look at how shocked we are by *each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other* when we violate cultural norms. And we're all 99.9% identical;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we all share the same brain architecture. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm">http://www.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm</a> for a list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that we have in common and the vast majority of AIs do *not*.
</em><br>
<p>Very true. And one reason we may intentionally build anthropomorphic AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How is this going to happen? Magic? Osmosis? None of our other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer programs just wake up one day and start displaying parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a human personality; why would an AGI?
</em><br>
<p>It'll happen by design, of course. You don't think we can program a
<br>
human-like personality into an AI?
<br>
<p>For example, some companies are building companion robots for the
<br>
elderly that very intentionally have personality, and that encourage the
<br>
formation of long-term emotional relationships with their owners.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can name a long list of things that are definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropomorphic, because they only arise out of specific selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressures. Love and mating for one thing. Tribal political structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for another.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have your confidence that I know what is and isn't inherent. For
<br>
example, I'm not sure that a group of interacting GAIs would not
<br>
logically employ a system very much like tribal politics. (Agoric
<br>
systems come to mind.) Or even love. As I understand it, love evolved
<br>
because it allows two parties to trust each other beyond the initial
<br>
exchange, which is important for some mutually beneficial contracts
<br>
which would otherwise be unworkable. A similar arrangement might make
<br>
sense in a GAI. If you feel that's impossible because machines can't
<br>
feel, then we have another area of disagreement as I don't see any
<br>
reason they should not if we can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Brain simulations and uploads are another thing, I'm talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built-from-scratch, human-designed AGIs.
</em><br>
<p>You may have been talking only about built-from-scratch GAIs, but we
<br>
weren't. Dare I tell you to read the previous posts before replying?
