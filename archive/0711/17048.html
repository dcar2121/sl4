</em><br>
<p>I think this is still tautological, pretty much however you ask it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                                                          If it indeed confirms that the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't well posed, then I'd like to follow up by asking what makes us ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that question in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Now this is a well-posed question, and somewhat interesting.
<br>
Fortunately, I think I know the answer (or most of it, at least)... so
<br>
maybe it's you're lucky day, and you won't have to wait for an SI.
<br>
<p>I admit to having asked that question myself before... it's just that
<br>
every time I think about it in depth, I decide it's not really a good
<br>
question.  It's meaningful to ask things like &quot;Why am I wearing a
<br>
watch rather than not wearing a watch?&quot;, and if you're a mind/body
<br>
functionalist and consider your &quot;self&quot; to refer to the mental software
<br>
running on your body (rather than the body itself) then you can even
<br>
ask things like &quot;Why am I 6 feet tall rather than 4 feet?&quot; or why is
<br>
my skin a particular color? etc.  Maybe there will be an interesting
<br>
answer to those questions, and maybe the answer is that it was just
<br>
random chance... but either way, I think there is a sense in which
<br>
they are well-posed.  However, those questions are only meaningful if
<br>
you're defining &quot;I&quot; in a certain way.  You can ask &quot;why do I have
<br>
property X, and not some other property?&quot; only if property X is
<br>
non-essential to your definition of &quot;I&quot;.  If property X is a part of
<br>
what you mean by &quot;I&quot; then it fails as a meaningful question.  So you
<br>
cannot, for instance, ask &quot;Why do I have the set of properties K?&quot;
<br>
where K is the set of all properties which define the intelligence
<br>
which is you.  If you include too many properties in the set you're
<br>
inquiring about, then it reduces to asking &quot;Why is the set K the set
<br>
K?&quot; which is obviously a tautology.  So I think the reason why we tend
<br>
to ask that question, is because there are a number of meaningful
<br>
questions leading up to it, but because of the loose way in which we
<br>
tend to throw words around like &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; without fixing them to
<br>
rigid signifiers, and because we have a difficulty in conceiving of
<br>
ourselves fully, we don't realize when we've crossed the line into
<br>
asking something tautological.  We tend to just glide right past the
<br>
line, assuming our questions are still meaningful.
<br>
<p>So, if I were a superintelligence, and I answered your question in
<br>
this way, would I get full credit? ;)
