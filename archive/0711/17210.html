<p><em>&gt; Here's a FAI design:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, there is an swarm AGIs of about the human intelligence level, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average human knowledge and task of creating a Friendly AI. The AGIs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living in a virtual simulation without their knowledge, and the AGIs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really slowly rewriting themselves to increase their intelligence. If humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can code a FAI, then it must be possible for these AGIs too.
</em><br>
<p>Why does it matter that the AGIs don't know they are in a simulation?  What if
<br>
we knew the universe was simulated?
<br>
<p>Also, each level of the simulation decreases both the available computing
<br>
power and the complexity.  Where does the increased intelligence come from?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is another computer that the AGIs don't know about, that sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reads through the data from the AGI virtual world and creates a virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation (with the help of supercomputers) to test that FAI design. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI has a really low probability to predict the possibility of a virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world simulation, so the probability of escaping is low. The computer does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some tasks trying to verify whether the FAI design works.
</em><br>
<p>How do you build an FAI tester with a better test for friendliness than what
<br>
humans could do manually?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All this is run in another virtual layer with a computer observing possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escapes from the virtual layer, and this layering can be made 100 times if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.
</em><br>
<p>How much computing power will this require, and where will you get it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One more note: the whole simulation inside simulations is located in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island booby trapped with nuclear bombs. If an extra electronic signal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detected the whole thing blows up. 
</em><br>
<p>So now you are letting a complex, poorly understood process control nuclear
<br>
bombs, where the most dangerous thing it could do is not use them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not safe enough. That *island* is a an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual simulation run in another real island. Actually, that second island
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a simulation too. I would like to see an UFAI to escape that.
</em><br>
<p>1. The computer says &quot;I have successfully achieved godlike intelligence
<br>
guaranteed to be friendly.  You may now safely connect me to the internet&quot;.
<br>
<p>2. Somebody else with a lot less computing power than your system requires
<br>
builds an intelligent computer worm, or a self replicating robot or bacteria
<br>
with swarm intelligence, just to see if it works, and worries about how to
<br>
program it later.  Which is more likely to happen first?
