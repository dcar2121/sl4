Hi sl4.
<br>
<p>(Short self-deprecating 1st post intro: My name is Gissur and I'm writing
<br>
from Iceland, I've been lurking for a while, but I thought I'd finally
<br>
contribute (even if it's just a glorified link).)
<br>
<p>Well - seeing as how point number 5 is beyond the singularity - we're pretty
<br>
free to speculate.
<br>
<p>Robin Hanson tackles this point from a slightly different perspective in his
<br>
paper; The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past
<br>
It?&lt;<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html</a>&gt;.
<br>
He argues that the evolution of mankind consists of numerous discreet steps
<br>
which he describes a &quot;best-guess evolutionary path to an explosion which
<br>
leads to visible colonization of most of the visible universe&quot;. He then goes
<br>
on to discuss that each of these steps could constitute The Great Filter, an
<br>
obstacle so great, that evolution has yet to tackle it, thus explaining the
<br>
Great Silence.
<br>
<p>This of course raises the Very Important Question: Are we past the Great
<br>
Filter? Because if we aren't we'd better look out.
<br>
<p>This also raises the question whether an AGI would be as interested in
<br>
Extraterrestrials as we humans seem to be, because if I we CAN find reasons
<br>
for it NOT to be, we might have found a plausible way to sidestep the whole
<br>
Great Filter/Great Silence issue - namely, that once an AGI reaches a
<br>
certain level of processing power (however this power comes to be) it
<br>
doesn't really need to go anywhere.
<br>
<p>Assuming an AGI is primarily an infovore, I'd think that it would be
<br>
reasonable to say that it would want to know everything it can know, before
<br>
risking interstellar exploration, and given how we like to think the laws of
<br>
physics work the same way everywhere in the universe, it could probably find
<br>
a lot out just by staying. Maybe it'd need to build a dyson sphere, maybe
<br>
not. Maybe it would find some source of energy unknown to us, anyway - what
<br>
I'm basically saying is that the constant of colonization, which we ascribe
<br>
to all life, need not apply to an AGI, since a lot of the principles which
<br>
drive OUR exploration don't necessarily apply (namely competition and
<br>
scarcity of resources).
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if this has all been covered before, and I also apologize if I'm
<br>
raving.
<br>
