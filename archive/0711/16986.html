<em>&gt; Ignoring the non-branching universe for the moment, how do you know that

</em><br>
<p>How do you know *anything*? You have a Bayesian &quot;prior distribution&quot;,
<br>
which may include anthropic reasoning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll put this in more formal terms to make it clearer. Let P(x) be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability that x is the output of a uniformly random program.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously if a bounded-rationality agent is aware that it's a
<br>
uniformly random program, then once it has seen that x is its output,
<br>
it should (if it is sophisticated, and it has nothing better to do
<br>
with its time) give x a probability on the order of the amount of
<br>
Chaitin's Omega that it doesn't know. So what? You're begging the
<br>
question of why it had this prior in the first place. The prior
<br>
certainly isn't true of the programs running on my PC; none of my
<br>
programs are drawn from uniformly random distributions (not even
<br>
Microsoft Word).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible that SI can take an arbitrary string x and tell us whether P(x) &lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1/2^(2^100)?
</em><br>
<p>Underspecified. If by &quot;probability&quot; you only mean &quot;something that
<br>
obeys the Probability Axioms, and is also sometimes useful&quot;, then
<br>
sure. If an agent has bounded rationality, it can consistently say
<br>
&quot;there is a 1/2 probability that any number between 1 and 10 is an
<br>
even number. There is a 1/2 probability that 5 is an even number.
<br>
There is a 1/2 probability that 6 is an even number.&quot;
