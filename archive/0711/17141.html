<em>&gt; &gt; How does it *know*, ahead of time, to explain it to you, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just doing it? This kind of thing is what requires FAI engineering in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the first place. If you program it to tell you what it will do in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; order to figure out the problem, it will turn the planet into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computronium to figure out how it will turn the planet into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computronium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You just explained it to me; are you suggesting that if you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suddenly a lot smarter you *wouldn't* be able to explain it to me?
</em><br>
<p>This is a Giant Cheesecake Fallacy. Obviously, a superintelligent AGI
<br>
could explain how to build an FAI without destroying the world. The
<br>
quadrillion-dollar question is, *why* would it explain it to you and
<br>
not destroy the world, when destroying the world has positive utility
<br>
under the vast majority of goal systems? If I suddenly became much
<br>
smarter, I would be able to explain it much better, without even
<br>
thinking about destroying the world. But an OAI does not act like a
<br>
super-smart me; it acts with no human or human-like morality
<br>
whatsoever. The OAI does not rationalize up reasons why it wouldn't
<br>
destroy the world, it just does it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And so on, and so forth; the problem is that the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of minds will see more computronium as a good thing, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; therefore seek to convert the entire planet into computronium. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't even really matter what the specific goals of the AGI are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because computronium is useful for just about anything. To quote CEV:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the goal is just the disinterested solution of an intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem it won't do that. Imagine a scientist given some data and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked to come up with a theory to explain it. Do you assume that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being really smart, he will spend his time not directly working on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, but lobbying politicians etc. in order increase funding for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further experiments, on the grounds that that is in the long run more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to yield results? And if a human can understand the intended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning behind &quot;just work on the problem&quot;, why wouldn't a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligent AI be able to do the same?
</em><br>
<p>Wasn't this already covered several years ago, by Eli &amp; Co.? This
<br>
exact scenario, where the AGI is asked to solve a technical problem
<br>
and converts the world to computronium to get the results faster, was
<br>
covered in CFAI
<br>
(<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI.html#design_generic_stomp">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI.html#design_generic_stomp</a>). To
<br>
quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;Scenario:  The Riemann Hypothesis Catastrophe
<br>
You ask an AI to solve the Riemann Hypothesis. As a subgoal of solving
<br>
the problem, the AI turns all the matter in the solar system into
<br>
computronium, exterminating humanity along the way.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The other way to get a Riemann Hypothesis Catastrophe is to make
<br>
solving the Riemann Hypothesis a direct supergoal of the AI - perhaps
<br>
the only supergoal of the AI. This would require sheer gibbering
<br>
stupidity, blank incomprehension of the Singularity, and total
<br>
uncaring recklessness. It would violate almost every rule of Friendly
<br>
AI and simple common sense. It would violate the rule about achieving
<br>
unity of purpose, and the rule about sharing functional complexity
<br>
instead of giving orders.&quot;
