<p>I don't think anyone here would argue that a superintelligent AI could
<br>
take over the internet with relative ease. There are always security
<br>
holes that we don't realize, and as soon as you can manage a buffer
<br>
overflow you can get a computer to execute any code you want. The
<br>
human brain is messier, more complicated, and less modular, but it is
<br>
still a &quot;robust yet fragile&quot; system. It has strange weaknesses that
<br>
allow seemingly harmless types of input, such as words, to set off
<br>
catastrophic changes within it. Just because I can't talk someone into
<br>
a psychotic state doesn't mean it can't be done.

<p>There was an episode of pokemon that sent 685 people to the hospital,
<br>
and that wasn't even INTENTIONAL.
