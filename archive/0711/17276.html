<p>It can be “proven” that the computer will not stop before it hits point

X in the sense that you can write a program just like the one I did and
<br>
watch what it does and note that it did not stop. And that is the only
<br>
sense it can be said to have been “proven”.

<p><em>&gt; But it, and we, can know the ultimate goal. 
</em><br>
<p>I would maintain that with a rapidly evolving intelligence the ultimate
<br>
goal is unknown by us or even by the Jupiter Brain because there is no
<br>
such gaol. There may be something that appears to be, but as soon as he
<br>
starts to get close to it a more distant goal comes into view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unpredictability does not necessarily scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with complexity. 
</em><br>
<p>But it almost always does, especially if you expect it to do anything
<br>
creative, like making use of the sum total of human knowledge to produce
<br>
a Singularity. A web browser this is not.

<p><em>&gt; you cannot use anthropomorphic reasoning. 
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Jupiter Brain will not act like you do 
</em><br>
<p>And yet you claim to understand the Jupiter Brain well enough to predict
<br>
what it will do after countless iterations a billion years from now. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More anthropomorphicism. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Jupiter Brain will not act like you do
</em><br>
<p>Both will prefer existence to non existence, both will have a will to
<br>
power, and both will behave in ways that rocks generally do not.  And if
<br>
a Jupiter Brain was absolutely 100% alien you could not communicate with
<br>
it or it to you; and I don’t think that’s what you had in mind.
<br>
<p>On Mondays Wednesdays and Friday you say an AI is totally alien, on
<br>
Tuesday and Thursday you say it is totally comprehensible, and on Sunday
<br>
you grumble about anthropomorphism. Perhaps you agree with Emerson that
<br>
“A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds”.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that the problem is difficult. 
</em><br>
<p>Besides that Mrs. Lincoln how did you like the play?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This does not mean that we are
</em><br>
somehow excused from solving it. 
<br>
<p>More juvenile reasoning. Wishing does not make it so.
