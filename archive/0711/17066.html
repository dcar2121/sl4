<p>That's just stupid. The smarter you are, the better you are at
<br>
explaining anything to anyone. If an explanation exists which a human
<br>
would understand, a superintelligence should be able to find it. It
<br>
should be able to explain general relativity to an eight year old so
<br>
well that their intuitive understanding of the skewing of reference
<br>
frames is better than stephen hawking's.
<br>
<p>I don't even agree with the idea that the answers to various big
<br>
questions are simply beyond our comprehension. Unlike the mind of an
<br>
insect, the human mind is a system of sufficient complexity that it
<br>
can essentially be reprogrammed. The limitations are in the form of
<br>
hardware issues: speed, short and long term memory, etc.
<br>
<p>All the philosophical questions we've solved turn out to have
<br>
extremely simple answers, they're just nonintuitive. I very much
<br>
expect the rest of them are the same.
<br>
<p>Then again, maybe not. In the words of gordon creighton, we dream of a
<br>
logical universe; what if it isn't logical at all, but a vast
<br>
surrealist nightmare?
