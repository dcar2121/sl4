</em><br>
<p><p>While I don't agree with John's argument, this &quot;fact&quot; can't  remain
<br>
unchallenged. Do you have some secret theory of intelligence that
<br>
allows you to make such statements?
<br>
<p>I currently think any adult brain (silicon or otherwise) will be
<br>
fairly opaque to minds of the same complexity. I think intelligence
<br>
requires experimental self-programming and that many hacks and weird
<br>
dependencies between brain modules will develop as a mind comes to
<br>
maturity, while a baby brain would be conceptually simple. This would
<br>
restrict the ability to self-improve to something slow and painful.
<br>
Lets say parts of the AI develop to use the natural response times of
<br>
the components for timing, I have seen things suggesting that neurons
<br>
are used in this fashion in brains (it might be a lot more efficient
<br>
than centralised clocks). So then speed up the hardware may throw the
<br>
timings out of sync, if the memory/logic is ported blindly. And
<br>
similarly for speeding up an algorithm might throw it out of sync with
<br>
other algorithms. An AI would have to understand itself completely to
<br>
get speed up from hardware speed increases in the trivial fashion
<br>
assumed in the exponential growth of a singleton.
<br>
<p>I do not seek to convince you of this. Just to show your virtual
<br>
certainty is misplaced, unless you can prove that intelligence does
<br>
not need this sort of system. Because with this sort of necessity for
<br>
AI it means that societies are likely to be the general mode that
<br>
brings about the singularity (if it occurs), rather than a singleton.
