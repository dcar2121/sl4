</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you tried to use anthropomorphic reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about a 747, or a toaster, or a video game,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you'd be laughed at.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course it would be ridiculous to use anthropomorphic reasoning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how a toaster works, but not if you used it to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another mind;
</em><br>
<p>To get a vague sense of how different &quot;another mind&quot; can be, try
<br>
talking to someone who has *never* experienced Western culture. Then
<br>
realize that they're still 99.9% identical to you genetically. Or
<br>
better yet, try conversing with an orangutan via sign language; he's
<br>
something like 90% identical to you genetically, which is more than
<br>
you can say for an AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it is after all the only tool we have for doing such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing,
</em><br>
<p>You see, we have these things called &quot;reason&quot; and &quot;logic&quot;, which we
<br>
can also use to understand minds. If we tried to use ancestral
<br>
instincts instead of reason for getting along in modern society, we'd
<br>
be utterly screwed. Every time you didn't get something you really
<br>
wanted because you knew it would screw up long-term plans, you used
<br>
reason to override pre-GI instincts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that's why it evolved.
</em><br>
<p>It evolved because it was useful *in the ancestral environment*, when
<br>
everyone thought pretty much the same way. That's no longer true even
<br>
in contemporary human culture; I use anthropomorphic reasoning
<br>
incorrectly with *other humans* all the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At any rate if you want to insult me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're going to have to find something new to call me because I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find it insulting to be called a believer in anthropomorphism, just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit repetitive.
</em><br>
<p>We've long since established that you're a believer in
<br>
anthropomorphicism, there's no need to dwell on it. Initially, I
<br>
presumed nobody on this list would be that naive, but, heck, I've been
<br>
wrong before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Probabilities of zero will give you nonsense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Bayesian probability theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then to hell with Bayesian probability theory, the probability that 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 2 will turn out to be 5 is zero.
</em><br>
<p>If you start out assuming Bayesian probability theory is wrong, you
<br>
will be forced to conclude that 2 + 2 = 5, or something equally
<br>
ridiculous. For the full derivations, see Probability Theory: The
<br>
Logic of Science by E.T. Jaynes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This does not mean it is an invalid term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The term AGI is used by members of this list and almost nobody else, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't believe me do a Google search for AGI and see what you get.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a classic example of inventing new jargon to make tired and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather silly ideas sound revolutionary.
</em><br>
<p>If you actually did Google it, you would have found that there was a
<br>
full-scale, physical conference on AGI scheduled for March 2008
<br>
(<a href="http://agi-08.org/">http://agi-08.org/</a>), with more than fifty papers submitted so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Please, please, please *read the bleepin' literature*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mean read the &quot;literature&quot; about AGI that no working scientist is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the slightest bit interested in?
</em><br>
<p>If you want the academic literature, get a copy of Artifical General
<br>
Intelligence (Goertzel, Pennachin) at
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-General-Intelligence-Cognitive-Technologies/dp/354023733X">http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-General-Intelligence-Cognitive-Technologies/dp/354023733X</a>.
