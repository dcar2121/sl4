<p>I would not argue that it will happen soon or rapidly but rather 
<br>
unpredictably.
<br>
<p>Before there is an AI singularity, we need to 1) understand intelligence 
<br>
more than we do now; 2) have enough computing power to implement it; 3) 
<br>
put together enough &quot;AI&quot; in the right configuration to make a 
<br>
singularity (human equivalent AI is not enough); 4) create enough 
<br>
traction between the AI and the rest of the world to both allow it to 
<br>
understand the world (just reading about it won't do it when you come to 
<br>
fundamentally new theories), and to influence it substantially; and 5) 
<br>
move from the lab to the world in general (i.e., ship it). I can't 
<br>
predict how long any of those items will take. 1 and 2 could already 
<br>
have happened in some lab or garage somewhere, or could take another 
<br>
fifty years. 3 could be trivial or have scaling problems that are 
<br>
insurmountable (unlikely, but you never know). 4 and 5 are classic 
<br>
issues of science/engineering, and there are lots of examples of 
<br>
successes and total failures.
<br>
<p>Add them all together and it could take anything from a few years to 
<br>
never. Nor is it predictable how much time there will be from the 
<br>
initial appearance of substantive AI to the singularity. It could even 
<br>
be zero if the people involved don't publicize their initial successes.
<br>
<p>The analogy to the development of the atomic bomb has been brought up 
<br>
before, but it's instructive from a timing perspective. Imagine being in 
<br>
1907 and trying to predict the appearance of the first a-bomb (analogous 
<br>
to human level AI), the arms race (development of singularity 
<br>
capability), and the destruction of all life on the planet (the 
<br>
singularity). The first one happened after decades of incremental 
<br>
advances plus a concerted and well-funded effort to achieve it. And it 
<br>
happened with zero warning to the world as a whole because that 
<br>
concerted effort happened in secret. The arms race took decades more in 
<br>
fits and starts, but ultiately succeeded. And the destruction of life 
<br>
never happened at all.
