Everything you say here makes sense to me, but I think I disagree with  
<br>
respect to the necessity of molecular level modeling for making a  
<br>
functioning intelligence based on an emulated brain.  Surely,  
<br>
molecular level information will be necessary to make an accurate  
<br>
model of any specific intelligence (e.g. uploading).  However, we  
<br>
could emulate the functional properties of the brain–though not any  
<br>
specific brain–without keeping track of every molecule.  And if we did  
<br>
keep track of every molecule, it seems that the required computational  
<br>
resources would make emulating a brain nearly impossible, even with  
<br>
the ability to harness sl4 levels of computation.

<em>&gt;&gt; If you're modeling based on functional connections between neurons,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; leads to higher-level cognitive functions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it hard to believe that full neuronal emulation would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lesser technical challenge than understanding higher level cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions. However, even if emulation comes first, it would provide a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research tool far superior to anything we had before in neuroscience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could tweak a few parameters, rewire a few connections, add or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtract neuronal components all in software and observe the effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My original point to Wei Dai was that if we could simulate neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissue doing something &quot;simple&quot; at a fine enough level, it would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of scaling to simulate neural tissue doing something &quot;complex&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the neurons involved in abstract thought don't contain special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-computable parts that are lacking in more pedestrian neurons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; However, a properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; functioning neuron-by-neuron model of the brain would probably not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; require molecular-level resolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is often assumed in discussions about mind uploading, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't seen any good justification for it. Tiny concentrations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small molecules like LSD non-covalently binding to neuronal proteins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and slightly changing their conformation can cause drastic changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition. Millions of other parameters per neuron, including its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shape, its relationship to all its neighbours, the pattern of surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receptors, the state of cytoplasmic biochemical activity involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making and removing neurotransmitters and receptors, and so on, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all important even if you are just the considering a binary question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as whether the neuron will or won't fire. How are you going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model the behaviour of the neuron in a brain without considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail at this level?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; However, it is unclear that this will constitute a very plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; means of creating a super-intelligence.  A brain-in-a-box would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; know how to improve its own functioning.  Even if you model our best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; minds down to the molecular level, no one alive today would know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to improve the intelligence via neural modifications (besides making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everything uniformly faster).  The brain is a non-linear, self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; organizing system.  Emulation is not understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it would enormously enhance the process of understanding. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine that even crude trial and error experimentation with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nascent software would quickly result in cognitive improvements. (The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical considerations in undertaking such experiments are a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If you use a non-molecular modeling approach, you will not start with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a fully functioning sentience.  You will have an AI-child  that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; may be able to nurture into a some modicum of sentient functioning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There is a good possibility that it would be insane, as human neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; organization co-arises with embodied experience in the world.  Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; children do not start out with fully-developed brains.  You would  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to have a detailed model of how neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; work over time.  We'll get to this state of understanding one day,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even then, it's not clear that this is a good method for achieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; super-intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm guessing that a model above the molecular level just won't work at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, like a half-baked computer chip won't work at all. I expect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher level modelling of brain function will come far earlier than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true emulation, and human-level AI will come before AI modelled on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain. This has generally been the pattern in every other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endeavour where humans try to copy a biological system. Wheels come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before walking robots, and walking robots come before androids with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial muscle, bone, circulatory and nervous tissue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But this is all assuming that we're talking about emulation.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; advanced nano-technology and advanced knowledge in molecular/cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; neurobiology (not molecule-by-molecule modeling capabilities) here's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an idea which I have been toying with lately:  1) Flood a person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brain with nanobots.  2) Have the nanobots determine the functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; properties of every neuron and glial cell in the brain (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; endocrine functions).  3) Have the nanobots replace each of the cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with a functionally-identical synthetic equivalent.  4) Connect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; synthetic brain to an artificial body or virtual body.  If you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; these things, we will have been limited from many of the constraints
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of our biology.  In addition to overcoming the fact that our brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; age, we could probably speed up cognition by several orders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; magnitude (if your embodiment is in a virtual world that could keep-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; up).  But the time-scales of developing these technologies may make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this idea irrelevant.  By the time we have these capabilities, we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have already developed an AGI that figured out a better way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
