</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ok, that makes sense.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may make sense to assume that CEV writes a single program to
<br>
<em>&gt;     replace itself, using only the first-order extrapolation, and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     second-order extrapolation of how to extrapolate would happen in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     replacement program if it happened at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's a start, but I can see I'm not communicating what information I'm
<br>
looking for. I'm going to try making it up myself and you can correct me
<br>
where I've got it wrong.
<br>
<p>***
<br>
<p>CEV recipe:
<br>
<p>First we construct the initial dynamic. We do this by simulating the will of
<br>
earth's 7 billion human people, although abstractly enough that the
<br>
simulations aren't real people, to the extent that that means anything, but
<br>
either way it probably doesn't impact the end result so moving on.
<br>
<p>We don't care about carp, anchovies, orangutans, breakfast cereals, people
<br>
who are long dead, people who are recently dead, people who aren't born yet
<br>
(concieved? probably doesn't matter), or sneaky aliens in flying saucers.
<br>
<p>Then, these seven billion simulated people are fast-forwarded through 18
<br>
years of development so that they're all adults, and they're allowed to
<br>
interact while this is being done, so that they grow up &quot;together&quot;, and
<br>
learn to care and share and collaborate. Given no information to the
<br>
contrary, I guess this happens on an abstractly simulated earth, with the
<br>
only difference being that everybody who was already alive is immortal, and
<br>
there's no singularity because that would just gob things up like crazy.
<br>
<p>Then (all inside this abstract simulation), the people with what modern
<br>
medicine regards as a brain injury or mental illness sufficient to make them
<br>
incapable of taking responsibility for their own actions have that injury or
<br>
illness corrected.
<br>
<p>Then, as you said, the AI's probability distribution is substituted for that
<br>
of the people's. Additionally, their model of the world is replaced with the
<br>
AI's model, to the extent that that model can be wired to our volition. At
<br>
this point they'll become aware (although not REALLY aware, just, you know,
<br>
functionally) that they are the CEV, if they haven't figured this out
<br>
already.
<br>
<p>Then, they're made to think faster, and smarter.
<br>
<p>Then, they're allowed to self-modify their minds, to become the people they
<br>
want to be. Self modification requests must be submitted verbally, shouted
<br>
at the sky. Everyone previously mute is given the ability to speak.
<br>
<p>During this self-modification stage, every day at 2:00 PM GMT, everyone has
<br>
a collective dream that they're part of a focus group consisting of everyone
<br>
on earth, randomly seated at an extremely long rectangular table in a huge
<br>
meeting room. They're given three subjective hours to argue with their
<br>
fellows about what the initial dynamic should be. They wake up at 2:00 with
<br>
no time having passed.
<br>
<p>Every day at 4:00 PM GMT, everyone has an individual dream that they are at
<br>
santa's workshop in the north pole, and the AI is santa, and they tell him
<br>
what they want.
<br>
<p>This abstract simulation continues to run until either it stablizes, and
<br>
everyone wants roughly the same thing from day to day, or it goes chaotic
<br>
and roughly nobody wants the same thing, or 50 simulated years have passed.
<br>
<p>The whole simulation, from beginning to end, is run not as a single thread
<br>
of possibility, but rather as an increasingly blurry, endlessly branching
<br>
mess. When it's all said and done, the AI looks at what every probable
<br>
extrapolation of every person asked santa, and takes stock of what they
<br>
agreed they wanted and didn't want, and how strongly they felt that way,
<br>
although since everybody is allowed to self-modify, it's a good bet they'll
<br>
all feel &quot;100%&quot; strongly about everything, or however it's measured.
<br>
<p>If there's not enough agreement to construct a coherent initial dynamic, the
<br>
AI prints &quot;OUT OF CHEESE ERROR&quot; and becomes completely inactive. If there is
<br>
enough agreement to construct a coherent initial dynamic, then it's
<br>
constructed, and then implimented.
<br>
<p>***
<br>
<p>I doubt you had in mind the simulated earth, focus group, santa claus, etc,
<br>
but my point is there has to be some kind of concrete method for these
<br>
steps. What I want to know is the recipe as YOU envision it.
