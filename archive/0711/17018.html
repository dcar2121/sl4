<p><em>&gt; One of the things I'd like most from a friendly SI is answers to certain

<p>I expect that you would be disappointed and frustrated as the higher
<br>
intelligence would appear to respond in riddles.  Pressed further, it
<br>
might respond [cf. Eliezer] that there are no mysterious answers, but
<br>
only mysterious questions, and that when you have composed a proper
<br>
question you will have the answer you seek.
<br>
<p>Note that we can expect a more advanced intelligence to demonstrate
<br>
objectively superior results (relative to a given goal) but this does
<br>
not imply that it could effectively explain it to a lesser
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>Some alternatives:
<br>
<p>It could provide the **appearance** of a satisfactory answer.
<br>
<p>It could suggest the direction of a path leading to the understanding you seek.
<br>
<p>It could manipulate you in the direction of a path leading to the
<br>
understanding you seek.
<br>
<p>It could divert your attention toward other interests that you might
<br>
might find more productive at your current stage of development.
<br>
<p>It could divert your attention toward pursuits that it would assess as
<br>
more productive.
<br>
<p>It could place you in a simulation where some annoying person on a
<br>
email list tries to impress upon you the importance of context...
<br>
<p>And on and on.
