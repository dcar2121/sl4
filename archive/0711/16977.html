<p>
Suppose an SI wants to do something with a very small, but non-zero 
<br>
probability, say 0 &lt; p &lt;= 1/3^^^3 (in Knuth's up-arrow notation). How would 
<br>
it go about doing this? The answer seems to be &quot;it can't&quot;, because 
<br>
algorithmic information theory says there is no way that it can generate a 
<br>
sufficiently long random number that it can know is truly random. Can anyone 
<br>
see a way around this limitation?
<br>
<p>This problem came up in the context of Eliezer's &quot;Torture vs. Dust Specks&quot; 
<br>
dilemma (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/torture-vs-dust.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/torture-vs-dust.html</a>), but I 
<br>
think it might be of interest outside that context.
