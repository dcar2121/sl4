<p>
One of the things I'd like most from a friendly SI is answers to certain 
<br>
questions. If I meet an SI and it can't answer these questions or at least 
<br>
explain why they can't be answered, I would be really disappointed. But it's 
<br>
hard to imagine how an optimization process can answer them (unless the 
<br>
answers are programmed into it, or it's doing something like &quot;search for the 
<br>
string that maximizes intellectual satisfaction for the questioner&quot;), which 
<br>
makes me think that intelligence != optimization process. Does anyone have a 
<br>
counterargument?
<br>
<p>Here are my questions:
<br>
<p>How does math really work? Why do we believe that P!=NP even though we don't 
<br>
have a proof one way or the other?
<br>
<p>How does induction really work? Why do we intuitively know that, contra 
<br>
Solomonoff Induction, we shouldn't believe in the non-existence of 
<br>
halting-problem oracles no matter what evidence we may see?
<br>
<p>Is there such a thing as absolute complexity (as opposed to complexity 
<br>
relative to a Turing machine or some other construct)?
<br>
<p>How does qualia work? Why do certain patterns of neuron firings translate 
<br>
into sensations of pain, and other patterns into pleasure?
<br>
<p>How does morality work? If I take a deterministic program that simulates a 
<br>
neuron firing pattern that represents pleasure, and run it twice, is that 
<br>
twice as good as running it once? Or good at all?
<br>
<p>Why am I me, and not one of the billions of other people on Earth, or one of 
<br>
the many people in other parts of the multiverse?
<br>
