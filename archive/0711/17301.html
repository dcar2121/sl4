<p>
While I'm still open to being convinced otherwise, my current belief is 
<br>
that friendly AI is doomed to failure. Let me explain why and see if it 
<br>
convinces anyone else, or if they can produce strong counter-arguments.
<br>
<p>The whole situation reminds me of another movement in computer science 
<br>
that was a hot topic when I started out in the '70s: proving programs 
<br>
correct. Although there were many great ideas and many great thinkers 
<br>
involved, that movement failed to have any substantial impact of the 
<br>
real world for three reasons: it was hard to impossible to implement, 
<br>
people didn't really need it, and a specification is not necessarily 
<br>
less error prone than an implementation. All of these reasons apply to 
<br>
FAI as well.
<br>
<p>First, to be useful, FAI needs to be bullet-proof, with no way for the 
<br>
AI to circumvent it. This equates to writing a bug-free program, which 
<br>
we all know is next to impossible. In fact, to create FAI, you probably 
<br>
need to prove the program correct. So it's unlikely to be possible to 
<br>
implement FAI even if you figure out how to do it in theory.
<br>
<p>Second, I believe there are other ways to achieve the same goal, 
<br>
rendering FAI an unnecessary and onerous burden. These include 
<br>
separating input from output, and separating intellect from motivation. 
<br>
In the former, you just don't supply any output channels except ones 
<br>
that can be monitored and edited. This slows things down tremendously, 
<br>
but is much safer. In the later, you just don't build in any motivations 
<br>
that go outside the internal analysis mechanisms, including no means of 
<br>
self-awareness. In essence, design it so it just wants to understand, 
<br>
not to influence. This may be as prone to error as FAI, but is simpler 
<br>
to implement and therefore more likely to be successful. (Indeed, any 
<br>
solution can be argued to be impossible to implement due to the near 
<br>
certainty of bugs, but in general the simpler they are, the more likely 
<br>
they are to be workable.)
<br>
<p>Third, defining FAI is as bug-prone as implementing it. One small 
<br>
mistake in the specification, either due to lack of foresight or human 
<br>
error (say, a typo), and it's all for nothing. And, in general, it's 
<br>
hard to correctly specify a solution without having the same context as 
<br>
that of the implementors of the solution, which is this case is 
<br>
equivalent to saying that you have the same perspective as the AI, which 
<br>
you don't.
<br>
<p>To save everyone from having to read more postings, let me pre-supply 
<br>
some of the replies I'm sure to get to this message:
<br>
<p>* Read the literature!
<br>
<p>* You don't understand the problem.
<br>
<p>* You're an idiot.
<br>
<p>I don't disagree with any of those, actually, but I'm only likely to be 
<br>
convinced I'm wrong by arguments that address my points directly.
