<p>
A lot of people got sidetracked by questioning the basic assumptions.
<br>
So I have to state them more explicitly and detailedly:
<br>
<p>* The OAI is not able and doesn't want to do anything besides
<br>
answering questions in a restricted way: it will output media
<br>
(text/pictures/videos/audio). Think of it as a glorified calculator AI
<br>
(GCAI). The reason this is so, is because this is the way it was
<br>
designed.
<br>
* It will not go into an infinite loop or decide that it needs to turn
<br>
the whole earth/universum into computronium if it is faced with a
<br>
question beyond it's capabilities. If you use your desk calculator and
<br>
press the key &quot;pi&quot; the calculator doesn't start an infinite loop in
<br>
order to calculate all digits of pi, but it just outputs pi to some
<br>
digits. If you ask the GCAI:
<br>
- &quot;Calculate pi&quot; it would ask back:
<br>
- &quot;How many digits do you want?&quot;
<br>
- &quot;I want them all!&quot;
<br>
- &quot;Sorry, I cannot do that.&quot;
<br>
- &quot;Ok, give me the first 3^^^3 digits.&quot;
<br>
- &quot;Sorry, but the universe will be dead before I can finish this task.
<br>
If you want I can still start calculating it, just interrupt me when
<br>
you want something else.&quot;
<br>
etc...
<br>
* It CANNOT modify itself, nor does it want to modify itself.
<br>
* When outputting media the GCAI won't do anything unexpected like
<br>
embedding subliminal messages in order to manipulate humans. It also
<br>
won't output an infinite or very high number of pages beyond our
<br>
reading capacity, unless specifically asked to do so.
<br>
<p>I hope you get the idea. All this is based on the assumption that it
<br>
is easier to do a GCAI according to the specifications above than a
<br>
FAI. Why? Because it is very hard to define what friendly is supposed
<br>
to be or do. On the other hand we all know how a calculator is
<br>
supposed to behave itself.
<br>
<p>Roland
