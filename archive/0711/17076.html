</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not the same.  An SI trying to communicate with a human would be like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trying to communicate with an insect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's just stupid. The smarter you are, the better you are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining anything to anyone. If an explanation exists which a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would understand, a superintelligence should be able to find it. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to explain general relativity to an eight year old so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well that their intuitive understanding of the skewing of reference
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ability to communicate is limited by the intelligence of both sender and
<br>
receiver.  We can observe the dancing of bees as they tell others in the hive
<br>
where the pollen is.  We can also create dancing robot bees that signal the
<br>
bees where to fly.  But that is about all we can do.  Their language is quite
<br>
limited.  They can't ask where to build a hive that would best ensure their
<br>
survival.  They don't know the difference between a beekeeper and an
<br>
exterminator.
<br>
<p>A superintelligence would know the complete state of your brain.  You would
<br>
not need to ask it anything.  It would already know your questions.  It it
<br>
chooses to, it could answer by reprogramming your brain.  But we can know
<br>
nothing about its intentions or motives.
