</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you're a really good explainer, maybe you can speed up someone's

</em><br>
<em>&gt; an expert who has spent his entire life learning it and working in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; *intuitive* understanding&quot; I think you gain intuition for a subject
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think you guys really underestimate the potential power of
<br>
information and the potential malleability of the human mind.
<br>
<p>Imagine an enormous ziggurat, where every floor is half the size of
<br>
the floor below. On the bottom floor, a googleplex of monkeys on
<br>
typewriters type out every possible page of text. On the second floor,
<br>
half a googleplex of comittees in meeting rooms evaluate two pages
<br>
each and send the one which is a better explanation of general
<br>
relativity up to the floor above. (In most cases both pages will be
<br>
complete gibberish but bear with me). This is repeated for the third
<br>
floor, the fourth floor, etc, until finally at the Xth floor, where
<br>
2^X = a googleplex, we have the final page.
<br>
<p>Personally I would be afraid to even read the thing. It'd probably
<br>
explain general relativity so well that you'd lose your sanity in the
<br>
process.
