</em><br>
<p>If you want to compare AGI *relative* to whole brain emulation - 
<br>
unanchoring the actual time and hence tossing any pretense of 
<br>
futuristic prophecy out the window - then that's a whole separate story.
<br>
<p>I would begin by asking if there was ever, in the whole history of 
<br>
technology, a single case where someone *first* duplicated a desirable 
<br>
effect by emulating biology at a lower level of organization, without 
<br>
understanding the principles of that effect's production from that low 
<br>
level of organization.  I would not be surprised if someone could 
<br>
think of one example, but I would be surprised if they could think of 
<br>
three, or of a single *major* example.
<br>
<p>The elementary reason why I am suspicious of whole-brain emulation is 
<br>
that the main arguments for it seem to proceed as follows:  &quot;Nobody 
<br>
has any idea why birds fly, or even a good definition of what &quot;flying&quot; 
<br>
means apart from the fact that birds do it, so we'll get flightiness 
<br>
by emulating bird biochemistry before we have de novo flying 
<br>
machines.&quot;  This argument is intrinsically based on ease of 
<br>
imaginability with current knowledge, rather than probable future 
<br>
advances in knowledge.  With current knowledge it &quot;seems easy to 
<br>
imagine&quot; that future technology could emulate a brain cell by cell, 
<br>
but &quot;hard to imagine&quot; that anyone will understand the sacred and 
<br>
mysterious principles of intelligence.  And similarly, in 1890 it 
<br>
would have been easy to imagine a flying machine that looked just like 
<br>
a bird and flew just like a bird, and hard to imagine a flying machine 
<br>
that worked differently.
<br>
<p>You cannot use ignorance as if it were positive knowledge.
<br>
<p>Looking at history, we find two lessons:
<br>
<p>1)  Extremely mysterious-seeming desirable natural phenomena are 
<br>
eventually understood and duplicated by engineering;
<br>
2)  Because they have ceased to be mysterious by the time they are 
<br>
duplicated, humans design them by engineering backward from the 
<br>
desired results, rather than by exactly emulating the lower levels of 
<br>
organization of a black box in Nature whose mysteriousness remains 
<br>
intact even as it is emulated.
<br>
<p>Cars don't emulate horse biochemistry, sonar doesn't emulate bat 
<br>
biochemistry, compasses don't emulate pigeon biochemistry, suspension 
<br>
bridges don't emulate spider biochemistry, dams don't emulate beaver 
<br>
building techniques, and *certainly* none of these things emulate 
<br>
biology *without understanding why the resulting product works*.
<br>
<p>The notion of whole-brain emulation *which preserves intelligence's 
<br>
mysteriousness* seems to me a device to preserve the future's 
<br>
nonabsurdity - to avoid violating the invariant &quot;Intelligence is 
<br>
mysterious&quot; in a futuristic prediction.  But the future is always absurd.
<br>
<p>Suppose I put it to you this way:  *Given* the lessons of past 
<br>
history's engineering of formerly mysterious phenomena, what 
<br>
characteristics visible *without benefit of hindsight*, would have 
<br>
enabled ancient futurists to *distinguish* the extremely rare case of 
<br>
a desirable phenomenon that is first duplicated by emulating a lower 
<br>
level of biological organization while the higher levels remain 
<br>
mysterious and non-reverse-engineerable, from all the many cases where 
<br>
the high level was understood by insight and then engineered with a 
<br>
different lower level of organization?
<br>
<p>I might try to answer if I could think of any cases at all of the 
<br>
first type.  They may exist, but I don't know or am not recalling them 
<br>
(note use of availability heuristic).
<br>
<p>I can think of nothing which separates the AI case from any of the 
<br>
historical cases of the second kind, except for various special 
<br>
pleading of the form &quot;But this time it *really is* mysterious!&quot;, 
<br>
presumably as distinguished by various signs and portents (such as 
<br>
failed optimism) which were also present in past historical cases.  I 
<br>
would mark this down as a failure to appreciate how failure to develop 
<br>
flying machines looked *at the time*, without benefit of hindsight.
<br>
<p>None of this is an argument for AI happening quickly in an absolute 
<br>
sense, simply that it will not *first* happen through whole-brain 
<br>
emulation.  It is not like arguing, in 1880, that powered 
<br>
heavier-than-air flight will happen before 1900 - it's hard to see how 
<br>
this could have been foreseeable at all, one way or another.  But they 
<br>
might have validly guessed in 1880 that nonbirdlike flying machines 
<br>
would *precede* flying machines that emulated the tendons, muscles, 
<br>
skeletons, relative weights, and wing-flapping patterns of biological 
<br>
birds.  Even though information of the second kind seemed &quot;easy to 
<br>
imagine&quot; a clever anatomist discovering and clever mechanic 
<br>
duplicating, while a nonbirdlike design seemed &quot;hard to imagine&quot;. 
<br>
Even in 1880, they could have remembered that ships are not like fish, 
<br>
trains are not like horses, and elan vital turned out not to be so 
<br>
crucial in chemical reactions after all.
