All the replies on SL4 as of 10:40AM Pacific seem pretty good to me. Why
are you asking after &quot;rapid&quot; progress?&nbsp; It doesn't seem to
be the key question. .... An analysis of dollar responses to public
issues&quot; makes the point that in many cases, people have no anchors,
no starting points, for questions like &quot;How much should this company
be penalized for crime X?&quot; .... On one memorable occasion, an AI
researcher said to me that he thought it would take 500 years before
AGI.&nbsp; ... I suspect that, especially among AI researchers, the
question &quot;How long will it be before we get AGI?&quot;, is more of
an attitude expression than a historical estimate ...&nbsp; Naturally,
building AGI will seem *very* hard if you can't imagine any way to do it
(the imaginability heuristic) and so they'll give a response near the
upper end of their scale.&nbsp; ... The key realization here is that
building a flying machine would also *feel* very hard if you did not know
how to do it.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; As for knowledge itself, that is a matter
of pure basic research, and if we knew the outcome we wouldn't need to do
the research.&nbsp; How can you put a time estimate on blue-sky
fundamental research delivering a brilliant new insight?&nbsp; ... We
have no reason to believe that timing is predictable even in
principle</blockquote><br>
The anchor that I start with is my rought estimate of how long whole
brain emulation will take, and so I'm most interesting in comparing AGI
to that anchor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that people are prone to take these
estimate questions as attitude surveys is all the more reason to seek
concrete arguments, rather than yet more attitudes.  <br><br>
