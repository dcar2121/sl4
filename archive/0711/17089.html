<p>
Norman,
<br>
<p>I very much agree that tilting is the keystone to the whole system of
<br>
SR, and it's frustrating that it's not explained very well in
<br>
introductory courses.  I happen to be a teaching assistant for a very
<br>
introductory astronomy college course called &quot;Overview of the
<br>
Universe&quot;  this quarter, and we covered special and general relativity
<br>
very briefly and superficially a few weeks ago.  Lots of students came
<br>
to me in the discussion section asking for a better explanation than
<br>
the professor gave in lecture.  I did my best, and they seemed
<br>
pleased, but the truth is that certain ideas are complex enough that
<br>
they rely on understanding a less complex set of ideas first... you
<br>
build up knowledge like this modularly.  So the only thing I could
<br>
really do is give them analogies.  I've explained both SR and GR to
<br>
friends plenty of times, and I always explain it to them in terms of
<br>
rotating (or &quot;tilting&quot;) space and time axes if they are people who I
<br>
think can easily visualize geometry and have some inclination for what
<br>
coordinates are, and other basic math type stuff that most of my
<br>
friends generally have (regardless of what field they're in).
<br>
However, with these astronomy kids, a lot of them have trouble with
<br>
very basic math (like exponents and fractions), and explaining it to
<br>
them in terms of rotating space and time axes into each other just
<br>
doesn't help at all.  You always have to explain things on a level
<br>
that's appropriate for your audience.  You have to use very different
<br>
analogies and speak in different terms if it's someone who is 8 years
<br>
old versus someone with a high school diploma, versus someone in
<br>
computers, math, or engineering.
<br>
<p>Getting back to the topic at hand, I think a superintelligent AI is
<br>
not going to understand GR all that better than the experts today do,
<br>
as there is just not that much more to understand about it.  It's easy
<br>
to say an SI will be thousands of times better at explaining something
<br>
that many people consider hard to learn.  But it only seems hard and
<br>
mysterious until you fully learn it.  Do you think an SI is going to
<br>
be able to explain how to cook a turkey 100 times faster than a normal
<br>
person?  Sure... they can say the words 100 times faster, but the
<br>
person listening who doesn't know how to cook the turkey, is still
<br>
going to have to hear it explained at the same rate.
<br>

<em>&gt; Well, speaking from personal experience, I can explain general

</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else do it, and I find it hard to believe my explanation is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I was first taught that when travelling near the speed of light,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distances become shorter and the rest of the universe gets slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (from your point of view), it didn't make sense to me, because if from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my perspective it only takes a day to get to alpha centauri, why is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that when I get there, five years have gone by, and when i take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one day trip back to earth, an additional five years have gone by back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on earth? From my reference frame, where does the extra time get in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I asked the professor and he wrote some equations on a napkin, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially he couldn't find the words to explain it. The answer turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to be that as you accelerate to near the speed of light, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference frame &quot;tilts&quot; so to speak, and the five years happens all at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once for alpha centauri, then when you get there and decelerate it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tilts back, and five years happens on earth. Like letting down a set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of venetian blinds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In all the handy &quot;guy on a train with a clock and einstein's on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; platform with two mirrors and a bouncing photon&quot; intros i've seen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how computer animated they are, I've never seen this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic fact mentioned at all, and it's kind of the keystone of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole system.
