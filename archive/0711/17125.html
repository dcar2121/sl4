Well said.  From this conversation, I can see two important  
<br>
implications:
<br>
<p>1.  Emulating is probably an inefficient–and potentially unethical or  
<br>
even dangerous way–of achieving human-level AI.
<br>
<p>2.  Digital uploading may be so difficult/expensive as to make it not  
<br>
worthwhile.  Instead, we could transcend biology by replacing our  
<br>
neurons with synthetic computational equivalents.  This seems like a  
<br>
rational first-step for a couple reasons:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)  Synthetic neurons can be monitored and replaced.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)  Synthetic neurons could be robust under a wider range of  
<br>
conditions (e.g. permanently jacked into a simulated world without an  
<br>
actual bio-body).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)  Synthetic neurons are potentially much faster than bio-neurons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)  Synthetic neurons can potentially keep logs of their activity  
<br>
such that we could create &quot;back-ups&quot; of our minds.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)  If you want to digitize someone's mind, you're going to need to  
<br>
know the state of a huge number of neurons (and glia, etc.) that are  
<br>
changing from moment to moment.  With synthetic neurons, you would  
<br>
know that you have all of the important functional details.  In fact,  
<br>
I would argue that it's a necessary prerequisite to uploading.  But  
<br>
even if you don't like uploading, these data-sets will be enormously  
<br>
valuable for understanding the details of how brain produces mind.
<br>
<p>But first we need advanced nanotechnology and some means of  
<br>
controlling/programming the nanobots.  Or maybe–probably?–the AGI  
<br>
people will have succeeded long before we have this kind of  
<br>
technological sophistication.  In that case, the AGI will be able to  
<br>
tell us whether or not this is the optimal first step for maximizing  
<br>
human potential.
