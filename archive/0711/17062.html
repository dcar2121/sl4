<p>That's not the point. Even if you did speak their language, you
<br>
couldn't communicate what we meant by &quot;combustion&quot;, because they
<br>
wouldn't have any of the prerequisite knowledge. In English, you might
<br>
define &quot;combustion&quot; as &quot;the heat-producing chemical reaction of air
<br>
with organic materials&quot;. But they don't know what a chemical reaction
<br>
is. They don't know what an organic material is. They don't even know
<br>
what &quot;heat&quot; or &quot;air&quot; are- as late as several hundred years ago, people
<br>
thought that heat was some kind of all-pervasive, conserved &quot;caloric
<br>
fluid&quot;, and that air was the all-pervasive medium in which things
<br>
happened, like the modern-day Lorentzian manifold. The inferential
<br>
distance is simply too great. This is why we need CEV in the first
<br>
place. To quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;Let's ask Fred's volition a more complicated question: &quot;What should
<br>
the code of a Friendly AI look like?&quot; But there's a minor problem,
<br>
which is that Fred is a hunter-gatherer from the Islets of Langerhans,
<br>
where they have never even heard of Artificial Intelligence. There is
<br>
a tremendous distance between the real Fred, and a Fred who might
<br>
specify the code of a Friendly AI. Fred needs more than knowledge of
<br>
simple facts, and knowledge of many background disciplines not known
<br>
to the Islets of Langerhans. Fred needs to answer moral questions he
<br>
doesn't know how to ask, acquire new skills, ponder possible future
<br>
courses of the human species, and perhaps become smarter. If I started
<br>
with the Fred of this passing moment, and began a crash education
<br>
course which Fred absorbed successfully, it would be years before Fred
<br>
could write a Friendly AI. Different Everett branches of Fred would
<br>
not write identical code, and would probably write different AIs.
<br>
Would today's Fred recognize any of those future Freds, who had
<br>
learned so much about the universe, and rejected so many prevailing
<br>
beliefs of the Islets of Langerhans?
<br>
<p>Yet today's Fred still has wishes that straightforwardly apply to the
<br>
creation of an Artificial Intelligence. Fred may not know what a
<br>
paperclip is, or what a solar system is, but nonetheless Fred would
<br>
not want anyone to create an Artificial Intelligence that tiled the
<br>
solar system with paperclips.&quot;
