Whoops.  I think I was using some terminology in an idiosyncratic  
<br>
fashion.  If I continue to do so, please point it out to me.  You are  
<br>
absolutely right that we would have no chance of making our emulated  
<br>
brain into a genius–or even a sane person–if its lifeworld constituted  
<br>
a box.  By brain-in-a-box, I meant a simulated brain that was  
<br>
restricted in its allowed outputs.  Instead of a box, it would have a  
<br>
simulated embodiment in a simulated world.  But this would all be  
<br>
restricted to &quot;the box&quot;–not necessarily a box, but some sort of semi- 
<br>
closed system–of a given set of computational elements.
<br>
<p>If we find ourselves with sufficient computational resources that we  
<br>
could build an emulated brain that functions on a par with human-brain  
<br>
time-scales, then it would necessarily surpass all humans in terms of  
<br>
speed of cognition.  Our neurons are fixed in terms of how fast they  
<br>
can sum/fire action potentials.  The limits of digital emulation have  
<br>
no clear boundary, though potentially sufficiently difficult to  
<br>
advance that this method is rendered irrelevant by other methods.  If  
<br>
you could make the brain as smart as the smartest human, and then  
<br>
speed up the rate of computation, you would have surpassed the  
<br>
greatest human intelligence.  Over-clocked digital Einstein (to pick a  
<br>
well-known genius) could think more thoughts in a given period of time  
<br>
than meat-brain Einstein.  Mistakes/failures are often the result of  
<br>
failing to give proper thought to a problem.  By giving digital  
<br>
Einstein more time to work on any given problem, you would get better  
<br>
results than meat-brain Einstein.  To someone interacting with a sped- 
<br>
up digital Einstein using a flesher-brain, he would seem impossibly  
<br>
intelligent.  Since the information constituting the intelligence  
<br>
would be digitized, you could then make multiple copies of this  
<br>
intelligence–not sure of the ethics of this–and have them work on  
<br>
problems in parallel.  Though this may not get us to the &quot;knee-of-the- 
<br>
curve&quot; in terms of progress towards super-intelligence, it would get  
<br>
us much closer than we are now.  Ensuring &quot;friendliness&quot; still seems  
<br>
problematic.  But once again, this method could be rendered obsolete  
<br>
by the time these technologies become feasible.
<br>
<p>In terms of ethics, emulated neurons seem no different than  
<br>
experimenting with cognitive models based on completely different  
<br>
principles (e.g. some sort of hierarchical/probabilistic world- 
<br>
modeler).  The one difference I can see is that an emulated brain will  
<br>
necessarily have qualitative subjective experiences like ours and an  
<br>
AI based on other computational principles may not.  As long as we're  
<br>
not actively non-benevolent to our digital-genius-brains, then it  
<br>
might be possible to justify giving them special-case status in terms  
<br>
of making them part of our moral communities.

</em><br>

</em><br>
