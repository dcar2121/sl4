<p>I'm assuming Bayesian reasoning as well. I don't think anthropic reasoning 
<br>
is relevant to this issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously if a bounded-rationality agent is aware that it's a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should (if it is sophisticated, and it has nothing better to do

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin's Omega that it doesn't know. So what? You're begging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of why it had this prior in the first place. The prior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly isn't true of the programs running on my PC; none of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs are drawn from uniformly random distributions (not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft Word).
</em><br>
<p>I was using the standard prior for Solomonoff Induction. I see Nick Hay has 
<br>
written an exposition of the concept at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/25/solomonoff-induction/">http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/25/solomonoff-induction/</a>. Quoting from 
<br>
it:
<br>
<p>Solomonoff induction predicts sequences by assuming they are produced by a 
<br>
random program. The program is generated by selecting each character 
<br>
randomly until we reach the end of the program.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Now is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible that SI can take an arbitrary string x and tell us whether P(x) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1/2^(2^100)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Underspecified. If by &quot;probability&quot; you only mean &quot;something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obeys the Probability Axioms, and is also sometimes useful&quot;, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure. If an agent has bounded rationality, it can consistently say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;there is a 1/2 probability that any number between 1 and 10 is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even number. There is a 1/2 probability that 5 is an even number.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a 1/2 probability that 6 is an even number.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This P is supposed to be the same function as before (i.e., the standard 
<br>
prior for Solomonoff Induction).
<br>
<p>Does that clear up the point I was trying to make?
