<p>I don't assume it could do anything, just that it could do basically
<br>
anything which is possible. The world of the possible is a very
<br>
strange place, and one which we have explored only the tiniest tiniest
<br>
corner of.
<br>
<p>The idea that we have mostly explored the possible when it comes to
<br>
the human brain and what it can be made to do, is absurd to me. Our
<br>
understanding of the mind's limits is so poor that we can be outdone
<br>
by accidents, as in the case of the man who gained unusual powers of
<br>
memory after being hit in the head by a baseball.
