<em>&gt; OK then, what are the arguments suggesting a single insight has a good
</em><br>
chance to
<br>
<em>&gt; make this much difference?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about a single insight, but  I'd venture that a solid theory of
<br>
intelligence is the major obstacle between us and AGI.
<br>
<p>If engineering an AGI does prove to be difficult, we can hope that the
<br>
theory will be clear enough and make enough of an impact to get all needed
<br>
financial resources.
<br>
<p>An AGI, as Eliezer has said, does not have to imitate the details of the
<br>
brain, but it will broadly imitate its functionality. Airplanes easily beat
<br>
out birds in some characteristics once the theory was in place, and after
<br>
the unveiling of the Wright brothers' design it took only a few years until
<br>
planes were good enough to use in war. (I understand that controlling the
<br>
craft's balance was the key insight.)
<br>
<p>Creating an intelligence is unlike building a bridge, building, or tunnel;
<br>
getting ships across the ocean; getting a rocket into space; or building the
<br>
atom bomb, which require vast resources of materials and energy even when
<br>
the theory of how to build one is understood. The human brain, the
<br>
existence-proof of intelligence,  is just a one-kilo lump.
<br>
<p>Although we do not understand the brain perfectly yet, it is becoming clear
<br>
that there is no super-engineering-trick there that threatens to transcend
<br>
the abilities of human engineering. Indeed, brains range from incrementally
<br>
from worms to human, and if we can engineer something better than the worms,
<br>
we can work our way up to human.
<br>
<p>All the above doesn't set a time for AGI, but it does suggest that it might
<br>
come soon after the theoretical breakthrough.
<br>
<p>Joshua
