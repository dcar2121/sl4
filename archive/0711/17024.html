</em><br>
<p>All the replies on SL4 as of 10:40AM Pacific seem pretty good to me. 
<br>
Why are you asking after &quot;rapid&quot; progress?  It doesn't seem to be the 
<br>
key question.
<br>
<p>Kahneman's &quot;Economic preferences or attitude expressions?  An analysis 
<br>
of dollar responses to public issues&quot; makes the point that in many 
<br>
cases, people have no anchors, no starting points, for questions like 
<br>
&quot;How much should this company be penalized for crime X?&quot; and so they 
<br>
substitute judgment of &quot;How bad was this company, on a scale of 1 to 
<br>
Y?&quot;, where the actual scale Y varies depending on the person, and then 
<br>
tack &quot;million dollars&quot; onto the end.
<br>
<p>On one memorable occasion, an AI researcher said to me that he thought 
<br>
it would take 500 years before AGI.
<br>
<p>500 years?  500 years ago we didn't even have *science*.
<br>
<p>So what's going on?  I suspect that, especially among AI researchers, 
<br>
the question &quot;How long will it be before we get AGI?&quot;, is more of an 
<br>
attitude expression than a historical estimate - &quot;On a scale of 1 to 
<br>
Y, how hard is it to build AGI?&quot; - where Y varies from person to 
<br>
person, and then they tack on &quot;years&quot; at the end.  Naturally, building 
<br>
AGI will seem *very* hard if you can't imagine any way to do it (the 
<br>
imaginability heuristic) and so they'll give a response near the upper 
<br>
end of their scale.  The one responded as if I had asked, &quot;On a scale 
<br>
of 1 to 500, how hard does building AGI *feel*?&quot;
<br>
<p>The key realization here is that building a flying machine would also 
<br>
*feel* very hard if you did not know how to do it.  But this reflects 
<br>
a knowledge gap, rather than solid knowledge of specific 
<br>
implementation difficulties.  We know how stars work, therefore we 
<br>
know it would be difficult to build a star from hydrogen atoms.  Some 
<br>
magazine or other, in 1903, said that future flying machines would be 
<br>
built by the work of &quot;millions of years&quot;(!) of mathematicians and 
<br>
mechanists.  They didn't know how to do it, and they confused this 
<br>
feeling of difficulty for the positive estimate that doing it *with* 
<br>
knowledge would be very difficult.
<br>
<p>As for knowledge itself, that is a matter of pure basic research, and 
<br>
if we knew the outcome we wouldn't need to do the research.  How can 
<br>
you put a time estimate on blue-sky fundamental research delivering a 
<br>
brilliant new insight?  Far or near?
<br>
<p>It's also possible that AI researchers are substituting judgment of 
<br>
&quot;How long would it take to create AGI *using the techniques you 
<br>
know*?&quot; in which case 500 years might well be an underestimate, if it 
<br>
could be done at all, like trying to carve Mount Rushmore using 
<br>
toothpicks.
<br>
<p>Others may substitute judgment of &quot;How good do you feel about AI?&quot; and 
<br>
give a short time estimate, reflecting their general feelings of 
<br>
goodwill toward the field.
<br>
<p>We have no reason to believe that timing is predictable even in 
<br>
principle - that it will be a narrow distribution over Everett 
<br>
branches - let alone that we can predict it in practice with knowledge 
<br>
presently available to us.
