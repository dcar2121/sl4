<p>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, to be useful, FAI needs to be bullet-proof, with no way for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI to circumvent it. This equates to writing a bug-free program, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we all know is next to impossible. In fact, to create FAI, you probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to prove the program correct. So it's unlikely to be possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement FAI even if you figure out how to do it in theory.
</em><br>
<p><p>Does it need to be perfect, rather than 1) better than previous versions, 2)
<br>
able to recognize errors, and 3) highly redundant? For example, your AI
<br>
could be motivated to ensure Kaldor-Hicks efficient transfers of wealth, *
<br>
and* to ensure maximally beneficial transfers of wealth -- and if it finds
<br>
that Goal #2 is interfering with Goal #1, it would drop the second goal
<br>
until it could come up witha a better way to fulfill it without hurting Goal
<br>
#1. I mean, if you're designing a system for, say, routing trains, you don't
<br>
need a perfect Get Things There Fast routine, as long as you have a very
<br>
high-priority, low-error Don't Crash Things Into Each Other routine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, I believe there are other ways to achieve the same goal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rendering FAI an unnecessary and onerous burden. These include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separating input from output, and separating intellect from motivation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the former, you just don't supply any output channels except ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be monitored and edited.
</em><br>
<p><p>Monitored and edited by whom? This dragon-on-a-leash theory presupposes that
<br>
we can pick the right leash-holder, and ensure that the leash stays where we
<br>
want it. That's very nearly incompatible with the notion that an AI is
<br>
valuable enough to be worth creating and powerful enough to make a
<br>
difference.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Third, defining FAI is as bug-prone as implementing it. One small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake in the specification, either due to lack of foresight or human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error (say, a typo), and it's all for nothing. And, in general, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to correctly specify a solution without having the same context as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that of the implementors of the solution, which is this case is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to saying that you have the same perspective as the AI, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't.
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, error correction can help, here. As long as the AI thinks that
<br>
not-harming (or harming-only-while-compensating) is way, way more important
<br>
than doing good, it's likely to be a net win even if a buggy
<br>
benefit-creating function could, if executed, cause harm.
