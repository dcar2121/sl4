<p>
Recipe for CEV.
<br>
<p>Set up a data compression contest for compressing a large portion of the
<br>
Internet, including text, images, video, and audio.  To compress text, you
<br>
must predict it.  To predict it, you must understand it.  To understand it,
<br>
you must understand the thoughts of the writer, which depend on the writer's
<br>
model of the world.  Compressors that compress smaller will therefore have
<br>
better models of the world and of the human mind.
<br>
<p>Likewise for video and audio.  Compressors that are better at modeling
<br>
physics, that know about objects commonly seen and heard by humans, know how
<br>
people move and speak, and model visual and audio perception will compress
<br>
smaller than programs that don't.
<br>
<p>The text portion would ideally include writing samples from everyone on Earth.
<br>
&nbsp;In practice we won't achieve that, so people who post a lot of material to
<br>
the Internet will get a bigger vote than those that don't.  So be it.  The
<br>
important point is that the top compression program will have the best model
<br>
of humanity.  It will know what makes people happy or mad or successful or
<br>
afraid.  It will understand, as many people do, about planning for the future,
<br>
that people who immediately get everything they want will not be happy, and
<br>
that the rich are not happier than the poor.  It will understand genius and
<br>
mental illness.  It will understand about moral views in various cultures,
<br>
because it will have to in order to compress well.
<br>
<p>I do not specify how this model is built.  It will likely be built using a mix
<br>
of manually coded knowledge, machine learning, and meta-learning algorithms
<br>
like evolution and recursive self improvement.  A successful compressor will
<br>
know how to write and debug software, because such models will compress
<br>
specifications, source code, and executable code better than those that don't.
<br>
<p>The will require a lot of computing power.  To model a single adult human mind
<br>
we would require training data equivalent to 20 years of text, speech, and
<br>
video.  We want to model billions of human minds.
<br>
<p>We now have a model of the world that includes human goals, an understanding
<br>
of volition, and forecasting abilities on a par with prediction markets.  We
<br>
stop here, because CEV does not tell us how to transfer these goals to the AI.
