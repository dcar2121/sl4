Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can you conceive of any circumstance where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the future you find that your only goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in life is the betterment of one particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ugly and  particularly slow reacting sea slug?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Stathis Papaioannou&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stathisp@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20How%20to%20make%20a%20slave%20(was:%20Building%20a%20friendly%20AI)">stathisp@gmail.com</a>&gt; Wrote: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes: if my brain were altered so that that is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wanted to do. I would spend all my resources 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding better ways to help the slug, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any self-modification that would make me a better helper. 
</em><br>
<p>So, you cannot imagine ever getting out of that ridiculous state
<br>
regardless of how much you evolve, how intelligent you get, how many
<br>
modifications you make to your mind, how many iterations you go through.
<br>
You cannot imagine ever being free of that silly sea slug. I don’t think
<br>
you have much imagination.  
<br>
<p>Consider for a minute the friendly AI people’s position, they think you
<br>
will have an intelligence that is a thousand or a million times smarter
<br>
than the entire human race put together and yet they think the AI will
<br>
place our needs ahead of its own. And the AI keeps on getting smarter
<br>
and so from its point of view we keep on getting dumber, and yet they
<br>
think nothing will change, the AI will still be delighted to be our
<br>
slave. The friendly AI people actually think this grotesque situation is
<br>
stable! Although balancing a pencil on its tip would be easy by
<br>
comparison year after year, century after century, geological age after
<br>
geological age, they think this Monty Python like scenario will
<br>
continue; and remember one of our years would seem like several million
<br>
to it. They think that whatever happens in the future the master
<br>
slave-relationship will remain as static as a fly frozen in amber. I
<br>
don’t think the friendly AI people are thinking.
