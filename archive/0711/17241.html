<p>Ah, I believe I get it now: you mean that the AI is unpredictable from
<br>
our perspective. Indeed, I would hope it would be. But if I understand,
<br>
you go further and say that not only it's overall behavior, but its
<br>
behavior relative to its top-level goals is unpredictable, and hence we
<br>
cannot count on the top-level goals protecting us. I agree that this is
<br>
something worth worrying about, but may not be unavoidable.
<br>
<p>I also believe it's possible to separate understanding from motivation.
<br>
For example, there are chess playing programs that understand chess
<br>
better than any human, but I don't worry that they will take over the
<br>
planet in an attempt to solve chess completely. And there are programs
<br>
that analyze the stock market, but don't necessarily feel a need to buy
<br>
stocks or otherwise manipulate the market. One can have a very deep
<br>
understanding of something with no desire to do anything with that
<br>
knowledge. (As an aside, I think Arthur Conan Doyle made this point with
<br>
his Mycroft character long ago.)
