<p>
There is no system of value or right and wrong built into the fabric of
<br>
reality, ethics don't &quot;exist&quot; in any sense more than favorite colors exist.
<br>
But we all have things we want and things we don't want. These form
<br>
arbitrary personal ethics, which are neither given weight because they are
<br>
personal or negated because they are arbitrary.
<br>
<p>Because many of our values are the same, and because of the advantages of
<br>
cooperation, we invent collective systems of right and wrong that we hold
<br>
each other to. These systems are not arbitrary, but they are derived from
<br>
the fundamentally arbitrary values of everyone involved.
<br>
<p>Arguments about ethics can thus take place on two levels. The personal level
<br>
amounts to no more than stating what you want, and the societal level
<br>
amounts to an agreement made that benefits the participants.
<br>
<p>The problem is, people almost always confuse the two levels, and until
<br>
they're untangled, any argument about ethics is stuck in a whirlpool.
<br>
<p>It would be all too easy to use this as a segue into saying &quot;As I see it the
<br>
point of CEV is to come up with the best possible system of the second type
<br>
that can be constructed for humanity&quot; but this in fact is NOT the point of
<br>
CEV, or even what I would want the point to be.
<br>
<p>And even if it was, arguing about what we think CEV is supposed to do, or
<br>
what we think it should do, strikes me as rather the wrong thing to argue
<br>
about. What matters is what it WILL do.
<br>
<p>I don't have a problem with what CEV does, because I don't KNOW what it
<br>
does.
<br>
<p>What I want is a more detailed model of the implementation. I'm not asking
<br>
for math (although that would certainly be nice), just clarity.

<p>In a now-dead thread on the SI blog, Eliezer wrote:
<br>
<p>[T]he part of the extrapolation &quot;if we knew more&quot; is not an extrapolation of
<br>
<em>&gt; our responses to evidence, but an extrapolation of the substitution of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI's probability distribution for our own probability distribution. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves if we anticipated future experiences correctly to the limits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI's knowledge. Furthermore, modeled the world correctly to the limits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the AI's model and the limits of our ability to react emotionally to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements of that model. In the order of evaluation, this substitution would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur before moving onto such considerably more complicated and recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes of &quot;more the people we wished we were&quot; or &quot;had grown up further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>According to the poetry, &quot;knew more&quot; etc. is to be &quot;interpreted as we wish
<br>
that interpreted, extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated.&quot; DOES &quot;knew
<br>
more&quot; happen first, interpreted in the explicit manner you describe, or is
<br>
it &quot;interpreted as we wish it interpreted&quot;, and if so, how is THAT
<br>
interpreted?
<br>
<p>It would be really nice if you could break down the order of operations, and
<br>
define them more explicitly.
<br>
<p>Thank you.
