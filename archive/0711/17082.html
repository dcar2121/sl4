<p>I know this is not exactly what you were asking for, but it’s close.
<br>
Just yesterday it was announced that for first time photosynthesis has
<br>
been simulated on a computer.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071109123201.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071109123201.htm</a>
<br>
<p>They then used a genetic algorithm to randomly change the thousands of
<br>
different variables that effect efficiency and than ran it through the
<br>
computer to see if it improved things. After running on a supercomputer
<br>
for a while they came up with a version of photosynthesis that was
<br>
nearly twice as efficient as the version nature came up with. The point
<br>
is the scientist’s high level goal was clear, improve the efficiency of
<br>
photosynthesis, and they reached their goal without understanding what
<br>
all those low level changes they were making were doing.
<br>
<p>Something similar happened in the area of antenna design.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/st-5/main/04-55AR.html">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/st-5/main/04-55AR.html</a>
<br>
<p>The antenna the genetic algorithm came up with looked strange, it’s not
<br>
something a human would likely dream up, but it worked very well, and
<br>
nobody knows why. A genetic algorithm has also been used for the
<br>
software interface between nerves and the fingers of a prosthetic arm
<br>
and in cochlear implants.
<br>
<p>The unique thing about genetic algorithms is that this software improves
<br>
at least as fast as Moore's Law.
