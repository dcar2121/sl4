<p><em>&gt; One of the things I'd like most from a friendly SI is answers to certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions. If I meet an SI and it can't answer these questions or at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why they can't be answered, I would be really disappointed. But it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to imagine how an optimization process can answer them (unless the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers are programmed into it, or it's doing something like &quot;search for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; string that maximizes intellectual satisfaction for the questioner&quot;), which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes me think that intelligence != optimization process. Does anyone have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterargument?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are my questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does math really work? Why do we believe that P!=NP even though we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a proof one way or the other?
</em><br>
<p>1a. Math is the reason the universe exists.
<br>
2b. To the human mind, three examples are more convincing than a proof.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How does induction really work? Why do we intuitively know that, contra 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solomonoff Induction, we shouldn't believe in the non-existence of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halting-problem oracles no matter what evidence we may see?
</em><br>
<p>2a. By Hebb's rule.
<br>
2b. See question 1b.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there such a thing as absolute complexity (as opposed to complexity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to a Turing machine or some other construct)?
</em><br>
<p>3. No.  Complexity is relative to the observer.  The observer is a finite
<br>
state machine.  A finite state machine can only model itself
<br>
probabilistically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How does qualia work? Why do certain patterns of neuron firings translate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into sensations of pain, and other patterns into pleasure?
</em><br>
<p>4a. Qualia does not exist.  Evolution selects for brains that are programmed
<br>
to believe in qualia.  You cannot refute this belief.
<br>
4b. Pain and pleasure are input signals to a reinforcement learning algorithm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How does morality work? If I take a deterministic program that simulates a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuron firing pattern that represents pleasure, and run it twice, is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twice as good as running it once? Or good at all?
</em><br>
<p>5a. Morality is what you believe it is.  It is not a function of pain and
<br>
pleasure.
<br>
5b. <a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt">http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why am I me, and not one of the billions of other people on Earth, or one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many people in other parts of the multiverse?
</em><br>
<p>6. Because I = me.  Your real question is why is this mysterious?  This is due
<br>
to a conflict between your programmed belief in qualia, and logic which says
<br>
qualia does not exist.  See question 4a.
<br>
<p>If I was an SI, I would have better answers, but then I would not be able to
<br>
communicate them to you.  If you are not satisfied with my answers, then take
<br>
this pill...
