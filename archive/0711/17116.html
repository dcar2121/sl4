</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We could emulate the human brain by modeling the activity of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; benevolence (which is important if you're a non super-intelligence).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To emulate the behaviour of neurons in a brain would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculating all the outputs from a volume of neural tissue given all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inputs from the surrounding tissue. If we could do that, we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to calculate what signals the brain would send to the vocal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparatus after receiving any given input from the auditory nerve. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only obstacles to doing this, given an adequate neural model, would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having sufficiently fine-grained information about brain state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient computational resources to run the model. It would require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution and simulation down to at least the molecular level, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is hard to imagine that we would be able to pull off such a feat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without understanding and copying higher level cognitive functions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first; rather like building a flying machine by emulating a bird's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wings, muscles, cardiovascular and nervous system before being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build a rubber band-powered ornithopter.
</em><br>
<p>If you're modeling based on functional connections between neurons,  
<br>
this does not imply that you need to understand how the neuronal level  
<br>
leads to higher-level cognitive functions.  However, a properly  
<br>
functioning neuron-by-neuron model of the brain would probably not  
<br>
require molecular-level resolution.  If you were to use molecular- 
<br>
level details in your model, the required computational resources  
<br>
would be enormous.  These are much larger than the ones suggested by  
<br>
Kurzweil, which would lead to emulation capabilities circa the year  
<br>
2030-ish, based on his estimates of future computational resources.   
<br>
The magnitude of the required computational resources might make it  
<br>
impossible for it to function as fast as a meat-brain.  This depends  
<br>
on the maximum computational rate we can reasonably expect using  
<br>
advanced computing technologies.  It is unclear to me when we will  
<br>
have access to such technologies (e.g. carbon nano-tube computers) or  
<br>
what their limitations will actually be.  What did people think of the  
<br>
speculations on the limitations of computation in Kurzweil's book?
<br>
<p>However, your method of interacting with the brain-in-a-box via  
<br>
sensory inputs/outputs–don't give it access to the web–could  
<br>
potentially overcome much of the benevolence problem (though not all  
<br>
of it).
<br>
<p>However, it is unclear that this will constitute a very plausible  
<br>
means of creating a super-intelligence.  A brain-in-a-box would not  
<br>
know how to improve its own functioning.  Even if you model our best  
<br>
minds down to the molecular level, no one alive today would know how  
<br>
to improve the intelligence via neural modifications (besides making  
<br>
everything uniformly faster).  The brain is a non-linear, self- 
<br>
organizing system.  Emulation is not understanding.
<br>
<p>If you use a non-molecular modeling approach, you will not start with  
<br>
a fully functioning sentience.  You will have an AI-child  that you  
<br>
may be able to nurture into a some modicum of sentient functioning.   
<br>
There is a good possibility that it would be insane, as human neural  
<br>
organization co-arises with embodied experience in the world.  Also,  
<br>
children do not start out with fully-developed brains.  You would have  
<br>
to have a detailed model of how neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity  
<br>
work over time.  We'll get to this state of understanding one day, but  
<br>
even then, it's not clear that this is a good method for achieving  
<br>
super-intelligence.
<br>
<p>But this is all assuming that we're talking about emulation.  Assuming  
<br>
advanced nano-technology and advanced knowledge in molecular/cellular  
<br>
neurobiology (not molecule-by-molecule modeling capabilities) here's  
<br>
an idea which I have been toying with lately:  1) Flood a person's  
<br>
brain with nanobots.  2) Have the nanobots determine the functional  
<br>
properties of every neuron and glial cell in the brain (including  
<br>
endocrine functions).  3) Have the nanobots replace each of the cells  
<br>
with a functionally-identical synthetic equivalent.  4) Connect the  
<br>
synthetic brain to an artificial body or virtual body.  If you do  
<br>
these things, we will have been limited from many of the constraints  
<br>
of our biology.  In addition to overcoming the fact that our brains  
<br>
age, we could probably speed up cognition by several orders of  
<br>
magnitude (if your embodiment is in a virtual world that could keep- 
<br>
up).  But the time-scales of developing these technologies may make  
<br>
this idea irrelevant.  By the time we have these capabilities, we may  
<br>
have already developed an AGI that figured out a better way.
