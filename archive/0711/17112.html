<p>To emulate the behaviour of neurons in a brain would involve
<br>
calculating all the outputs from a volume of neural tissue given all
<br>
the inputs from the surrounding tissue. If we could do that, we would
<br>
be able to calculate what signals the brain would send to the vocal
<br>
apparatus after receiving any given input from the auditory nerve. The
<br>
only obstacles to doing this, given an adequate neural model, would be
<br>
having sufficiently fine-grained information about brain state and
<br>
sufficient computational resources to run the model. It would require
<br>
resolution and simulation down to at least the molecular level, and it
<br>
is hard to imagine that we would be able to pull off such a feat
<br>
without understanding and copying higher level cognitive functions
<br>
first; rather like building a flying machine by emulating a bird's
<br>
wings, muscles, cardiovascular and nervous system before being able to
<br>
build a rubber band-powered ornithopter.
