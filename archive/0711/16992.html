<br>
<p>worth noting the typical crap about &quot;Since 99.5% of Transhumanists are
<br>
white males, they don't care about any of these issues&quot;. Of course
<br>
when you tell them that even if you are a white male you DO care about
<br>
all of these issues, they will not believe you. This is just PC crap.
<br>
Sorry my friend the author, I am a transhumanist and I am NOT a
<br>
neocon. Sorry if that does not fit into your dumb black and white
<br>
worldview.
<br>
<p>The author also shows the typical lack of appreciation for complexity.
<br>
Aging research is bad because it takes effort away from other things.
<br>
This is BS.  If those who dedicated their energy to making the first
<br>
fore had followed the dictates of the PC majority that certainly
<br>
existed also at those times, we would still be eating raw meat.
<br>
Humanity has progressed so far because a wide range of people, each
<br>
with her or his particular interests and sensibilities, have dedicated
<br>
their energy to a wide range of problems.
<br>
<p>I wanted to leave this comment to the article but the Kuro5hin system
<br>
does not let me in (perhaps it understands that I am a bad
<br>
transhumanist neocon). Try to leave comments.
<br>
<p>G.
