<em>&gt; In that paper I specify a machine that will infer the goals of a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group of people and pursue a weighted average of those goals, given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient training data about the perceptions and voluntary actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those people.  Your voluntary actions are the contractions of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntary muscles, so the problem of providing the training data is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptually simpler than the problem we started with.
</em><br>
<p>I think this paper is quite valuable as an illustration of the non-trivial 
<br>
nature of the problem. However I see two important issues that are not 
<br>
mentioned in the paper.
<br>
<p>1. Suppose a human says to the AI, &quot;please get an apple for me.&quot; In your 
<br>
scheme, how does the AI know what he really wants the AI to do? (Buy or 
<br>
pick, which store, etc.) What utility function the human is trying to 
<br>
maximize by saying that sentence depends on the human's expectation of the 
<br>
consequences of saying that sentence, which depends on what he thinks the AI 
<br>
will do upon hearing that sentence, which in turn depends on the AI's 
<br>
beliefs about the human's expectations of the consequences of saying that 
<br>
sentence. How do you break this cycle?
<br>
<p>2. If you take an EU-maximizing agent's utility function and add or multiply 
<br>
it by a constant, you wouldn't change the agent's behavior at all, because 
<br>
whatever choices maximized EU for the old utility function would also 
<br>
maximize EU for the new utility function. So from someone's behavior, you 
<br>
can at best only obtain a family of equivalent utility functions that are 
<br>
positive affine transformations of each other. There is no obvious way to 
<br>
combine these families together into an average social utility function. 
<br>
This is a well known problem called &quot;interpersonal comparison of utilities&quot;.
<br>
