<p><p><em>&gt; Suppose an SI wants to do something with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very small, but non-zero probability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say 0 &lt; p &lt;= 1/3^^^3 (in Knuth's up-arrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notation).
</em><br>
<p>(By the way, on an Overcoming Bias pages the
<br>
writer seems to assume that Knuth also
<br>
invented the single-arrow uparrow notation
<br>
---see link below. This is incorrect. Knuth
<br>
invented only the double and triple (etc.)
<br>
up-arrow notation, the single arrow notation
<br>
as in 10^10^10... being as old as keyboards
<br>
with carets.)
<br>
<p>There is no symbolic way that I can think
<br>
of to do this (and I don't think it's possible),
<br>
but one may fall back upon our best physics
<br>
theories. For example, the probability of
<br>
the air rushing out of a small bag, or the
<br>
probability of an ocean freezing are rather
<br>
small. For extremely small probabilities,
<br>
imagine that dust has gravitationally 
<br>
contracted rather recently to assemble the
<br>
Andromeda galaxy, and then calculate the
<br>
probability that the reverse could take place,
<br>
i.e., that the atoms making up the A galaxy
<br>
might begin rushing apart in the time reversed
<br>
scenario. 
<br>
<p>The SI could base its action on the occurrence
<br>
of such an event. But even there, a size 
<br>
limitation is evident.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would it go about doing this? The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be &quot;it can't&quot;, because algorithmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information theory says there is no way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can generate a sufficiently long random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number
</em><br>
<p>You probably could stop right there!  :-)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that it can know is truly random. Can anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a way around this limitation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This problem came up in the context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's &quot;Torture vs. Dust Specks&quot; dilemma(<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/torture-vs-dust.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/torture-vs-dust.html</a>), but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it might be of interest outside that context.
