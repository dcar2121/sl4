Actually, I do have reasons based on rationality and evidence for believing that. Yes, there will be a few common elements between man and AGI - both will use algorithms for cognition, for example. But that's about where the mandatory similarities end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S. BTW, being arrogant is sort of the shtick here. C'mon you have to admit that it's a little bit fun on the rare occasion to be a little bit arrogant. :-)  Don't take it too personally, if someone here wants to genuinely offend you, you'll know.

<p>So you understand the role that emotions play in human intelligence. You
<br>
understand the structure of future GAIs. And you know what's necessary
<br>
and what's not necessary for general intelligence. I don't understand
<br>
any of those things, so rather than taking your word for it, I'll
<br>
continue to believe there may be common elements between man and GAI,
<br>
possibly including emotions (and maybe not too).
