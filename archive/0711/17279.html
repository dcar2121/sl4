&quot;I think it's possible that we evolved the way we did because it works
<br>
well, not due to the special circumstances faced by homo sapiens, and
<br>
therefore some elements may repeat in a GAI.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have hair on my head, and I have general intelligence. But I don't have general intelligence because I have hair on my head. General intelligence is not the only adaptive advantage that evolution operates on. Things like emotions are not necessary for general intelligence, evolution tacked them on to some animals because they incidentally happened to have additional value in terms of survival and reproduction - like hair on the head.

<p>They said the same thing about graphical user interfaces. Well, except

for the last part.

<p>Sigh.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I think we've both made our points. You think any
<br>
anthropomorphic elements of a GAI are either unlikely or dangerous. I
<br>
think it's possible that we evolved the way we did because it works
<br>
well, not due to the special circumstances faced by homo sapiens, and
<br>
therefore some elements may repeat in a GAI.
