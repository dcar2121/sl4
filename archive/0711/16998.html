<p>Sounds good. But there's no constraint that a super-intelligence has
<br>
to strive for Solomonoff Induction, I know of no AI project that is
<br>
being built solely based on Solomonoff Induction, and no human being
<br>
on Earth directly uses Solomonoff Induction, so if you're assuming the
<br>
use of Solomonoff Induction in this scenario, then that's significant
<br>
enough that you should have said that up front as part of the premise.
<br>
That's the only reason I said you're &quot;begging the question&quot;.
<br>
<p>I would agree that if this AI says, &quot;what's the probability that my
<br>
next action will look like x?&quot; then the probability should normatively
<br>
be &gt; 1/3^^^3, for any x that the AI can remotely begin to *distinctly*
<br>
think about (that is, it's not an anonymous part of an ensemble.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Now is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible that SI can take an arbitrary string x and tell us whether P(x)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 1/2^(2^100)?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This P is supposed to be the same function as before (i.e., the standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior for Solomonoff Induction).
</em><br>
<p>By the same logic, you can never do something with probability .5,
<br>
since you can't consistently prove that the measure of any reasonable
<br>
x lies in the range .5 - 1/3^^^3 &lt; p &lt; .5 + 1/3^^^3. The same is true
<br>
for any real number.
