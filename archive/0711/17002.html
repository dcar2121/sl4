<p><em>&gt; We don't have a ghost of a clue what intelligence is
</em><br>
<p>Well it’s true, we don’t have a good definition of intelligence and I
<br>
doubt
<br>
we ever will, but that is a small matter because we have something much
<br>
more important, examples. Intelligence is what smart people do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Richard Feynman had measured IQ of 120, much much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower than Marilyn Vos Savant or most of hte pople in MENSA.
</em><br>
<p>Is it really surprising to learn that the most complex thing in the
<br>
universe, intelligence, can not be satisfactorily described with a
<br>
scalar
<br>
when even something as simple as wind needs a vector?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Even if we did know, there's no evidence we can enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it or replicate it.
</em><br>
<p>Exquisite premium grade extra virgin nonsense. You obviously have
<br>
a computer but if you really believe the above statement why on earth
<br>
did you buy one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AI is brain-dead&quot; and &quot;AI has hit a brick wall
</em><br>
<p>Just a very few years ago nearly everyone would say that the ability to
<br>
play
<br>
a good game of chess was an excellent example of intelligence, but not
<br>
today, today intelligence is whatever a computer can’t do YET; and so
<br>
using that definition you conclude AI has made no progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Show us a working automated translation program that reliably takes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural language and reliably spits back out idiomatic English without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grammatical or semantic errors.
</em><br>
<p>That will happen when the computer fully understands what it is asked to
<br>
translate, and 20 minutes after that the Singularity will happen. But I
<br>
admit we are a hell of a long way from that point, hell Britney Spears
<br>
may
<br>
be approaching middle age by then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Give us the hard evidence that nanotechnology works
</em><br>
<p>Well life works, admittedly it’s a crude version of Nanotechnology but
<br>
it's
<br>
about as good as you could hope for considering that it was invented by
<br>
random mutation and natural selection. I have a hunch intelligence can
<br>
do better, one hell of a lot better. I should add that the fact that the
<br>
area human beings are able to successfully engineer is cut in half ever
<br>
18 months gives me a hint that Nanotechnology is making progress.
<br>
One hell of a lot of progress actually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Antonio Damasio, in his book Decartes' Error, has deep-sixed most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant misconceptions on which hard AI is based. I.e., that there exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some magical fluid called &quot;mind&quot; separate from the brain
</em><br>
<p>There is nothing magical or metaphysical or even very interesting about
<br>
it,
<br>
in fact the distinction it is all rather mundane; brain is a noun, mind
<br>
is a
<br>
verb, and I John K Clark am an adjective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the 50 years since Feynman gave his lecture, we've seen zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress  in creating anything like what Feynman talked about.
</em><br>
<p>What an astronomically foolish thing to say!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would superhumanly smart computers even bother to interact with us
</em><br>
<p>Beats me, but what has that got to do with the price of eggs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Give us that hard evidence that claims about people &quot;uploading their minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into computers&quot; are anything more than a foolishly ignorant delusion based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the fantasy that Descartes' mind-body divide is actually real and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there exists some magical intangible Platonic essence called &quot;the mind&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's distinct from and separable from the human body (meaning the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human  brain).
</em><br>
<p>Oh dear, it appears you are yet another of those meat is sacred people,
<br>
that is to say atoms are sacred people, that is to say very silly
<br>
people.
