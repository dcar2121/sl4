<p>Curiously, I found that SIAI's own position seems closer to the former than 
<br>
the latter. Quoting from 
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/07/31/siai-why-we-exist-and-our-short-term-research-program/">http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/07/31/siai-why-we-exist-and-our-short-term-research-program/</a>:
<br>
<p>Theoretical computer scientists such as Marcus Hutter and Juergen 
<br>
Schmidhuber, in recent years, have developed a rigorous mathematical theory 
<br>
of artificial general intelligence (AGI). While this work is revolutionary, 
<br>
it has its limitations. Most of its conclusions apply only to AI systems 
<br>
that use a truly massive amount of computational resources ¨C more than we 
<br>
could ever assemble in physical reality.
<br>
<p>What needs to be done, in order to create a mathematical theory that is 
<br>
useful for studying the self-modifying AI systems we will build in the 
<br>
future, is to scale Hutter and Schmidhuber¡¯s theory down to deal with AI 
<br>
systems involving more plausible amounts of computational resources.
<br>
(end quote)
<br>
<p>I may be quoting that a bit out of context, but I think it illustrates that 
<br>
even SIAI may be underestimating the amount of work that needs to be done 
<br>
for the AI-based approach to a positive Singularity to work. I guess either 
<br>
that, or Eliezer and Ben have different opinions on the subject.
<br>
<p>BTW, I still remember the arguments between Eliezer and Ben about 
<br>
Friendliness and Novamente. As late as January 2005, Eliezer wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if Novamente should ever cross the finish line, we all die.  That is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I believe or I would be working for Ben this instant.
</em><br>
<p>I'm curious how that debate was resolved?
