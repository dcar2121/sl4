<p>The bee that responds to the dancing robot does not know it is communicating.

If an SI reprograms your brain, you would not know it either.

<p>How would you explain the difference between a beekeeper and an exterminator
<br>
to a bee?  It does not matter how smart *you* are.  You could use
<br>
nanotechnology to augment the bee's brain with human level intelligence, but
<br>
then it wouldn't be a bee anymore.

eventually get it wrong, and evolutionary pressure will take over.

<p>It is like nothing else.
