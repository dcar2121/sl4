<p>Ignoring the non-branching universe for the moment, how do you know that 
<br>
each quantum coin flip is actually independent from all of the others? If 
<br>
the flips are not independent, it's possible that your 3^^^3 bits contains 
<br>
only say 2^100 bits of information but you have no way of telling the 
<br>
difference. (What I mean is that the laws of physics are such that quantum 
<br>
coin flips only appear to be independent, but aren't really.)
<br>
<p>I'll put this in more formal terms to make it clearer. Let P(x) be the 
<br>
probability that x is the output of a uniformly random program. Let SI be 
<br>
the program of a superintelligence such that P(SI) &gt; 1/2^(2^80). (That had 
<br>
better be true, or we have no hope of ever seeing this SI.) Now is it 
<br>
possible that SI can take an arbitrary string x and tell us whether P(x) &lt; 
<br>
1/2^(2^100)? The answer is no, because suppose it could, then we can find 
<br>
the lexicographically first string S with P(S) &lt; 1/2^(2^100) by writing a 
<br>
program that uses SI as a subroutine and queries it with all possible 
<br>
strings in lexicographical order until the SI answers &quot;yes&quot;, but since this 
<br>
program isn't much larger than SI itself, that implies P(S) can't be much 
<br>
smaller than 1/2^(2^80) which is a contradiction.
