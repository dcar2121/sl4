<p>No, I wasn't.  When you take a perfectly reasonable
<br>
explanation of what I was saying (Robin's), and then
<br>
begin talking about papers and pretending that I've
<br>
made some reference to your hobby horse about the terms
<br>
of art in the field, you are not arguing against what
<br>
I said, but merely being dishonest.  Perhaps, however,
<br>
you seriously misremembered what I said and believed
<br>
I'd said something about the AGI acronym, or asked for
<br>
a published paper.  Perhaps.

</em><br>
<p>That wasn't your original assertion though.  Rather,
<br>
you said it was logical that more intelligent beings
<br>
should be in charge, rather than less intelligent
<br>
beings.  Being in charge has nothing to do with making
<br>
decisions, because you cannot decide what your top
<br>
goal should be -- decisions imply a &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;,
<br>
which only make sense in the context of a pre-existing
<br>
goal.
<br>
<p>So, to show your original assertion, you'd have to show
<br>
that the most important goals of more intelligent beings
<br>
were better than the most important goals of less
<br>
intelligent beings.  This is why other people on this list
<br>
have inferred that you believe in a universal morality; if
<br>
you do not, how could you show such a thing?
