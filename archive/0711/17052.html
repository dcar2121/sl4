people are prone to take these estimate questions as attitude surveys is
all the more reason to seek concrete arguments, rather than yet more
attitudes.</blockquote><br>
If you want to compare AGI *relative* to whole brain emulation -
unanchoring the actual time and hence tossing any pretense of futuristic
prophecy out the window - then that's a whole separate
story.</blockquote><br>
Well to the extent that I do think we have grounds for rough estimates of
emulation dates, comparative estimates for AGI would allow date estimates
for AGI as well.&nbsp; <br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">I would begin by asking if there
was ever, in the whole history of technology, a single case where someone
*first* duplicated a desirable effect by emulating biology at a lower
level of organization, without understanding the principles of that
effect's production from that low level of organization.
</blockquote><br>
I know of no important cases, but we do often emulate non-biological
systems this way, when they are complex and we mainly care about computed
I/O behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; We record musics and movies, and we port
software.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also often &quot;reverse-engineer&quot; physical
devices by copying complex designs we don't fully understand.&nbsp;
Organizations also often copy procedures from other organizations they
don't understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that a lack of biological examples
should give us pause, but have we ever really wanted to reproduce the I/O
behavior of complex biological software before?<br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">Looking at history, we find two
lessons:<br><br>
1)&nbsp; Extremely mysterious-seeming desirable natural phenomena are
eventually understood and duplicated by engineering;<br>
2)&nbsp; Because they have ceased to be mysterious by the time they are
duplicated, humans design them by engineering backward from the desired
results, rather than by exactly emulating the lower levels of
organization of a black box in Nature whose mysteriousness remains intact
even as it is emulated.<br><br>
Cars don't emulate horse biochemistry, sonar doesn't emulate bat
biochemistry, compasses don't emulate pigeon biochemistry, suspension
bridges don't emulate spider biochemistry, dams don't emulate beaver
building techniques, and *certainly* none of these things emulate biology
*without understanding why the resulting product
works*.</blockquote><br>
But again, these aren't examples of trying to reproduce complex computed
I/O behavior.&nbsp; <br><br>
