<em>&gt; While I'm still open to being convinced otherwise, my current belief is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that friendly AI is doomed to failure. Let me explain why and see if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinces anyone else, or if they can produce strong counter-arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole situation reminds me of another movement in computer science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was a hot topic when I started out in the '70s: proving programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct. Although there were many great ideas and many great thinkers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved, that movement failed to have any substantial impact of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real world for three reasons: it was hard to impossible to implement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people didn't really need it, and a specification is not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less error prone than an implementation. All of these reasons apply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, to be useful, FAI needs to be bullet-proof, with no way for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI to circumvent it.
</em><br>
<p>Error: You have assumed that the AI will actively be trying to
<br>
&quot;circumvent&quot; Friendliness; this is not accurate. See
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI//adversarial.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI//adversarial.html</a>. In short, a
<br>
Friendly AI has the physical capacity to kill us, or to make an UFAI,
<br>
but it doesn't want to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This equates to writing a bug-free program, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we all know is next to impossible. In fact, to create FAI, you probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to prove the program correct.
</em><br>
<p>That's why the problem is so difficult. Anyone can build a system that
<br>
will work if there are no bugs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it's unlikely to be possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement FAI even if you figure out how to do it in theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, I believe there are other ways to achieve the same goal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rendering FAI an unnecessary and onerous burden. These include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separating input from output, and separating intellect from motivation.
</em><br>
<p>Won't work. See <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/complex-wishes.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/complex-wishes.html</a>.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the former, you just don't supply any output channels except ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be monitored and edited.
</em><br>
<p>Won't work. See <a href="http://sysopmind.com/essays/aibox.html">http://sysopmind.com/essays/aibox.html</a>.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This slows things down tremendously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but is much safer. In the later, you just don't build in any motivations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that go outside the internal analysis mechanisms, including no means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-awareness. In essence, design it so it just wants to understand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to influence.
</em><br>
<p>Understanding requires more computronium. Hence, computronium = good.
<br>
Hence, humans will be converted to computronium, as quickly as
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This may be as prone to error as FAI, but is simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to implement and therefore more likely to be successful. (Indeed, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution can be argued to be impossible to implement due to the near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty of bugs, but in general the simpler they are, the more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are to be workable.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third, defining FAI is as bug-prone as implementing it. One small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake in the specification, either due to lack of foresight or human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error (say, a typo), and it's all for nothing.
</em><br>
<p>That's what CEV is for, see <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html</a>.
<br>
The idea is that you don't specify Friendliness content; you specify
<br>
the process to derive Friendliness content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, in general, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to correctly specify a solution without having the same context as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that of the implementors of the solution, which is this case is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to saying that you have the same perspective as the AI, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To save everyone from having to read more postings, let me pre-supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the replies I'm sure to get to this message:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Read the literature!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * You don't understand the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * You're an idiot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't disagree with any of those, actually, but I'm only likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced I'm wrong by arguments that address my points directly.
</em><br>
