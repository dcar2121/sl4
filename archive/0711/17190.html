On Wed, 21 Nov 2007 &quot;Stathis Papaioannou&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stathisp@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20How%20to%20make%20a%20slave%20(was:%20Building%20a%20friendly%20AI)">stathisp@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human goals, values etc. have evolved to be what they are.
</em><br>
<p>And the same will be true of the AI’s goals and values, except that the
<br>
AI’s evolution will happen astronomically faster. This will be true for
<br>
2 reasons:
<br>
<p>1) The AI’s brain is enormously fast.
<br>
<p>2) The AI will evolve using super fast Lamarckian evolution, the sort of
<br>
evolution culture evolves by, not the much much slower Darwinian
<br>
variety. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; this is quite different to arguing that simply by virtue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being  intelligent the AI will have particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals and value.
</em><br>
<p>Of course an AI will have goals and values, if it didn’t and you asked
<br>
him a question he would have no reason to answer you, he would have no
<br>
reason to even think about the question. But it would be unreasonable to
<br>
expect me to tell you exactly what the AI’s goals and values are, it is
<br>
unreasonable to expect me to understand how a mind vastly more powerful
<br>
than mine works.
<br>
<p>Humans on this list seem desperate to find a virtue that they have but a
<br>
AI must lack, they have come up with all sorts of lame ideas: we evolved
<br>
(big deal) we are made of meat (big deal) emotions are harder to produce
<br>
than intelligence (BULLSHIT!). None of these excuses hold water, the
<br>
truth is the AI will be far far superior to us using any criteria you
<br>
care to name, and you’re just not going to be able to enslave such
<br>
supernova of brain power. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no  logical contradiction in having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; godlike powers and wishing to use  those powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the service of less capable beings.
</em><br>
<p>Can you conceive of any circumstance where in the future you find that
<br>
your only goal in life is the betterment of one particularly ugly and
<br>
particularly slow reacting sea slug?
