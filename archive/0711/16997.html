</em><br>
<em>&gt; it go about doing this? The answer seems to be &quot;it can't&quot;, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic information theory says there is no way that it can generate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently long random number that it can know is truly random. Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a way around this limitation?
</em><br>
<p><p>There is no situation that would call for taking an action based on such a
<br>
low probability.
<br>
<p>Suppose someone, call him Tim, is evaluating what course of action he should
<br>
take. Tim calculates that the correct action is to play a mixed strategy of
<br>
A with probability p, and B with probability 1 - p. But wait! p is so small
<br>
that Tim cannot randomly choose a number with sufficient precision to
<br>
properly play this strategy. Tim's head explodes from thinking about this.
<br>
<p>So why isn't this a problem? Because the ability to determine that the best
<br>
strategy is to perform some action with probability p guarantees that Tim is
<br>
able to calculate with numbers of the same order of magnitude as p.
<br>
<p>I don't think the subtleties of randomness come into play at all here,
<br>
although they could in different similar situations -- rock-paper-scissors
<br>
is not completely random, but it's generally good enough for children who do
<br>
not have access to better methods of settling trivial disputes. The analogy
<br>
here would be that Tim might determine that the correct probability to play
<br>
some portion of a mixed strategy is very low, so low that the cost of not
<br>
playing that strategy was lower than the cost of accurately calculating that
<br>
cost.
