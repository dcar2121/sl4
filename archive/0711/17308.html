<em>&gt; &gt; In the former, you just don't supply any output channels except ones

</em><br>
<p>Suppose:
<br>
- The only input to the AI is a very narrow problem definition (&quot;prove
<br>
the Riemann hypothesis&quot;). Notably, the input does not contain anything
<br>
about human psychology or language, or even the existence of a world
<br>
outside its system.
<br>
- The only output comes after the AI has shut down. No interaction.
<br>
How, then, could it manipulate humans into escaping? At worst you'd
<br>
get a safe failure, either because it had insufficient resources or
<br>
because you specified the problem wrong. If this allows safe passive
<br>
AI, it could be very useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This slows things down tremendously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but is much safer. In the later, you just don't build in any motivations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that go outside the internal analysis mechanisms, including no means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-awareness. In essence, design it so it just wants to understand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not to influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Understanding requires more computronium. Hence, computronium = good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence, humans will be converted to computronium, as quickly as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.
</em><br>
<p>I have a reason to think this might not happen even in an unboxed AI.
<br>
As I understand, part of the AGI problem is getting the AI to model
<br>
itself as a continuous part of the world rather than a wholly separate
<br>
entity (AIXI-style), so that e.g. it 'understands' that it should
<br>
prevent its physical housing from being damaged. Might an AI that
<br>
models itself as something separate not be able to 'conceive' of
<br>
expanding its computational resources by manipulating the _external_
<br>
world? Of course, I'm not suggesting anyone try this - I'm hardly
<br>
confident of it - and it doesn't seem as useful as my first idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Third, defining FAI is as bug-prone as implementing it. One small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mistake in the specification, either due to lack of foresight or human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; error (say, a typo), and it's all for nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what CEV is for, see <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea is that you don't specify Friendliness content; you specify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the process to derive Friendliness content.
</em><br>
<p>CEV is itself content capable of being mis-specified, but I basically agree.
