<p>
Joshua,
<br>
<p>The issue is that publishers' contracts normally explicitly forbid this.
<br>
<p>So, at the present time, as an author one of an intellectual book that is
<br>
not likely
<br>
to yield much revenue, one is faced with an irritating choice, between
<br>
<p>A) self-publishing the book and then posting it online -- as well as,
<br>
perhaps making it available
<br>
in hard-copy through, say, Lulu.com
<br>
<p>B) using a &quot;real publisher&quot;, which confers some reputation that does not
<br>
come along with
<br>
posting a book online or self-publishing it
<br>
<p>The approach I've taken has been to sort-of cheat.  I.e., I have used real
<br>
publishers because
<br>
I've considered it worthwhile to establish an acceptable academic
<br>
publication record.  However,
<br>
after a book has been in print a little while, I've generally posted
<br>
rough-draft versions on my website,
<br>
even though this is not strictly allowed by the publishers' contracts.
<br>
<p>For the AGI-08 conference proceedings, we negotiated a specific deal with
<br>
the book publisher,
<br>
which was that
<br>
-- we cannot publish the whole proceedings online, on the conference website
<br>
-- however, if authors post papers on their websites, the conference website
<br>
can link to these papers
<br>
<p>This is odd, but I understand the publisher's point of view, given the
<br>
realities of their existence as
<br>
a publishing company.
<br>
<p>Anyway, the publishing industry is in a state of transition, and the
<br>
academic community has not
<br>
caught up.  Once paper-publication is eliminated as a marker of reputation
<br>
and status, I personally
<br>
will happily post all my stuff on my website.  But I have to deal with the
<br>
social realities I'm
<br>
embedded in, like everybody else...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
