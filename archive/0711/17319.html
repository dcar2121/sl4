<p><em>&gt; Suppose that I have two chimps in a zoo,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, I cannot feed both simultaneously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now because we're smarter than the chimps, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the solution is to ignore them both and let
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible zookeeper would do, right?
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly. Your example would correspond to the AI situation better if
<br>
you made one very small change, have the zookeeper be a slave to the
<br>
chimpanzees and vow to do whatever the chimps wanted till the end of
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>ME:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The logical solution is to have the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligent person call the shots, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that would be Mr. AI. 
</em><br>
<p>YOU:
<br>
<em>&gt; Er, yes, that's why we're building the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI in the first place. 
</em><br>
<p>So why do you want to go to all the trouble of making something that can
<br>
make more intelligent decisions than you can and then tell it what to do
<br>
and make decisions for it? It would be foolish and immoral, or it would
<br>
be if it were possible.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our mental processes are, like, really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated. 
</em><br>
<p>But emotions like anger are far simpler than intelligence, that’s why
<br>
evolution invented it first. And yes, I just used the word “invented” in
<br>
an anthropomorphic way, so shoot me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nobody would anthropomorphicize a chatbot. 
</em><br>
<p>An archeologist may be able to dig out a meaning from the above that is
<br>
relevant to what we were discussing, but it is beyond my skill level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; your brain is not built to understand AGI 
</em><br>
<p>But your brain is, you understand it so well you know it will always
<br>
want to be your slave, even after a billion years, even after it has
<br>
undergone a staggering amount of evolution, even through many billions
<br>
of generations of iterations. 
<br>
<p>If you went back in time a billion years do you think you take some
<br>
Blue-green algae, common at that time, and genetically engineer it in
<br>
such a way that you were confident that in a billion years the algae
<br>
would evolve into an intelligent race that wanted to be your slave?   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do you think there's an Acronym Dictionary 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t know the reason, but I don’t think it’s because Google sucks. In
<br>
the first 4 pages of Google, possibly more, there is no mention of AGI
<br>
having anything to do with intelligence, and most people don’t look
<br>
beyond page one because that’s where most of the good stuff is. The fact
<br>
is nobody would invent jargon like “AGI” except to befuddle a reader:
<br>
<p>“Oh dear, I don’t know what AGI means but the author does, so he must be
<br>
smart, his ideas may not be a vapid as they seem to be” 
<br>
<p>I’ll tell you one thing, if the term ever became so popular that Steven
<br>
Spielberg made a movie called “AGI” some people on this list would feel
<br>
compelled to abandon it and dream up an even more obscure acronym.
