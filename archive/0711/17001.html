<p>
I know why I was not able to post my comment to K5 with a new account:
<br>
they now ask new users for a one-time 5$ payment to enable comments.
<br>
So I posted from an old account that I made a few years ago. Some
<br>
others posted, in particular Eugen's comment is very good.
<br>
<p>I wish to encourage everyone to post THIS IS BS to K5. In particular
<br>
we should make it clear that &quot;nearly all Transhumanists are either
<br>
Neocons and Neocon influenced&quot; is BS, and &quot;Since 99.5% of
<br>
Transhumanists are white males, they don't care about any of these
<br>
issues&quot; is BS. So please, if you have a not too recent K5 account, go
<br>
to
<br>
<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/11/4/132937/255">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/11/4/132937/255</a>
<br>
and say loud and clear THIS IS BS
<br>
<p>Of course our friend Dale makes a valiant attempt at a defense saying
<br>
something like: yes, the K5 statements are perhaps not entirely
<br>
correct, BUT blah blah blah.

<br>
<p>With enough clever words and enough hair-splitting one can always hope
<br>
to prove that black is white and BS is wisdom, but some simple and
<br>
clear thinking usually shows that black is black and BS is BS.

<em>&gt; worth noting the typical crap about &quot;Since 99.5% of Transhumanists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white males, they don't care about any of these issues&quot;. Of course

<em>&gt; when you tell them that even if you are a white male you DO care about

<em>&gt; Sorry my friend the author, I am a transhumanist and I am NOT a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neocon. Sorry if that does not fit into your dumb black and white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worldview.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The author also shows the typical lack of appreciation for complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aging research is bad because it takes effort away from other things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is BS.  If those who dedicated their energy to making the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fore had followed the dictates of the PC majority that certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existed also at those times, we would still be eating raw meat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humanity has progressed so far because a wide range of people, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with her or his particular interests and sensibilities, have dedicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their energy to a wide range of problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wanted to leave this comment to the article but the Kuro5hin system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not let me in (perhaps it understands that I am a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist neocon). Try to leave comments.
