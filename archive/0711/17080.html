<em>&gt; &gt; That's just stupid. The smarter you are, the better you are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explaining anything to anyone. If an explanation exists which a human

<em>&gt; &gt; would understand, a superintelligence should be able to find it. It
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well that their intuitive understanding of the skewing of reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; frames is better than stephen hawking's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming such an explanation exists; I would guess that it does not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we are somewhere near the limit of the best possible explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an eight year old at the moment. It is irrational to assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just because we humans are not infinitely intelligent, we can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly have discovered the best answer to a technical or theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Well, speaking from personal experience, I can explain general
<br>
relativity in nontechnical terms a hell of a lot better than I've seen
<br>
anyone else do it, and I find it hard to believe my explanation is the
<br>
best one.
<br>
<p>When I was first taught that when travelling near the speed of light,
<br>
distances become shorter and the rest of the universe gets slower
<br>
(from your point of view), it didn't make sense to me, because if from
<br>
my perspective it only takes a day to get to alpha centauri, why is it
<br>
that when I get there, five years have gone by, and when i take the
<br>
one day trip back to earth, an additional five years have gone by back
<br>
on earth? From my reference frame, where does the extra time get in
<br>
there?
<br>
<p>I asked the professor and he wrote some equations on a napkin, but
<br>
essentially he couldn't find the words to explain it. The answer turns
<br>
out to be that as you accelerate to near the speed of light, your
<br>
reference frame &quot;tilts&quot; so to speak, and the five years happens all at
<br>
once for alpha centauri, then when you get there and decelerate it
<br>
tilts back, and five years happens on earth. Like letting down a set
<br>
of venetian blinds.
<br>
<p>In all the handy &quot;guy on a train with a clock and einstein's on the
<br>
platform with two mirrors and a bouncing photon&quot; intros i've seen,
<br>
regardless of how computer animated they are, I've never seen this
<br>
basic fact mentioned at all, and it's kind of the keystone of the
<br>
whole system.

<em>&gt; Ability to communicate is limited by the intelligence of both sender and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the pollen is.  We can also create dancing robot bees that signal the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bees where to fly.  But that is about all we can do.  Their language is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited.  They can't ask where to build a hive that would best ensure their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival.  They don't know the difference between a beekeeper and an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminator.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but my point is, there is a difference in kind between a human
<br>
and a bee. It's like the difference between a computer and a
<br>
calculator. If you know what you're doing, you make the computer do
<br>
damn near anything, without any kind of physical tampering, just by
<br>
typing on the keyboard and clicking on the mouse.
<br>
<p>Just as with bees, my desktop computer can communicate with the other
<br>
computers on the internet far more efficiently that I can communicate
<br>
with it. But the things I can teach it to do go beyond what the other
<br>
computers can teach it by a long, long way.
<br>
<p>The idea that we humans are near the limits of our capacity for
<br>
understanding is absurd. Just as a computer, what we are capable of
<br>
understanding surpasses what we are capable of figuring out on our own
<br>
by miles and miles and miles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A superintelligence would know the complete state of your brain.  You would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not need to ask it anything.  It would already know your questions.  It it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chooses to, it could answer by reprogramming your brain.
</em><br>
<p>What does this have to do with anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But we can know nothing about its intentions or motives.
</em><br>
<p>Except if we defined them, or if it told us, or if we observed the
<br>
results of its actions? Kind of like everything else?
