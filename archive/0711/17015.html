<p>
<em>&gt; So I am here to ask: where are the best analyses arguing the case for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid (non-emulation) AI progress?
</em><br>
<p>Some answers examine the progress of engineering and suggest that AGI will
<br>
probably come at a certain date -- soon --  just as the telephone and the
<br>
airplane seemed fated to emerge when they did: there were multiple inventors
<br>
racing for the finish line.
<br>
<p>There is some justice in that, but another approach is this: All that
<br>
remains on the road to AGI is figuring out how intelligence works. Some
<br>
researcher(s) will do so. We don't know when, but it is fundamentally a
<br>
mathematical/philosophical advance rather than a nitty-gritty understanding
<br>
of the quirks of a biological systems. The implementation  is just a Simple
<br>
Matter of Programming &lt;<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>The understanding could be achieved by one genius with a brain-flash, or by
<br>
a community making progress together. We can compare the breakthroughs of
<br>
Wiles and Perlman, which depended on a series of mathematical developments,
<br>
yet could not be predicted like the progress of  some engineering project
<br>
(not that those are too predictable).
<br>
<p>This is different from, e.g., reaching Alpha Centauri, which would require
<br>
solving more than one engineering problem (despite the good work of
<br>
pioneering researchers who have laid out advance plans) and enormous
<br>
economic resources. It is also different from time travel or teleportation
<br>
which would require re-defining laws of physics (despite some speculative
<br>
thought in these directions). Indeed, I'd say that it's different from life
<br>
extension, which requires understanding multiple biological systems and
<br>
engineering a well-balanced fix to certain problems.
<br>
