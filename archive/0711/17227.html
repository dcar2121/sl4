</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>Truly - I must follow my own advice and point out contradictions in
<br>
Elizier's writing to contribute to his work as I expect it from others
<br>
myself. And although I have done so on numerous occasions and his posts are
<br>
rather long at times, I seldom got a response from him how the
<br>
contradictions pointed out by me could be resolved from his point of view.
<br>
<p>I read his post again and shall point out some contradictions and potential
<br>
improvements once more - but frankly it is not fun not to get a response on
<br>
how to resolve the contradiction. Here we go:
<br>
<p>&quot;Outcomes don't lead to Outcomes, only Actions lead to Outcomes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Action: work -&gt; Outcome: life
<br>
<p>According to the above statement life does not lead to work. This is a
<br>
contradiction.
<br>
<p>&quot;[...] in this formalism, actions lead directly to outcomes with no
<br>
intervening events.&quot;
<br>
<p>Action: define! action = solution -&gt; execute action -&gt; outcome: solution
<br>
<p>This is very convenient. Like catching all lions in a desert by building a
<br>
3x3 meter cage and defining the outside as inside. You can do that - but
<br>
what is achieved by it? A laugh of a forgiving audience. But we are not here
<br>
to make fun of ourselves - at least not primarily.
<br>
<p>&quot;Being ignorant of your own values may not always be fun, but at least it's
<br>
not boring&quot;
<br>
<p>So ignorance is bliss? I personally do not agree that that is the case.  The
<br>
way I see it, ignorance is the set of false implications based on chosen
<br>
axioms. Ignorance is caused either by uncertainty in regards to a cause or
<br>
an effect or rationalized contradictions. Ignorant people are unaware of the
<br>
consequences of their actions and the harm it causes themselves as well as
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>The idiom 'ignorance is bliss' can thus be interpreted to mean that people
<br>
unaware of their actions causing self destruction will see no reason to
<br>
change what they are doing. Personally, I prefer knowing my values.
<br>
<p>Or are surprises fun? A surprise is something you you do not expect. You are
<br>
unexpectedly hit by a car. That's not fun...
<br>
<p>I think I demonstrated the willingness to review, interpret and understand
<br>
the work of others. Can I get the favor of pointing out contradictions in my
<br>
work returned now?
<br>
<p>Here is the link again:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.rationalmorality.info/wiki/index.php?title=Rational_philosophy_of_morality_%28intuitive%29">http://www.rationalmorality.info/wiki/index.php?title=Rational_philosophy_of_morality_%28intuitive%29</a>
<br>
<p>Please do not get me wrong - I think he is a brilliant writer and I have a
<br>
lot of respect for him and science in general. But I respect critical
<br>
rational discourse even more. Further I do not merely contradict by playing
<br>
advocatus diaboli. No. I developed my own model that provides a better
<br>
understanding. Please contradict it and I will work harder to improve it
<br>
further. Or understand it - recognize its value and move forward to find and
<br>
solve the next contradiction.
<br>
<p>Many thanks,
<br>
<p>Stefan
