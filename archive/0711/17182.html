<em>&gt; rehashing:
</em><br>
<p>One question/concern that I have, which is not covered by your list,
<br>
is the possibility of a powerful but sub-AGI level AI falling into the
<br>
&quot;wrong hands&quot;.
<br>
<p>I believe that AI will come in several iterations. The first couple
<br>
versions will be very powerful reasoning/statistical inference systems
<br>
but will not have their own goals. In other words, the AI will act
<br>
like an oracle, answering very difficult questions accurately but not
<br>
taking actions on its own.
<br>
<p>For an example of how this could be a problem, consider the following
<br>
scenario. Dr. Evil invents such an AI system. He then uses it to
<br>
predict the stock market, so he becomes enormously wealthy. He then
<br>
constructs some simple robot soldiers, and uses them to take over the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>Given the existence of a Dr Evil who can construct this kind of
<br>
non-self-willed AI, the above scenario doesn't seem so implausible.
<br>
<p>I consider this type of problem to be somewhat more realistic than the
<br>
&quot;super-AGI turns world into computronium&quot; scenario. Even more
<br>
realistic is the possibility of the government obtaining a pseudo-AI
<br>
and using it for tyrannical purposes. Almost all the obvious
<br>
applications of limited AI incline in this direction (robot weapons,
<br>
computer vision for surveillance, speech recognition so the NSA can
<br>
automatically transcribe all your phone calls).
<br>
<p>This list isn't for political debate, but I think everyone will agree
<br>
that there is not even a popsicle barricade standing between us and
<br>
AI-aided government tyranny. I consider this a rather substantial
<br>
existential risk and one which we are psychologically biased against
<br>
thinking about (it requires criticism of one's own group and
<br>
government). So in this sense discussion of AGI and politics must
<br>
unfortunately collide.
<br>
<p>The question I'm seriously asking myself now is: should AI research be
<br>
put on hold until more political safeguards can be put in place?
<br>
<p>Perhaps some people have discussed this at length and provided a
<br>
compelling answer. If so, please send me a link.
<br>
<p>thanks,
<br>
Dan
