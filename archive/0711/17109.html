</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Or, to mention another problem, for mental arithmetic and visual  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perception,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you can have someone do mental arithmetic or look at something

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; insight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into the nature of induction&quot; isn't likely to get you anywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if the neural activity involved in &quot;higher&quot; cognition is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex than that involved in more basic cognition (and I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an assumption, not necessarily true), there is no reason to suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is a different type of physical process altogether. It's all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generic neurons, generic neurotransmitters, generic action potentials.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, if we are able to analyse and emulate a simple brain function,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This seems like a fallacy of composition.  Simple brain function?  All  
<br>
of these phenomena are dependent upon functional relationships between  
<br>
neurons.  But this does not mean that we will be able to understand  
<br>
more complex configurations–by &quot;complex&quot;, I'm referring to difficulty  
<br>
of understanding and not necessarily structural/functional complexity– 
<br>
just because we understand simpler configurations.  Neuroscientists  
<br>
have detailed mechanistic explanations of basic perceptual processes.   
<br>
They have had nowhere near this kind of success when it comes to  
<br>
things like &quot;executive functions&quot;.  It may have to do with the fact  
<br>
that the nature of information processing is more idiosyncratic (self- 
<br>
organizing in a complex way) in the frontal lobe of the brain.  Bottom  
<br>
up perceptual processes are topographic and map the external world in  
<br>
a fairly tractable manner.  Consequently, we have fairly detailed  
<br>
models going down to the neuronal level.  We don't have this for  
<br>
higher-order cognition.
<br>
<p>We could emulate the human brain by modeling the activity of different  
<br>
neural regions, but this would be an extremely limited form of reverse  
<br>
engineering.  Emulation isn't understanding.  Ideally, we would like  
<br>
detailed understanding of the engineering principles underlying  
<br>
cognition.  Without this, we will be limited in our abilities to  
<br>
anticipate the emergent properties of the emulated brains.  If you  
<br>
achieve a super-intelligence using this sort of method (the ethics of  
<br>
which are questionable), I don't see how we will be able to ensure  
<br>
benevolence (which is important if you're a non super-intelligence).
