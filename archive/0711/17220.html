<p>I think you're misinterpreting what people are saying here. I have yet 
<br>
to see a post to this list that said or implied that meat is somehow 
<br>
special. Maybe I should let the actual posters explain themselves, but I 
<br>
really haven't seen that.
<br>
<p>Goals will necessarily come from one of two places: pre-programmed or 
<br>
random. This is true of people as well as machine GAIs. Random top-level 
<br>
goals are arguably a design flaw. Pre-programmed goals come from us in 
<br>
the case of machine GAIs, from evolution in the case of people.
<br>
<p>So, are you arguing that it's impossible to eliminate the presence of 
<br>
random top-level goals? Or that it's impossible to predict the actual 
<br>
result of pre-programmed top-level goals? Or that new non-random 
<br>
top-level goals will get introduced from thin air?
<br>
<p>However, let me add one other point: In humans, I do not believe the 
<br>
goal set is strictly hierarchical. This means there are no permanent 
<br>
top-level goals, though there are persistent goals. This often results 
<br>
in people doing things to achieve local goals that detract from 
<br>
accomplishing what you'd think were their top-level goals. The current 
<br>
top-level goals vary based on current circumstances -- i.e., randomly 
<br>
based on external inputs. Computer GAIs might have the same problem, but 
<br>
don't have to.
<br>
<p>[BTW, the condescending tone of many of your posts does not further your 
<br>
arguments. It just makes the posts unpleasant to read. Same comment to 
<br>
others who take a similar tone.]
