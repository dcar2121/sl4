I'm sure I'll regret interfering as usually in this list, but......
<br>
<p>Some humbleness is necessary while on this list Harry.
<br>
Or while on any highly focused expert list, for that matter.
<br>
Until you can consider yourself an expert on the field.
<br>
Then you can attempt arrogance, but now you're a moment too soon.
<br>
<p>Whatever you are working on regarding AI (or is it AGI?), don't think you can transfer your expertise to FAGI straight away.
<br>
People in the SIAI are pretty much the only group that has been focusing on FAGI for any considerable amount of time.
<br>
<p>What makes you think you can do it better right of the bat?

<p>Good luck with that. But, frankly, judging from the posts on this list,
<br>
you sounds like exactly the sort of arrogant people who believe they
<br>
know the answer and no one else does who I especially think should
<br>
&nbsp;*not*
<br>
control the singularity. Hmmm, maybe I should get back to work.

<p>No thanks.
