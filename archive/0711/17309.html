<em>&gt;&gt; First, to be useful, FAI needs to be bullet-proof, with no way for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the AI to circumvent it. This equates to writing a bug-free program,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which we all know is next to impossible. In fact, to create FAI, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probably need to prove the program correct. So it's unlikely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible to implement FAI even if you figure out how to do it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does it need to be perfect, rather than 1) better than previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions, 2) able to recognize errors, and 3) highly redundant? For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, your AI could be motivated to ensure Kaldor-Hicks efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfers of wealth, /and/ to ensure maximally beneficial transfers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wealth -- and if it finds that Goal #2 is interfering with Goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #1, it would drop the second goal until it could come up witha a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better way to fulfill it without hurting Goal #1. I mean, if you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designing a system for, say, routing trains, you don't need a perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get Things There Fast routine, as long as you have a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-priority, low-error Don't Crash Things Into Each Other routine.
</em><br>
<p>I would have thought that 1 and 2 were as likely to be buggy as anything
<br>
else. Redundancy, though, has some possibilities. Sort of like putting
<br>
something in multiple bags, so that if some leak, it's still OK. But
<br>
that could equally well be applied to other approaches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Second, I believe there are other ways to achieve the same goal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rendering FAI an unnecessary and onerous burden. These include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; separating input from output, and separating intellect from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; motivation. In the former, you just don't supply any output channels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; except ones that can be monitored and edited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monitored and edited by whom? This dragon-on-a-leash theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presupposes that we can pick the right leash-holder, and ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the leash stays where we want it. That's very nearly incompatible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the notion that an AI is valuable enough to be worth creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and powerful enough to make a difference.
</em><br>
<p>Monitored by us or by programs we create, which can be much simpler than
<br>
an AI and hence easier to get right. The best current example I can
<br>
think of is programmed trading, where we already have AIs (simple ones)
<br>
picking stocks and automatically buying for selling them. But there are
<br>
safeguard programs that shut the whole system down if certain parameters
<br>
are exceeded.
<br>
<p>As to it being worthwhile, I'd say you need to evaluate that on a
<br>
case-by-case basis. But you're right, it certainly won't be as powerful
<br>
as a completely unleashed AI.
