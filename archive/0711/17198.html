UCaRtMaAI stands for &quot;Using Compassion and Respect to Motivate an
<br>
Artificial Intelligence&quot;.  Isn't that a horrible title? 
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Wei Dai&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:weidai@weidai.com?Subject=Re:%20UCaRtMaAI%20paper%20(was%20Re:%20Building%20a%20friendly%20AI%20from%20a%20&quot;just%20do%20what%20I%20tell%20you&quot;%20AI)">weidai@weidai.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;However I see two important issues that are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mentioned in [<a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/index.html">http://www.fungible.com/respect/index.html</a>].
</em><br>
<p>But you understood it well enough to see the issues.  Maybe it's more
<br>
comprehensible than I thought.  Thanks for taking a look.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1. Suppose a human says to the AI, &quot;please get an apple for me.&quot; In your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheme, how does the AI know what he really wants the AI to do? (Buy or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pick, which store, etc.) 
</em><br>
<p>The answer to that question depends on the AI's simplest explanations of
<br>
the human's goals.  This depends on the AI's past observations of the
<br>
human's previous behaviors (and the behaviors of the other humans,
<br>
since the AI explains them all at once).  You didn't specify the past
<br>
behaviors, and even if you did I don't have enough brainpower to run
<br>
the AI's algorithm, so I don't know the answer to your question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What utility function the human is trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maximize by saying that sentence depends on the human's expectation of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consequences of saying that sentence, which depends on what he thinks the AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will do upon hearing that sentence, which in turn depends on the AI's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beliefs about the human's expectations of the consequences of saying that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentence. How do you break this cycle?
</em><br>
<p>Good example.  I'll have to talk about that more explicitly in the paper.
<br>
<p>The algorithm in the paper does give a well-defined result in this
<br>
case.  The cycle doesn't go around as much as you say.  (I have the
<br>
diagram at <a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html#beliefs">http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html#beliefs</a> open in
<br>
the other window, if you want to follow along.)  The AI comes up with
<br>
many possible explanations for &quot;Beliefs&quot; (along with all of the other
<br>
ovals in the diagram), and each aggregate explanation is given an
<br>
a-priori probability according to the speed prior.  The simplest
<br>
explanations of the human's beliefs will tend to dominate.  Each
<br>
explanation will take the human's estimated Mind-state as input and
<br>
will output, among other things, what the AI thinks the human thinks
<br>
the AI is going to do.  That's as far as it goes around in the
<br>
algorithm I gave.  Any further reflection will happen inside that
<br>
little &quot;Beliefs&quot; oval, or perhaps inside the &quot;Mind-Physics&quot; oval.
<br>
Simple explanations will tend to be preferred, so the cycling around
<br>
inside those ovals has to be bounded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. If you take an EU-maximizing agent's utility function and add or multiply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it by a constant, you wouldn't change the agent's behavior at all, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever choices maximized EU for the old utility function would also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maximize EU for the new utility function.
</em><br>
<p>That's a reasonable reaction to the paper because I didn't emphasize
<br>
in the best place how that issue is dealt with.  The utility is an
<br>
integer with a bounded number of bits, so many of the constants you
<br>
might want to multiply by will cause overflow and break the
<br>
explanation.  Similarly, there's only a finite number of constants you
<br>
can add, depending on the range of values.  The broken explanations
<br>
don't contribute to the final result.  I hint at the bounded utility
<br>
values at
<br>
<a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html#guessed-parameters">http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html#guessed-parameters</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html#pascals-wager">http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html#pascals-wager</a>.  The number
<br>
of bits in the utility is the &quot;utility_bits&quot; parameter to
<br>
Infer_utility_problem.__init__ at
<br>
<a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/code/infer_utility.py.txt">http://www.fungible.com/respect/code/infer_utility.py.txt</a>, and that
<br>
variable is used in check_reasonable_utilities in planner.py.  (Now
<br>
I'm glad I thoroughly tested that code.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no obvious way to combine these families together into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;average social utility function.  This is a well known problem called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;interpersonal comparison of utilities&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The arithmetic is clear, once you assume the utility is a nonnegative
<br>
integer with a maximum value.  The AI's estimated utility for me in
<br>
situation X runs from (say) 0 to 1023, and the AI's estimated utility
<br>
for you in situation X runs from 0 to 1023, so we can get a weighted
<br>
average of our utilites to get the AI's utility.
<br>
<p>Humans do interpersonal comparison of utilities routinely.  I want to
<br>
stay alive tomorrow, and you probably want to eat dinner tomorrow.  I
<br>
think that in the simplest circumstances consistent with what has been
<br>
said so far, we'll all agree that my desire to stay alive tomorrow is
<br>
greater than your desire to eat dinner tomorrow.  Since humans can do
<br>
it, if you buy into Church-Turing thesis you have to conclude that
<br>
there is an algorithm for it.  If you don't buy into the
<br>
Church-Turing thesis, you're reading the wrong mailing list. :-).
<br>
<p>If someone has a better idea, please speak up.  We really do have to
<br>
compare utilities between people, since the FAI will routinely have to
<br>
choose between helping one person and helping another.  (For a
<br>
suitably twisted definition of &quot;Friendly&quot;, one can argue that the
<br>
previous sentence is false.  I'd be interested in seeing details if
<br>
anyone can fill them in in a way they honestly think makes sense.)
