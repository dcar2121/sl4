I did one of my theses on Recurrent Analog Neural Networks (ARNN) and
<br>
gave a talk at the University of Liverpool two years ago, the
<br>
proceedings were recently published by World Scientific[1] with my
<br>
paper under the title &quot;On the possible Computational Power of the
<br>
Human Mind&quot;. An arXiv version is available online:
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605065">http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605065</a>
<br>
<p>and the presentation from the conference:
<br>
<a href="http://complexity.vub.ac.be/phil/presentations/Zenil.pdf">http://complexity.vub.ac.be/phil/presentations/Zenil.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>ARNNs are basically neural networks, first analyzed by Siegelmann and
<br>
Sontag, able to allow arbitrary real numbers as weights.
<br>
Traditionally, neural networks have been considered to have rational
<br>
or computable weights. From Kleene we know that neural networks with
<br>
integer weights are equivalent in computational power to finite
<br>
automata. Siegelmann made several contributions in her seminal book[2]
<br>
such as the construction of a very small universal neural network with
<br>
only 9 neurons (published before in joint with Maurice
<br>
Margenstern[3]). She also gave several interesting computational
<br>
complexity results related to the ARNN's in general and provided a
<br>
proof for neural networks with rational numbers as equivalent to
<br>
Turing machines in computational power. Then extended the model to
<br>
allow any arbitrary real number that would then automatically allow
<br>
the ARNN to compute beyond the Turing limit (e.g. put as weight the
<br>
value of $\Omega$ the halting set coded as a real number). Of course
<br>
one question is from where one can get that non-computable number in
<br>
order to put it in the net configuration to reach hypercomputation
<br>
(all known artificial neural networks run basically over Turing
<br>
machines), although if the system already has it (e.g. one already
<br>
operating in nature or in our head) then it automatically would reach
<br>
hypercomputation. But from it one cannot draw any conclusion about its
<br>
feasibility. Martin Davis's excellent article [4], &quot;The Myth of
<br>
Hypercomputation,&quot; clearly articulates several criticisms, including
<br>
jumps to conclusions from Siegelmann's work.
<br>
<p>Hava Siegelmann is not claiming that the human brain is an ARNN, we
<br>
suggest that it can be studied through an ARNN model though, because
<br>
of its generality. Of course a brain with a neural network with
<br>
arbitrary real number would go beyond the Turing limit, but that is
<br>
unlikely, even when there are other elements traditionally taken as
<br>
&quot;continuous&quot; variables, such as neural spikes, also covered in [1].
