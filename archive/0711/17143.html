<p>Other people have already said this to you, but I'll say it
<br>
differently: you're projecting human thought patterns on to the AI.
<br>
Just because the AI is smart doesn't mean that it thinks to check
<br>
before dropping a piano on a busy street.  That's from an example I
<br>
saw somewhere; if you're moving a piano out of a 6th story
<br>
apartment, think about every bit of cognition that has to go right
<br>
for you to look down and check for the presence of people rather
<br>
than just dopping the thing.  This has nothing to do with
<br>
intelligence, it has to do with a complicated set of mental
<br>
structures that are used to check the validity of sub-goals.  An AI
<br>
need not have any of these, so you say &quot;Get the piano out of the
<br>
apartment&quot; and it kills 3 people.  That doesn't mean it's not smart,
<br>
it means it doesn't think like you do.
<br>
<p>All your posts on this topic seem to assume the AI thinks like you
<br>
do.  You need to revisit that.
