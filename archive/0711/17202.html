Hi,
<br>
<p>I just got back home after attending the European futurists conference
<br>
(read my thoughts about it at www.vetta.org ) and really should be working
<br>
on the final version of my PhD thesis before Hutter decides to pay me a
<br>
visit
<br>
in Switzerland armed with a gun :-)
<br>
<p>So just a few quick comments for the moment:
<br>
<p>Yes, there are infinitely many things that can be proven.  The limit I prove
<br>
only applies to statements of a particular form, as Matt notes in his
<br>
second post in this thread.  Statements of the form &quot;x+1 &gt; x&quot; always
<br>
remain provable no matter how large or complex x is.  My result is only
<br>
about prediction algorithms, not math in general.
<br>
<p>As Vladimir notes, this limit depends on the complexity of a specific
<br>
program (the proof search program).  With a bigger program you can
<br>
push this limit up.  (Just like with Gödel's result you can always add new
<br>
axioms to the system to try to &quot;plug the holes&quot;).
<br>
<p>However, before people then conclude that the result is kind of silly
<br>
because
<br>
we can get around the problem by just using a bigger program... there's a
<br>
problem with that plan.  If you look at the proofs, in order to make this
<br>
more
<br>
powerful program what you really need are bits from the halting sequence
<br>
because the long running programs are the ones causing all the trouble.  Of
<br>
course the halting sequence is not computable... so you're stuck back where
<br>
you started.
<br>
<p>Shane
