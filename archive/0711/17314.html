<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the former, you just don't supply any output channels except ones
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Won't work. See <a href="http://sysopmind.com/essays/aibox.html">http://sysopmind.com/essays/aibox.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The only input to the AI is a very narrow problem definition (&quot;prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Riemann hypothesis&quot;). Notably, the input does not contain anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about human psychology or language, or even the existence of a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside its system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The only output comes after the AI has shut down. No interaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How, then, could it manipulate humans into escaping? At worst you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a safe failure, either because it had insufficient resources or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you specified the problem wrong. If this allows safe passive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, it could be very useful.
</em><br>
<p>This increases the minimum competency of the AI, but isn't obviously
<br>
enough to make the problem impossible.  For example,
<br>
<p>(1) the AI might be able to  infer the existence of humans from the
<br>
problem specification and its source code (consider:  how many bits of
<br>
information are fed to the AI by its input and its code?).
<br>
<p>(2a) the AI may be able to output through multiple channels, e.g.
<br>
shuffle bits around to generate EM waves which induce a current in you
<br>
cellphone which...  Or perhaps the sandbox is insecure, and the AI can
<br>
connect to the internet or hide code elsewhere in the machine e.g.
<br>
overwrite the firmware.
<br>
(2b) or, if the AI is being run multiple times it may be able to infer
<br>
this and cooperate with its later executions somehow,
<br>
(2c) or, it works out human psychology sufficiently so as to write the
<br>
magic symbol/paragraph which both looks like a solution and makes the
<br>
reader really want to connect the AI's box to the internet
<br>
(2d) or, the programmers (predictably) peek at the AI's memory, or
<br>
find they need to run an interactive process to get real results.
<br>
<p>I don't know whether any of these ideas actually work, but it seems
<br>
like something may well work.  It is not too hard to generate a lot of
<br>
potential vulnerabilities like this.  In general you can try to patch
<br>
against each of these, but without a more rigorous method you can't
<br>
patch against all possible holes.
<br>
<p>Btw, the archives are voluminous, and this has (I think) been
<br>
discussed there before.  You might find interesting things there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This slows things down tremendously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but is much safer. In the later, you just don't build in any motivations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that go outside the internal analysis mechanisms, including no means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-awareness. In essence, design it so it just wants to understand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not to influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Understanding requires more computronium. Hence, computronium = good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hence, humans will be converted to computronium, as quickly as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a reason to think this might not happen even in an unboxed AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I understand, part of the AGI problem is getting the AI to model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself as a continuous part of the world rather than a wholly separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity (AIXI-style), so that e.g. it 'understands' that it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent its physical housing from being damaged. Might an AI that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models itself as something separate not be able to 'conceive' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding its computational resources by manipulating the _external_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world? Of course, I'm not suggesting anyone try this - I'm hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident of it - and it doesn't seem as useful as my first idea.
</em><br>
<p>If it models the external world well enough to avoid damaging itself,
<br>
there seems to great risk it would be able to model more e.g. the
<br>
effect of computronium (AIXI wouldn't make computronium, although I
<br>
can't prove it, but it would overwrite reality, although I can't prove
<br>
that either).  This level of modeling accuracy is a relatively fine
<br>
line given a sufficiently powerful AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Third, defining FAI is as bug-prone as implementing it. One small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mistake in the specification, either due to lack of foresight or human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; error (say, a typo), and it's all for nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's what CEV is for, see <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The idea is that you don't specify Friendliness content; you specify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the process to derive Friendliness content.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CEV is itself content capable of being mis-specified, but I basically agree.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, CEV is not the first part of the AI development process.  It
<br>
would catch a certain class of programmer errors, but you need more
<br>
error correcting mechanisms below it, and perhaps after it.
