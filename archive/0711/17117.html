<p>The problem with self-improvement-in-a-box is that it is a _box_ and 
<br>
that is no environment in which complexity can grow. A baby needs the 
<br>
womb. It is like trying to draw a 128-sided polygon in a pyramid, which 
<br>
clearly does not have enough points or 'complexity' to support the 
<br>
struct. 
<br>
<p>But in general I question whether or not the actual functioning of the 
<br>
brain has to be improved at the moment to reach seed-AI levels. What we 
<br>
need is more brain, not necessarily better brain, although both avenues 
<br>
of research should be pursued. Instead of emulating we could be adding 
<br>
more raw brain power and trying to interface it with the readily 
<br>
present neurons.
<br>
<p>I say this because we _are_ AI ourselves and so far not yet seed AI. So 
<br>
the way to solve this problem seems to be to add more brain, which 
<br>
seems to be the special component, not necessarily better brain, 
<br>
something that is as of yet impossible. You can cite geniuses, yes, but 
<br>
you cannot yet cite ways to replicate genius, so scientifically I am 
<br>
not sure if genius counts as an argument.
<br>
<p>Interesting post. Thank you. Please continue. :)
