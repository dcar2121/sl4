<em>&gt; &gt; There is another potential issue concerning questions about models of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI, both very likely to happen as I will explain below:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. The problem of OAI deciding if a model (created by itself or not)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is FAI, is undecidable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. it is irreducible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in both cases OAI cannot give a definite answer. Now replace OAI by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything else but a hypercomputer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are right, this would also imply that we humans CAN'T prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a specific AGI is friendly, correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>That's right as long as the human mind does not turn out to be a
<br>
hyper-computer beyond the Turing limit, or any
<br>
non-catchable-by-science super-powerful organ.
<br>
<p>These are all the logical scenarios I can figure out:
<br>
<p>(1) Any type of AGI should be capable of universal computation,
<br>
otherwise it would be potentially less powerful than any digital
<br>
computer for most tasks. Moreover, it would be decidable so any
<br>
digital computer (even us as performing at least at the first Turing
<br>
degree) would be able to know &quot;a priori&quot; any answer asked to the AGI
<br>
just by shortcutting the computation of such a silly AGI (modulo
<br>
speed-ups).
<br>
<p>Therefore:
<br>
<p>(a) under the Church-Turing thesis (CTT) (which is widely accepted as
<br>
true by evidence in its favor and total lack of evidence against) it
<br>
turns out that no Turing machine can decide in general any non-trivial
<br>
property (non-trivial in the sense of Rice's theorem) as FAI or any
<br>
other consequence of computation in general (just as anybody can never
<br>
decide or predict if a Windows machine will crash or not, although
<br>
that does not prevent Microsoft to try to minimize it as possible).
<br>
and
<br>
(b) as you point out, under computationalism (by using a kind of
<br>
strong generalized CTT), the human mind cannot prove any non-trivial
<br>
property of AGI (under the minimum requirement of being capable of
<br>
universal computation but likewise that does not prevent us for trying
<br>
to build PC's).
<br>
<p>Because (a) and (b) are widely accepted as true in Science because of
<br>
many reasons, even when esoteric approaches have been suggested (e.g.
<br>
Penrose claims about the human mind as a quantum hyper-science
<br>
hyper-computer) and consider that even the standard model of quantum
<br>
computing is Turing reducible, so even a quantum computer would fail
<br>
deciding any non-trivial property of AGI, the answer is yes, it is
<br>
very unlikely that any other AGI, OAI or XAI, including the human mind
<br>
can decide whether or not an AGI is FAI OAI or any XAI as long as the
<br>
&quot;AI&quot; par remains computationally speaking powerful enough.
<br>
<p>And even if (b) turns out to be false by hypercomputationalism, AGI
<br>
would still be essentially undecidable if it is taken to the upper
<br>
feasible degree of computation and it would be bad news even for AGI
<br>
because it could imply indirectly that perhaps intelligence is an
<br>
emergent property of a hyper-computer coded in the mind. Case that of
<br>
course I strongly disbelieve.
<br>
<p>That does not prevent us to talk long about interesting approaches of
<br>
AGI and FAI, specially how to reach it. But it is a kind of weird that
<br>
most discussions does not take into consideration these important
<br>
facts and definitely constraints that are neglected about
<br>
computational systems in general. Once being aware of all that perhaps
<br>
we could take the discussion to another level.
