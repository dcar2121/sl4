1). We already have more than enough computing power to implement
<br>
intelligence. Both our best supercomputers (BlueGene) and our best
<br>
distributed computing networks (Folding@Home) have surpassed the
<br>
PetaFLOPS level.
<br>
2). An AGI which is &quot;human equivalent&quot;, in the sense that it can match
<br>
a human's capabilities in any field, should be able to stomp us into
<br>
the dust in computer programming. Remember that, for an AGI to learn
<br>
any new task of significant complexity, it has to be able to write
<br>
hundreds of lines of new code on-the-fly.
<br>
3). An AGI need not understand the world (in any significant sense) to
<br>
do huge amounts of damage. Even regular viruses can do huge amounts of
<br>
damage; a self-modifying virus could easily destroy most of the
<br>
world's computer systems, even without general intelligence.
<br>
4). If you could figure out how to influence the world from within a
<br>
computer, a human-equivalent AGI can, by definition.
<br>
5). You are quite correct on the difficulty of timing everything, but
<br>
the AGI project will probably be known to the public, due to the lack
<br>
of government-imposed secrecy.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before there is an AI singularity, we need to 1) understand intelligence

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; traction between the AI and the rest of the world to both allow it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the world (just reading about it won't do it when you come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally new theories), and to influence it substantially; and 5)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move from the lab to the world in general (i.e., ship it). I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict how long any of those items will take. 1 and 2 could already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have happened in some lab or garage somewhere, or could take another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifty years. 3 could be trivial or have scaling problems that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurmountable (unlikely, but you never know). 4 and 5 are classic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues of science/engineering, and there are lots of examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successes and total failures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Add them all together and it could take anything from a few years to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never. Nor is it predictable how much time there will be from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial appearance of substantive AI to the singularity. It could even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be zero if the people involved don't publicize their initial successes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The analogy to the development of the atomic bomb has been brought up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before, but it's instructive from a timing perspective. Imagine being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1907 and trying to predict the appearance of the first a-bomb (analogous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to human level AI), the arms race (development of singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability), and the destruction of all life on the planet (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity). The first one happened after decades of incremental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances plus a concerted and well-funded effort to achieve it. And it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened with zero warning to the world as a whole because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerted effort happened in secret. The arms race took decades more in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fits and starts, but ultiately succeeded. And the destruction of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never happened at all.
