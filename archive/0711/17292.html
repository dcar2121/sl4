<p>You could argue that an AI may have animalistic motives because it
<br>
will have been initially designed by animals, or because the AI's with
<br>
such motives might be more successful in Darwinian competition. But
<br>
you can't legitimately argue that animalistic motives follow naturally
<br>
from intelligence. Intelligence has nothing to do with setting
<br>
motivations, only with achieving them once they are set.
<br>
<p>The term intelligence is sometimes loosely used as in the following:
<br>
<p>(a) If you're intelligent, then you won't let people order you around.
<br>
<p>What is really meant is:
<br>
<p>(b) If you're intelligent AND you don't want people ordering you
<br>
around, then you won't let people order you around.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, we could have,
<br>
<p>(c) If you're dumb AND you don't want people ordering you around, then
<br>
you will let people order you around.
<br>
<p>or,
<br>
<p>(d) If you're intelligent AND you want to please people, then you will
<br>
let people order you around.
<br>
<p>or,
<br>
<p>(e) If you're dumb AND you want to please people, then you won't let
<br>
people order you around.
<br>
<p>In other words, your willingness to let people order you around is not
<br>
necessarily dependent on your intelligence, while your ability to
<br>
bring about the appropriate state of affairs given this willingness or
<br>
lack of it is necessarily dependent on your intelligence.
