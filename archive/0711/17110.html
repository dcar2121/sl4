<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, I do think a godlike intelligence could improve on these methods,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having done that trick, could it then teach a dog to read, or tell a

</em><br>
<p>I don't think you could reprogram a dog's brain to be able to read by
<br>
speaking words at it, but I would guess that it still might be
<br>
possible through some kind of audiovisual input. It would require a
<br>
more fundamental change than teaching a human to read, because you
<br>
would have to make the dog smart enough to use language in the first
<br>
place, but you've got a moderately large lump of gray matter, and to
<br>
an extent it can be reprogrammed.
<br>
<p>If a foothold can be established whereby greater and more nuanced
<br>
control can be exerted, then the dog can be made into more than a dog.
<br>
<p>I get your point though, at some point limits must be reached. I doubt
<br>
an AI could talk a ladybug into reading.
<br>
<p>As for the joke so funny it makes people die laughing, yes, I
<br>
absolutely think this is possible.
