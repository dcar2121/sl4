</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alright, I'll give it a go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Dying of laughter is possible, and has probably occurred multiple throughout history (&lt;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/laughing.asp">http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/laughing.asp</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fatal_hilarity">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fatal_hilarity</a>&gt;).
</em><br>
<p>It's possible that the people who allegedly died of laughter actually
<br>
died of some unrelated coincidental condition, or at least had some
<br>
rare quirk in their physiology which rendered them susceptible to
<br>
fatal hilarity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) People are capable of endlessly repetitive actions, even self-injurious actions, and equally endlessly repetitive mental states (examples being common in schizophrenia and other mental disorders).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) If one begins thinking in a mental loop, and said loop involves laughter, one will continue laughing (#2).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Laughter will eventually kill you if continued indefinitely. (Obviously. Either through dehydration or whatever kills in fatal hilarity.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I suppose that continuous extreme laughter would kill you
<br>
eventually if it prevented you from eating and drinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So now all we need to know is, can an SI create a joke that will cause one to laugh at all (yes - we can, after all),
</em><br>
<p>Surely yes - and a very, very funny joke at that. But even finding a
<br>
joke that will be universally considered funny at all would be very
<br>
difficult, let alone universally lethally funny. The task would be a
<br>
lot easier if the SI were free to tailor the joke to each individual.
<br>
<p>See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World</a>'s_funniest_joke
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and could it also package in it the means to put you into a
</em><br>
schizophrenic state? This second proposition is weaker and easier to
<br>
show than whether an SI could create a lethal joke, I think, and
<br>
probably true. If people can be driven to suicide by what someone
<br>
says, surely producing a schizophrenic or paranoid loop would be even
<br>
easier?
<br>
<p>I can imagine that talking someone into killing themselves is
<br>
possible, but psychosis is a hardware problem. You can't talk someone
<br>
out of a psychotic state and you can't talk them into it either.
