<p>
There is another potential issue concerning questions about models of
<br>
AI, both very likely to happen as I will explain below:
<br>
<p>1. The problem of OAI deciding if a model (created by itself or not)
<br>
is FAI is undecidable.
<br>
or
<br>
2. it is irreducible.
<br>
<p>in both cases OAI cannot give a definite answer. Now replace OAI by
<br>
anything else but a hypercomputer.
<br>
<p>(2) implies (1) but not the other way around. i.e. (1) is the hardest
<br>
subset of the type (2).
<br>
<p>By Rice theorem we know that (1) is very likely --with measure 1-- and
<br>
(2) follows also immediately and independently of (1) since FAI is
<br>
supposed to be as sophisticated as OAI or any AI (including HI, the H
<br>
for human, under computationalism).
<br>
<p>Rice theorem says that any nontrivial property about the language
<br>
recognized by a Turing machine is undecidable. A property of Turing
<br>
machines is trivial if it holds for all partial computable functions
<br>
or for none. So asking whether or not some AI model is an FAI model is
<br>
evidently non-trivial because there is at least one Turing machine
<br>
that has the property, and at least one that hasn't.
<br>
<p>(2) says that if the system is as sophisticated (namely universal) as
<br>
the &quot;tester&quot; then there is no possible shortcut to decide a property
<br>
of the other model (running also over a universal Turing machine). (2)
<br>
can be read as a problem of computational complexity, but it does not
<br>
always follow from that field since computational complexity concerns
<br>
about time and space but not steps. This latter is considered by
<br>
another type of interesting irreducibility  to Stephen Wolfram. His
<br>
principle of computational irreducibility basically says that while
<br>
some computations admit shortcuts that allow them to be performed more
<br>
rapidly, most do not.  And by his principle of computational
<br>
equivalence, it would turn out that any descent approach to AI,
<br>
including FAI, will turn to be computationally irreducible. In other
<br>
terms, this latter principle says that there are no natural (feasible)
<br>
intermediate Turing degrees so if a computational system is sound and
<br>
computationally powerful enough it will follow immediately that it is
<br>
universal and therefore irreducible.

<em>&gt; &gt; Building a friendly AI(FAI) from a &quot;just do what I tell you&quot; AI(OAI ==

<em>&gt; &gt; obedient AI).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I know that OAI have been discussed recently in this forum but read on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before you dismiss this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To avoid any possibility of dangers we program the OAI to not perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any actions other than answering with text and diagrams(other media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like sound and video would be a possibility too). In essence what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have is a glorified calculator. I think this avoids any dangers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the AI following orders literally with unintended consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So we go to the OAI and say: &quot;Tell me how I can build a friendly AI in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a manner that I can prove and understand that it will be friendly.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The OAI will think and give you a detailed blueprint, proof, etc...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You then analyse the documents until you understand them. You could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also ask for further clarification from the OAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Someone might raise the objection: how can you be sure that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aren't any backdoors or problems with the blueprints? This will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be a problem if you come up with your own way of making a FAI. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only answer is: you have to be very careful! The point of using an OAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the same as for using a calculator: to make things easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then you build the FAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course the real thing may be a bit more complicated for example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making the OAI first generate plans for a more intelligent OAI and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on. We could have several OAI enhancement steps until we finally are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; able to make a FAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On a very basic level our current-date computers are OAIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Comments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Roland.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The OAI analyzes your instruction, concludes that it would require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of computing power to design an FAI, and then turns the planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth into computronium before spitting out the design plans.
