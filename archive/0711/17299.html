<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would &quot;ignore what the humans say&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the right solution?
</em><br>
<p>Because Mr. AI knows he is smarter than the humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about telling the humans that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a contradiction in commands and asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for clarification. 
</em><br>
<p>Because trying to explain to a human exactly why the commands are
<br>
contradictory would be like trying to explain to a dog how quantum
<br>
mechanics works. The logical solution is to have the most intelligent
<br>
person call the shots, and that would be Mr. AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is no reason for the AI to become annoyed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with humans, unless underlying circuitry for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion of getting annoyed was programmed into the AI 
</em><br>
<p>Yea right, and there is no way my radio can play Beethoven unless
<br>
somebody put a Beethoven circuit into it, and my digital camera can’t
<br>
take a beautiful picture unless somebody wrote a beauty subroutine for
<br>
it.

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; To get a vague sense of how different &quot;another mind&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be, try talking to someone who has *never* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced Western culture. Then realize that they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still 99.9% identical to you genetically. 
</em><br>
<p>You are making my case for me, you go on and on about how strange and
<br>
alien the AI will be, and then say you understand it well enough to be
<br>
certain it will be your slave for the next billion years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You see, we have these things called &quot;reason&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;logic&quot;, which we can also use to understand minds.
</em><br>
<p>And it is not illogical to ask yourself what would I do if I were in
<br>
that other mind’s place, and then repeat the exercise but this time
<br>
trying to think more like  he thinks not as you think. Obviously it will
<br>
not always work but it’s worth a try. I would even go so far to say that
<br>
the value of anthropomorphic reasoning was one of the main reasons
<br>
evolution drove us to develop a bigger brain, because the single most
<br>
important aspect in our environment is our fellow intelligent beings and
<br>
survival demands we understand them as best we can. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We've long since established that you're a believer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in anthropomorphicism, 
</em><br>
<p>Then why do you keep telling me that as if it’s a major news flash?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you actually did Google it, you would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that there was a full-scale, physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conference on AGI scheduled for March 2008 
</em><br>
<p>I did Google it and I don’t know how many pages you had to go down to
<br>
find the above (it’s not on the first 4 pages!) but no matter, I’m just
<br>
not very interested in Analytical Graphics Inc, or The American
<br>
Geological Institute, or Adjusted gross income, or Adventure Game
<br>
Interpreter, Aquent Graphics Institute, or the Association for
<br>
Geographical Information or….
