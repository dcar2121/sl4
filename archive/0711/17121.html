<p><em>&gt; If you're modeling based on functional connections between neurons,

</em><br>
<p>I find it hard to believe that full neuronal emulation would be a
<br>
lesser technical challenge than understanding higher level cognitive
<br>
functions. However, even if emulation comes first, it would provide a
<br>
research tool far superior to anything we had before in neuroscience.
<br>
You could tweak a few parameters, rewire a few connections, add or
<br>
subtract neuronal components all in software and observe the effect.
<br>
<p>My original point to Wei Dai was that if we could simulate neural
<br>
tissue doing something &quot;simple&quot; at a fine enough level, it would be a
<br>
matter of scaling to simulate neural tissue doing something &quot;complex&quot;,
<br>
since the neurons involved in abstract thought don't contain special
<br>
non-computable parts that are lacking in more pedestrian neurons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, a properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functioning neuron-by-neuron model of the brain would probably not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require molecular-level resolution.
</em><br>
<p>That is often assumed in discussions about mind uploading, but I
<br>
haven't seen any good justification for it. Tiny concentrations of
<br>
small molecules like LSD non-covalently binding to neuronal proteins
<br>
and slightly changing their conformation can cause drastic changes in
<br>
cognition. Millions of other parameters per neuron, including its
<br>
shape, its relationship to all its neighbours, the pattern of surface
<br>
receptors, the state of cytoplasmic biochemical activity involved in
<br>
making and removing neurotransmitters and receptors, and so on, are
<br>
all important even if you are just the considering a binary question
<br>
such as whether the neuron will or won't fire. How are you going to
<br>
model the behaviour of the neuron in a brain without considering
<br>
detail at this level?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, it is unclear that this will constitute a very plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means of creating a super-intelligence.  A brain-in-a-box would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how to improve its own functioning.  Even if you model our best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds down to the molecular level, no one alive today would know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to improve the intelligence via neural modifications (besides making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything uniformly faster).  The brain is a non-linear, self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizing system.  Emulation is not understanding.
</em><br>
<p>But it would enormously enhance the process of understanding. I
<br>
imagine that even crude trial and error experimentation with the
<br>
nascent software would quickly result in cognitive improvements. (The
<br>
ethical considerations in undertaking such experiments are a different
<br>
matter.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you use a non-molecular modeling approach, you will not start with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fully functioning sentience.  You will have an AI-child  that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be able to nurture into a some modicum of sentient functioning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a good possibility that it would be insane, as human neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization co-arises with embodied experience in the world.  Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children do not start out with fully-developed brains.  You would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have a detailed model of how neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work over time.  We'll get to this state of understanding one day, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even then, it's not clear that this is a good method for achieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>I'm guessing that a model above the molecular level just won't work at
<br>
all, like a half-baked computer chip won't work at all. I expect that
<br>
higher level modelling of brain function will come far earlier than
<br>
true emulation, and human-level AI will come before AI modelled on the
<br>
human brain. This has generally been the pattern in every other
<br>
endeavour where humans try to copy a biological system. Wheels come
<br>
before walking robots, and walking robots come before androids with
<br>
artificial muscle, bone, circulatory and nervous tissue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this is all assuming that we're talking about emulation.  Assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced nano-technology and advanced knowledge in molecular/cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurobiology (not molecule-by-molecule modeling capabilities) here's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an idea which I have been toying with lately:  1) Flood a person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain with nanobots.  2) Have the nanobots determine the functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties of every neuron and glial cell in the brain (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endocrine functions).  3) Have the nanobots replace each of the cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a functionally-identical synthetic equivalent.  4) Connect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synthetic brain to an artificial body or virtual body.  If you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things, we will have been limited from many of the constraints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our biology.  In addition to overcoming the fact that our brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age, we could probably speed up cognition by several orders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnitude (if your embodiment is in a virtual world that could keep-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up).  But the time-scales of developing these technologies may make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this idea irrelevant.  By the time we have these capabilities, we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have already developed an AGI that figured out a better way.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
