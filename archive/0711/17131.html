<p>
Building a friendly AI(FAI) from a &quot;just do what I tell you&quot; AI(OAI ==
<br>
obedient AI).
<br>
<p>I know that OAI have been discussed recently in this forum but read on
<br>
before you dismiss this.
<br>
To avoid any possibility of dangers we program the OAI to not perform
<br>
any actions other than answering with text and diagrams(other media
<br>
like sound and video would be a possibility too). In essence what we
<br>
would have is a glorified calculator. I think this avoids any dangers
<br>
from the AI following orders literally with unintended consequences.
<br>
<p>So we go to the OAI and say: &quot;Tell me how I can build a friendly AI in
<br>
a manner that I can prove and understand that it will be friendly.&quot;
<br>
<p>The OAI will think and give you a detailed blueprint, proof, etc...
<br>
<p>You then analyse the documents until you understand them. You could
<br>
also ask for further clarification from the OAI.
<br>
Someone might raise the objection: how can you be sure that there
<br>
aren't any backdoors or problems with the blueprints? This will also
<br>
be a problem if you come up with your own way of making a FAI. The
<br>
only answer is: you have to be very careful! The point of using an OAI
<br>
is the same as for using a calculator: to make things easier.
<br>
<p>Then you build the FAI.
<br>
<p>Of course the real thing may be a bit more complicated for example:
<br>
making the OAI first generate plans for a more intelligent OAI and so
<br>
on. We could have several OAI enhancement steps until we finally are
<br>
able to make a FAI.
<br>
<p>On a very basic level our current-date computers are OAIs.
<br>
<p>Comments?
