<p>Maybe if you asked the AI it would just tell you that it was
<br>
impossible, or only possible in a subpopulation of people (about 1%)
<br>
who have a susceptibility to developing psychosis. Maybe it would also
<br>
tell you that a reliable strategy for taking over the world given just
<br>
an Internet connection is also impossible, or computationally
<br>
intractable, or that the question of its possibility is undecidable.
<br>
It's irrational to assume that an advanced enough AI would be able to
<br>
do *anything at all*.
