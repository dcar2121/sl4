<p><em>&gt; My goal of eating sugar comes from human evolution. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will AIs also want to eat sugar because of human evolution? 
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; what are you actually trying to say? 
</em><br>
<p>Both you and Mr. AI will have one goal in common and it’s the most
<br>
important one of all, both of you will want to continue to exist. If Mr.
<br>
AI didn’t have this goal he wouldn’t be of any use to himself or to
<br>
anyone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;The AI will do it the same way you do” is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful way of thinking about how to build an AI. 
</em><br>
<p>I never said it was, I was asked how the AI tells a good goal from a bad
<br>
goal and I said it will use the same sort of mental process that we do,
<br>
and that process is called “Judgment”, and I see no reason that sort of
<br>
data crunching can only be produced by meat. I mean, what other answer
<br>
could I give, did you expect me to give detailed blueprints for an AI?
<br>
<p>I think some on this list are guilty of meatism, but I have a dream.
<br>
Silicon or meat I have a dream that one day we will live in a nation
<br>
where intelligent beings are not judged by the sort of matter in their
<br>
brains but by the content of their character. I have a dream, for I have
<br>
seen the Promised Land! Hallelujah!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't know how humans work.
</em><br>
<p>A keen grasp of the obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what's up with &quot;his&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>What pronoun would you prefer? I hope you’re not one of those people who
<br>
insist I say “he or she” all the time.
