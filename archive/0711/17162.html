Legg proved in <a href="http://www.vetta.org/documents/IDSIA-12-06-1.pdf">http://www.vetta.org/documents/IDSIA-12-06-1.pdf</a> that there is
<br>
a (fairly small) level of complexity beyond which theorems cannot be proved,
<br>
i.e. Godel incompleteness in ubiquitous.  Likewise, Wolfram's principle of
<br>
computational equivalence (
<br>
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipleofComputationalEquivalence.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipleofComputationalEquivalence.html</a> ) argues
<br>
empirically that beyond some (fairly small) level of complexity, that all
<br>
processes are equivalent to universal Turing machines (thus, the halting
<br>
problem is undecidable).  Are these assertions equivalent, in the same sense
<br>
that Godel incompleteness is equivalent to the halting problem?  Did Legg
<br>
prove Wolfram's assertion?  It seems that Legg and Wolfram arrived at the same
<br>
conclusion independently, as neither cites the other's work as far as I know.
<br>
<p>The question came up while I was considering theoretical lower bounds on the
<br>
complexity of self improving intelligence.  It seems to me that Turing
<br>
completeness would be sufficient, possibly a few hundred bits.  This would be
<br>
a quicker (but possibly more dangerous) path to a singularity than superhuman
<br>
intelligence.  I am trying to understand the risk, and why it has happened
<br>
only once in the last 3 billion years.
