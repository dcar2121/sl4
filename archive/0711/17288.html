<em>&gt; &gt; Lets say parts of the AI develop to use the natural response times of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the components for timing, I have seen things suggesting that neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are used in this fashion in brains (it might be a lot more efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than centralised clocks).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This level of hardware dependency would be utterly unnecessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undesirable, and unlikely to arise.
</em><br>
<p>So why did it arise in the brain? Perhaps there is some usefulness to
<br>
this arrangement that you are not seeing, because your theory of
<br>
intelligence is not complete, or perhaps not. My point was until you
<br>
have a complete and preferably constructive theory of intelligence,
<br>
you cannot completely dismiss this potential.
<br>
<p>I can go into detail why I think decentralised/constructable timing
<br>
circuits is a good idea for intelligence, but that is more suited to
<br>
the AGI list, or off-list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intelligence can find much cleaner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions, especially with better hardware than neurons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So then speed up the hardware may throw the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; timings out of sync, if the memory/logic is ported blindly. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; similarly for speeding up an algorithm might throw it out of sync with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other algorithms. An AI would have to understand itself completely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get speed up from hardware speed increases in the trivial fashion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumed in the exponential growth of a singleton.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does software (except poorly designed games, or other UI-intensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software, with hardcoded timing loops) break when run on a faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system? I don't think so. An intelligence strongly dependent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodiment, like a human, would have some problems because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desynchronization from the world (similar to the timing loop thing),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but an AI needn't be built that way. (And a human could be speeded up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just fine if given a rich virtual environment running at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed.)
</em><br>
<p>I think it is a possibility all intelligence needs to be strongly
<br>
dependent upon embodiment. You cannot maintain that an intelligence
<br>
running on purely faster hardware is more intelligent than one running
<br>
on slower hardware, without saying intelligence is dependent upon
<br>
embodiment.
<br>
<p>With regards to putting humans in a virtual world.This would place a
<br>
barrier between the human and culture/reality, reducing the humans
<br>
ability to get information it would need to self-improve. You cannot
<br>
get new information about the nature of the world from a simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I do not seek to convince you of this. Just to show your virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certainty is misplaced, unless you can prove that intelligence does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not need this sort of system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't. Generalize from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/tom/?p=19">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/tom/?p=19</a> : an upload in VR can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run arbitrarily fast and produce the same result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>1) We have no Turing Machines, merely things that would be Turing
<br>
Machines if we had infinite memory. So you would have to show that a
<br>
QED simulation of an AI would take less resources than we have/will
<br>
have in the next hundred years.
<br>
<p>2) It depends how you define, &quot;solve all the problems&quot;. Due to
<br>
embodiment there are some problems a simulated AI couldn't solve in
<br>
the same fashion as the un-simulated human. E.g. riding a bike through
<br>
an unwired tunnel (at least with current technology), due to energy
<br>
constraints (no super computers on a bike) and inability to receive
<br>
radio signals.
