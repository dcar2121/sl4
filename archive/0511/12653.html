<em>&gt; In fact, as Michael Shermer points out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent people can be among the most intractable because they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend erroneous beliefs with such alacrity.
</em><br>
<p>I know that my IQ is not nearly as high as Langan's.  I have no intention of 
<br>
measuring my IQ and would rather not know what it is.  I do not claim to be 
<br>
a genius, and I do not believe that I am less intelligent than most people. 
<br>
I know that I am smart enough to think about and produce ideas.  Better 
<br>
knowledge produces better ideas, and knowledge will only increase in time. 
<br>
I am not talking about knowledge that doesn't deviate from the accepted 
<br>
norm, but knowledge that is true and accurate.  But I have had similar 
<br>
problems with some of my ideas (Erroneous beliefs).  I have little 
<br>
experience with knowing if these ideas that I think about are good or bad, 
<br>
and I lack the knowledge to produce consistent meaningful ideas.  Lack of 
<br>
knowledge does allow a person to produce more ideas which vary greatly from 
<br>
the accepted norm.  This may allow good ideas to be produced (As many famous 
<br>
people have done in the past), but all I have gotten out of this is 
<br>
overconfidence and then embarassment.
<br>
<p>For example, if I say that morality is in part determined by intelligence, I 
<br>
risk enduring relentless persecution by ever-rightous self-proclaimed 
<br>
geniuses.  I don't -know- that my idea is correct, but I have a good reason 
<br>
in my mind for considering the possibility.  I could be lacking the one 
<br>
piece of knowledge that proves the idea wrong, but I do not believe this 
<br>
piece of knowledge exists, because these ideas are no more than philosophy 
<br>
until experiments commence and hard facts can be collected (not possible 
<br>
today with our current tools).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the 'norm' ideas could be incorrect, and before I can 
<br>
accept the outcome of myself agreeing to this norm and to the norm's 
<br>
supporters, I must either prove the unprovable, persuade the norm's 
<br>
supporters to agree with my ideas, or yield myself to the philosophical 
<br>
norm.  Both parties believe in their ideas, and both parties have just cause 
<br>
to believe these ideas.  It is this confusion that has vexed me recently. 
<br>
If the Singularity were not so important to the survival of myself and 
<br>
everyone on this planet, I would withdraw myself from this type of community 
<br>
for these reasons.  At this point, I refuse to rapidly read stacks of books 
<br>
which contain information that cannot reasonably be veried to be true.  If I 
<br>
assumed that all the read information was true, I would have no problem 
<br>
reading stacks and stacks of books as quickly as some others on this list 
<br>
have done.  I am not a blind follower, but I must devote myself to the 
<br>
Singularity.  I hope to make some sense out of this mess I got myself into.
