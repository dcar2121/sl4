<p>Well, no, what you say is not entirely accurate.  Stravinsky was an
<br>
abysmal law student when he encountered Rimsky-Korsakov at the age of
<br>
20, and Rimsky told him that maybe he should take some lessons, but 
<br>
thought his stuff was not that great and discouraged him from a career 
<br>
as a musician.
<br>
<p>Newton's early period at Cambridge was in many ways pretty banal.
<br>
<p>Einstein was running hot and cold all the time ... he was the poster boy 
<br>
for the type of person who looks mediocre on a standard test.
<br>
<p>As for Leonardo, we don't know much about his early talent in respect of 
<br>
the kind of thing that would appear on an SAT.  I mean, can you get a 
<br>
99.9th percentile on SAT if you are good at drawing and painting ......? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never mind the fact that Leonardo couldn't finish most of the 
<br>
projects that he started.
