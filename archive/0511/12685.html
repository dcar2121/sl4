/* Updated Metaphysics (as described by
<br>
* philosphers for the past few millenia).
<br>
*
<br>
* Also, made room for physics and evolution,
<br>
* and made sure to leave plenty of room for failure of the theory.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>What is &quot;Metaphysics&quot;?
<br>
<p>Metaphysics and physics are two closely related terms. Physics is our 
<br>
description of a causal process from which our intelligence was evolved, and 
<br>
is currently maintained in, which are processes independent of a purposeful 
<br>
interpretation. Metaphysics is our description of causal processes that are 
<br>
with purpose or design. A metaphysical description might say something like 
<br>
&quot;That tree tried to kill me!&quot; after a large branch falls unexpectedly out of 
<br>
a tree beneath which we are standing. A physical description would be &quot;That 
<br>
branch fell and missed my head by inches!&quot;
<br>
<p>Metaphysics is not special to intelligent entities such as humans. All goal 
<br>
behaving physical processes are metaphysical. What IS special to intelligent 
<br>
entities is the ability to percieve reality WITHOUT any necessary relation 
<br>
to a goal, such that we may call ourselves objective, rather than 
<br>
subjective; such that we can say: &quot;THIS is true, independent of metaphysical 
<br>
perceptions&quot;.
<br>
<p>The ability that separates a nonintelligent process from an intelligent one 
<br>
is that the process has the ability to percieve *causal relationships* about 
<br>
reality independent of any goal. Furthermore, this is how humans, unlike 
<br>
animals, which can only percieve the metaphysical, can understand what the 
<br>
world is REALLY like, regardless of our desires. That is, we can take the 
<br>
&quot;meta&quot; out of metaphysics.
<br>
<p>Evolution is real. Evolution is how we describe the physical process which 
<br>
is *reality* and their corresponding metaphysical processes. Evolution shows 
<br>
that humans did not descend from a greater metaphysical process, but rather, 
<br>
from the physical processes themselves, upon which metaphysical procesess 
<br>
emerge. This is contrary to the religious view that human design, and in 
<br>
fact, any structure of reality that exists at all, was designed by an 
<br>
intelligent process. By definition, evolution is an unintelligent process. 
<br>
It is a metaphysical process that has indirect goal based behavior. That is, 
<br>
simply that we recognize that time exists. Therefore, any process which 
<br>
exists for a long amount of time, obviously is implicitly CAPABLE of 
<br>
existing for that amount of time, and this holds for physical and 
<br>
metaphysical processes. This fact in and of itself provides a psuedo 
<br>
goal-based metaphysical process to emerge. This process is called evolution. 
<br>
Structures in reality mutate, and those that are better at lasting longer, 
<br>
by definition, last longer. Structures in reality that are life-based (or 
<br>
virus) tend to multiply. Those that multiply more have a better chance of 
<br>
mutation, and thus a better chance of improving the time length of the 
<br>
metaphysical &quot;species&quot;.
<br>
<p>All metaphysical processes exist because they are composed of a very complex 
<br>
evolved combination of basic physical processes (for example, the massive 
<br>
multicellular extremely intricate and complicated physical process called a 
<br>
cockroach). No metaphysical process *causes* anything, rather, a 
<br>
metaphysical process is only a description of a physical process, and any 
<br>
physical process that accepts this description in it's functional parameters 
<br>
can be called &quot;life&quot; (such that metaphysical concepts can be applied to 
<br>
physical concepts, such as bodily action). As intelligent processes, we 
<br>
humans have the ability to percieve metaphysical processes, like all 
<br>
animals, (for example: EATING) However, we also can percieve a metaphysical 
<br>
process (the apple falling from the tree) without any necessary metaphysical 
<br>
attachment (WHY? NO, REALLY, EXACTLY WHY DID THAT HAPPEN?). This takes the 
<br>
form of meta-meta-physics. Some philosophers in the past have amused 
<br>
themselves at the idea that perhaps there is a completely general realm of 
<br>
true metaphysics. The answer is: we don't know. However, if we pay 
<br>
attention, we will see where physical and metaphysical processes intersect, 
<br>
and we can then postulate with specific degree of probability whether or not 
<br>
the metaphysical process is possible (to make true), or probable (to happen 
<br>
independent of desire).
<br>
<p>The Law of Evolution
<br>
<p>The Law of Evolution states that any physical or metaphysical process that 
<br>
exists only exists until it stops existing, at which point it is no longer 
<br>
in existence.
<br>
<p>This allows for those things that exist longer to exist longer, such as an 
<br>
individual physical human, or a metaphysical species called dodo bird, or an 
<br>
abstract [metaphysical] concept like &quot;the Singularity&quot;, *if and only if* a 
<br>
metaphysical process creates such a physical process as to ensure its 
<br>
metaphysical continuation.
<br>
<p>A person is an active intelligent metaphysical process, while at the same 
<br>
time being an active intelligent physical process. Humans are percieving 
<br>
metaphysical proceses and physical processes all the time, and translating 
<br>
extensively between the two.
