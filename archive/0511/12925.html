<em>&gt; Anyway, Mark Geddes, since you wonder how Eliezer would have done on

</em><br>
<p>The following is quite an interesting opinion, and it is, of course, 
<br>
your own - why preface it by attributing it to me?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have said something like &quot;there is a minute chance that someone working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on such a puzzle is smart enough that they could contribute to a seed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, but no chance at all that someone working on such a puzzle rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than on something useful has the minimal level of ethical seriousness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that must be demanded from a seed AI researcher so it isn't worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recruiting here.&quot;  As a serious seed AI researcher, the possibility that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might be a good idea to spend his time working the puzzle would never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even have occurred to him.  People pay attention to Eliezer not because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's an ex-prodigy and supposed &quot;super-genius&quot;, but because he has spent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his time effectively to develop certain ideas with more clarity than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else has.  Your ability to make accurate one sentence guesses, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without the ability to explain your reasoning, is just not interesting, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if it does result in your scoring higher on some IQ tests than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer or anyone else would.  Maybe the puzzle you were talking about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was &quot;the ultimate IQ test&quot; but that is precisely why it is NOT similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to FAI theory.  Unlike the answers on an IQ test, &quot;AI doesn't fit on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; t-shirt&quot;, and for FAI, which can't be solved with guess work, trial, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error, even correct intuitive answers which cannot be explained are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little better than worthless.
</em><br>
<p>I'd never tell a prospective seed AI programmer to stop playing 
<br>
mathematical games, though I don't know if the book Geddes referenced 
<br>
was a game of that type.  I was first captured into this gig - it seems 
<br>
inevitable in hindsight, yet that itself may be illusion - when I pulled 
<br>
Vernor Vinge's &quot;True Names and Other Dangers&quot; randomly off a library 
<br>
shelf of SF paperbacks.  Several important ideas came to me while I was 
<br>
pursuing my time-wasting hobby of trying unsuccessfully to write science 
<br>
fiction.  Inspiration lurks in odd places.
