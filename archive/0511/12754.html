It seems likely that genetic structure strongly biases the neocortex towards 
<br>
certain types of modality.  Cachalots have much more neocortex than we do, 
<br>
but don't do a lot of complex social organization.  Female Elephants have 
<br>
chimp-level encephalization quotients, complex social groups of size similar 
<br>
to those of hunter gatherers, fine manipulators, tool use, long lives, and 
<br>
human sized or larger neocortexes, but in the million years or so of their 
<br>
existance (20 million if Mastadons count) they have not developed any 
<br>
culture comparable to ours and specifically have not domesticated other 
<br>
animals or adapted to a range of climates to spread globally.  They are also 
<br>
ineffective in defending themselves against human hunter-gatherers.

<p>What is known of savants also suggests the presence of non-standard 
<br>
cognitive strong attractors.  Savants typically excell in one or a few of a 
<br>
standard set of skills.  Kim Peek appears to provide confirmation of the 
<br>
viability of high-speed textual input using the visual cortex.  I suspect 
<br>
that most people read faster than the effective bandwidth for auditory 
<br>
input, hence the important of suppressing subvocalization to maximizing 
<br>
reading speed.
