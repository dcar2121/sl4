</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I think I recognized the necessity of this when I discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintaining the synchronicity of dispersed brain modules that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute to consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The threshold in this case isn't the preserved percentage of the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brain structure but whether the whole system comprised of old and new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; substrate lost, at any point, the potential to generate single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mind-producing activity of matter in space-time. In the first case, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; system lost that potential (died) while, in the second case, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; existed at all times during the transfer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly, we lose a great deal of neural activity nuring NREM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sleep -- a period of time when we also lack consciousness.  According
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your premise, we would be a new consciousness each day, because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose single-consciosness-activity every night (or during anesthesia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coma, etc.).  Clearly, I think that I am the same, continuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness as I was yesterday and the day before, so I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's an especially relevant criterion.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, mind transfers are usually debated in terms of brain 
<br>
structure and preservation of continuity of consciousness. In reality these 
<br>
concepts are somewhat marginal to what really matters for a truly successful 
<br>
uploading procedure. What really matters, IMO, is a &quot;mind-producing activity 
<br>
of matter in space-time,&quot; which I've defined reluctantly as &quot;presence&quot; to 
<br>
bring more clarity to these discussions. Presence shouldn't be mistaken for 
<br>
consciousness which is merely a subset of &quot;mind-producing activity of matter 
<br>
in space-time.&quot; Just because people sometimes lose consciousness doesn't 
<br>
mean their brains stop working. In other words, I can be present without 
<br>
being conscious. It really doesn't matter to the success of uploading 
<br>
procedure if subjects maintain their consciousness during transfer. 
<br>
Successful uploading is not about preserving brain structure either. All 
<br>
that matters is preservation of the original presence by maintaining 
<br>
potential for that presence. Once uploading procedure manages to preserve 
<br>
the original presence the other things pretty much take care of themselves.
<br>
<p>So yes, I agree that consciousness isn't a relevant criterion by which we 
<br>
should judge whether the true essence of &quot;I am&quot; was transferred during 
<br>
uploading. I lose and regain consciousness all the time but I remain the 
<br>
same day after day, year by year because I've never lost my original 
<br>
presence.
