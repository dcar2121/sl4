The obvious response to this is that we store some memories even while 
<br>
asleep, and that dreaming people who are woken report consciousness of 
<br>
that dreaming. There is a continuity to our *minds* even if we suffer 
<br>
from forgetfullness while asleep.
<br>
<p>It seems just as valid to look at identity in terms of an idealisation, 
<br>
historically, through memory, as something which supervenes on 
<br>
subsystems, or as an Empty concept (i.e. identity is just a convenient 
<br>
description for all our subsystems, and exists in a relational sense). I 
<br>
prefer the final way.
<br>
<p>Identity, for me, can cope with the discontinuities of sleep and 
<br>
personality change. It is a linguistic term, and people don't have 
<br>
trouble understanding that a person can change drastically, yet still 
<br>
refer to them by the same name. Identity has many forms, only some of 
<br>
which are affected by discontinuity.
<br>
<p>Perhaps it's better to say that human identity isn't damaged by 
<br>
discontinuity. Perhaps the question is what kinds of discontinuity 
<br>
constitute &quot;harm&quot; to the individual, and which do not?
<br>
<p>Abstractly, I can imagine other kinds of existence where these concepts 
<br>
are, shall we say, stretched? They are interesting questions, but I 
<br>
don't think they disprove the validity of using the term &quot;identity&quot;.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
