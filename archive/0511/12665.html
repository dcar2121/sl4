I think you have missed the point. It's not that Einstein was an idiot, 
<br>
and thus could not understand maths as well as most people. The point 
<br>
was that he was very smart, and problems were all the more complex and 
<br>
baffling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;seem to be an obvious correlation between IQ and atheism, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know if it's &quot;obvious&quot;, but it is documented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;See <a href="http://www.objectivethought.com/atheism/iqstats.html">http://www.objectivethought.com/atheism/iqstats.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a review.  From my brief perusal of that page, it appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the mean IQ score of atheists is over one standard deviation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above the mean score of &quot;believers&quot;, with the result that believers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dominate the IQ under 110 region (around 90% believers at IQ=100),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while atheists and agnostics dominate the IQ range of 140 and up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(around 80-90% atheists-agnostics at IQ&gt;140).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I partially disagree with your conclusions. The page, and let's just 
<br>
assume its numbers are correct for the moment, does not show that simply.
<br>
<p>For one thing, many of the tests studied &quot;students&quot;. This is not very 
<br>
helpful, as I have already said that I understand there to be a 
<br>
correlation between academia and atheism. If &quot;students&quot; means university 
<br>
students, than an additional correlation within that set between IQ and 
<br>
atheism does not show the link as clearly as I would like. I think you 
<br>
need a broader cross-section.
<br>
<p>Regardless, perhaps it is a real phenomena within those circles, which 
<br>
is in itself interesting.
<br>
<p>I believe that the correlation appears to be between liberalism and IQ. 
<br>
I read more sentences which were describing &quot;religious conservatism&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;orthodox beliefs&quot; and &quot;liberalism&quot; or &quot;religious liberalism&quot;. I don't 
<br>
know whether it's right to say that's a link between IQ and atheism or not.
<br>
<p>Without reading each study (and I don't intend to), I think it's unclear 
<br>
whether it's merely strict adherence to dogma which poses a problem for 
<br>
the intelligent, or the belief in something spiritual itself. A fuller 
<br>
analysis of that idea would make very interesting reading!
<br>
<p>But you would really need to account for a number of other possible 
<br>
links before making strident claims about the correlation. Perhaps such 
<br>
things were done in each study, but I retain a degree of scepticism.
<br>
<p>The strongest claim was made thus: &quot;The mean test scores of 
<br>
non-believers was 119 points, and for believers it was 100&quot;. This shows 
<br>
no small difference between the two. I'm frankly amazed that there could 
<br>
be such a large difference. I accept that the study may have found such, 
<br>
but extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof...
<br>
<p>I would love to see the results of studies in non-US countries which 
<br>
have a broader base of atheists.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
