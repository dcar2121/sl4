<p><p>On what basis can you possibly justify saying that?
<br>
It seems to me that the war in Iraq was drastically better than the 
<br>
alternative.
<br>
<p>1. Ultimately less death
<br>
2. ultimately less pain
<br>
3. more fairness in government
<br>
4. freer people
<br>
5. more knowledgable people (more, cheaper, technology and communication)
<br>
etc, etc, etc
<br>
<p>Or maybe you thought I meant, war in general = good. I don't know if what I 
<br>
was writing was just completely incomprehensible or what. My point was that 
<br>
those society restructuring events, such as war and nation building, had 
<br>
extremely powerful effects, and I also said the United States used this in a 
<br>
particularly beneficial manner (at least, from what I see, in Iraq. The 
<br>
epitome of the opposite being our blunder in Vietnam).
<br>
<p>Furthermore, does the (imo presumptuous) disagreement with my ultimate 
<br>
&quot;side-note&quot; conclusion completely nullify everything in the essay? War = 
<br>
good really doesn't relate at all to the essay, except where War = good. The 
<br>
point about war was simply that it is a powerful society restructuring 
<br>
event, with powerfully beneficial potential (but only where 
<br>
[death+!war]&gt;[death+war]). *Dramatic society restructuring is most difficult 
<br>
in those societies in which war is justified, in any way short of actual 
<br>
war.*
<br>
<p>Four people dismissed the entire idea as if it were the most distasteful 
<br>
concept they had ever witnessed, and that confuses me more than anything. If 
<br>
the list won't stand for it, y'all at least message me offlist to explain 
<br>
why everything I said was so completely ridiculous.
<br>
<p>I'm confused.
