<p><p>For historical data in absolute terms, that variance is almost below  
<br>
the noise floor.  It may be significant to you, but that opinion is  
<br>
pretty irrelevant in the context of what typical variances and rates  
<br>
of change have looked like over the last million years.  The climate  
<br>
does not ask your opinion of whether or not a variance is  
<br>
&quot;significant&quot; before doing what it does.  I have no problem with the  
<br>
idea that humans are significantly contributing to the variance, but  
<br>
I do have a problem with the idea that this variance is extraordinary  
<br>
when there is ample evidence that this variance is well within normal  
<br>
parameters for the system that is earth.  From a systems perspective,  
<br>
the global climate really does not care where the variances come  
<br>
from, and this particular variance is not extraordinary.  I would be  
<br>
far more worried about extreme variances that happen naturally with  
<br>
moderate frequency.
<br>
<p>My issue, illustrated in your response, is that many people have  
<br>
strong opinions on this matter but they are frequently based on  
<br>
intuitions that are divorced from the context of the system those  
<br>
opinions are nominally about.  I really don't have an opinion or  
<br>
prediction about climate change, but I've made a lot of observations  
<br>
that most self-styled definitive opinions are of highly suspect  
<br>
quality based on the evidence we currently have.
<br>
<p><p>That said, why exactly is all this even important?  Solving problems  
<br>
a hundred years in the future today seems like a fruitless use of  
<br>
resources.  Even the most catastrophic climate shifts in the  
<br>
historical record took a couple decades to occur, and those were a  
<br>
couple orders of magnitude more extreme than the variances we've seen  
<br>
over the last century.
