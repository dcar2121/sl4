With respect to lucid dreaming, I find it easiest to talk about it and think about it as the last thing I do before I sleep.  Somewhere in my mind something clicks while I'm asleep then I get to play God over a very good virtual reality.  The problem is becoming too aware -- to the point were you may awaken.  Realizing I'm asleep,(though in complete control), seems to help me keep focus.  I developed enough focus over the years to perform dream re-entry and pick up where I had left off before I awakened.  It's some strange gift which is probably just a coping mechanism.  My I.Q. averages in the 130's, I have several degrees and certifications in different fields but I have yet to find a single project to concentrate fully on which helps me realize that I'm not that smart after at all.

&quot;Winning a Nobel Prize is no big deal, but
<br>
winning it with an IQ of 124 is really

something.&quot;
<br>
--Richard Feynman
<br>
The earlier post about Einstein and his
<br>
blackboard hit the nail on the head: he achieved
<br>
relativity theory by obsessing about it &quot;like a
<br>
dog worrying a bone.&quot; It's what you do with what
<br>
you have.
<br>
By comparison, former NH governor and White House
<br>
chief of staff John Sununu reputedly has a 180 IQ
<br>
and eidetic memory (both of which I would kill
<br>
for) but somehow managed to be an utter fool in
<br>
my estimation (among other follies, circa 1990 he
<br>
ran a climate sim on his home computer, which
<br>
couldn't have been much better than a 386 with a
<br>
couple megs of ram, and decided global warming
<br>
wasn't for real! When real climatologists running
<br>
supercomputers weren't willing to place total
<br>
faith in their sims.) If there's a better parable
<br>
illustrating that IQ-isn't-everything, I'd like
<br>
to hear it.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, a number tells you nothing about
<br>
what sort of mental skills a person might have:
<br>
there's a guy I work with at the post office;
<br>
once I was telling him about lucid dreaming,
<br>
which Stephen LaBerge had recently proved in the
<br>
sleep lab to be a real phenomenon. Very few
<br>
people can do it regularly (I only managed it
<br>
briefly, once or twice; it was astounding! Like
<br>
the best virtual reality you could have. In lucid
<br>
dreams, you really can fly.) Tad, my co-worker,
<br>
said &quot;Oh, you mean awake dreams? I have those all
<br>
the time! You have to be careful, if you get too
<br>
excited you wake up.&quot; I told him that was like
<br>
being able to throw a baseball at 100 miles an
<br>
hour, and not realizing that's special.
