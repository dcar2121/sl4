<em>&gt;The Mensa (International) web site clearly states that the

<em>&gt;somewhere that on the 50th anniversary, one of the founders said that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's backed up by lots of commentary in the (American) Mensa

The Australian website is in concordance with that. I would not 
<br>
interpret &quot;identify and foster human intelligence&quot; as &quot;Mensa states that 
<br>
it wants to provide a forum where intelligent people can work together 
<br>
to solve the world's problems.&quot; In Australia, the practical emphases 
<br>
that relate to the indentification and fostering of human intelligence 
<br>
are encouraging appropriate schooling, dealing with social issues, 
<br>
helping young and clever people to fulfil their goals, provide the 
<br>
mailing lists for discussion amongst the group, etc etc.
<br>
<p>It is a far cry from trying to bring about wider change, or solving the 
<br>
world's problems. They certainly do not relate to science research, 
<br>
although the exploits of any individuals are always met with interest, 
<br>
and usually result in some interesting magazine articles and conversations.
<br>
<p>I realise that the Australian experience might be different from that of 
<br>
the U.S., where I understand the organisation has many more members, and 
<br>
possible also has a different character.  However, I don't believe that 
<br>
I have been misleading or even incorrect in my presentation of 
<br>
Australian Mensa.
<br>
<p>There is probably room for both of us to be correct. Certainly it is a 
<br>
regular occurence than mensans will wish to become a part of an action 
<br>
group working towards goal X, where goal X is not one of the particular 
<br>
goals currently being pursued by the committee on behalf of the 
<br>
organisation.
<br>
<p>However, such a specificity of goals tends to isolate those individuals, 
<br>
and these endeavours seldom get off the ground. Mensa Australia lacks 
<br>
the funding to become a research institution, and an IQ in the 98th 
<br>
percentile is simply not the major prerequisite for success in such an 
<br>
area.
<br>
<p>As you say, people who are interested in technological development tend 
<br>
to pursue that in the context of industry groups. Since IQ is very 
<br>
useful generally, the leaders in these areas will often be very smart 
<br>
also. The interesting thing about Mensa is precisely the weakness you 
<br>
identified -- its lack of consensus, its variety of membership and its 
<br>
complexity.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
