</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; uploading procedure.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.  That seems to be the sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument made by people who claim the rest of us just don't have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced enough conception of consciousness.  I think my conception is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; than anyone on this list, along with a strong background in psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and philosophy of mind. I understand the illusion of self and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness can be a dynamic phenomenon.
</em><br>
<p>At no point during this discussion I claimed to know how consciousness
<br>
works. I'm actually not interested in that. My argument is entirely about
<br>
the nature of being. Using simple logic and facts, I try to emphasize
<br>
something that should become obvious in retrospect. In this argument, I
<br>
treat mind as a black box. The only neuroscience piece of knowledge I use
<br>
which is sufficient to prove my point is that this black box consists of
<br>
some matter flowing in space and time, regardless of the way *how* it
<br>
happens. This is the only assumption I make and I think it's a solid one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the fact remains that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you obliterate all of the physically connected substrate underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particular mind-agent, it ceases to exist.  That's still a problem.
</em><br>
<p>It's true. Mind cannot exist without matter in our universe, but, in my
<br>
view, it's important to separate the concept of matter from the activity of
<br>
matter because it is quite obvious to me that it is the activity that
<br>
produces the mind, not the matter itself, even though matter is a necessary
<br>
medium for that activity to arise. It's the most important point I have to
<br>
make.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; It really doesn't matter to the success of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; procedure if subjects maintain their consciousness during transfer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Successful uploading is not about preserving brain structure either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand how.  If you don't transfer activity (subject is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not conscious), and you don't transfer substrate (structure is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserved), then how does a particular mind still exist?
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstood me here. The activity is actually *the* thing I would like
<br>
to transfer. This mind activity isn't required to have whatever sub-activity
<br>
that produces consciousness &quot;running&quot; during transfer. As long as this
<br>
instance of activity of matter in space and time is of mind-type, it's good
<br>
enough for me.
<br>
<p>As far as the brain structure goes, let me say something about mind
<br>
structure. I view mind structure as a pattern or shape of mind-producing
<br>
activity. It doesn't really matter whether I implement my mind structure 
<br>
using neurons, silicon or something else entirely or what configurations of 
<br>
wetware/hardware I choose to accomplish
<br>
that. As long as I am able to transfer and support that same shape, how I 
<br>
implement that should be irrelevant to the nature of my being.
<br>
<p>To answer your question, ultimately, I would like to be concerned with bare
<br>
activity and nothing else. But since activity cannot exist without matter in
<br>
space and time, mind transfer must happen through the medium of matter in
<br>
space and time as well to maintain that activity throughout the procedure.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; All
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that matters is preservation of the original presence by maintaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; potential for that presence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is vague language.  You defined &quot;presence&quot; as mind-producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity, but you said that that activity doesn't need to exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the uploading process.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are mixing up presence with consciousness here. They are quite
<br>
different. I see presence as the collection of all activities that cause a
<br>
mind, and consciousness as a subset of presence. Mind-producing
<br>
activity must necessarily exist throughout the uploading process.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Once uploading procedure manages to preserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the original presence the other things pretty much take care of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So yes, I agree that consciousness isn't a relevant criterion by which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should judge whether the true essence of &quot;I am&quot; was transferred during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; uploading. I lose and regain consciousness all the time but I remain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same day after day, year by year because I've never lost my original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; presence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You never lost your original brain structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Martin
</em><br>
<p>I never lost my potential for presence that is being stored in my brain
<br>
structure.
