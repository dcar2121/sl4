<p>
Having spent some time in the hospital this weekend waiting for my
<br>
daughter to be born, I was finally presented with enough downtime to
<br>
read Jeff Hawkins' &quot;On Intelligence&quot;, and while I disagree with his
<br>
dismissal of singularity and grey goo scenarios at the end, I was struck
<br>
by the hitherto unknown to me possibility of sensory substitution.
<br>
(Generic Description--&gt;
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010901/bob14.asp">http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010901/bob14.asp</a>) This, coupled
<br>
with watching a new baby experience the world for the first time got me
<br>
thinking about senses generally and the Codic Modality mentioned in CFAI
<br>
specifically.
<br>
Since the human neocortex appears to be non-discriminatory when it comes
<br>
to processing data streams, could a human substitute an arbitrary
<br>
sensory stream (I.e. a codic stream, or an echolocation stream if you've
<br>
ever wondered what it's like to be a bat) in such a way as to have an
<br>
intuitive sense of code executing? Would this make for a better
<br>
programmer? What data stream would be necessary to achieve this level of
<br>
codic understanding?
<br>
Separately, would it be possible to use this input stream as, say, a
<br>
textual modality for the high speed input of text data? Currently we use
<br>
our visual modality for this which, to my mind, is killing flies with
<br>
sledgehammers. Since the high resolution of the eyes while looking at a
<br>
page or screen of textual data is severely under-utilized, could raw
<br>
text data be streamed in on another channel without the addition of so
<br>
much extraneous white space? I realize that it would be akin to learning
<br>
another language at first, but to my mind, once it was aquired, probably
<br>
in conjunction with either visual reading or auditory listening, it
<br>
could be sped up beyond what either of the other methods are capable of.
<br>
<p><p>As a side note, it appears that the Wiki has been spammed. Unless of
<br>
course Viagra is suddenly an existential risk.
