<p>
The Feynman, Watson, and Crick IQ numbers are obviously bogus.  Watson was a 
<br>
freakin Child prodigy, and Feynman was a Jew at MIT back when they had 
<br>
quotas about accepting too many Jews, and back when IQ tests were still 
<br>
primitive.  Even if the number isn't a simple lie, you can bet that the MIT 
<br>
admissions committee did a better job measuring 'g' than the tests of the 
<br>
day.  As for Crick, have you actually read him?  Simply the quality of vocab 
<br>
and grammar would put him well above a 115 on tests which are substantially 
<br>
tests of vocab.  Obviously, he was a physicist, which demands (as in getting 
<br>
through a single physics course with decent grades is impossible 
<br>
without)quant and spacial skills which would lead to better performance on 
<br>
those sections of most tests.  People like to make up factoids.
<br>
<p>Anyway, Mark Geddes, since you wonder how Eliezer would have done on that 
<br>
puzzle, I'll tell you exactly how he would have done.  He would have said 
<br>
something like &quot;there is a minute chance that someone working on such a 
<br>
puzzle is smart enough that they could contribute to a seed AI, but no 
<br>
chance at all that someone working on such a puzzle rather than on something 
<br>
useful has the minimal level of ethical seriousness that must be demanded 
<br>
from a seed AI researcher so it isn't worth recruiting here.&quot;  As a serious 
<br>
seed AI researcher, the possibility that it might be a good idea to spend 
<br>
his time working the puzzle would never even have occurred to him.  People 
<br>
pay attention to Eliezer not because he's an ex-prodigy and supposed 
<br>
&quot;super-genius&quot;, but because he has spent his time effectively to develop 
<br>
certain ideas with more clarity than anyone else has.  Your ability to make 
<br>
accurate one sentence guesses, without the ability to explain your 
<br>
reasoning, is just not interesting, even if it does result in your scoring 
<br>
higher on some IQ tests than Eliezer or anyone else would.  Maybe the puzzle 
<br>
you were talking about was &quot;the ultimate IQ test&quot; but that is precisely why 
<br>
it is NOT similar to FAI theory.  Unlike the answers on an IQ test, &quot;AI 
<br>
doesn't fit on a t-shirt&quot;, and for FAI, which can't be solved with guess 
<br>
work, trial, and error, even correct intuitive answers which cannot be 
<br>
explained are little better than worthless.
