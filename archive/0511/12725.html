<p>I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.  That seems to be the sophisticated
<br>
argument made by people who claim the rest of us just don't have an
<br>
advanced enough conception of consciousness.  I think my conception is
<br>
fairly advanced, especially since I probably know more neuroscience
<br>
than anyone on this list, along with a strong background in psychology
<br>
and philosophy of mind. I understand the illusion of self and that
<br>
consciousness can be a dynamic phenomenon.  But the fact remains that
<br>
if you obliterate all of the physically connected substrate underlying
<br>
a particular mind-agent, it ceases to exist.  That's still a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What really matters, IMO, is a &quot;mind-producing activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of matter in space-time,&quot; which I've defined reluctantly as &quot;presence&quot; to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean their brains stop working. In other words, I can be present without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being conscious.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course, because the physical substrate of consciousness is
<br>
still intact, it's just not active.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It really doesn't matter to the success of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure if subjects maintain their consciousness during transfer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Successful uploading is not about preserving brain structure either.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand how.  If you don't transfer activity (subject is
<br>
not conscious), and you don't transfer substrate (structure is not
<br>
preserved), then how does a particular mind still exist?  Sure,
<br>
there's an exact *copy* of that mind that will try to convince you
<br>
that nothing is amiss, but that is also an illusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that matters is preservation of the original presence by maintaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential for that presence.
</em><br>
<p>This is vague language.  You defined &quot;presence&quot; as mind-producing
<br>
activity, but you said that that activity doesn't need to exist
<br>
throughout the uploading process.  Well, then you've just made a NEW
<br>
copy.  You, the person that I'm talking to right now, the one who
<br>
actually experienced the life history in your memories (rather than
<br>
just having them recreated de novo during uploading), would be gone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once uploading procedure manages to preserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original presence the other things pretty much take care of themselves.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; So yes, I agree that consciousness isn't a relevant criterion by which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should judge whether the true essence of &quot;I am&quot; was transferred during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading. I lose and regain consciousness all the time but I remain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same day after day, year by year because I've never lost my original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence.
</em><br>
<p>You never lost your original brain structure.
