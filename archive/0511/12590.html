<em>&gt; There is actually significant evidence that intelligence (g) operates

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Model), which asserts that humans are essentially blank slates whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitudes and abilities are shaped entirely by their upbringing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I certainly don't support the blank slate model of human
<br>
intelligence, as might be apparent from my frequent references to our
<br>
environment of evolutionary adaptation, and please don't get me
<br>
started on the various weakness of the Standard Social Science Model 
<br>
or contemporary studies of psychology (not to be confused with
<br>
scientific studies of cognition.)
<br>
<p>So it might be inferred that my point was about something different.
<br>
<p>A few weeks ago, Michael Vassar posted an excellent
<br>
<em>&gt; article, &quot;Why G Matters&quot;, which is one of thousands of articles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presenting important evidence for the context-independent predictive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validity of g:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The predictive validity of g is powerful in all job domains, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases in intensity with the intellectual demands and abstractness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the task.  University physics is perhaps one of the most intellectually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demanding and abstract domains known to man, and therefore it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected that a high g value will convey especially significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits, regardless of context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This study is all about performance of individuals *within the
<br>
standard environment* and how those with above average IQ will do
<br>
better generally accross the board.  The usual bell curve is shown and
<br>
they say &quot;For the top 5% of the population (over IQ 125), success is
<br>
really 'yours to lose.' These people meet the minimum intelligence
<br>
requirements of all occupations, are highly sought after for their
<br>
extreme trainability, and have a relatively
<br>
easy time with the normal cognitive demands of life.&quot;
<br>
<p>I suspect that many, if not most of the members of this list fall
<br>
within that 5% category and would generally agree that higher
<br>
intelligence correlates with greater success in the regular world
<br>
(even discounting stereotypical social awkwardness.)
<br>
<p>However, the paper you referenced is not about the extreme forms of
<br>
intelligence (off the bell curve) associated with child progidies who
<br>
often require sheltering as I tried to point out earlier,  or the
<br>
extreme performance in mathematics or music sometimes associated with
<br>
Aspergers or Autism, or the kind of narrow &quot;intelligence&quot; currently
<br>
exhibited by some machine performance.
<br>
<p>My point was about intelligence operating *within a sheltered or
<br>
sharply constrained environment* being popularly assumed to have a
<br>
greater understanding of the bigger picture even outside of their
<br>
environment of interaction.  It's a fallacy of extrapolation.
