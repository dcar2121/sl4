<em>&gt; Hands up everyone here who's bothered learning to speed-read. I'm going to
</em><br>
guess one, maybe two hands will be raised. How many still use it on a
<br>
regular basis? One of the two hands, I suspect, goes down.
<br>
<p>Learned, actively use, actively proselytize it, and on occasion teach speed
<br>
reading.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
[Photoreading offers even greater bandwidth advantages.]
<br>
<p>One of my dreams is to see speed reading adopted, and integrated, into the
<br>
public school curriculum of a large population state such as Texas.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But you are correct about using it; the best analogy I know for speed
<br>
reading, both the learning and maintaining of the skill is:  weight lifting.
<br>
It's work.  Rewarding work, but work nonetheless.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My business is pragmatic accelerated learning -- it just happens to focus on
<br>
computer technology.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In the one time I was able to speak with Bill Gates directly, he had just
<br>
given a talk on the apparent unlimited advancement of technology my question
<br>
was:  &quot;If the advancement of software and hardware is unlimited, what is the
<br>
limitation on the adoption of technology?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(It might interest you to know that Gates' major motivator was NOT money but
<br>
rather the proliferation and adoption of computer technology -- he was just
<br>
very good at making money in that business.)
