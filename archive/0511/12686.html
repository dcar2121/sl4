<p>Minor correction-- I'm not really working on AGI in any serious way yet.
<br>
Right now, I'm finishing up some prior obligations, and trying to gain
<br>
enough hands-on experience with AI to make a rational decision about what to
<br>
do next.  Once those things are done, I might end up starting a new project,
<br>
although my first choice would be to help out on an existing effort.
<br>
<p>I agree with the general sentiment that finding good people is super-hard.
<br>
In my present job, I spend a fair amount of time hiring programmers.  I'm
<br>
currently trying to hire a couple of people for one of the best-known and
<br>
most successful game companies in the world, offering highly competitive
<br>
salary and benefits (we'll go head to head with MS or Google).  Our only
<br>
requirement is that we want world-class programmers-- we'll look at top
<br>
people with any experience level, from college students to 30 year veterans.
<br>
Even so, we're having an incredibly hard time finding people.  That's pretty
<br>
much universal in the software industry.
<br>
<p>For AGI, the problem is much harder.  The quality bar is similar (maybe much
<br>
higher, if you believe SIAI), the pay is likely to be much lower, you need
<br>
to be sl4 but not a nutjob, you have to have some knowledge of AI, and you
<br>
have to be willing to work for a company that nobody's ever heard of, doing
<br>
work that most people think is crazy, with dubious prospects for ever
<br>
getting rich.
<br>
<p>My gut estimate (I believe SIAI's estimate is higher) is that the absolute
<br>
minimum team size for a realistic AGI effort is 6 full time senior-level
<br>
programmers.  I believe that's more than the combined current teams at SIAI,
<br>
Novamente, Numenta, and A2I2.
<br>
<p>I suspect that solving this problem will necessitate aggressive outreach and
<br>
recruiting within the broader tech community, not just singularitarians.
