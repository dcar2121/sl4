transhumanism a cult?  Why *aren't* prospective transhumanists

needs to be explained.  Usually when a room full of people agree with

each other on something, they are a lot more obnoxious.

&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that a lot of people confuse &quot;movement&quot; with &quot;cult&quot;.  In  any social movement there will be strong leaders with lots of charisma,  but that does not in anyway make a movement a cult.  As Eliezer  notes, transhumanism does not have any of the trademarks of a cult,  which general include a single leader and a single platform as well as  excessive control over the members.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, met some transhumanists who do seem to approach the  subject in quite a religious fashion.  They make their cases more  from faith and less from reason.  Of course, this still does not  make it a cult :)  I think that as the movement becomes more  widespread and people from a variety of backgrounds are exposed to the  ideas, that there will be a wider array of responses.  Some  responses will be more emotionally led than intellectually led. Not  everyone who is interested in transhumanism will be able to grasp the  ideas with the same rigor of research and level of sophication.   That isn't a bad thing, it's to be expected.  It's just how social  movements work.
