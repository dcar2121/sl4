</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Mental health can probably be maintained as long as he is sheltered
<br>
within an environment matching his particular abilities and
<br>
disabilities.
<br>
<p>Regarding scientific contributions, I see a significant probability of
<br>
some novel but narrow insights, but probable disappointment in the
<br>
context of general and practical applicability to real-world problems.
<br>
<p>While I don't doubt he's a prodigy, this story reeks of
<br>
publicity-enhancement.  The claim that he qualified for university by
<br>
being able to recite an explanation of Shroedinger's equation is quite
<br>
shallow and says nothing about all the associated understanding that
<br>
would normally be expected.  The gee-whiz claim that he's thinking
<br>
about flying cars in connection with string theory says more about the
<br>
child-like nature of his thoughts than about any kind of special
<br>
insight, and the statement that his father speaks for him because he
<br>
has not yet learned to communicate properly to adults using Korean
<br>
social norms hints strongly about the uneven nature of his education
<br>
and understanding.
<br>
<p>What I find most significant about this and similar situations is that
<br>
the popular conception of &quot;intelligence&quot; does not include its extreme
<br>
dependence on context.  If intelligence is understood in terms of the
<br>
capability of an agent to predict changes and thus respond effectively
<br>
to its environment, then any isolation from the environment has the
<br>
effect of reducing its effective intelligence in that broader context.
<br>
&nbsp;For a system within a co-evolutionary environent, the mismatch
<br>
becomes progressively worse.
<br>
<p>I hope that Yoo-geun gets the benefit of a special environment in
<br>
which he can flourish and contribute to the diversity of thinking that
<br>
promotes our growth, while not being hampered with the popular
<br>
assumption that he sees more of the big picture than do others.
