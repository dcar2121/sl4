<p>You're right that not all find this obvious. I certainly don't, while
<br>
I believe Robin does. For those who don't, the reasoning, I believe,
<br>
goes like this: human beings are routinely led to believe and do
<br>
things that they personally, at other times in their life, would have
<br>
found preposterous, and that all outside observers likewise do. This,
<br>
among many other things, indicates that the normal human mind is
<br>
susceptible to various forms of manipulation. Intelligence, as has
<br>
been discussed recently, doesn't seem to be a strong protection
<br>
against many form of irrationality. A full understanding of these
<br>
human weaknesses, it seems, would allow one a great deal of persuasive
<br>
power that could be used to a large number of ends.
<br>
<p>Part of it is a mental experiment. Imagine someone who is as
<br>
charismatic as, say, Steve Jobs, or Bill Clinton, perhaps. The most
<br>
charismatic person in your experience. An AI would be at least that
<br>
persuasive. A seed AI would be better. (Perhaps someone else could do
<br>
a better job with this idea than I.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The succinct answer is &quot;Someone only marginally smarter than most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans appears to be able to pretty consistently convince them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; let the AI out.  The capabilities of something *MUCH* smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most humans should be assumed to be much greater.&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't understand what you are saying here.  Who is the &quot;someone&quot; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are referring to, who is convincing &quot;them&quot; to let &quot;the&quot; AI out?
</em><br>
<p>I think Robin is referring here to the AI Box experiments performed by
<br>
Eliezer. Since he was able to convince people who otherwise said they
<br>
would definitely not let an AI out, to let him out, (I believe the
<br>
count is 2 out of 3 now?) we can assume at a bare minimum that a
<br>
superintelligent AI could perform at least as well. And when the
<br>
stakes are as high as they are (which may not bear directly to your
<br>
question, but does bear on the utility of the question) if the
<br>
experiments were to find even one out of ten convinced, that would be
<br>
much too high a rate to justify the risk of relying on an AI box to
<br>
contain a seed AI.
