<p><em>&gt; Hi Jeff,

<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Non-reciprocal altruism is so uncommon in humans as to be more easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; categorized *as a disorder (!!!??)* than some sort of higher, grand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trait of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humanity that puts us on a moral pedestal above the non-human animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A bit of evidence about rarity would be good.  And why on earth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classify it as a disorder???  Do you think the world would be a better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place without non- reciprocal altruism?  You're thesis (sic) is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even very well framed.  Rarity of behaviours is not a good indicator 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the fitness of the behaviour.
</em><br>
<p><p>New additions to the next DSM:
<br>
<p>Non Reciprocal Altruism Disorder (NRAD)
<br>
Patient exhibits the following symptoms, which have persisted for at 
<br>
least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with 
<br>
developmental level:
<br>
- Often exhibits generosity
<br>
- Often purchases gifts for others
<br>
- Often donates to charities
<br>
- Often exhibits helpful behaviours
<br>
In addition, the patient must meet the following criteria:
<br>
A. symptoms must be present in two or more settings (such as work and home)
<br>
B. the individual must show &quot;clinically significant impairment&quot; at work 
<br>
or school or with other people
<br>
C. the individual must not suffer from another mental disorder that 
<br>
could explain the symptoms
<br>
<p>Humble Personality Syndrome (HPS):
<br>
- Patient exhibits non egomaniacal behaviours
<br>
- Continually refrains from narcissistic impulses
<br>
- Exhibits helpful behaviours without seeking popular acknowledgement
<br>
- Patient refuses to claim credit for other people's efforts
<br>
<p>Politeness Disorder:
<br>
- Patient impulsively blurts out emotionally charged interjections such 
<br>
as &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thankyou&quot;
<br>
- Often exhibits deference to others
<br>
- Often exhits respect for others
<br>
- Often uses strategies to avoid offence and confrontation
<br>
Politeness Disorder is commonly confused with Consideration Disorder, 
<br>
but is distinguished by the nature of the interjections, and a 
<br>
prevalence of deference behaviours over assistance behaviours.
<br>
<p>Chronic Tolerance Syndrome (CTS):
<br>
Although all normal persons exhibit some limited tolerance behaviours, 
<br>
CTS is evident when the patient acts with tolerance towards others when 
<br>
a non-maladjusted person would resort to name calling and violence. 
<br>
<p>Caritamania:
<br>
- Patient forms deep and meaningful relationships
<br>
- Exhibits irrational loyalty towards projected targets of caritas
<br>
- Exhibits deep affection for sexual partners even in absence of sexual 
<br>
contact
<br>
<p>When the DSM comes out for AIs, will we have listings for &quot;Friendliness 
<br>
disorders&quot;?
<br>
<p>===
<br>
<p>The whole &quot;disorder&quot; thing is kinda funny.  Apart from the fact that I 
<br>
have adjusted and make allowances for my inattention behaviours, I'd be 
<br>
a poster boy for ADD (not ADHD).  Strangely enough, I was never 
<br>
diagnosed as a kiddie as ADD because I was fairly academically 
<br>
succesful.  Nowadays, they'd use the term &quot;gifted and talented&quot;.  I've 
<br>
been reading my partner's research on G&amp;T kids (she's a primary 
<br>
teacher), and it's amazing how much crossover there is between gifted 
<br>
and ADD-except that one type shows &quot;potential&quot; and the other's 
<br>
&quot;infuriating&quot;.  I could babble more, but it's hardly SL4 relevant.
