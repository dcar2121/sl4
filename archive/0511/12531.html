Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for 'emergence' from the Internet, speculation at the level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluffy generalities is absolutely useless. If you think there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific mechanism that could conceivably produce an AGI distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the Internet, describe it, and we might have something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * Michael Wilson
</em><br>
<p>I discussed this possibility in my 2002 book &quot;Creating Internet
<br>
Intelligence.&quot;  
<br>
<p>I do think it's a real possibility, but, certainly not in the next
<br>
few years.
<br>
<p>How it could happen would be if a bunch of narrow AI programs were
<br>
posted on the Net and allowed to interact as &quot;autonomous agents.&quot;
<br>
<p>Potentially, their interactions with each other and with humans
<br>
could cause the emergence of an additional layer of intelligence
<br>
not envisioned by the designers of any of the narrow-AI agents
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>I could spell out some specific scenarios via which this could
<br>
potentially happen.  Probably others could too.  You need to
<br>
envision agents using powerful narrow-AI tech that can do things
<br>
like
<br>
<p>-- automatically summarize documents on the Net and post its
<br>
summaries on the Net
<br>
<p>-- some simple computational reasoning based on information
<br>
extracted from documents and databases online
<br>
<p>-- make economic and financial predictions and post them 
<br>
online
<br>
<p>-- do economic transactions such as financial trading or
<br>
automated product-purchasing, based at least partly on
<br>
information gathered from the Net  (much of which was
<br>
posted by other AI agents)
<br>
<p>-- give people recommendations regarding what to read,
<br>
what to buy, etc. with much more savvy than current
<br>
software
<br>
<p>-- make scientific hypotheses via integrating knowledge
<br>
from existing databases (there is loads of scientific
<br>
data online)
<br>
<p>I'm not talking about the emergence of intelligence
<br>
from unintelligent software like Word and Firefox
<br>
and Mathematica.  I'm talking about the emergence of
<br>
autonomous intelligence from autonomous narrowly-intelligent
<br>
software components that interact tightly via the medium
<br>
of the Net.  Potentially, in this sort of scenario, one could
<br>
see the self-organization of a kind of emergent meta-mind.
<br>
<p>How likely is something like this?  Well that depends upon
<br>
a lot of things, including the specific nature of the narrow-AI
<br>
software we're talking about.
<br>
<p>My own bet is that someone will intentionally create an AGI
<br>
well before we get the chance to see whether this kind of
<br>
semi-spontaneous crystallization of AGI from the Net really
<br>
occurs.
<br>
