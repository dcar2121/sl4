<p><p>Probably the worst case of this in my experience, and I've taken a  
<br>
lot of tests, was the US military technical aptitude tests.  There  
<br>
were a few questions on those tests that were premised on patently  
<br>
false assumptions, yet which made a certain kind of sense if one  
<br>
could guess the axioms of the ignoramus that put the test together.
<br>
<p>A person with significantly above average IQ and knowledge will  
<br>
notice these defects and answer based on an educated prediction of  
<br>
the assumptions the test writer was using.  It was how people like me  
<br>
got perfect scores.  The truly educational portion of the test was in  
<br>
discovering how many people get very marginal scores on these tests.   
<br>
My initial comments on the test series were that it was designed to  
<br>
weed out the stupid half of the chimpanzee population; an ill-advised  
<br>
thing to say, as it turns out that the average human did not do  
<br>
nearly as well as I had assumed, and many did very poorly.  Which is  
<br>
why it is rarely polite (on many levels) to discuss metrics of  
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>But yes, I would agree that above some level of education/ 
<br>
intelligence some very significant defects in standardized tests  
<br>
start to become apparent.  That most people never noticed always kind  
<br>
of threw me.
