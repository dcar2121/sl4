<p>
The combination of extreme memorization skills Yoo-geun SONG clearly
<br>
has and the article's comment that the father spoke to the reporter in
<br>
place of (rather than in addition to) Yoo-geun because &quot;[he] is
<br>
lacking in his ability to communicate with adults&quot; implies he may be
<br>
autistic, Asperger's, or similarly 'disabled.'
<br>
<p>While I don't look down on that mode of being or seek to 'cure' those
<br>
who are diagnosed and *don't wish* to be cured, history bears out the
<br>
fact that most arithmetical and eidetic child prodigies end up losing
<br>
their special talent as they become adults, going insane (some form of
<br>
extreme anti-social behavior leading to withdrawal from societal
<br>
interaction and hence contribution), and/or retaining the eidetic &amp;
<br>
arithmetic abilities but lacking the ability to do anything useful
<br>
with them (not seeing the big picture, as it were; think &quot;Rain Man&quot;
<br>
for a Hollywood/nearest-approximation example).
<br>
<p>So I, like most people, hope he turns out all right and also that he
<br>
might contribute something especially useful to our understanding of
<br>
the world. But I don't have a high expectation of this occurring.
<br>
<p>Regarding flying cars and string theory, as mentioned below:
<br>
<em>&gt; The claim of a connection between flying cars and string theory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed quite silly.
</em><br>
<p>I've read a bit about string theory, but I can't say I understand it
<br>
well enough to refute a potential application to flying cars. I agree
<br>
&quot;flying cars&quot; is an unfortunate, short-sighted scope for something as
<br>
amazing as the potential applications of a unified theory, but to call
<br>
it silly to suggest a connection seems unjustified. Maybe you know
<br>
significantly more about string theory than I'd thought you did.
<br>
<p>A second reason for not dismissing the potential connection is the
<br>
fact that the father is still talking about it even after it has
<br>
surely been brought up around various physics professors. It might be
<br>
expected that physics professors looking for a prodigy would be
<br>
disappointed by and have rather lower expectations of a potential
<br>
physics prodigy whose main interest was blatant silliness to
<br>
professional physicists. If so, then the boy being recruited by all
<br>
the top science departments in Korea becomes less likely. Still
<br>
possible, but less likely.
<br>
<p>My point in commenting on this flying car tangent is not to get a
<br>
discussion on string theory &amp; flying cars going, nor even to convince
<br>
people a connection is plausible (I really couldn't say); it is
<br>
instead to use this as an example to emphasize the general point that
<br>
we should none of us be so quick to judge hypotheses involving fields
<br>
in which we are not especially qualified, and especially when the line
<br>
of reasoning leading to the hypothesis in question is not proffered.
