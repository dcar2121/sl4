<em>&gt;Female Elephants have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chimp-level encephalization quotients, complex social groups of size
</em><br>
similar 
<br>
<em>&gt;to those of hunter gatherers, fine manipulators, tool use, long lives,
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt;human sized or larger neocortexes, but in the million years or so of
</em><br>
their 
<br>
<em>&gt;existance (20 million if Mastadons count) they have not developed any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture comparable to ours and specifically have not domesticated other
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;animals or adapted to a range of climates to spread globally.  They are
</em><br>
also 
<br>
<em>&gt;ineffective in defending themselves against human hunter-gatherers.
</em><br>
<p>But I do not believe that elephants, or in fact any other creature as
<br>
far as my Googling has found, has 6 full layers of cortical tissue, and
<br>
it is this, rather than total area or volume of tissue which allows us
<br>
to think on a more abstract level than that of other creatures and gives
<br>
us our &quot;creative&quot; edge. As I understand it, area relates proportionally
<br>
to bandwidth while each layer allows the generalizations created from
<br>
the detailed input of the lower layer to be generalized and abstracted
<br>
to a greater degree. Please correct me if I am mistaken here, as my
<br>
primary source of input about this topic has been Mr. Hawkins' book. If
<br>
there are seminal papers or texts that I should read in order to ask
<br>
better questions I would love to know about them.
