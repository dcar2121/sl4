(This is SL4 relevant.  I know the Global Warming /evidence/ thread has been 
<br>
killed, but I'm commenting on specific concerns about our future)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: &quot;J. Andrew Rogers&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:andrew@ceruleansystems.com?Subject=Re:%20Global%20Warming%20-%20future%20implications">andrew@ceruleansystems.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That said, why exactly is all this even important?  Solving problems  a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundred years in the future today seems like a fruitless use of  resources. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Even the most catastrophic climate shifts in the  historical record took 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a couple decades to occur, and those were a  couple orders of magnitude 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more extreme than the variances we've seen  over the last century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Firstly, it is incorrect to say that climate changes always occur &quot;slowly&quot; 
<br>
on the scale of decades. Plain Wrong.
<br>
<p>A decent example of startlingly abrupt change is the end of the Younger 
<br>
Dryas approximately 11,500 years ago.  According to ice-core records, about 
<br>
10 degree C of change happened really suddenly.  REALLY suddenly.  Although 
<br>
global change /might/ have occurred over a decade or two, the Greenland 
<br>
(GRIP/GISP2) and Vostok core samples both indicate change over less than a 
<br>
decade - possibly in as little as ONE year.
<br>
<p>The end of the Younger Dryas is covered succinctly by K C Taylor, LA 
<br>
Mayewski et al &quot;The Holocene/Younger Dryas Transition Recorded at Summit, 
<br>
Greenland&quot;, 1997, in /Science/ v 278 pp 825-827
<br>
<p>A compilation of YD data was put together in 1993 by D M Peteet, ed, &quot;Global 
<br>
Younger Dryas&quot; 1993 in Quaternary Science Reviews, v 12.
<br>
<p>Since abrupt global climate change will* have a profound effect on global 
<br>
economic activity, this is a  SL-4 concern.  A potential global economic 
<br>
collapse this century would interfere with computing developments, and 
<br>
consequently with AGI concerns.
<br>
<p>Admittedly, the best thing that people in the computing sphere can do is to 
<br>
develop an AGI ASAP, firstly to help climatologists do their job (rather 
<br>
than have computer heads pontificate at them), and secondly, because MNT may 
<br>
offer some solutions to climate change problems.
<br>
<p>However, it is also important to note that the attitude that &quot;Solving 
<br>
problems a hundred years in the future today seems like a fruitless use of 
<br>
resources&quot; is also harmful in the domain of climate change.  As Prof Richard 
<br>
Alley (Geosciences, Penn State) makes a point in his beautifully simple (and 
<br>
not too preachy) &quot;The Two Mile Time Machine&quot; (Princeton UP, 2000): &quot;the 
<br>
Climate may be a bit like a drunk -- when left alone, it sits; when forced 
<br>
to move, it staggers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Reducing the push on the climate a little may make a crucial difference to 
<br>
climate outcomes.  Because the various feedback mechanisms (CO2 is one of 
<br>
many) cause jitters and fluctuations, not causing climate jitters will lead 
<br>
to a lot less human suffering overall.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it is obvious that some actions lead to results with a 
<br>
time-lag, and that the time-to the result makes the results no less serious, 
<br>
and therefore the problem no less significant.
<br>
<p>It would seem kinda silly to say that just because a bomb has a longer fuse, 
<br>
that it becomes unimportant to avoid setting it off.  Sure, it's better to 
<br>
have 2 hours to evacuate a building than 2 minutes, but having to evacuate 
<br>
the building is nevertheless important!
<br>
<p>By all means, do whatever you can to create an entity that will take more 
<br>
care of our nest than we have done.  But that doesn't mean that it's OK to 
<br>
shit in our water trough.
<br>
<p>-- Olie
<br>
<p>*Climate change is a given.  The past few thousand years of stable, warm 
<br>
weather has been an anomaly.  Without some serious Sysop intervention, there 
<br>
will be change, and sometimes that change will be abrupt.  Change might not 
<br>
happen this decade or this millenium, but 20degC of change will occur in the 
<br>
future.
