<em>&gt; &quot;By the way, I believe that we will create friendly AI, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we will also (eventually) create unfriendly AI, either by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident or by design.  &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm just curious where you came up with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By my understanding, these two are mutually exclusive... in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sense that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you actually create an FAI, it will quickly ensure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody create a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UFAI (major existential risk), and if you create a UFAI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first, then that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tends to imply humans are, well, screwed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, even assuming you are correct and that the first friendly
<br>
AI of sufficient interlligence eliminates the possibility of
<br>
an unfriendly AI (very doubtful but as least useful as a thought
<br>
experiment) then notice that SOMEONE would have created that
<br>
friendly AI, and someone else somewhere will be bound to disagree.
<br>
<p>Do you expect everyone would agree that the US Military (or NSA,
<br>
or whatever) has the final say on &quot;friendly&quot;, or that some 
<br>
commercial organiation (e.g., IBM, Microsoft) has the final
<br>
say?  Just look at the people who HATE Microsoft merely for
<br>
selling a lot of software that they don't wish to use.
<br>
<p>Or imagine a terrorist or terrorist supporting nation has the
<br>
&quot;first&quot; friendly (in their terms) AI....
<br>
<p>Or, it's open source?  How do you stop some human from taking
<br>
it offline and tinkering with it until it is able to do battle
<br>
again with the Supreme Friendly AI running the world.
<br>
<p>People cannot even agree on what would constitute 'friendly'
<br>
or 'unfriendly' behavior -- if it is powerful enough to prevent
<br>
any competitors it will by definition have to PROTECT itself
<br>
and, almost by definition, have to evolve to counter new threats,
<br>
at which point you cannot count on ANY pre-programmed friendly
<br>
behavior being permanent.
<br>
<p>An evolving, all-powerful, friendly AI is a new species over 
<br>
which we cannot guarantee control over any sufficiently long
<br>
period of time.
<br>
<p>Even if we could guarantee this, we couldn't agree on the
<br>
definition of friendly or the evaluation of it's behavior
<br>
yesterday when it stopped some war between two countries.
<br>
<p>Someone didn't get their way; perhaps someone had to die.
<br>
Someone does not think this is friendly. If you are lucky,
<br>
you are not on &quot;that side.&quot;
