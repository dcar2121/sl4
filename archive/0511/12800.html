<p>
If I might offer something of an inside view on all this...
<br>
<p>For a start, don't hold it against Song Yoo-geun that he wants to build 
<br>
flying cars based on string theory.  Being a child prodigy in physics is 
<br>
not like being a college student in physics, even if both know some of 
<br>
the same information.  When I scored 1410 on the SAT at age 11, I was 
<br>
not anything like a high school graduate who scores 1410 on the SAT.  In 
<br>
some ways I knew more and was smarter, in other ways I knew less and was 
<br>
dumber.  At the age of eleven I was not an ordinary eleven-year-old, but 
<br>
I was not an ordinary bright high school graduate either.
<br>
<p>In particular, you should realize that child prodigies don't have the 
<br>
same kind of absurdity-detectors.  In your dream you may see an elephant 
<br>
in your bedroom without noticing anything wrong.  As a child some parts 
<br>
of your mind have not awakened.  This may be startling when the dreamer 
<br>
knows quantum physics, for we expect physicists to be awake; yet still 
<br>
the dreamer dreams.  Back in my child-prodigy days I also dreamed of 
<br>
building flying cars, based on cold fusion (which was just then being 
<br>
announced).  The same level of physics understanding will give rise to 
<br>
very different conceptions of one's own ability to build flying cars, 
<br>
depending on whether that understanding exists in a college student or a 
<br>
child prodigy.
<br>
<p>As for whether Yoo-geun will go on to contribute anything to science, 
<br>
the key concepts here are &quot;diagnosticity&quot; and &quot;reversion to the mean&quot;. 
<br>
For example, let's say that I take a group of student recommendation 
<br>
letters.  First I ask subjects to rate the recommendation laters on a 
<br>
scale of 1 to 10 for how glowing the recommendation was.  Then I ask 
<br>
subjects to predict the student's performance during the freshman year 
<br>
of college, using only the recommendation letters as their data.  Then I 
<br>
ask subjects to predict the student's performance during the senior year 
<br>
of college.  The consistent result, which makes no sense statistically, 
<br>
is that all three judgments are equally extreme.  If a letter of 
<br>
recommendation is not a *perfect* predictor of performance during the 
<br>
freshman year, then your prediction of freshman performance should be 
<br>
less extreme than your evaluation of the recommendation letter.  If the 
<br>
correlation is not *perfect*, then your prediction should revert to the 
<br>
mean.  Similarly, since the senior year of college is farther away than 
<br>
the freshman year, there's more opportunity for other factors to come 
<br>
into play.  Thus the recommendation letter will be less *diagnostic* of 
<br>
the senior year than the freshman year.  Therefore your prediction of 
<br>
the senior year should be less extreme than your prediction of the 
<br>
freshman year.  A lot can happen in four years!
<br>
<p>Ever since I was old enough to know about reverting to the mean, I've 
<br>
been repeating to myself:  &quot;I will not revert to the mean.  I will not 
<br>
revert to the mean.&quot;  Even before then, I'd heard of Sidis too.  I was 
<br>
determined that I would *not* fade away, I would *not* burn out, I would 
<br>
*not* become one of those prodigies that excel in childhood and then are 
<br>
never heard from again.  I have always disliked being called a &quot;young 
<br>
genius&quot;, because the amazing thing about a dog that can write is not how 
<br>
well the dog writes, but that the dog can write at all.  I wanted to do 
<br>
things that would be impressive in their own right, not impressive 
<br>
because I did them when I was young.  Whenever someone complimented me 
<br>
on being a prodigy, it drove me forward to keep doing more, to keep 
<br>
improving further, until my deeds stopped being remarkable *for their 
<br>
youth*.  I suspect that whether a child prodigy grows into an adult 
<br>
genius depends, among other things, on the strength of that prodigy's 
<br>
determination not to waste his potential.
<br>
<p>Another strong factor is probably rationality.  I can't Google this 
<br>
story, but I once read about a child prodigy who was being admitted to 
<br>
college study of mathematics at age 11, or something like that.  And it 
<br>
was recounted in this magazine article how the prodigy had apparently 
<br>
found a disproof of some famous mathematical theorem or other, so that 
<br>
it took the startled teacher a few moments to find the flaw.  There was 
<br>
a quote from the prodigy - I don't remember it exactly - where he 
<br>
wistfully says, &quot;It would have disproven the whole foundation of the 
<br>
field...&quot;
<br>
<p>I read this and smiled.  Back in my child-prodigy days, I think at 
<br>
around the age of 13 or so, I thought I had found a disproof of Cantor's 
<br>
Diagonal Argument.  Ah, the dreams of glory that danced in my head!  A 
<br>
week later I found the blatantly obvious flaw in my disproof.  I was 
<br>
initially a bit disappointed.  I thought to myself:  &quot;I'll get that 
<br>
theorem eventually!  Someday I'll disprove Cantor's Diagonal Argument, 
<br>
even though my first try failed!&quot;  I resented the theorem for still 
<br>
being obstinately true, and I started looking for other disproofs.  And 
<br>
then I realized something.  I realized that I had made a mistake, and 
<br>
that, now that I'd spotted my mistake, there was absolutely no reason to 
<br>
suspect the strength of Cantor's Diagonal Argument any more than other 
<br>
major theorems of mathematics.  I saw then very clearly that I was being 
<br>
offered the opportunity to become a math crank.  I did not wish this to 
<br>
be my future, so I gave a small laugh and let it go.  I waved Cantor's 
<br>
Diagonal Argument on with all good wishes, and I did not question it 
<br>
again.  Later I would read that magazine article about that other young 
<br>
prodigy and smile quietly, saying to myself:  &quot;He has not quite let go 
<br>
of his dreams of glory.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you are smart enough to have bright ideas as a child, you may fall 
<br>
into a child's trap when your bright idea is disproven.  I had to think 
<br>
all those rational thoughts *at the age of 13*, or fail.  Of course 
<br>
adults fall into this trap too, especially if they don't have many 
<br>
bright ideas, so that their bright idea is precious to them.  I had the 
<br>
advantage of being confident that I would come up with other bright 
<br>
ideas if I let go of that one.  If Yoo-geun cannot give up his dreams of 
<br>
antigravity after his absurdity-detectors awaken, he will become a 
<br>
crackpot, as other child prodigies have done.
<br>
<p>There's also the claim - I forget who made it - that the number-one 
<br>
thing a genius needs is an important problem to solve.  I can't say any 
<br>
deliberate planning went into that one, since I was catapulted into my 
<br>
present existence when I randomly picked Vernor Vinge's &quot;True Names and 
<br>
Other Dangers&quot; off a library shelf.  Good luck, Yoo-geun!  And beware 
<br>
that you will not get far by saying to yourself:  &quot;I am a genius, now I 
<br>
need an important problem.&quot;  People who think such thoughts fill in 
<br>
&quot;important problem&quot; by automatic word-association from magazine 
<br>
articles, and they go off to study some cliche &quot;important problem&quot; that 
<br>
ten thousand other scientists are already working on.  If you are 
<br>
horrified at the world you find yourself in, and you wish to remake it 
<br>
for good, then you may recognize an important problem when you see one.
<br>
<p>Another key variable is whether Yoo-geun's accomplishments so far have 
<br>
been driven by his parents' ambitions.  I was exceptionally lucky on 
<br>
that score.  My parents never once pressed me to be any kind of genius. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead they tried to keep it from going to my head, and wisely 
<br>
admonished me that intelligence wasn't the critical thing in the world - 
<br>
social skills and life experience were much more important.  The effect 
<br>
of this was to fix firmly in my mind the sovereignty of intelligence. 
<br>
(My parents were especially strident about the value of life experience 
<br>
when I tried to point out some of the logical flaws of the Jewish 
<br>
religion; they said to me, &quot;You'll understand when you're older.&quot;  It 
<br>
wasn't until much later that I realized that rationality, not 
<br>
intelligence, had been the critical variable in that test - that I had 
<br>
not outthought my parents; rather they had outthought themselves.)  I 
<br>
cannot conceive that if my parents had tried to cram my head full of 
<br>
impressive knowledge and proudly exhibited me to the media as a genius, 
<br>
I would have grown into anything like my present form.
<br>
<p>Even if Yoo-geun doesn't fade, I wouldn't count on him having ideas 
<br>
impressive in their own right (rather than being impressive in one so 
<br>
young) until, oh, at least the age of 16, and more likely his twenties. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative accomplishment is relatively easy.  It may mean you have the 
<br>
*potential* for absolute accomplishment, but absolute accomplishment is 
<br>
still a lot harder.
