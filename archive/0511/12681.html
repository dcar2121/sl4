</em><br>
<p>Well, this is obviously not true. I was hired nearly two years ago,
<br>
after knowing about a2i2 since it's inception. Our most recent hire,
<br>
David Raw, was a lurker on sl4 and applied for a job after he
<br>
completed his CS degree.
<br>
<p>We have had quite a few interviews, and we currently have pending
<br>
applications although this isn't really the place to discuss it.
<br>
<p>Suffice to say that we do need more people, and thus far, the
<br>
transhumanist culture has been the richest source of talent we've
<br>
found that had both the skills and the interest to do good work. (past
<br>
employees like David McFadzean, Richard Kowalski, and others before my
<br>
time have been very key to the project)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with Michael Vassar that we have an unfortunate tendency to

</em><br>
<p>One very important aspect of internet networking is that it's a
<br>
positive interaction. You don't talk to other people on sl4
<br>
incidentally, and thus only know what you or they have made a point to
<br>
establish. So it's easy to 'fill in the blanks' about the other person
<br>
out of assumed similarity.
<br>
<p>I think that online communities depend on a certain blurring and
<br>
assumption of shared identity in order to get over the fact that
<br>
people don't have geography or family/work associations to hold them
<br>
together, which is fine. But it's important to realize that there
<br>
isn't really an 'average sl4 reader' opinion, because the barriers to
<br>
entry are both low, and there is little harmonizing experience, other
<br>
than the common experience of reading the list. Thus there is of
<br>
course a 'most common opinion' amongst sl4 readers, which is not the
<br>
same thing at all.
<br>
<p>The point of my digression here is that it's easy to isolate yourself
<br>
in specialist interest groups, but it's also possible to overestimate
<br>
how many people agree with you there, and why. I would caution against
<br>
naive sociological conclusions based on your sense of such a
<br>
community.
