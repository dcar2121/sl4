</em><br>
<p>I would be very interested in substantiation of this trend. In my
<br>
experience, the prodigies I'm familiar with tend to contribute as much
<br>
or more than more traditionally late flowering scientists. They also
<br>
tend to be prolific, ranging from highly specialized to generalistic,
<br>
and sometimes their later fame even eclipses the fact that they were
<br>
once childhood prodigies.
<br>
<p>I believe that this 'fact' of childhood prodigies retreating, or not
<br>
contributing is due to the rather unfortunate public attitude towards
<br>
a group of prodigies in america early this century. These included
<br>
Norbert Wiener(Tufts College, at age 11) and William Sidis (also age
<br>
11, Harvard). In a series of public articles that can only be
<br>
described as trasitioning from breathless hyperbole to disparaging
<br>
libel, magazines and newspapers followed Sidis in particular, harping
<br>
on his decision to withdraw from his teaching position under great
<br>
public pressure, and eventually resign from public mathematical
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>Both Wiener and Sidis are thought of as crazy people. Even the
<br>
normally NPOV Wikipedia describes Wiener as the 'prototype' of
<br>
absentminded academic later in life, and includes a particularly
<br>
pointless Anecdotes section, which repeats apocryphal stories about
<br>
Wiener's inability to deal with every day life.
<br>
<p>Looking at the historical evidence, both Wiener and Sidis were
<br>
relatively prolific scientists, Sidis doing well in mathematics, and
<br>
after retiring, writing quite a few books under psuedonyms, on
<br>
anthropology, linguistic studies of native american culture and
<br>
language, cosmology (in one of the few books he published under his
<br>
own name, he predicted something very similar to a black hole in
<br>
1925).
<br>
<p>A savage series of newspaper articles doesn't make someone crazy. And
<br>
other than these few famous prodigies who withdrew from their original
<br>
field of study (another example would be Stephen Wolfram), many
<br>
remained, plugging steadily away.
<br>
<p>Thankfully, fame as a prodigy doesn't seem to stick. And fame as a
<br>
scientist.. well, that's pretty unusual anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A second reason for not dismissing the potential connection is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that the father is still talking about it even after it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely been brought up around various physics professors. It might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected that physics professors looking for a prodigy would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappointed by and have rather lower expectations of a potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics prodigy whose main interest was blatant silliness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional physicists. If so, then the boy being recruited by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the top science departments in Korea becomes less likely. Still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, but less likely.
</em><br>
<p>I'm amused that this is getting as much comment as it has, and in this
<br>
direction. What's wrong with flying cars?
<br>
<p>First, if his father is talking about this, it's entirely possible
<br>
that it's his father's interpretation of one of his ideas. An
<br>
explanatory example for very compact power generation, or assymetrical
<br>
gravity fields or whatever.
<br>
<p>Second, a viable design for such a device is a perfectly valid reason
<br>
for pursuing science. To me, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison are very
<br>
valid scientific heroes. They changed the world, they contributed to
<br>
science. Sure they're 'mere' engineers, and were motivated by the 
<br>
desire to make cool things (and a lot of money). But I'm a mere
<br>
engineer, I want to build an intelligent machine, and I was very
<br>
uninterested in many fields of math and science on their own with
<br>
which I am now familiar.
<br>
<p>It's just a little strange how little charity we seem to extend to
<br>
this boy. Obviously he's going to want his father to speak to the many
<br>
reporters who want to prod at him. Even if he were perfect at
<br>
addressing elders, it would be hard for an 8 year old to get respect.
<br>
Obviously he hasn't had the time to come up with original science yet.
<br>
Obviously he's going to want to do cool things(like flying cars and
<br>
such).
<br>
<p>It's not like the base population of 8 year olds is so mentally stable
<br>
and protected that he is in any obvious elevated risk. Personally I'd
<br>
be more worried about someone with equivalent g factor in some hell
<br>
public school, and no interested homeschooling parents.
