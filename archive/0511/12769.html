<p>Hands up everyone here who's bothered learning to speed-read. I'm going to

guess one, maybe two hands will be raised. How many still use it on a

<p>We have lots of I/O bandwidth already (as long as you're not suffering from

carpal tunnel syndrome - if you are, or have done, ask for a soft touch

keyboard or whatever is the right phrase to use; if anyone knows what is,

please let me know).

<p>The bottleneck is using it.
