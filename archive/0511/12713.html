<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, mind transfers are usually debated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of brain structure and preservation of continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of consciousness. In reality these concepts are somewhat marginal
</em><br>
<p>What an extraordinary thing to say! I would humbly suggest that
<br>
subjective continuity of consciousness is absolutely positively 100% the
<br>
ONLY thing that matters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What really matters, IMO, is a &quot;mind-producing activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of matter in space-time,&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>And I would also humbly suggest that the term “space – time” be used
<br>
only when the words “time” and “place” are insufficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; consciousness which is merely a subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mind-producing activity of matter
</em><br>
<p>Merely?! If my consciousness is preserved who cares about the rest.
<br>
And “description of the activity” would be more accurate.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in space-time.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Translation: At a time and place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because people sometimes lose consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean their brains stop working.
</em><br>
<p>When the brain of a surgery patients is cooled way down and they are
<br>
under very deep anesthesia there is still some minimal metabolism going
<br>
on in the neurons, but nothing you wouldn’t find in a liver or skin
<br>
cell; and there is virtually no communication between neurons; in other
<br>
words no thought, conscious or unconscious.     
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can be present without being conscious.
</em><br>
<p>At that moment you not only have no consciousness you don’t even have
<br>
reflexes, and are no more intelligent that a house plant. Are you
<br>
absolutely certain you really want to claim that is you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So yes, I agree that consciousness isn't a relevant criterion
</em><br>
<p>NOT RELEVANT!?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by which we should judge whether the true essence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I am&quot; was transferred during uploading.
</em><br>
<p>I can’t say much about your “presence” theory because I can’t make heads
<br>
or tails of it, but it sound like if you’re right then you could already
<br>
be dead; I could have uploaded you last night when you were sleeping,
<br>
duplicated you consciousness exactly but bungled when attempting to
<br>
duplicate “presence”, whatever that is. The result is that you are just
<br>
as conscious as you ever were, just as intelligent and just as happy and
<br>
you have all your memories, but you’re dead.
<br>
<p>My question is this: If you are correct then why should you care if
<br>
you’re dead or not, and why should anyone care about this mysterious and
<br>
mystical “presence” that just sounds like a soul dressed up in its best
<br>
Sunday go to meeting words like “Space Time Continuum”.
