<br>
<p><em>&gt; Making a long story very very short, because extreme smartness can give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely interesting rewards.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Smartness does not in itself give the extreme ability to persuade. 
<br>
Smartness enables one to more easily figure out a strategy or solution to do 
<br>
the persuasion or other tasks, with a minimum number of clues (at least one 
<br>
but probably more, depending on the way the mind functions).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, and more to the point, because extreme smartness to the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a complete theory of mind of the opponent means you can find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paths exist in his future space of development and follow those paths that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to your own release. This smartness differential though, to ensure a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete theory of mind, needs to be overwhelming, not just that of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over another human.
</em><br>
<p>We are still talking about the AI as it is in a box, right?  I agree that an 
<br>
AI can probably inevitably persuade -most- people to let it out of the box. 
<br>
However, just because it is smart does not mean that it knows how a specific 
<br>
person's mind works, or even any human mind in general.  Let's not forget 
<br>
that it's only form of communication is text.  This is not sufficient to 
<br>
form a complete theory of mind in a reasonable amount of time.
<br>
<p>If an IQ 170 professional persuader (lawyer, politician) gets sent to jail, 
<br>
does he have the ability to convince each and every IQ 100 jail guard to let 
<br>
him out of his cell and all the way out the front door to freedom?  Maybe he 
<br>
can persuade some, but not all.  They are trained not to do this.
<br>
<p>I am not trying to say that keeping an AI in a box is a good strategy, but 
<br>
some AI researchers might think so.  They may keep an AI in a box and hope 
<br>
that they can keep it there until they believe that they have made it 
<br>
friendly.  I think many of us need to be careful before making claims about 
<br>
AI behavior or making claims that intelligence is all powerful (intelligence 
<br>
is nothing without facts).  The bottom line is if you have to worry about 
<br>
keeping an AI in a box, you probably aren't doing a good job in making it 
<br>
friendly in the first place.
<br>
<p>Stay open-minded.
<br>
<p>Mark Nuzzolilo
