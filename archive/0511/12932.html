</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; J. Andrew Rogers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I sympathise with you on the general point of being attacked for 
<br>
statements you did not make, but I have questions about what you were 
<br>
actually trying to say with your original comment.
<br>
<p>1) Agreed: mere correlation is, of course, not evidence of a causal 
<br>
relationship.  CO2 could rise and fall in step with temperature (as 
<br>
indeed it does, in the Vostok cores and in the published data from the 
<br>
EPICA project that hit the news networks today) and yet we could still 
<br>
be in the dark about whether CO2 was causing the temperature change.
<br>
<p>2) A propos of the climate change debate generally, the CO2-Temp 
<br>
correlation is only one small part of the overall scientific claim:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Fossil fuel consumption has caused a massive change in CO2, 
<br>
putting the world today at the most extreme point on a graph that goes 
<br>
back 650,000 years.  For the EPICA news from today, see, e.g. 
<br>
(<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4467420.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4467420.stm</a>),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Climate simulations clearly indicate that if you pump CO2 into 
<br>
the atmosphere, you are likely to destabilize or heat the atmosphere,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The planet shows the effects of a truly astonishing and rapid 
<br>
climate change going on right now, regardless of whether it was caused 
<br>
by CO2 emissions or whatever.
<br>
<p>3) The *real* problem for science is that there are some ideologically 
<br>
driven groups who pick out isolated factoids from the mass of evidence, 
<br>
then use these isolated factoids to try to make assertions about the 
<br>
reliability of the entire body of data.  For example: &quot;CO2 does not 
<br>
necessarily cause Temperature change, so Global Warming is not real.&quot;
<br>
<p>4) You confused me, and obviously several other people, by seeming to 
<br>
align yourself with the anti-science conservative ideologues mentioned 
<br>
in (3), when you inserted the phrase &quot;common misconception fostered 
<br>
because it is useful to some ideological factions&quot; in your comments. 
<br>
You also said that &quot;When global temps rise, CO2 levels tend to rise, not 
<br>
the other way around,&quot; .... and *this* is a strong assertion of causal 
<br>
effect, on *your* part.  You accuse people of being confused about 
<br>
correlation and causality, but then you jump from citing correlation 
<br>
data to claiming causality yourself (the words I just quoted).  At the 
<br>
very least, I am confused about who you are attacking, and what for.
<br>
<p>5) Finally, it seems to me that you also are taking stuff out of 
<br>
context, as the people I referred to in (3) tend to do.  If there were 
<br>
no other data than the historical correlation and some proposed 
<br>
mechanisms which, as you point out, could equally explain a causal link 
<br>
in either direction, we might all be neutrally debating the matter.  But 
<br>
that leaves out the factor I listed in 2 (c), above:  to wit, the huge 
<br>
increase in CO2 in the last few hundred years, and the simultaneous huge 
<br>
increase in temperature and huge ecological changes that seem related to 
<br>
the temperature change.  *That* factor is what swings the interpretation 
<br>
in one direction.  By insisting on talking only about the evidence as if 
<br>
that factor did not exist, you imply that we should be neutral in our 
<br>
interpretation of the CO2-Temp correlation .... but it is precisely 
<br>
because of those other effects that the Intergovernmental Panel on 
<br>
Climate Change, taking account of the whole body of evidence, is not 
<br>
neutral about the evidence.
<br>
<p>So, yes, you could be right to point out the way that CO2-Temp 
<br>
correlation does not mean CO2-&gt;Temp causality BY ITSELF, but by omitting 
<br>
to mention that most environmentalists do not take the data by itself 
<br>
but instead take a larger view (like the IPCC), and by instead accusing 
<br>
those enviromentalists of being an ideological faction that has 
<br>
deliberately fostered misconceptions, you align yourself with the 
<br>
antiscientists at the same time that you deny doing so.
<br>
<p>[The above not meant in a derogatory voice, only as carefully analytical 
<br>
as I can manage under time pressure.]
