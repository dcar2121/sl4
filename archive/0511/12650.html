<p>
<em>&gt;a bouncer).  Mensa states that it wants to provide a forum where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent people can work together to solve the world's problems. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am a member of Mensa Australia, and they make no such claim. I 
<br>
maintain my membership for the high quality mailing list which they 
<br>
provide. Within that mailing list, I have found a variety of beliefs, 
<br>
some of which I don't believe are genuinely defensible. However, I think 
<br>
it's a mistake to believe that the &quot;compellingness&quot; of an argument is 
<br>
ever an objective thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the people who are already solving the world's problems --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doctors, scientists, engineers -- have already surrounded themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with other smart people and get the stimulation that they need.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tend not to join places like Mensa, which is why Mensa will never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fulfill its goal and will always be a place where people play
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scrabble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Well, as I said, my mensa makes no such claim. They *like* just playing 
<br>
scrabble. Aspiring to some ideological goal is something else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What I also found is a place where a disconcerting number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were devoutly religious, believed in UFOs, and other pseudoscientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and even nonsensical things.  I couldn't understand then why so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smart people could believe such dumb things, but I think now it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because so many of them aren't part of the larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intellectual/academic landscape.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That is probably correct. I have heard that academic study *is* 
<br>
correlated with atheism, and even more strongly so if you add in a 
<br>
personal religious belief as opposed to a doctrinal one.
<br>
<p>I think it's paternalistic to say that smart people are always believing 
<br>
dumb things. I think that people adopt beliefs which are successful for 
<br>
them - people are largely pragmatists and adopt beliefs structures which 
<br>
allow them to function. If people prefer a metaphor of religion to a 
<br>
metaphor of science, and are still willing to engage in an honest 
<br>
process of reflection and theory refinement, then their choice of 
<br>
metaphor is irrelevant. Being honest is, I think, about not discounting 
<br>
the importance of falsifying evidence.
<br>
<p>I have a number of religious friends who are, in any important sense, as 
<br>
intelligent as I am. Yet they maintain their belief, largely (I believe) 
<br>
because they are inherently idealistic. I believe that if I were 
<br>
idealistic, I would also convert to a form of religion.
<br>
<p>I also charge some people in the transhumanist / singularist movement of 
<br>
being idealistic. Their religion is different, but no less faith-based. 
<br>
For example, the adherence to the belief in rapid expansion post the 
<br>
creation of superintelligent AI is, frankly, faith-based. There is 
<br>
supporting evidence which some of us find compelling, but I've never 
<br>
heard a compelling argument that such an explosion is actually 
<br>
necessitated by superintelligence. I instead get versions of Pascal's 
<br>
wager and people who are unwilling to consider things in a more 
<br>
fine-grained granularity.
<br>
<p>They believe that the *ideal* of the singularity is more important than 
<br>
the *detail* of the singularity.
<br>
<p>That seems to me to also be a dumb thing. I am better with ideas than 
<br>
details, but do not ignore their importance.
<br>
<p>Sadly, I lack the mathematical clout to phrase such arguments in a 
<br>
compelling way to people who are mathematically oriented. Indeed, I may 
<br>
be the one who cannot &quot;see&quot; the truth in this case.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, I also see within mensa many pseudoscientific and genuinely 
<br>
... flawed ... positions which do not fit what I have been describing. 
<br>
Partially, that's because mensa's hurdles are not very high. I don't 
<br>
think I'd be playing russian roullette at odds of 1 in 50, for example. 
<br>
And I am only at the lowest end of that hurdle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You can be intelligent without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having formal training in critical thinking skills (as members of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list, so well versed in probability theory, should know).  That, among
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other things, may be Langan's biggest problem.  For anybody who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read Tversky et al. or the other suggestions on the SIAI booklist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human reasoning, you know that it doesn't necessarily come naturally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even for intelligent people.  In fact, as Michael Shermer points out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent people can be among the most intractable because they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defend erroneous beliefs with such alacrity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My point is that an IQ score is a pretty good predictor of success,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but not the only one.  A rigorous methodology for making accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inferences must still be learned.  Paying attention to the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mainstream is pretty important.  Concensus science has passed the test
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of falsifiability by many smart people.  Langan might think that since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he's profoundly smarter than any individual scientist, he can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pontificate in his ivory tower and come up with a closer description
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of reality than scientists can, but he's not smarter than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aggregate knowledge of the scientific community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Again, I fully agree.
<br>
<p>Although, scientific progress does often proceed through revolution. 
<br>
Then again, that revolution only seems rapid from outside the system -- 
<br>
often the seeds of discontent are well-sown before anything hits the 
<br>
popular press.
<br>
<p>My line of questioning was made in the hope that people wouldn't assume 
<br>
I was making that mistake, and would simply answer directly.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
-T
