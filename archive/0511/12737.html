<em>&gt;&gt;The obvious response to this is that we store some memories even while

<em>&gt;Woah, stop right here. You just stopped talking about consciousness
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness strictly necessary for an intelligence that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objectively, claims to have a sense of identity, if you allow that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objective consciousness doesn't imply subjective consciousness. (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think it does imply that.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I question whether you really can have a dream without a sense of 
<br>
identity. Cogito ergo sum --- the mere evidence of your own experience 
<br>
implies that there is a distinction between you and the world.
<br>
<p>I don't share such dreams, perhaps you'd like to expand on what you mean 
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>Identity is, I think, linked into consciousness in that way.
<br>
<p>Obviously, lots of things have identity, and also there is a difference 
<br>
between identity in the sense that we ascribe &quot;identity&quot; to a thing 
<br>
across history.
<br>
<p>The point was that the supposed gaps in consciousness identified during 
<br>
sleep may not be gaps in consciousness, but in fact gaps in memory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Identity, for me, can cope with the discontinuities of sleep and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;personality change. It is a linguistic term, and people don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;trouble understanding that a person can change drastically, yet still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;refer to them by the same name. Identity has many forms, only some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which are affected by discontinuity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yeah, but I would think that those you're responding to would reply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that while identity might be able to cope, consciousness wouldn't. (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't have a problem with this view, because I think of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as an almost empty concept.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The point was that the supposed gaps in consciousness identified during 
<br>
sleep may not be gaps in consciousness, but in fact gaps in memory.
<br>
<p>If you accept that, then obviously identity is strictly related to 
<br>
consciousness, for a consciousness has a unique history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Perhaps it's better to say that human identity isn't damaged by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;discontinuity. Perhaps the question is what kinds of discontinuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;constitute &quot;harm&quot; to the individual, and which do not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not sure, but I don't think anyone *is* claiming this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I thought, that in claiming that consciousness was interrupted nightly, 
<br>
traditional concepts of identity were not strictly correct, because it 
<br>
was wrong to use &quot;the same&quot; to describe a person's consciousness before 
<br>
and after sleep.
<br>
