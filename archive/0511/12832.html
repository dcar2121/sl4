<p>When people pick three common English words that are supposed to contain
<br>
the secret of safely navigating the Singularity, I usually think of a
<br>
tribal shaman futilely shouting the 'magic words' into the path of an
<br>
oncoming tornado. No set of three words has anything like the descriptive
<br>
power to do anything useful. All they are going to do is cause you to
<br>
emphasise some parts of your own goal system over others; my interpretation
<br>
of 'safety, diversity and fairness' isn't going to be anything like yours
<br>
when implemented as a Singularity strategy, nor is my interpretation of
<br>
'joy, choice and growth' going to be anything like Ben's. When used as
<br>
a title for a long document that actually provides useful description
<br>
and formally defined implementation mechanisms, I'd /still/ suggest such
<br>
loaded terms are better avoided because it sets up strong expectations
<br>
that strongly affect how the document will be (mis)interpreted. Even as
<br>
a one-line summing up at the end you risk people quoting that one line
<br>
in isolation and /that/ being misinterpreted. When found on their own
<br>
like this, I think the whole idea of 'three magic terms that tell you how
<br>
to save the world' can safely be classified as 'worse than useless'. You
<br>
can't do Singularity strategy by employing the cognitive machinery humans
<br>
have to optimise our speech to sound convincing/impressive/intelligent
<br>
to other people, or our tendency to summarise complex positions into
<br>
manageable slogans.
<br>
<p>That said, feel free to translate your three words into a detailed
<br>
description that actually imposes strong objective constraints on the
<br>
actions of whoever you think should build the FAI. You may well have
<br>
such a model in mind, but no three words however well chosen are going
<br>
to be enough to get other people to envision it. Indeed, if past
<br>
history is anything to go by it's going to be an uphill struggle to
<br>
be understood even if you're an excellent writer and write a book
<br>
length description.
