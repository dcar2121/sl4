<p>I wouldn't say that either intelligence or ambition--or focus or
<br>
organization or anything else--are limiting factors. For that to be
<br>
so, an increase in one factor wouldn't lead to an overall greater
<br>
success past a point. But I don't think this holds. While a complete
<br>
lack of ambition may make it so that a greater intelligence doesn't
<br>
yield much more success, it's more of a NBNS thing--necessary, but not
<br>
sufficient--than it is a limiting thing. For reasonable levels of
<br>
ambition and intelligence and other factors, I think an increase in
<br>
one would always increase lon-term success.
<br>
<p>Here's another quality that I think is necessary for accomplishment.
<br>
Single-mindedness. One of my own main limiting factors is a curiousity
<br>
that's unable to sit for very long on any one subject. I work very
<br>
hard on a large number of different things. It seems to me that this
<br>
particular affliction is quite common among the intelligent and is at
<br>
least as responsible for lost accomplishment as a lack of ambition.
<br>
<p>I think it probably has something to do with want to be holistic, with
<br>
wanting to have a good grasp on the wider principles of everything.
<br>
And part of it is being smart enough to see how terrible one's
<br>
toolchain is and wanting to work on improving it instead of working on
<br>
using it to make something--spending time on &quot;meta&quot; aspects of one's
<br>
pursuits.
