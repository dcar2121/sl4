<p><p>The sense of smell is actually tremendously important to being human, or  
<br>
being any animal.  It's fundamental.  The thing is, it's considerably less  
<br>
conscious than the other senses.  Your emotional state right now has a lot  
<br>
to do with what you are smelling right now, even if there's no smell  
<br>
that's strong enough to get your attention.
<br>
<p>I don't think that means that using smell as a conduit for electronic  
<br>
information would be a bad idea.  On the contrary, once we start to make  
<br>
use of smell in creating our virtual worlds we will finally feel at home  
<br>
in them in a very deep way.
<br>
<p><p>I'm not sure I agree with the premises of this conversation, though.  Why  
<br>
would we need to put more I/O on the human brain at this point?  That  
<br>
doesn't seem like the bottleneck to me.  Humans have hardly anything else  
<br>
except I/O.  Declarative memory, that's a bottleneck.
