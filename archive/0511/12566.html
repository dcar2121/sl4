<em>&gt;Whoa - I was seriously startled by the idea that other mammals might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have brains with a different number of layers than ours.  So I Googled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what do you know?  Some mammals don't have 6 layers.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;They have 7.
</em><br>
<p>I stand corrected. My Google kung-fu is weak.
<br>
<p>So, the apparent answer to the question of adding sensory modalities to
<br>
an existing human is that, since the cortex is accounted for by the
<br>
existing senses plus motor control, you would have to accept the loss of
<br>
cortical tissue to some other sense in order to make room for a new one,
<br>
and obviously the bandwidth required by the new sense would dictate the
<br>
area you would be required to forefeit. So the question then becomes,
<br>
which existing input stream is the least necessary for success in the
<br>
modern human environment? i.e. Which could we get rid of with the least
<br>
amount of impact on daily life? I don't seem to be using my sense of
<br>
smell very often . . .
