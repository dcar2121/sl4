<p>Woah, stop right here. You just stopped talking about consciousness
<br>
and stepped over into identity. I really don't see that the two
<br>
concepts are the same. Identity is about your memories, your thought
<br>
processes. A sense of identity is not necessary for consciousness. I
<br>
have many dreams in which I have no sense of identity at all. (I
<br>
suppose you could argue that I'm not really conscious during those
<br>
dreams, but I'm not going to help you out there.) Nor is subjective
<br>
consciousness strictly necessary for an intelligence that,
<br>
objectively, claims to have a sense of identity, if you allow that
<br>
objective consciousness doesn't imply subjective consciousness. (I
<br>
think it does imply that.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; an idealisation,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer the final way.
</em><br>
<p>I'm open to any of these.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Identity, for me, can cope with the discontinuities of sleep and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble understanding that a person can change drastically, yet still
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are affected by discontinuity.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, but I would think that those you're responding to would reply
<br>
that while identity might be able to cope, consciousness wouldn't. (I
<br>
don't have a problem with this view, because I think of consciousness
<br>
as an almost empty concept.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps it's better to say that human identity isn't damaged by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discontinuity. Perhaps the question is what kinds of discontinuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitute &quot;harm&quot; to the individual, and which do not?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure, but I don't think anyone *is* claiming this.
