</em><br>
<p>It's pretty well established that IQ differences are real and
<br>
important.  Within the population of highly intelligent people, I
<br>
would identify one good predictor of &quot;having goofy beliefs&quot; as
<br>
&quot;belonging to a high IQ society.&quot;  Langan actually started one.
<br>
<p>A few years ago I  joined Mensa out of curiosity.  What I found was a
<br>
group of fairly smart people who wasted their intellectual gifts
<br>
playing board games and socializing.  I had enough friends to do that
<br>
on my own and didn't need to pay $50 per year for it.  What I also
<br>
found is that there were few people my age (I was 22 at the time). 
<br>
There were a lot of middle aged people, including what seemed to be a
<br>
large number middle aged housewives and people with menial jobs.  Now,
<br>
there's nothing wrong with being a bartender or a grocery store clerk
<br>
or a housewife, but it's obvious that some these people sought out an
<br>
organization like Mensa because they weren't getting the intellectual
<br>
stimulation that they needed in their personal lives (Langan, btw, is
<br>
a bouncer).  Mensa states that it wants to provide a forum where
<br>
intelligent people can work together to solve the world's problems. 
<br>
But the people who are already solving the world's problems --
<br>
doctors, scientists, engineers -- have already surrounded themselves
<br>
with other smart people and get the stimulation that they need.  They
<br>
tend not to join places like Mensa, which is why Mensa will never
<br>
fulfill its goal and will always be a place where people play
<br>
scrabble.
<br>
<p>What I also found is a place where a disconcerting number of people
<br>
were devoutly religious, believed in UFOs, and other pseudoscientific
<br>
and even nonsensical things.  I couldn't understand then why so many
<br>
smart people could believe such dumb things, but I think now it's
<br>
because so many of them aren't part of the larger
<br>
intellectual/academic landscape.  You can be intelligent without
<br>
having formal training in critical thinking skills (as members of this
<br>
list, so well versed in probability theory, should know).  That, among
<br>
other things, may be Langan's biggest problem.  For anybody who has
<br>
read Tversky et al. or the other suggestions on the SIAI booklist on
<br>
human reasoning, you know that it doesn't necessarily come naturally,
<br>
even for intelligent people.  In fact, as Michael Shermer points out,
<br>
intelligent people can be among the most intractable because they can
<br>
defend erroneous beliefs with such alacrity.
<br>
<p>My point is that an IQ score is a pretty good predictor of success,
<br>
but not the only one.  A rigorous methodology for making accurate
<br>
inferences must still be learned.  Paying attention to the scientific
<br>
mainstream is pretty important.  Concensus science has passed the test
<br>
of falsifiability by many smart people.  Langan might think that since
<br>
he's profoundly smarter than any individual scientist, he can
<br>
pontificate in his ivory tower and come up with a closer description
<br>
of reality than scientists can, but he's not smarter than the
<br>
aggregate knowledge of the scientific community.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Martin
