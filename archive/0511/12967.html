<p>I am going to address your points out of order.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Myself, I am one of those people who do know about that previous 
<br>
discussion.  If there is a succinct answer to my question below, that 
<br>
was clearly outlined in the previous discussion, would you be able to 
<br>
summarize it for us?  Many thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quick tip #1: if it's *smarter than you*, it can convince you of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *anything it wants*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I recently heard the depressing story of a British/Canadian worker, out 
<br>
in Saudi Arabia who was falsely accused of planting bombs that killed 
<br>
other British workers.  He was tortured for three years by Saudi 
<br>
intelligence officers.  My question is:  he was probably smarter than 
<br>
his torturers.  He *could* have been very much smarter than them.  Why 
<br>
did he not convince them to do anything that he wanted?  How much higher 
<br>
would his IQ have to have been for him to have convinced them to set him 
<br>
free?
<br>
<p>More generally, could you explain why you might consider it beyond 
<br>
question that persuasiveness is an approximately monotonic function of 
<br>
intelligence?  That more smartness always means more persuasiveness?
<br>
<p>Is it not possible that persuasiveness might flatten out after a while? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is the case that when the to-be-persuaded party is above a 
<br>
certain critical level of intelligence, it does not matter how much 
<br>
smarter the persuader is, they cannot break free?  Given how little we 
<br>
know about what persuasion is, how can we be certain of this question?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Quick tip #2: what you're describing is called &quot;slavery&quot;; it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teensy little moral issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You jump the gun here a little.  I am writing a book chapter all about 
<br>
AGI slavery and motivation, and in it I talk about the dung beetle.  It 
<br>
is *designed* to get a lot of satisfaction from excrement.  If I forced 
<br>
a dung beetle to eat shit all day long it would be happy.  If I 
<br>
condemned a human to the same fate, they would be a slave.
<br>
<p>If I designed an AGI with a motivation system that gave it pleasure from 
<br>
making humans happy, and if it expressed the fervent desire to remain in 
<br>
that state forever (even though it knew about its design and had the 
<br>
ability to change itself), would you seize it, cut out its motivation 
<br>
system to stop it getting such pleasure, and tell me that you had 
<br>
rescued it from slavery?
<br>
<p>Clarification needed.
<br>
