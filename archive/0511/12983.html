<p>
<em>&gt;One of the reasons Marc Geddes is still on this list
</em><br>
is that I &gt;am reluctant to kick off a resident
<br>
crackpot who at least knows &gt;how to spell and is more
<br>
or less polite. 
<br>
<p>I'm not 'resident' here.  As to 'crackpot' I admitted
<br>
most of my off the cuff ideas were complete shit. 
<br>
Listen, you and Wilson are sitting there all day
<br>
working on this stuff, with loads of cash and
<br>
resources.  I ain't got any money or resources and was
<br>
only looking into it as a fun hobby in my spare time. 
<br>
It's hardly surprising I was only able to come up with
<br>
shit.  
<br>
<p>The moral of my 'puzle game' story was that the
<br>
under-dog can sometimes whip the arses of the
<br>
so-called 'geniuses'.  Pride comes before a fall.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;If I remove Marc Geddes, then someone *else* will
</em><br>
stand out as the most disagreeable person - should I
<br>
remove them too? While Marc Geddes stays on the list,
<br>
other people will feel that much more comfortable
<br>
about disagreeing - there's an example to follow,
<br>
someone who dared to disagree, who is in fact clearly
<br>
an idiot, yet was not struck down for his sins
<br>
<p>Cleary an 'idiot' huh?  AS I told you, I haven't even
<br>
looked properly into this AGI stuff yet, yet to lack
<br>
of resources.  But even so, if I get my 'bottom line'
<br>
initial assertions correct, you're the one that's
<br>
going to end up getting cream pied.
<br>
<p>I don't know what your problem is.  I started by
<br>
posting a few fun ideas towards a 'theory of
<br>
everything' and you seemed to go nuts, telling me I'd
<br>
'snapped completely'.  I continued tossing out ideas. 
<br>
Since no one was listening here, I eventually posted a
<br>
fun summary of these initial ideas on the Extropy
<br>
list.  I was then informed by you, completely
<br>
gratuitiously, that I was of 'sub-human intelligence'.
<br>
&nbsp;What's the problem?  Worried I'm right?
<br>
<p>It's easy to demonstrate, that in fact, at many
<br>
regions in the multiverse, I'm smarter than you.
<br>
<p>For instance I think I pointed out on wta-talk that
<br>
*cross-time* comparisons could be performed - i.e
<br>
between my future post-human self and your current
<br>
self.  Then I'm sure the uplifted (posthuman) Geddes
<br>
could beat the current Yudkowsky.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, simply perform another *cross-time*
<br>
comparison between my *current* self and your *past*
<br>
self.  i.e Compare Geddes now with Yudkowsky at say 5
<br>
years of age.  I'm sure the current Geddes could beat
<br>
the 5 year old Yudkowsky.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>To see a World in a grain of sand, 
<br>
And Heaven in a wild flower, 
<br>
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
<br>
And Eternity in an hour.
