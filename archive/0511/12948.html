<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; SIAI's notion of Friendliness assurance relies on being able to design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI specifically for the sake of verifiability.  Needless to say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are not so designed.  Needless to say, it is not a trivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project to thus redesign a human.  I cannot imagine going about it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such way as to preserve continuity of personal identity, the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human cognitive architecture, or much of anything.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... Regarding your latter sentence, I'm not sure why you feel this
<br>
way.  But it's an interesting question, to which I don't have an
<br>
answer.  If there is a detailed line of reasoning underlying your
<br>
statement I'd be curious to hear it.
<br>
<p>The question you raise is is: given any two minds M and N, is it
<br>
possible to create a series of intermediate minds M1, M2, M3, ..., M_n
<br>
so that
<br>
<p>* M_i is c-similar to M_(i+1)
<br>
* M_1 is c-similar to M
<br>
* M_n is c-similar to N
<br>
<p>where
<br>
<p>A is c-similar to B
<br>
<p>means
<br>
<p>&quot;if A is transformed into B then there is a strong feeling of
<br>
continuity of consciousness through the transition.&quot;
<br>
<p>As you very likely recall Greg Egan posited a series of minds like
<br>
this in his novel Diaspora, bridging human and alien minds; but he was
<br>
after &quot;communication similarity&quot; rather than &quot;continuity of
<br>
consciousness similarity.&quot;  That is, the minds in his series were
<br>
markedly separate beings without &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; joining
<br>
them.  His goal was just that M_n should be able to communicate
<br>
clearly with M_(n+1).
<br>
<p>For M_n to be transformed into M_(n+1) while preserving the feeling of
<br>
&quot;selfness&quot; requires a much higher degree of similarity than between
<br>
the beings in Egan's series, of course.
<br>
<p>I don't find it very clear at the moment whether or not it is always
<br>
possible to construct a series like this.  This seems to me to depend
<br>
in a subtle way on the ways that the subjective experiences of
<br>
&quot;selfness&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; are constructed within (various sorts
<br>
of) minds.  You seem to believe that the construction of such series
<br>
is not possible if the mind-types are too different, but I'm wondering
<br>
if you have any solid reasons, or even any clearly-articulable
<br>
intuitions, in support of this hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Ben Goertzel
