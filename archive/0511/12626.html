<em>&gt;For the rest of this post, I'm going to assume that child prodigies are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talented kids with quantitively more talent, not something qualitatively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different.  I don't really know, I've never met (to my knowledge a prodigy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;{not counting Eliezer, whom I've never met in the flesh}, but I went 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through an accelarated learning programme at high school, so I know a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about how talented kids develop and end up
</em><br>
<p>Ollie, an &quot;accelerated learning program&quot; tells  you nothing at all about how 
<br>
relevantly talented kids develop.  Among other things, accelerated relative 
<br>
to IQ 100 still probably means within the range where everything correlates 
<br>
pretty well with 'g', while beyond about 2 SD most correlations fall 
<br>
dramatically.  Second, prodigies are not just talented kids only more so, or 
<br>
at least, they aren't generated by the same normal distribution that 
<br>
generates talented kids.  The article I cited indicates a normal 
<br>
distributino SAT score of 520 SD 140 for 12 year olds, a value strongly 
<br>
consistant with they hypothesis that SAT performance is an approximately 
<br>
linear function of age (consistant with the mental over physical age 
<br>
definition of IQ) Based on that distribution, Eliezer's score would be 6.93 
<br>
SD from the mean.  Scores like that don't occur in normal distributions.  
<br>
Such a score might occur in a log normal distribution, which is actually a 
<br>
better fit to IQ data than a normal distribution, one time a few million, 
<br>
but Eliezer is not the most extreme case of high performance.  Sho Yano, 
<br>
currently 13 or 14 and a MD/PhD at the University of Chicago, scored 1500 
<br>
(post 1996, similar to Eliezer's 1410) at age 8.  Even a log-normal 
<br>
distribution predicts no such data points, even after regressing to the 
<br>
mean.  Empirically, mice genetically engineered to express more of the 
<br>
enzyme CREB learn about ten times faster than ordinary mice but their 
<br>
learning levels off at a level achievable by normal mice.  Prodigies might 
<br>
have some comparable neurochemical characteristics, combined with parents 
<br>
who enable them to use their abilities to learn material appropriate to 
<br>
their abilities rather than to their age (far too many parents and most 
<br>
schools would not enable this).  The above model suggests little benefit in 
<br>
seeking out prodigies, but lacks sufficient evidence to be held as anything 
<br>
but a hypothesis.  The truth is, we don't know that much about prodigies, 
<br>
probably not enough to know if they could be useful.  If we had unlimited 
<br>
resources, finding out would be worth while.  With current resources it 
<br>
still might be, but probably not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;SIAI needs persons with expertise in computers and cognitive studies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(roughly).  Persons with expertise in pure maths or physics could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;useful, but not particularly.
</em><br>
<p>SIAI needs geniuses in pure logic and applied rationality.  The computer and 
<br>
cog-sci stuff are only needed at the ordinary &quot;expert&quot; level, though more is 
<br>
better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, because my brain is unwilling to remember any word that's not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;English, I can't learn complete languages to save myself.
</em><br>
<p>Funny.  I learn new vocab easily, but can't keep languages seperate in my 
<br>
mind.  Talk to me in Spanish and I'll probably answer in Russian.  Also, I 
<br>
can't learn accents *at all*.
<br>
<p>It doesn't really matter what things ordinary adults might incorrectly 
<br>
expect someone to excel in.  All that matters is &quot;can someone develop FAI 
<br>
theory&quot;.  So far, we know of one person who can.  He's sort of an ex-prodigy 
<br>
(depending on the definition) and his childhood ability set was definitely 
<br>
not the result of a normal distribution.  Not a lot of data to go on, but at 
<br>
least suggestive enough that given time following that line of thought might 
<br>
be wise.
