</em><br>
<p>Why would you /want/ to invest in this strategy?
<br>
<p>As mentioned by others, prodigies are more likely to be outstanding 
<br>
adults in various fields.  However, the best indicator for the expertise 
<br>
of an adult is not their expertise as a child, but their expertise as an 
<br>
adult.
<br>
<p>(For the rest of this post, I'm going to assume that child prodigies are 
<br>
talented kids with quantitively more talent, not something qualitatively 
<br>
different.  I don't really know, I've never met (to my knowledge) a 
<br>
prodigy {not counting Eliezer, whom I've never met in the flesh}, but I 
<br>
went through an accelarated learning programme at high school, so I know 
<br>
a bit about how talented kids develop and end up)
<br>
<p>Gifted children often have talent areas. 
<br>
<p>Tangent:  As a rule, math/science talents tend to make academic 
<br>
performance and mathsy accelaration easier - when you chuck an 
<br>
artistically talented kid into the senior years of high school early, 
<br>
they struggle more with the maths than mathsy kids with no artistic bent 
<br>
struggle with their relative inability to draw.   Anywhoodle...
<br>
<p>SIAI needs persons with expertise in computers and cognitive studies 
<br>
(roughly).  Persons with expertise in pure maths or physics could be 
<br>
useful, but not particularly.
<br>
<p>Child prodigies with a talent in Maths/sci will generally have the 
<br>
capability to learn computer stuff, but if they don't learn it as they 
<br>
develop, they're going to have a relatively hard time learning it as an 
<br>
adult.  Theres a good chance that as they grow older, children with 
<br>
Potential (Aargh! the dreaded P-word!) to be Seed AI programmers will 
<br>
decide that learning physics so that they can prove Einstein wrong is 
<br>
more fun than learning assembly, and so they won't pursue that avenue.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Another thing: sometimes it looks as though children with talent will be 
<br>
outstanding in one particular area.  I tought myself Latin grammar in a 
<br>
year, and some people at the time thought I had a language talent.  
<br>
However, because my brain is unwilling to remember any word that's not 
<br>
English, I can't learn complete languages to save myself.  
<br>
Interestingly, trying to learn foreign vocabularies demonstrated that I 
<br>
have less ability than the average person to learn stuff by rote.  When 
<br>
I try to reach for a word in Latin, I often end up remembering a word in 
<br>
Chinese.  Useful.
<br>
<p>The point of this last tangent is that even though a kid with talents in 
<br>
logic, maths, and understanding machine code might seem like an ideal 
<br>
programmer or computer whiz, they might have anti-talent in a surprising 
<br>
area that means that they do not have significant potential in the areas 
<br>
that surrounding adults might think they do.
