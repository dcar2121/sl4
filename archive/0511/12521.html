<p>
The Globalization Dynamic and the Singularity
<br>
--Hank Conn
<br>
<p>Globalization has become a powerful force in the modern era, however, 
<br>
globalization has always been a force throughout history. It hasn’t been 
<br>
until the advent of recent technology that the dynamic power of 
<br>
globalization has really stepped up in power. What is this power? How can we 
<br>
represent this power as something more concrete?
<br>
<p>Globalization is the means of evening out the prior understandings for a 
<br>
large amount of people. (&lt;-- my thesis. here is the justification:)
<br>
<p>Although, upon any understanding or belief (a meme), the way this belief is 
<br>
represented (as something evil, something western, etc) can be and is widely 
<br>
varied and on sometimes opposite extremes throughout a population 
<br>
(abortion). However, as the prior understandings become better specified (as 
<br>
a specific piece of knowledge or belief, however complex), and better spread 
<br>
throughout the group, the better representation will prevail more often than 
<br>
the lesser representation. Moreover, as better representations are more 
<br>
recognized, this lead to even better representations, where the original 
<br>
representations are entirely implicit within the better representation (such 
<br>
that the negation of that specific representation has very feeble priors 
<br>
upon which to rest = Scientific Progress).
<br>
<p>Furthermore, those most militarily successful nations are, and will continue 
<br>
to always be, those with a better military. As the definition for “better 
<br>
military” radically changed during the cold war, the extreme necessity of 
<br>
science demanded radical Scientific Progress. Those people who always had 
<br>
the better representations (economically, politically, socially, and all the 
<br>
other forces that exist, with each respective of its own utility), were 
<br>
unlikely to deny any scientific progress, because as this rapidly advancing 
<br>
field grew in size, as did the better representations that were created 
<br>
through this process. The most important period of time in human history was 
<br>
the Cold War. Not only did this period represent a time of military funded 
<br>
extreme Scientific Progress, but also a time of “nation building”. The 
<br>
implications of “nation building” have been the same since the dawn of time. 
<br>
When one society dominates and engulfs another, drastic memetic exchange 
<br>
occurs, virtually to the point of dictatorial unification. As scientific 
<br>
progress was so rapid during the Cold War that thousands of new inventions 
<br>
were being created every day (an unprecedented scale in history)- and the 
<br>
vast majority of these memetic and material exchanges meant something very 
<br>
different for the concept of “nation building”. Because, obviously, modern 
<br>
life is extremely more complicated than any social, economic, political, etc 
<br>
etc etc, structure that has ever existed; The adjustment of prior 
<br>
understandings is extremely more dramatic. That is, a vast, not necessarily 
<br>
restructuring, but at least *structuring* returns based on this event (and 
<br>
in many cases during and as a result from the Cold War, RE-structuring took 
<br>
place, which was even more extremely dramatic of a change).
<br>
<p>However, in each time the structuring was a POSITIVE force, (especially a 
<br>
positive force as made by the United States), this gives the restructured 
<br>
nation their own independent *positive force*, such that they can socially, 
<br>
economically, religiously, etc, exert positive forces on other people.
<br>
<p>This whole new paradigm of understanding history gives entirely new light on 
<br>
the existing social, economic, and government structures: those that made 
<br>
people happier lasted longer. Natural selection, where the organism is any 
<br>
memetic structure, and those that resulted in unhappiness of the people 
<br>
lasted much shorter than those that resulted in happiness of the people.
<br>
<p>Thus, as globalization increases prior understanding, this leads to a better 
<br>
increase in technology, which leads to an increase of globalization, ad 
<br>
infinitum. Human society is in a closed loop, converging upon a single event 
<br>
in history which, by definition, to break this loop, either all of humanity 
<br>
must be extinct, all of the knowledge of humanity disappears (a virtually 
<br>
impossible phenomenon short of an extremely particular virus, designed for 
<br>
such a feat, as well as some sort of global, physical destruction of 
<br>
knowledge), or technology would reach the point of maximum utility, in terms 
<br>
of subjective human happiness. Whether we are more likely to become extinct 
<br>
or reach this point of maximum utility is questionable.
<br>
<p>As we all know, the physical universe, as we have always been gradually 
<br>
discovering (even to this day) is made up of smaller and smaller parts, 
<br>
whose intricate functions are so extremely complex that we all but fail to 
<br>
comprehend them. Furthermore, when we do succeed in implementing some useful 
<br>
function (on some level of complexity: in the modern era is has primarily 
<br>
been in electronics), this brings about radical changes in globalization, 
<br>
and on such in the loop. Furthermore, the more complexity that we are 
<br>
capable of handling, the more profound changes in globalization are 
<br>
possible. Currently, we are just barely scraping the nano-level of 
<br>
complexity. A description of times in which various complexity levels were 
<br>
broken is out of the range of this document.
<br>
<p>Also, as another optimization pressure, the capability Science has to 
<br>
*implement* technology on one level of complexity, allows for the creation 
<br>
of *tools* to *COMPREHEND* and *create implementations* on the next level of 
<br>
complexity, and furthermore, implementations of one level of complexity 
<br>
higher allow for a level of magnitude higher utility *conceptual 
<br>
representations*, as well as *material products*.
<br>
<p>The most important conclusion of this document is the convergence of 
<br>
technology to its maximum utility level: namely, the Singularity. The 
<br>
Singularity is what is represented as the breaking point between the 
<br>
maximization of this utility curve on one side, and the extinction of the 
<br>
human race on the other. With the advent of superhuman intelligence (which 
<br>
could be derived from some artificial intelligence program, or human 
<br>
modifications by drugs, surgery, or other means of increasing intelligence), 
<br>
the Singularity occurs, and at that point we have no means of predicting 
<br>
what will happen, because the level of memetic prior understanding will be 
<br>
drastically different at that point, and changing very rapidly (as it 
<br>
already is: every human is always in a constant flux of information of 
<br>
better ideas, and constantly being provided every day with a better 
<br>
product). Some single human or AI program will have the *entire* memetic and 
<br>
technological loop which has powered the entire populace of humanity since 
<br>
it ever exited directly within its control. The more intelligent the entity 
<br>
becomes, the faster it can make itself more intelligent, as well as the more 
<br>
powerful their control over the entire human race.
<br>
<p><p>(As a side note: This is also my reasoning for supporting the war- it is a 
<br>
powerful factor in the globalization process which has so powerfully 
<br>
benefited humanity thus far)
