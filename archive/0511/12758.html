<p>Whoa - I was seriously startled by the idea that other mammals might

have brains with a different number of layers than ours.  So I Googled.

&nbsp;And what do you know?  Some mammals don't have 6 layers.

<p><p>Cortical Layer VII and Persistent Subplate Cells in Mammalian Brains
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
<p>Layer VII is the deepest cortical layer in rats, and consists of a thin
<br>
layer of persistent subplate cells overlain by a cell-sparse,
<br>
myelin-rich stratum through which many corticocortical axons travel.
<br>
Layer VII neurons participate in local and long-distance
<br>
corticocortical connections. The present study was undertaken to
<br>
determine whether layer VII is a typical feature in rodent brains, and
<br>
to determine which other mammalian taxa exhibit a layer VII. The adult
<br>
brains of 144 species from 22 orders were examined. Of these, 43
<br>
species in 6 orders exhibit a layer VII. These include the sciurognath
<br>
Rodentia, Insectivora, Paucituberculata, Paramelemorphia, some
<br>
Xenarthra, and some Chiroptera. In all taxa interstitial cells were
<br>
observed scattered throughout the white matter. The observed
<br>
distribution of layer VII in this sample of mammalian taxa suggests
<br>
that layer VII is a typical feature in some orders, but is not present
<br>
in most orders. The heterogeneous distribution of layer VII in the
<br>
Rodentia and Chiroptera suggests that species-level developmental
<br>
dynamics are involved. It is hypothesized that the timing of subplate
<br>
apoptosis in relation to the establishment of corticocortical
<br>
connections is the major factor that determines whether layer VII is
<br>
present in the adult stage.
