</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michaels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michaels is a professor of environmental sciences at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the University of Virginia, past president of the American 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Association of State Climatologists, past program chair 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Change...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wait a minute!  Isn't that the UN Panel you quoted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; providing definite evidence and proof of your position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you should READ what Michaels has to say on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject so that you can know the disagreements and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how the actual findings are frequently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misinterpreted by the press and others with a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axe to grind.
</em><br>
<p>Let's read, instead, what the vast majority of other climate scientists 
<br>
say about Michaels.
<br>
<p>In 2003, Michaels threatened to sue a fellow scientist Peter Gleick, 
<br>
after Gleick told The Star Press of Muncie, Indiana, that Michaels &quot;is 
<br>
one of a very small minority of nay-sayers who continue to dispute the 
<br>
facts and science about climate change in the face of compelling, 
<br>
overwhelming, and growing evidence. ... I consider that Michaels is to 
<br>
the science of climate change like the Flat Earth Society is to the 
<br>
science of planetary shape.&quot;
<br>
<p>What happened to scientific discussion?  Since when did a scientist sue 
<br>
someone for disagreeing with him?
<br>
<p>Harvard University professor John Holdren told the U.S. Senate 
<br>
Republican Policy Committee, &quot;Michaels is another of the handful of U.S. 
<br>
climate-change contrarians, but lacks [MIT professor and fellow 
<br>
contrarian] Richard Lindzen's scientific stature. He has published 
<br>
little if anything of distinction in the professional literature, being 
<br>
noted rather for his shrill op-ed pieces and indiscriminate 
<br>
denunciations of virtually every finding of mainstream climate science.&quot;
<br>
<p>He sounds like THE person to cite, doesn't he?
<br>
<p>When the previous poster said &quot;The ENTIRE scientific community&quot; agrees 
<br>
that global warming is real, he was exaggerating for effect, but the 
<br>
magnitude of his statement was accurate:  the vast majority of the 
<br>
scientific community who understand the issues well enough DO agree.
<br>
<p>The greatest threat to science today comes from ideological groups who 
<br>
say the kind of thing that you just did: &quot;Maybe there is a problem; 
<br>
maybe there isn't.&quot; as if one or two contrarians (who have received 
<br>
enormous amounts of money from industry groups) are equal in weight to 
<br>
several hundred experts (who just draw a scientist's paltry salary) who 
<br>
say the opposite.
