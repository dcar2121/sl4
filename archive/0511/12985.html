<p><em>&gt; I repeat:  why is extreme smartness capable of extreme persuasion?

<p>At the risk of being redundant:
<br>
<p>When we ask if an extremely intelligent being can be extremely
<br>
persuasive to humans, we are not wondering about the nature of
<br>
intelligence, but about the nature of human beings. The real question
<br>
is: &quot;how exloitable are human beings?&quot; If human beings can in principle
<br>
be manipulated to perform a certain action, then sufficiently powerful
<br>
inference would be able to figure out how.
<br>
<p>So how exploitable are we? As a lower bound, we can say that human
<br>
beings can in principle be convinced to do anything that one human being
<br>
has convinced another human being to do.
<br>
<p>This lower bound can't be anywhere near what can be done in principle,
<br>
though, because the effort that has gone into solving the problem of
<br>
exploiting humans, while gargantuan, is nowhere near appropriate to the
<br>
size of the problem. Understanding how to optimally exploit humans is on
<br>
the order of the difficulty of fully understanding human cognition.
<br>
<p>So far, no serious general intelligence has been used to try to solve
<br>
this problem. Human general intelligence is very small compared to all
<br>
of human cognition, which is what we are attempting to analyze when we
<br>
try to exploit other humans. So when manipulating people, we have to use
<br>
specialized tools which we evolved for this purpose.
<br>
<p>I strongly suspect that, when trying to predict the actions of others,
<br>
we look to our own decision mechanisms and extrapolate that others would
<br>
make analogous decisions. This would be more likely to fail when dealing
<br>
with a human who is very different from yourself, for example someone
<br>
less intelligent. So the most generally intelligent people may not be
<br>
the best equipped to manipulate normal human beings (so I'm predicting
<br>
that, for someone on this list, an average man off the street would be a
<br>
more difficult gatekeeper in an AI-Box experiment than an average
<br>
college graduate).
<br>
<p>So I'm saying that more intelligence should not help a human to
<br>
manipulate other humans as much as it would help with other tasks.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, for a mind smart enough to socialize with humans
<br>
_using general intelligence_, a little more intelligence should go a
<br>
long way.
