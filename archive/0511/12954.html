<em>&gt; &gt; Ben, you're framing the question as if there's an objective basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subjective &quot;continuity of consciousness.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe there is such an objective basis, even though our current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science of mind is not deep enough to tell us much about this basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By an objective basis, I mean a reductionist explanation for under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what conditions a mind will describe itself as having the subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of &quot;continuity of consciousness.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Okay, then we're in agreement to this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the case of a series of mindstates transitioning between M and N,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is possible that M will describe itself as having the subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; but N will not.
</em><br>
<p>Okay so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case, the kind of &quot;continuous awareness thread&quot; I was talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about cannot exist.
</em><br>
<p>Your statement asserts the &quot;existence&quot; of a &quot;continuous awareness
<br>
thread&quot; that was being reported on, when it would be more accurate to
<br>
say simply that each iteration of the mind reported experiencing a
<br>
sense of continuity. This is where I think you again begin to mix the
<br>
subjective with the objective.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It may be that a theorem-proving-based Friendly mind would not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subjective experience of &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; but this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from demonstrated.  My guess is that such a mind *would* have such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an experience, although it would also be acutely aware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitations of this experience as a summary of what goes on inside its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, and would also have many other forms of subjective experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we cannot currently conceive.
</em><br>
<p>While I don't necessarily disagree with this paragraph, it too seems
<br>
to blur the distinction as earlier.  For example, to say that a mind
<br>
&quot;has&quot; the subjective experience rather than a mind &quot;reports&quot; the
<br>
subjective experience.  To say that it &quot;has&quot; an experience seems to
<br>
invoke that Cartesian dualism that is so ingrained in human thinking
<br>
but has no functional representation (except as a model of that
<br>
subsystem of human thinking.)  It's a powerful illusion.  And
<br>
completely real and modelable--the illusion, that is.
<br>
<p>My own thinking about advanced minds is that they will be highly aware
<br>
(meaning able to effectively incorporate a wide range of sense data
<br>
into their model) of their world and their internal operation, and
<br>
they will be able to communicate with us in our language, mapping
<br>
misleading and ambiguous human phraseology (when appropriate) onto
<br>
their more precise message, but that they will have no use for the
<br>
illusion of subjective experience since they will have more direct
<br>
access to the more objective information relevant to achieving their
<br>
goals.
