Good point. I was quite struck by Eliezer's fear of &quot;reverting to the 
<br>
mean&quot;. He clearly meant this in a way which captured both &quot;staying 
<br>
ambitious&quot; and also &quot;living up to the potential of his IQ&quot; yet those are 
<br>
two different things. It appears that most people agree with me that 
<br>
they are not one and the same, and that for whatever reason, most of the 
<br>
high IQ people alive today are not ferociously ambitious in that sense.
<br>
<p>I wonder, thought, whether restlessness in this area is not common. I do 
<br>
believe that IQ is something real, and that it is a limiting factor in 
<br>
understanding some things. I think of IQ as being the average height of 
<br>
a map of intellectual abilities.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, I wonder whether we will not need the assistance of 
<br>
pre-singularity superintelligences to understand the meaning of 
<br>
post-singularity ones. In many ways computers today are already beyond 
<br>
the comprehension of a single person. The workings of a computer rely on 
<br>
logic, computer programming, but also materials science and engineering, 
<br>
even social science in the form of the success of the Internet to 
<br>
function as they do. While their IQ is low, they are already amazing. We 
<br>
use computers to build computers already.
<br>
<p>It is an interesting discussion of personal responsibility, which feeds 
<br>
into Eliezer's desire not to revert to the mean, to what degree we 
<br>
should concentrate on the Singularity. (E here stands in for many other 
<br>
people who see this as a Very Important Thing). I am less ... personal 
<br>
about my responsibilities. If a superintelligence does not maintain our 
<br>
safety or pursue our goals, then who are we really to constrain it to 
<br>
things which are within our limited understanding?
<br>
<p>I suspect that the Singularity will be less quick that most here 
<br>
imagine, undergoing a progression of improvement. I think we will see 
<br>
functioning robots before a distributed intelligence, for example, 
<br>
because people will solve little problems in non-general ways and cobble 
<br>
something together with it.
<br>
<p>People always overestimate the impact of technology in the short term, 
<br>
and underestimate it in the long term. For me, the transition period 
<br>
will be the most fascinating thing to be alive for, if I am that lucky. 
<br>
Perhaps I will live another 60 years, and perhaps that will be enough 
<br>
time. That would really be something to see, even if it's only the first 
<br>
stages of change. Beyond that, I am I dead, and what does it matter to 
<br>
me if the student surpasses the master?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
