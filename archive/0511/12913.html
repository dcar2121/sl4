<em>&gt;I googled about a bit, and: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Watson: 122 IQ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Crick: 115 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Feynman: 124 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Winning a Nobel Prize is no big deal, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;winning it with an IQ of 124 is really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--Richard Feynman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The earlier post about Einstein and his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blackboard hit the nail on the head: he achieved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relativity theory by obsessing about it &quot;like a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dog worrying a bone.&quot; It's what you do with what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you have. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By comparison, former NH governor and White House 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chief of staff John Sununu reputedly has a 180 IQ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and eidetic memory (both of which I would kill 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for) but somehow managed to be an utter fool in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my estimation (among other follies, circa 1990 he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ran a climate sim on his home computer, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couldn't have been much better than a 386 with a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasn't for real! When real climatologists running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supercomputers weren't willing to place total 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faith in their sims.) If there's a better parable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illustrating that IQ-isn't-everything, I'd like 
</em><br>

<p><p>Well, there are many important qualities besides IQ. 
<br>
Take my extreme disagreement with Eliezer about the
<br>
nature of mind.  No doubt he's absolutely convinced
<br>
(along, I'm quite sure with many others at SL4) that
<br>
I'm a total crack-pot and I'm equally absolutely
<br>
convinced he's 'mind blind'.  It's all horribly
<br>
frustrating because there's no way to cure either of
<br>
us of our blindnesses.  I can never know what it could
<br>
be like to be a super-genius (since I'm not one), so
<br>
in a sense I'm simply 'blind' to what Eli gets up to. 
<br>
May as well try to describe sight to a blind-man. 
<br>
Conversely, my general intuitions about the mind seem
<br>
absolutely obvious and clear-cut to me, but apparently
<br>
sound like gibberish to most others ;)  Again, may as
<br>
well try to describe sight to a blind man. 
<br>
Apparently, it just can't be done *sigh*
<br>
<p>Let me tell you a story:
<br>
<p>Some years back I was involved in a big world-wide
<br>
'treasure hunt' - you know - one of those 'puzzle
<br>
books' - you had to decipher the puzzle (hidden in
<br>
pictures) and there was a big cash prize at the end. 
<br>
Any way, this puzzle officially holds the record as
<br>
the most complex puzzle ever devised.  
<br>
<p>There were perhaps 10 000 from around the world
<br>
working on it over a sustained period of time -and yes
<br>
there were bulletin boards like SL4 where everyone
<br>
would come claiming to have the answer ;) - ah those
<br>
were the days.  Any way, even with tens of thousands
<br>
working on it non-stop and sharing their ideas on
<br>
bulletin boards, experts thought the puzzle was so
<br>
complex it might take 2 years to solve and the
<br>
time-limit for the puzzle was in fact 3 1/2 years (the
<br>
prize pool went to charity if it wasn't solved after
<br>
that time).
<br>
<p>Any way, up-shot was, a lot of people became very
<br>
obsessed with this big puzzle, including me (I mean
<br>
there really were people working on it non-stop).
<br>
<p>Strangely (may be this might sound a bit silly), the
<br>
quest for a solution that puzzle actually reminds me
<br>
very very much of the quest for Singularity.  Exactly
<br>
the same atmosphere.  The same obsession.  The same
<br>
super-genuius's working on it all day and claiming
<br>
that the answer was 'just around the corner'.  
<br>
<p>And here's the amusing punch-line to this story:  I
<br>
had my own ideas about what the solution was going to
<br>
look like.  I kept telling the super-geniuses that the
<br>
answer would involve a 'border square locator
<br>
algorithim' but they kept pooh-poohing me.  I kept
<br>
repeating it over and over on messageboards: 'You need
<br>
to look for a border square locator algorithm'.  The
<br>
super-geniues kept pooh-poohing me.  Honestly, there
<br>
were people EXACTLY like Wilson and Yudkowsky on that
<br>
game (perhaps not so quite in their league IQ wise,
<br>
but the same kind of personalities).    
<br>
<p>Guess what:  we got the end of the puzzle (after a few
<br>
years) and the solution involved - you guessed it -
<br>
<p>A FRIGGING BORDER SQUARE LOCTAOR ALGORITHM
<br>
<p>I whipped the arses of those super-geniuses.  No
<br>
kidding.  This is a true story.  I often think of that
<br>
puzzle game.  I often wonder how someone like Eliezer
<br>
or M.Wilson would have fared in that contest - would
<br>
they have solved the puzzle?  And how long would it
<br>
have taken them?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Those who are curious about my story and want to
<br>
check out the puzzle book in question - it's still
<br>
available in the shops.  Here's a link to the book on
<br>
Amazon in fact:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446524328/104-7038854-1568752?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446524328/104-7038854-1568752?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance</a><br>
<p>Of course the contest is closed now.  (It actually ran
<br>
from 1997-2000 if I recall correctly).  But I
<br>
definitely think that puzzle still stands as the
<br>
ultimate IQ test.
<br>
<p>The solution to the big puzzle was up on the net for a
<br>
couple of years I think, but the solution has been
<br>
taken down now.  And the solution is not in print.  So
<br>
the full solution now exists only in the heads of
<br>
those few thousands of us that lasted to the end ;)
<br>
<p>A true story.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
