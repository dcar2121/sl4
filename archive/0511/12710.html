<p>Yes, Google could conceivably have some secret project that will
<br>
produce a UFAI. So could tens of government organisations and hundreds
<br>
(if not thousands) of companies. Unless you're prepared to spend your
<br>
time lobbying Google researchers (or any of these other organisations)
<br>
to try and make them aware of the dangers, something which strikes me
<br>
as having a very low chance of success, there's nothing to be gained
<br>
by worrying about it in public.
<br>
<p>Generally unless you're actively involved in an AGI project or have
<br>
some other means of directly influencing one, debating FAI morality,
<br>
seed AI technology and Singularity strategy in general is a strictly
<br>
recreational activity. Speculation about secret projects that may or
<br>
may not be in progress isn't normally very satisfying in that regard.
<br>
<p>As for 'emergence' from the Internet, speculation at the level of
<br>
fluffy generalities is absolutely useless. If you think there's a
<br>
specific mechanism that could conceivably produce an AGI distributed
<br>
over the Internet, describe it, and we might have something to
<br>
discuss.
