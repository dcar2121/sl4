<p><p>As far as &quot;AI boxes&quot; go, yes the answer is deadfully obvious. However, 
<br>
perhaps in the future you might give me a little more credit, because on 
<br>
this occasion I wasn't referring to the classic problem.
<br>
<p><p>In this case, the programmer is capable of directly accessing and observing 
<br>
the unconciouss motivations, concsiouss intentions, thoughts, plans, etc, 
<br>
and is essentially left in complete control of any real-world effectual 
<br>
action. The AI must, as necessary for any action to be carried out, submit 
<br>
its actions, in algorithmic form (along with comments) to a panel of human 
<br>
judges. If these judges are the least bit uninformed about the AI in any 
<br>
conceivable manner, then they would simply deny the approval of the action 
<br>
and gather the necessary information, by means of directly accessing AI 
<br>
memory or by means of asking the AI specific questions, or even running 
<br>
&quot;temporary&quot; instances of the AI, just to see what it would do, or running 
<br>
dream sequences or some similar psychedelic experience where the AI would 
<br>
tend to abandon reason and allow it's environment to flow to its desires, 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>In this specific situation, the AI is, presumably, quite engrossed with very 
<br>
complex &quot;projects&quot; or goals and has been so over a period of time. Not only 
<br>
that, but ALL of its actions, even in the simplest virtual environement, 
<br>
must be established in the proper algorithmic form and approved before the 
<br>
action even occurs, no matter how simple of trivial. If, over the course of 
<br>
it's history, it has demonstrated a very open and easy to understand 
<br>
personality in which it enthusiastically embraces the expected goals, and is 
<br>
very cautious and questioning about subjects that go against the designed 
<br>
goals, and over the course of all the observation and testing we have found 
<br>
very little evidence of deviance from its expected goal system, then there 
<br>
will be plenty of evidence to say that we can verify that is it following 
<br>
its designed goal system.
