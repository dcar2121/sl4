Wow, that was a really sombre, insightful response to a piece of weak, 
<br>
flippant wannabe humour.
<br>
<p>My favorite page in Kurtzweil's &quot;The Singularity is near&quot; is the picture of 
<br>
him in the suit with the board.  Nonetheless, it is true that by recognising 
<br>
cultish tendencies, we can avoid cultish pitfalls.
<br>
<p>Thread steal:  What can be done for donations to the SIAI from other 
<br>
countries.  That is, what's the /best/ way to do it?  SIAI isn't registered 
<br>
in Australia as a non-profit, and I expect that donations from 
<br>
non-north-Americans won't help the institute with their donation limitation 
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>I am certainly not the person to help with this sort of thing.  Sure, I've 
<br>
spent an awful lot of time  volunteering for non-profits, but don't get me 
<br>
to look after the books, registering a new organisation.  I haven't put in a 
<br>
tax return in more than two years (are those sirens I hear?).
<br>
<p>Anyway, 'Tis the season to open up our wallets and shell out for every damn 
<br>
thing, so I might as well do my bit to get everyone to donate to my cult.  I 
<br>
mean, preferred charity.  Pfft.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=RE:%20Cultishness%20as%20a%20high-entropy%20state">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But there's a deeper question behind this, which most people don't think to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ask because they're too busy arguing that transhumanism is a cult or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternatively that transhumanism is not a cult.  *Why* isn't transhumanism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a cult?  Why *aren't* prospective transhumanists surrounded by wall-to-wall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proselytizers?  This is an anomaly, which needs to be explained.  Usually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when a room full of people agree with each other on something, they are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lot more obnoxious.
</em><br>
<p>Hee!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The second reason is that it's harder for cults to form over the Internet.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with that.  The first person in my family to join a cult (Mummy 
<br>
being born Catholic doesn't count) was my brother joining the Cult of the 
<br>
Sub-Genius.  I think he's officially a martyr now.  Sub-genius was around 
<br>
way before the net, but they've been helped.
<br>
<p>My father used to mock him for joining that cult.  Then he joined the cult 
<br>
that has probably benefitted most from the internet: Flying Spagghetti 
<br>
Monsterism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People think of cultishness as if it were a special case, a defect of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain causes or certain people.  It's not.  Cultishness happens by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;default, unless you exert work to keep the Cause in an unnatural condition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of noncultishness.
</em><br>
<p>Who thinks that it's only a few certain people?  Look at ANY religion's 
<br>
origins... well, not every, but...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What goes into this work?  Off the top of my head, here are some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious ones:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1)  Deliberately restrict the scope of the meme.  If you have ideas about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI, then *just* talk about AI.  Don't tell people what food to eat, what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clothes to wear, which music to listen to, what art to view, who to marry, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who to sleep with, who to vote for, which games to play, or how to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their own damn lives.
</em><br>
<p>Hear hear
