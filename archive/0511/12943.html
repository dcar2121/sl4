<em>&gt;From: &quot;David Picon Alvarez&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:eleuteri@myrealbox.com?Subject=Re:%20famous%20Eliezer,%20puzzle%20game">eleuteri@myrealbox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The following is quite an interesting opinion, and it is, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your own - why preface it by attributing it to me?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe that this kind of thinking, the &quot;what would Eliezer do&quot; thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no matter how well one knows Eliezer and how tractable Eliezer is about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought processes, is one of the reasons why many people consider the SIAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other SL4 groups as cultish.
</em><br>
<p>Are you insinuating that just because I have a poster of Eliezer on my 
<br>
bedroom wall, a &quot;Yudkowski is our saviour&quot; poster in my lounge and a &quot;What 
<br>
would Eliezer do?&quot; bumper sticker, that I'm somehow subscribing to some sort 
<br>
of cult? I find that personally offensive, as I do not believe in any sort 
<br>
of regious dogma.  My position that the Singularity is 50% likely to occur 
<br>
in the next 20 years, freeing us from drudgery and giving us eternal 
<br>
uploaded life within a few hours is based purely on rational analysis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Going back to Vassar's original comments, I find it a bit odd to suggest 
<br>
that /any/ clever AI researcher would be preaching that all good AI 
<br>
researchers ought to give up their hobbies, and focus every ounce of their 
<br>
attention on the Big Problem At Hand.
<br>
<p>Putting it in a different format:
<br>
<p>If you think that  in order to achieve a better morality, it's worthwhile to 
<br>
force suffering - even your own - you're sort of missing the point.
