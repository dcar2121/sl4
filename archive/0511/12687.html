<em>&gt; My gut estimate (I believe SIAI's estimate is higher) is that the absolute

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree with this assessment. With the addendum that while you may
<br>
need a group of qualified workers, you may not need more than two
<br>
Theorists.
<br>
<p>It's difficult to know for certain the manpower in private companies,
<br>
but I suspect you're estimating a bit low how many people are
<br>
involved, but for some values of 'senior level programmers' you may be
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>Here, we have four programmers working, with the team historically
<br>
somewhat higher.
<br>
<p>Numenta has two senior level software engineers employed for certain,
<br>
with more possible, and two more advertised for on the website.
<br>
<p>Novamente LLC's page mentioned 7 founders, and there are people who
<br>
have been involved in various other aspects of BioMind, AGIRI, and
<br>
similar.
<br>
<p>SIAI contains basically Eliezer (who isn't known to have done any
<br>
software development) and M Wilson, who has, and is listed as an
<br>
associate researcher, and seems to be fairly active. I have no
<br>
details, but his blog and such doesn't mention any other engineers on
<br>
staff that I recall.
<br>
<p>Cyc claims 60 employees, how many might be actual developers is
<br>
unknown. A publication by Michael Witbrock in 2003 on Cyc's internals
<br>
had 9 co-authors, which gives a plausible sounding lower bound.
<br>
<p>Stephen Omohundro presented at the Foresight Institute last year,
<br>
which seems to lend some credibility, though I can't find any
<br>
information on his &quot;Self Aware Systems&quot; company. This may mean he's on
<br>
his own.
<br>
<p>Ai Research, of which I can determine little, other than they are
<br>
slick webdevelopers, and have an unimpressive (if polished) chatbot,
<br>
appears to have several senior developers and a forum of Internet
<br>
volunteers, as well as some unique employment ideas.
<br>
<p>There are of course many other research projects, and commercial
<br>
ventures, which might plausibly fall under AI, but not AGI, so we may,
<br>
(at some risk) exclude them.
<br>
<p>Also, we have the plethora of people working in spare time, or on
<br>
their own. It's hard to gauge just what kind of effect this could
<br>
have. On one hand, many theoretical contributions have been made by
<br>
independents, in academic settings, or as part of open-source or
<br>
coordinated volunteer groups in other fields, but on the other hand,
<br>
it seems that any plausible development in AI would need to take place
<br>
in the context of an AI software supersystem, unless some simplifying
<br>
assumption may be found to modularise functions more than I'm aware.
<br>
<p>I think that the amount of research to be done precludes any one
<br>
person, but not any one company making large contributions.
<br>
Unfortunately, I don't think that the barriers to entry are such that
<br>
much prevents new companies or interests entering the field, and
<br>
out-manpowering the small, generally self-organized groups doing work
<br>
now, except the fact that no one believes any new results are
<br>
imminent, and the lack of a usable public theory.
<br>
<p>When the microsofts and Sun's of the world see exciting results, it
<br>
won't take much for them to replicate and overtake small firms with
<br>
anything but a colossal head start, unless someone manages to develop
<br>
much AI theory in relative isolation, and keep from having to release
<br>
much or any of the software to public attention, which seems extremely
<br>
unlikely.
<br>
<p>The 'head start' theory seems to underlie most attempts to capitalize
<br>
on AI, aside from dreams of a single person taking AI theory from
<br>
conception to Singularity by himself, and in a short time frame. The
<br>
head start itself could take the form of a software framework
<br>
development issue (if the AI requires an enormous amount of framework
<br>
and management, none of which need be released by someone verifying
<br>
performance, (possible)), a theory gap (proprietary or simply advanced
<br>
software theory that is difficult to discern by untrained, or
<br>
reverse-engineers(also possible)), or a time gap (AI confers massive
<br>
advantages within a short real-time frame, making it physically
<br>
difficult for others to do anything but ride behind you on their own,
<br>
later curves(hard takeoff, AI managed AI company, instantaneous market
<br>
dominance via universal licensing, there are various scenarios))
<br>
<p>It depends on what you're in this business for. I personally subscribe
<br>
to a version of the head start theory because I think that by
<br>
developing AI both sooner and myself, I have a chance to deflect the
<br>
use of AI into positive avenues. This both takes the form of myself
<br>
and others benefiting materially from the AI, and the prevention of
<br>
other negative outcomes.
<br>
<p>Making money is not really important, except that we are for the
<br>
moment capitalists, and money is the pseudo-liquid medium of exchange
<br>
and power. I need to generate a plan that includes sufficient money to
<br>
do what I want, in the same way it needs to be conformant to physical
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>The selection effects for AGI researchers are harsh, and I don't
<br>
expect that hiring will be easy. But people who are smart, interested,
<br>
and knowledgeable about these things are more likely to be in the
<br>
transhumanist community than elsewhere. Why would such hypothetical
<br>
people not seek out such things? Unless they were dissatisfied with
<br>
the culture to the point of self-isolation, which seems unlikely, the
<br>
only other explanation would be future-shock, which would tend to
<br>
limit their effectiveness as researchers, I should think.
<br>
<p>I'd be interested in hearing other comments or thoughts on this.
