There seems to be an extremist view, originating in Eastern thought,
<br>
but growing in popularity in the Western academic world, that the mind
<br>
is a set of continuously evolving processes (which it is) that has
<br>
little or no relationship to its past states.  These processes are
<br>
essentially a new consciousness from moment to moment.  In this
<br>
extreme view, I literally am a new consciousness each day, having
<br>
merely inherited the memories of events experienced by other
<br>
consciousnesses earlier in time.  Of course, my physical body and
<br>
brain were there for those events, but my brain was instantiating a
<br>
different consciousness than the one writing this e-mail.  All my
<br>
friends are brand spanking new minds as well, having no relationship
<br>
to the people that my Yesterday's Mind talked to.  We all live under
<br>
the illusion of continuous consciousness (or identity) simply because
<br>
it doesn't matter.  As long as today's consciousness keeps my genes
<br>
alive for today, it has served its purpose.
<br>
<p>However, in this extreme view, uploading is pointless.  You might as
<br>
well build a mind sim and blow your brains out.  You won't exist
<br>
tomorrow anyway, because it would just be another consciousness that
<br>
has inherited memories of your experiences today.  So you might as
<br>
well build the mind sim, kill yourself and let it continue living your
<br>
life with your memories.  It will quickly convince your friends (their
<br>
future instantiations at least) that it's you.
<br>
<p>This is a very neat and sophisticated theory of mind.  I also think
<br>
that it is profoundly and dangerously wrong.  It arises when we
<br>
conflate &quot;self&quot; with &quot;identity.&quot;  Yes, there is no physical nexus of
<br>
the self.  It is an abstraction created by the internal narrative. 
<br>
The self, then, evolves as thought patterns and the internal narrative
<br>
evolves.  However a mind can lack a self while having a specific
<br>
identity.  A self is an abstraction, but a mind is physical system in
<br>
the universe and therefore, by necessity, has a unique set of
<br>
spacetime coordinates.  A mind is a thermodynamic system constituting
<br>
both structure and function.  A mind in general doesn't need to be on
<br>
a neural substrate, functioning through action potential patterns, but
<br>
it must (IMHO) be on some substrate, performing some thermodynamic
<br>
activity.
<br>
<p>You can't just ignore that.  You can't just make replicates.  You have
<br>
to conserve some level of the original system or it isn't that system.
