<em>&gt; On Tue, 1 Nov 2005 &quot;Heartland&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:velvethum@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20physics%20of%20uploading%20minds">velvethum@hotmail.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, mind transfers are usually debated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terms of brain structure and preservation of continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of consciousness. In reality these concepts are somewhat marginal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What an extraordinary thing to say! I would humbly suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective continuity of consciousness is absolutely positively 100% the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ONLY thing that matters.
</em><br>
<p>BTW, few years ago I was almost certain that, &quot;subjective continuity of 
<br>
consciousness is absolutely positively 100% the ONLY thing that matters.&quot; At 
<br>
least this view is closer to the truth than &quot;brain pattern is absolutely 
<br>
positively 100% the ONLY thing that matters.&quot; :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;What really matters, IMO, is a &quot;mind-producing activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of matter in space-time,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I would also humbly suggest that the term &quot;space - time&quot; be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only when the words &quot;time&quot; and &quot;place&quot; are insufficient.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly why I'm using &quot;space&quot; instead of &quot;place&quot;.  Minds exist in 4D 
<br>
space-time, not in a 2D &quot;time and place&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; consciousness which is merely a subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;mind-producing activity of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in space-time.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Translation: At a time and place.
</em><br>
<p>All the words in my definitions are there for a reason. No translations are 
<br>
necessary. I meant &quot;space&quot;, really.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Just because people sometimes lose consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; doesn't mean their brains stop working.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When the brain of a surgery patients is cooled way down and they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under very deep anesthesia there is still some minimal metabolism going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on in the neurons, but nothing you wouldn't find in a liver or skin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell; and there is virtually no communication between neurons; in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words no thought, conscious or unconscious.
</em><br>
<p><p>And even in this extreme case the person remains the same because the 
<br>
potential for original presence still exists. In fact, maintaining 
<br>
*potential for presence* should be *the* main goal of uploading.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I can be present without being conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At that moment you not only have no consciousness you don't even have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflexes, and are no more intelligent that a house plant. Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely certain you really want to claim that is you?
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course. If it were otherwise then every loss of consciousness would 
<br>
result in death. You are certainly not saying that, are you?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; So yes, I agree that consciousness isn't a relevant criterion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT RELEVANT!?
</em><br>
<p>It's not, sorry.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My question is this: If you are correct then why should you care if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're dead or not,
</em><br>
<p><p>Because being alive gives me opportunity to experience something, preferably 
<br>
something positive, while death takes away that opportunity. I would hold 
<br>
that view even if was wrong.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; and why should anyone care about this mysterious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical &quot;presence&quot; that just sounds like a soul dressed up in its best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sunday go to meeting words like &quot;Space Time Continuum&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John K Clark
</em><br>
<p>The meaning of what I call presence (no, it's not a synonym for 
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot;) is somewhat abstract but the definition is very simple - 
<br>
mind-producing activity of matter in space-time (or space and time, if you 
<br>
wish). It's the activity itself.
<br>
<p>Basically, presence is to the brain what motion is to a car.
<br>
<p>And no, it's not a soul. :)
