<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Your story of trying to disprove Cantor's diagonalization argument, in your
<br>
youth, really resonated with me!
<br>
<p>I was *not* as much of a prodigy as you were -- I was just a very bright
<br>
kid.  I entered university at 15 and graduated at 18; I suppose I could have
<br>
entered uni at 12 had the opportunity arisen; but I couldn't have done
<br>
university material at 8 or 10, no way, my brain just wasn't there yet.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I remember that at some point during my teens (late teens; I was
<br>
probably 19, in fact) I spent nearly a week convinced that I had proved
<br>
mathematics inconsistent!  Or, more specifically, that I had proved the
<br>
Axiom of Infinity led to logical inconsistency within Zermelo-Frankel set
<br>
theory.  That was an exhilarating week...
<br>
<p>But unfortunately (and predictably), all I had discovered was yet another
<br>
(screwy and not so elegant, really) form of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem,
<br>
somewhat related to algorithmic information theory.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this merely proves that I'm even crazier than you: You were just
<br>
trying to disprove aleph-one, but I was nuts enough to try and disprove
<br>
aleph-zero as well!
<br>
<p>[I still am not comfortable with the notion of the infinite in mathematics,
<br>
and especially not with aleph-one and all those nasty random entities that
<br>
exist as a group yet can never be demonstrated on an individual basis.  But
<br>
unfortunately the paradoxical nature of these things doesn't seem to take
<br>
the form of a real logical inconsistency, just an incompatibility between
<br>
the commonsense notion of &quot;is&quot; and the mathematical notion of &quot;is&quot;.]
<br>
<p>I knew a real child prodigy once, fairly well -- he was a classmate of my
<br>
son's, and at age 5 he was doing trigonometry and analytic geometry (while
<br>
my son, who was gifted in math but not a prodigy, was merely having fun with
<br>
simple binary arithmetic examples and very basic algebra... my son was by
<br>
far the *second* best kid in the class in math, but this prodigy kid blew
<br>
him away).  Indeed, he did not seem generally more *intellectually mature*
<br>
than my son or other very bright kids, even though he had more capability to
<br>
absorb and manipulate technical ideas.  In more respects his judgment was
<br>
still that of a young child.
<br>
<p>As member of a math dept. hiring committee, in the early 90's I I once
<br>
interviewed an ex-prodigy for a professor position.  He was clearly VERY
<br>
bright, and was unusual in having well-developed research careers in two
<br>
very different areas, set theory and mathematical physics.  But we ended up
<br>
hiring someone else, a number theorist who had not been a prodigy but seemed
<br>
to have more creative and important research ideas.  This encounter
<br>
reinforced what the literature shows: prodigies nearly always grow into very
<br>
gifted adults, but not necessarily more gifted than some others who were not
<br>
prodigies.  Yet another aspect in which brain function and development are
<br>
very  mysterious!
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben G
