<em>&gt;Subject: Early IQ Repost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Tue, 22 Nov 2005 00:34:04 +1100

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I never actually got a direct response to my first post in this thread, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the discussion has deviated well outside my line of thinking. That's fine, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but I still have my original train of thought waiting at the station, so to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speak. Original post follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;---------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer, what is your (self-estimated) IQ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not familiar with the GPA, but I assume it's strongly correlated, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you said it like your scores were good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not a genius, but I am clever. (IQ 130ish, 98th percentile, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes me uncommon but not rare).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know people who are cleverer by a further order of magnitude (member of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;999 club), but I still find I have more in common with them than people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relatively close in the downwards direction. Obviously, that's my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perception, not theirs, but so it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The supposition I have is that IQ is largely unrelated to passion or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivation, especially moving towards adulthood where the natural curiosity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and drive of childhood wears off. The most successful people (according to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society's usual metrics) are not the most intelligent, but the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obsessed, with IQ being a secondary correlate.
</em><br>
<p><p>The most successful people, given any metric, are not necessarily the most 
<br>
intelligent, but the most obsessed. My most potent image of Einstein (other 
<br>
than the hair) is the blackboard. The blackboard represents the thousands of 
<br>
hours spent drawing, thinking, erasing, etc. Only the most obsessed person 
<br>
could have the patience and interest to continue doing meaningful work for 
<br>
so long. This especially resonates with my experience working with AGI: 
<br>
spending thousands of painful and confusing hours visualizing, drawing (or 
<br>
writing), reading, and thinking.
<br>
<p>Success is limited only by obsession and ambition. Intelligence speeds 
<br>
everything up, but I don't believe that it is a limiting factor in many 
<br>
situations. This seems to fit well with Einstein, seeing as how he didn't 
<br>
even start speaking until a late age, and failed school miserably. Einstein 
<br>
was a lot closer to average intelligence than to the IQ of many child 
<br>
prodigies.

<em>&gt;It's probably not right to see the reduction in motivation of a child 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prodigy as a failure. In fact, it's probably not fair to push our own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beliefs about success onto others (argument from paternalism). However, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is wonderful when someone of high intellect pursues the goals which I find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-T
