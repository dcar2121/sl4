<p>Not so.  A FAI is *designed* to be verifiably predictably Friendly and 
<br>
not in a statistical sense either.  The global warming dynamics are not 
<br>
thus designed.  If we have to have controversial arguments about whether 
<br>
some specific FAI design is Friendly in the technical sense, arguments 
<br>
like we're having about global warming, then screw the design, come up 
<br>
with a better one.
<br>
<p>As I recently said on wta-talk to James Hughes's proposal for &quot;morality 
<br>
software&quot; for humans:
<br>
<p>**
<br>
<p>There's a theorem generalizing Turing's halting theorem, Rice's Theorem, 
<br>
which says that you cannot *in general* determine whether a 
<br>
computational process implements *any* nontrivial function - including, 
<br>
say, multiplication.  Then how is it possible that human engineers build 
<br>
computer chips which reliably perform multiplication?  Computer 
<br>
engineers build special cases of chips, *not* chips in general.  They 
<br>
deliberately use only those designs that they *can* understand.  They 
<br>
select an architecture of which they can predict - and in some cases, 
<br>
formally prove - that the chip design implements multiplication.
<br>
<p>SIAI's notion of Friendliness assurance relies on being able to design 
<br>
an AI specifically for the sake of verifiability.  Needless to say, 
<br>
humans are not so designed.  Needless to say, it is not a trivial 
<br>
project to thus redesign a human.  I cannot imagine going about it in 
<br>
such way as to preserve continuity of personal identity, the overall 
<br>
human cognitive architecture, or much of anything.  SIAI's notion of 
<br>
Friendliness relies on selecting an AI design of which we can verifiably 
<br>
say that it would never choose to expend effort on defeating its own 
<br>
Friendliness.  As opposed to superposing external &quot;morality software&quot; 
<br>
onto a mind that might not like it, or a mind that might plan in advance 
<br>
to defeat it.
