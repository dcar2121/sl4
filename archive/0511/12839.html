<p>
Indeed, but I reject the implied suggestion that I was making a mistake 
<br>
of assuming otherwise. I believe that IQ really is tracking ... 
<br>
something -- even if that something is nothing more than a correlation 
<br>
between various areas of skill. I would suppose that in Langan's case, 
<br>
something else has come unstuck. I'll just take it as fact that his IQ 
<br>
is what he says it is, on the grounds that even if he's off by a bit, 
<br>
it's still going to be really high.
<br>
<p>I find that with my IQ of 130, I can understand some things more easily 
<br>
than the average, pick up on things people miss etc, but I'm very open 
<br>
to error also. In a way, I'm more vulnerable, because I can get a false 
<br>
sense of security about my reasoning on some issue. Also, I can get led 
<br>
into traps by my own logic. The errors are often more subtle, but none 
<br>
the less devastating.
<br>
<p>I would be interested in quizzing people of very high IQ (say another 
<br>
standard dev. above) about what that's like, how their perception of 
<br>
ideas works etc.
<br>
<p>I think it's a quote of Einstein's that &quot;whatever your troubles in 
<br>
mathematics may be, I assure you that mine are still greater&quot;.
<br>
<p>The adoption of religion is an interesting case in point. There doesn't 
<br>
seem to be an obvious correlation between IQ and atheism, for example. I 
<br>
think that a lot of people's intuitions are dominated not only by IQ, or 
<br>
maybe I should simply say the ability to observe unusual correlations, 
<br>
but also by other factors. Some instinctive intuitions, or natural 
<br>
attractions to kinds of idea are, I would say, idealism, moralism, ego, 
<br>
mathematicism, individualism, immortality complexes and violence. That 
<br>
is to say, some people will defend the merits of one of those points of 
<br>
view above the evidence for its success. Often they will come up with a 
<br>
valid or defensible position, but it is not their IQ or the facts which 
<br>
drive them to adopt it.
<br>
<p>I would say that religious people, which I would also say most people 
<br>
are, tend to be idealists with an immortality complex, but this could be 
<br>
an apocryphal statement based on limited observation. My &quot;inner jury&quot; is 
<br>
still out on that one, but there you go.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
