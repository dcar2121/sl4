<p><em>&gt; As far as the brain structure goes, let me say something about mind

<em>&gt; To answer your question, ultimately, I would like to be concerned with bare

</em><br>
<p>This is the point that became clear to me after my last response.  I
<br>
came to the conclusion that your &quot;mind-producing activity&quot; or
<br>
&quot;potential for mind-producing activity&quot; was really just another term
<br>
for the substrate, because in any realistic sense, it's some substrate
<br>
that must produce mental activity.  In an abstract or hypothetical
<br>
sense, what you're saying is true:  if you could just transfer the
<br>
thermodynamics of mental states directly from neurons to silicon (or
<br>
whatever), everything else *would* take care of itself.  But you can't
<br>
do that -- at least not in any way that I can conceive of.  Energy
<br>
transfers are coupled to transitions in matter states.  Solving that
<br>
problem is probably harder than a Moravec transfer.
