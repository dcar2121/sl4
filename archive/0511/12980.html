</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Making a long story very very short, because extreme 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smartness can give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extremely interesting rewards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Smartness does not in itself give the extreme ability to persuade. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Smartness enables one to more easily figure out a strategy or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the persuasion or other tasks, with a minimum number of clues 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at least one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but probably more, depending on the way the mind functions).
</em><br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, and more to the point, because extreme smartness to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having a complete theory of mind of the opponent means you can find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paths exist in his future space of development and follow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those paths that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lead to your own release. This smartness differential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, to ensure a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complete theory of mind, needs to be overwhelming, not just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over another human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are still talking about the AI as it is in a box, right?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI can probably inevitably persuade -most- people to let it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the box. 
</em><br>
<p>The AI only has to persuade one or at most a few to do
<br>
something careless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, just because it is smart does not mean that it knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how a specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's mind works, or even any human mind in general.  
</em><br>
<p>But it does mean it can learn, enough, if given enough
<br>
time -- and in the long run the AI has as much time as
<br>
it needs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's not forget 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's only form of communication is text.  This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form a complete theory of mind in a reasonable amount of time.
</em><br>
<p>Text?  My computer already does passable voice input/output,
<br>
and anything smart enough to be called human inteligent will
<br>
almost certainly be smart enough to do near perfect (maybe
<br>
entertainment impersonator quality) voice input/output.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If an IQ 170 professional persuader (lawyer, politician) gets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sent to jail, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does he have the ability to convince each and every IQ 100 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jail guard to let 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him out of his cell and all the way out the front door to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom?  Maybe he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can persuade some, but not all.  They are trained not to do this.
</em><br>
<p>But SOME do (maybe without a 170 IQ) persuade some, a prison
<br>
guard, nurse, or their lawyer to help them escape.
<br>
<p>Or maybe just to take liberties with security that would only
<br>
mean a human prisoner could communicate over the Internet, but
<br>
for a growing AI, access to the Internet is tantamount to full
<br>
release with no chance of recovery (unless network security is
<br>
improved world wide to a great extent.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not trying to say that keeping an AI in a box is a good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some AI researchers might think so.  They may keep an AI in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box and hope 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they can keep it there until they believe that they have made it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, some will believe this.  Some might even find that the
<br>
precise act of &quot;keeping it in the box&quot; is not unlikely to make
<br>
that AI unfriendly (reasoning from human reactions which will
<br>
not always apply to a particular type of AI.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think many of us need to be careful before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making claims about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI behavior or making claims that intelligence is all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful (intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is nothing without facts).  The bottom line is if you have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worry about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping an AI in a box, you probably aren't doing a good job 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in making it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds reasonable.  And you cannot guarantee a friendly AI,
<br>
nor can you even guarantee you will be able to classify it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stay open-minded.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent advice.
<br>
