</em><br>
<em>&gt; much less &quot;particularly pointless&quot;- would you have the Albert Einstein

</em><br>
<p>It was not, in this case, my intent to attack Wikipedia, or even any
<br>
of the media that propagated this view of prodigies(with the possible
<br>
exception of The New Yorker). They are accurately conveying the public
<br>
record, I should think.
<br>
<p>In this case, I'm using apocryphal in the greek 'hidden things' sense,
<br>
where I'm trying for a sense of after-the-fact stories intended to
<br>
characterize the subject aside from representative or historical
<br>
accuracy. I was unaware they came from his autobiography, which I
<br>
suppose alters my view of their inclusion a bit, but to clarify again,
<br>
my argument is not with wikipedia or the authors of that piece.
<br>
<p>I'm using it as an example of the place he holds in general historical
<br>
review. I might object to the characterization of Albert Einstein
<br>
being a poor student and an enemy of the establishment because the
<br>
popular consensus these days is that he was, but I would not object to
<br>
reporting that people believe so.
<br>
<p>It's true that Sidis withdrew from mathematical life. It's true that
<br>
Mozart was emotionally troubled. It's true that Tesla and Hughes died
<br>
victimized and neurotic in hotel rooms. These are facts, but they are
<br>
anecdotal, and do not constitute a trend powerful enough to generalize
<br>
to every prodigy or genius. Yoo-geun has more in common,
<br>
statistically, with all the 8-year olds that die of choking on
<br>
unfamiliar foods, and it's a much more pressing threat to his
<br>
happiness.
