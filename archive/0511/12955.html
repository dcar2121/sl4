</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we cannot currently conceive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I don't necessarily disagree with this paragraph, it too seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to blur the distinction as earlier.  For example, to say that a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;has&quot; the subjective experience rather than a mind &quot;reports&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience.  To say that it &quot;has&quot; an experience seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoke that Cartesian dualism that is so ingrained in human thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but has no functional representation (except as a model of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsystem of human thinking.)  It's a powerful illusion.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely real and modelable--the illusion, that is.
</em><br>
<p>The English word &quot;has&quot; is rather ambiguous, which is why e.g. Lojban
<br>
decomposes it into 3 separate words denoting various kinds of
<br>
possession.
<br>
<p>What I would say is: there is a subjective experience that is
<br>
&quot;uniquely associated&quot; with that mind, in the sense that it is not
<br>
associated in the same close way with any other mind.  That is what I
<br>
mean by &quot;the mind has a subjective experience.&quot;
<br>
<p>The status of this kind of statement is about the same as when one
<br>
says &quot;I see a book on the table.&quot;  Of course, what's really going on
<br>
is that some particles associated with the book are impacting the
<br>
retina, etc. etc. -- but it would be rather awkward to say instead,
<br>
each time, &quot;My brain generates the phenomenal illusion that there
<br>
exists a book in phenomenal observed physical reality that is on the
<br>
phenomenal illusion of the table...&quot;
<br>
<p>I suppose I am a sort of dualist, in that I think that both
<br>
subjectivist and objectivist languages are useful for describing
<br>
reality.  But I don't believe there is a subjective realm that has its
<br>
own special dynamical laws which interact with the dynamical laws of
<br>
objective reality -- I have seen no evidence for that kind of dualism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own thinking about advanced minds is that they will be highly aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (meaning able to effectively incorporate a wide range of sense data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into their model) of their world and their internal operation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will be able to communicate with us in our language, mapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misleading and ambiguous human phraseology (when appropriate) onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their more precise message, but that they will have no use for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion of subjective experience since they will have more direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to the more objective information relevant to achieving their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure, because no reasonably creative, active finite mind will
<br>
in practice have access to every relevant piece of knowledge about
<br>
itself.  Truly complete self-understanding is not going to be possible
<br>
for any nontrivial real-world mind, and therefore any mind will need
<br>
to use some kinds of approximation models to study and represent
<br>
itself.  Presumably the approximation models of a very advanced mind
<br>
will be less stupid than ours, and how much they'll have in common
<br>
with ours (e.g. with approximation models like &quot;free will&quot;  and
<br>
&quot;stream of awareness&quot;) I really don't know...
