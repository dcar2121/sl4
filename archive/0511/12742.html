</em><br>
<p>This seems like a great idea; probably you could stream it into the
<br>
auditory cortex, which is already one-dimensional.  You could
<br>
experiment with this by writing a program that would take a text
<br>
document and play it by replacing each letter with a note, and see if
<br>
you can learn to &quot;read&quot; at high-speed.  I doubt you could read at a
<br>
higher speed that way than by listening to spoken text, but the point
<br>
is not practicality, but testing the modality shift.
<br>
<p>HOWEVER.  The problem that people rarely point out when talking about
<br>
adding new senses is that cortical real estate is expensive.  You can't
<br>
add a new sense without giving up something of equal value - either
<br>
giving up another sense, or reducing the range or resolution of that
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>It would be more interesting to me to know if motor cortex can be used
<br>
as sensory cortex.
