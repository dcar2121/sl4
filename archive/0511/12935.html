<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; A common misconception fostered because it is useful to some

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; rise, not the other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, yes, the grand conspiracy of the cabal known as the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific community.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (that bastion of political ideology), a body which collates published,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; peer-reviewed data from hundreds of papers, representing the findings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of thousands of scientists, has deteremined that humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contributing significantly to the global climate changes that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; facing.  But Mr. Rogers knows better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where did I state that humans are not contributing to climate change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that elevated CO2 levels do not contribute to atmospheric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warming?  Oh yes, that's right, I did not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are so many shining examples of poor reasoning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalization when it comes to the topic of global warming that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is appalling, though that is true with most topics.  You are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adding to that noise, by parroting dogma rather than, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloading the Vostok data.
</em><br>
<p>Parroting what dogma?  Please identify the specific claim that is
<br>
parroted dogma.  I made but one reference and one claim, dealing with
<br>
the IPCC.  Are you saying that their findings are dogma?  Useless
<br>
noise?  I was addressing your implied statement that supporters of the
<br>
idea of anthropogenic climate change are &quot;ideologues&quot; who misuse data.
<br>
&nbsp;CO2 is a known heat-trapping agent, which han be demonstrated
<br>
experimentally, and the IPCC -- certainly not an ideological body --
<br>
has concluded that CO2 is a large contributor to anthropogenic climate
<br>
change.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Far more is attributed to the scientific community by ideologues on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this matter than is actually claimed by the scientific community for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most part.  Are CO2 levels a valid and significant mechanism for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driving climate change?  Certainly.
</em><br>
<p>Which makes your earlier assertion that CO2 levels are a trailing
<br>
indicator of temperature increases irrelevant.  You agree that they
<br>
causally contribute to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are CO2 levels the primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism of climate change on earth?  Doubtful given the evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though it likely contributes.
</em><br>
<p>That's under dispute.  Within the realm of anthropogenic environmental
<br>
influence, CO2 may be the *most* important factor, but it's not the
<br>
most important out of all factors contributing to global climate
<br>
change.  It's the actual degree to which human activity influences
<br>
climate change that is the real debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conflating the first case with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second or correlation with causation is a serious failure of most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's understanding of this topic.
</em><br>
<p>And yet you just admitted it's causally linked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unless, of course, the topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of interest is CO2 levels rather than climate change -- a distinction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a real difference.
</em><br>
<p>It's a distinction only if CO2 levels are insignificant.  If, as many
<br>
scientists, most of them non-ideologues, believe that CO2 is the
<br>
leading anthropogenic cause of climate change, then it's significant. 
<br>
Especially if human activity per se is significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is ironic that these failure modes are essentially identical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the failures in reasoning of the Creationist/Intelligent Design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crowd, except that the shoe is on the other foot.  Careful reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is frequently only useful when it supports a position one already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees with.
</em><br>
<p>Blabbering.  Please don't ever insult my intelligence by comparing me
<br>
to creationists.  Creatioinsts don't do much research on evolution. 
<br>
I've done my homework on climate change.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Martin
