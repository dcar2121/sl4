<p>
I never actually got a direct response to my first post in this thread, 
<br>
and the discussion has deviated well outside my line of thinking. That's 
<br>
fine, but I still have my original train of thought waiting at the 
<br>
station, so to speak. Original post follows:
<br>
---------------------------------
<br>
<p>Eliezer, what is your (self-estimated) IQ?
<br>
<p>I am not familiar with the GPA, but I assume it's strongly correlated, 
<br>
and you said it like your scores were good.
<br>
<p>I am not a genius, but I am clever. (IQ 130ish, 98th percentile, which 
<br>
makes me uncommon but not rare).
<br>
<p>I know people who are cleverer by a further order of magnitude (member 
<br>
of 999 club), but I still find I have more in common with them than 
<br>
people relatively close in the downwards direction. Obviously, that's my 
<br>
perception, not theirs, but so it is.
<br>
<p>The supposition I have is that IQ is largely unrelated to passion or 
<br>
motivation, especially moving towards adulthood where the natural 
<br>
curiosity and drive of childhood wears off. The most successful people 
<br>
(according to society's usual metrics) are not the most intelligent, but 
<br>
the most obsessed, with IQ being a secondary correlate.
<br>
<p>It's probably not right to see the reduction in motivation of a child 
<br>
prodigy as a failure. In fact, it's probably not fair to push our own 
<br>
beliefs about success onto others (argument from paternalism). However, 
<br>
it is wonderful when someone of high intellect pursues the goals which I 
<br>
find important.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
-T
