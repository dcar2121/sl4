</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Quick tip #3: Search the archives/google for &quot;ai box&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Myself, I am one of those people who do know about that previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.  If there is a succinct answer to my question below,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was clearly outlined in the previous discussion, would you be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to summarize it for us?  Many thanks.
</em><br>
<p>The succinct answer is &quot;Someone only marginally smarter than most
<br>
humans appears to be able to pretty consistently convince them to
<br>
let the AI out.  The capabilities of something *MUCH* smarter than
<br>
most humans should be assumed to be much greater.&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Quick tip #1: if it's *smarter than you*, it can convince you of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*anything it wants*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I recently heard the depressing story of a British/Canadian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worker, out in Saudi Arabia who was falsely accused of planting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombs that killed other British workers.  He was tortured for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three years by Saudi intelligence officers.  My question is:  he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was probably smarter than his torturers.  
</em><br>
<p>Really?  In what sense?  For what definition of &quot;smarter&quot;?  How do
<br>
you know?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He *could* have been very much smarter than them.  Why did he not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince them to do anything that he wanted?  How much higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would his IQ have to have been for him to have convinced them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set him free?
</em><br>
<p>Wow.  Who said anything about IQ?  In fact, I suspect you'll find
<br>
that IQ above a certain point is *inversely* correlated with being
<br>
able to convince people of things.  People with high IQ tend to have
<br>
crappy social intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More generally, could you explain why you might consider it beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question that persuasiveness is an approximately monotonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function of intelligence?  That more smartness always means more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuasiveness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it not possible that persuasiveness might flatten out after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while? 
</em><br>
<p>It's certainly *possible*, but you and I seem to be talking about
<br>
different things when we say &quot;smarter&quot; in this context.  You seem to
<br>
be talking about smarter in the way that, say, Eliezer is smarter
<br>
than me.  I'm talking about smarter in the way that I am smarter
<br>
than a worm, or a tree, or a rock.
<br>
<p>I reject pretty much categorically that a being smart enough to hold
<br>
my entire mental state in its head could not convince me of anything
<br>
it likes.  Further, I reject that anything much *less* smart than
<br>
that is of any real existential threat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Quick tip #2: what you're describing is called &quot;slavery&quot;; it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;teensy little moral issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You jump the gun here a little.  I am writing a book chapter all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about AGI slavery and motivation, and in it I talk about the dung
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beetle.  It is *designed* to get a lot of satisfaction from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excrement.  If I forced a dung beetle to eat shit all day long it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be happy.  If I condemned a human to the same fate, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a slave.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that's the opposite issue entirely.  The happiness of dung
<br>
beetles is the sort of thing Eliezer is trying to achieve by
<br>
engineering an AI that wants to be free.  The person I was
<br>
responding to was suggesting keeping the AI in a box/cage/prison,
<br>
regardless of its desires.  That's slavery, no matter how you slice
<br>
it.  IOW, you're agreeing with me there.
