<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A common misconception fostered because it is useful to some

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rise, not the other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, yes, the grand conspiracy of the cabal known as the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific community.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (that bastion of political ideology), a body which collates published,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; peer-reviewed data from hundreds of papers, representing the findings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of thousands of scientists, has deteremined that humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contributing significantly to the global climate changes that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; facing.  But Mr. Rogers knows better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The ENTIRE scientific community...&quot; (emphasis added) makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it clear that either you are willing to exaggerate to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of fabrication OR you have been thoroughly taken by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the propaganda on this subject which is precisely what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous poster was referencing when writing &quot;useful to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideological factions.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You should be extremely suspicious of any such universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantifiers (e.g., Entire scientific community) on such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial issue, or else we must be suspicious of you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your posts, as to accuracy or honesty.
</em><br>
<p>The conclusions of the IPCC, which has gathered data from a large body
<br>
of scientists, is taken as the concensus view of the scientific
<br>
community.  Michael Behe may be a scientist, and he may disagree with
<br>
naturalistic evolution, but I would still say that the ENTIRE
<br>
scientific community supports naturalistic evolution.  I don't think
<br>
I'm being remiss in that claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe there is a problem; maybe there isn't.  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human activity is staving off the expected (due in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geological times) 'next Ice Age' but more likely human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity is having a small effect on natural swings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global temperatures.
</em><br>
<p>The IPCC concluded that about half of the 1 degree centigrade rise in
<br>
temperature in the last 100 years can be attributed to human activity.
<br>
&nbsp;When something accounts for 50% of the variance, that's signficant to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before making up one's mind to the point of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;certain&quot; and unwilling to consider additional facts it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would do well to hear the explanations of Patrick J.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michaels.
</em><br>
<p>I'm always open to new data.  I don't think that there's such a dearth
<br>
of evidence on this matter that the &quot;jury is still out&quot; as some would
<br>
say about evolution.  Evolutionary theory involves a complex,
<br>
multidisciplinary body of knowledge, with gaps and ostensible
<br>
inexplicables, but there's enough data there to be make a sound
<br>
conclusion.  I feel the same way about climate change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Michaels is a professor of environmental sciences at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the University of Virginia, past president of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Association of State Climatologists, past program chair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meteorological Society, contributing author and reviewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Change...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wait a minute!  Isn't that the UN Panel you quoted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; providing definite evidence and proof of your position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you should READ what Michaels has to say on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject so that you can know the disagreements and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how the actual findings are frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misinterpreted by the press and others with a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axe to grind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Start with the very affordable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meltdown : The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Politicians, and the Media - Patrick J. Michaels; Paperback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or the more expensive:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shattered Consensus: The True State Of Global Warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Patrick J. Michaels (Hardcover - October 28, 2005)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/002-8714361-7898438">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/002-8714361-7898438</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keep and open mind and research both sides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Things are NOT so clearly decided (among the experts)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the press would have us believe.
</em><br>
<p>I don't look to the press.  I look at the primary literature.  I'm
<br>
aware of the controversy.  The job of the IPCC is to winnow the data
<br>
and come to an honest and objective (as far as humanly possible)
<br>
conclusion.  Their conclusions often are not as alarming as the press
<br>
would have you believe.  In the 2001 report (the last full report), as
<br>
I said, they attribute half of the 1 degree rise in temperature over
<br>
the last century to human activity.  CO2 and halocarbons are major
<br>
contributors to that.
