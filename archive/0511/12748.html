<p>And yet, in a situation where half of an infant's brain needs to be

surgically removed for some reason, that individual can (sometimes)  
<br>
grow up to be a college graduate. If it happens at an early enough  
<br>
age, then it doesn't completely undermine the process of development:  
<br>
synaptic growth and pruning can continue even with one hemisphere.  
<br>
(Cortical real estate certainly is expensive; I'm just pointing out  
<br>
that it isn't always a matter of volume or surface area.)
<br>
<p>As for the actual numbers of neurons and synaptic connections that  
<br>
these exceptional people carry in their heads, I have no idea how  
<br>
they compare to the rest of us. Same goes for how much energy it  
<br>
takes them to run only a half-sized brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same thing occurred to me as I was pondering on this post. On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand, if the cortex truly is that generic, it should (hehe) be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Definitely. Until we're at the stage of mind uploads, though (or  
<br>
fantastically powerful nanotech and godlike knowledge of the brain-- 
<br>
possibly necessary for uploads anyway), I think that any such  
<br>
upgrades would have to come very early in life, before an  
<br>
individual's forest of synapses has been pruned down very much (i.e.  
<br>
while plasticity is still at a peak).
