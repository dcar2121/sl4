<p>
Actually, Da Vincy was identified as a remarkable painter at age 14 or 15 
<br>
and became the apprentice of a one of the famous painters of his day.  
<br>
Stravinsky, at age 20, acquired an apprenticeship with Russia's most famous 
<br>
musician.  Newton was recognized as unusually able as a child, but if he 
<br>
conceptualized gravity at age 12 as he later claimed, he told no-one and was 
<br>
not acclaimed till much later.  Leibnitz was recognized as a much more 
<br>
remarkable scholar in youth, and applied for a doctorate in law, on of 
<br>
several subjects he had mastered by that time at age 20, but was refused.  
<br>
Einstein was a bad student, dropped out of school, and failed his liberal 
<br>
arts exams, but in fact it is a testomony to his extrordinary mathematical 
<br>
test scores that he was recruited by the Eidgenössische Polytechnische 
<br>
Schule anyway under the condition that he first finish secondary school.
<br>
<p>In other words, by college age all of these examples had been recognized as 
<br>
unusually talented, surely 99th percentile and probably 99.9th percentile, 
<br>
but none of them had accomplishments that would be particularly unusual 
<br>
among say, Cal Tech students or SL4 posters.
<br>
<p>A curious demonstration of regression, by the way, comes from Cal Tech's 
<br>
admissions policy in 1995.  In that year, the two schools with the highest 
<br>
SAT averages among freshmen (both 1470 vs Duke at 1440 and Harvard and MIT 
<br>
at 1430) were Cal Tech and Harvey Mudd.  Obviously, these two schools have 
<br>
radically different standards.  The difference is that Cal Tech doesn't 
<br>
consider SATs as an admission criterion at all, while Duke and Harvey Mudd 
<br>
appearently consider SATs almost exclusively, so the SAT average for Cal 
<br>
Tech students regressed to from the impression they made on Cal Tech faculty 
<br>
1470, while for Harvey Mudd actual ability regressed from an SAT score of 
<br>
1470.  This difference, as well as the fact that Cal Tech students studied 
<br>
much more than those at Harvey Mudd or any other school and presumably 
<br>
benefitted from better professors and a better student-professor ratio 
<br>
(Equal numbers of faculty and undergrads!) presumably explains the much 
<br>
greater number of prominant Cal Tech alums relative to Harvey Mudd alums.  
<br>
The Harvey Mudd student body can probably be seen as the approximate 
<br>
practical limit to the effectiveness of selecting for IQ.  1/3 of the 
<br>
student body are national merit scholars, and 40% achieve PhDs, a value 
<br>
comparable to the 50% rate of MDs+PhDs+JDs among by CTY’s group selected for 
<br>
99.99th percentile childhood scores in either SAT math or SAT verbal and the 
<br>
64% rate among children in the 99.99th percentile in both math and verbal 
<br>
(above the 97th percentile SAT verbal and SAT math scores correlate .55, by 
<br>
the 99.99th percentile probably much lower).  Mudd is about 1/3 the size of 
<br>
Cal Tech, and half as old.  So, how does the level of achievement differ 
<br>
between the schools?    If SATs perfectly predicted Nobel Prizes, Mudd 
<br>
alumni would have about 1/6th as many as Caltech alumni.  In fact, Mudd 
<br>
alumni total 1, Caltech alumni total 18.  Alphabetical lists of 
<br>

<br>
<p><p>One final note. one of the Cal Tech Nobel Laurate alumni was William 
<br>
Shockley, who was excluded from the Terman Study of high IQ youth, which 
<br>
used a ratio IQ cut-off of Weschler IQ 140, slightly below the 99th 
<br>
percentile.  Ironically, despite this, later in his life William Shockly was 
<br>
an extreme outspoken advocate of IQ tests and of eugenics.  He became the 
<br>
less vitriolic of the two famous Caltech alumni to be a prominant late 20th 
<br>
century racist.  I don't really know what to make of this, but it could be 
<br>
seen as a reminder of the importance of rationality and its non-equivalence 
<br>
with intelligence.  Wolfram's semi-crank status (incidentally, he was one of 
<br>
the few prodigies from the above lists) further emphasizes this point.
