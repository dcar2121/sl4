The key question then is is there an implementable upload medium that transfers and supports the same (dynamic) shape?  Memories and behaviour tendencies are valueless entombed as bits.  I think the &quot;shape&quot; of an individual's mind can be ported to create a separate but seemingly identical person, but one's identity ceases if the uploading procedure is destructive to the original.

&nbsp;&nbsp;If my assertion is incorrect and the assertion below is true, it might make sense for an FAI to immediately computronium us to increase immediate industrial productivity and ressurrect us all at a later date when the universe's # of harnessable person-years is at a maximum.  If the reverse is true, humans in the present are a liability to pure AGI utilitarianism.  An FAI would have to be very carefully engineered not to steam-roll us.  We would have to be spoonfed to the singularity.

As far as the brain structure goes, let me say something about mind
<br>
structure. I view mind structure as a pattern or shape of mind-producing
<br>
activity. It doesn't really matter whether I implement my mind structure 
<br>
using neurons, silicon or something else entirely or what configurations of 
<br>
wetware/hardware I choose to accomplish
<br>
that. As long as I am able to transfer and support that same shape, how I 
<br>
implement that should be irrelevant to the nature of my being.
