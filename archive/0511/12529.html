<p><em>&gt; Obviously, you  couldn't find a location of &quot;green&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you could certainly find  locations  of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instances of &quot;green&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>True, and in exactly the same way you can find an instance of matter
<br>
behaving in a johnkclarkian manner, perhaps someday if I am
<br>
extraordinarily lucky more than one instance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since consciousness cannot exist outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the volume of the  brain […]
</em><br>
<p>Maybe for you but I’m not that obsessed, the only time my
<br>
consciousnesses is inside my brain is when I’m specifically thinking
<br>
about my biological brain, and most of the time I’m thinking about other
<br>
things not that 4 pound lump of grey jello.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and you know where that brain is, then you must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also know the location of  where consciousness happens 
</em><br>
<p>It is only in historically recent times that people even realized that
<br>
the brain had anything at all to do with thinking or consciousness, the
<br>
Greeks thought it was just an organ to cool the blood; the Egyptians
<br>
carefully preserved every part of the body after death EXCEPT the brain,
<br>
they thought it of no importance and just threw it away.  Those people
<br>
didn’t give a hoot in hell about the 4D space-time coordinates of their
<br>
brain, and yet despite their ignorance of the brain I think they were
<br>
conscious, although I admit I can’t prove it.
