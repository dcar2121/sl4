<p>Why do you think this child's environment has been especially sheltered 
<br>
or constrained?  If it has been, then sure, maybe the &quot;bigger picture of 
<br>
physics&quot; will remain elusive to the kid for many years - I'm not sure.  
<br>
Note that making profound contributions to physics probably doesn't 
<br>
require a &quot;big picture&quot; view of much aside from the mathematics 
<br>
specifically relevant to the tasks at hand.
<br>
<p>Extreme performance in idiot-savant types can indeed be the special 
<br>
case, to be examined separately from cases of &quot;normal people&quot; with high 
<br>
g.  I'm not sure whether they commonly collapse as adults (references, 
<br>
Jeff Medina?), and in fact seem to recall reading that exceptional 
<br>
genius in children does indeed predict exceptional genius in adulthood.  
<br>
Mozart is an obvious example.  There are many others.  Why do we 
<br>
necessarily assume that this child has Aspergeresque or autistic 
<br>
qualities, and is not simply a person of exceptional general 
<br>
intelligence who happened to focus upon physics?  Even extremely 
<br>
intelligent 8 year-olds might feel uncomfortable speaking to adults, I 
<br>
don't think that's indicative of any social handicap.  Were the child 
<br>
16, then sure.
