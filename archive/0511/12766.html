<em>&gt;&gt; reasons for expecting a hard takeoff are no better than the ones I've

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;Eric Baum calculates 10^36 operations to get intelligence, based on the number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of organisms that have ever lived.  To see why this number is wrong you may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consult <a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/jcollie/sle/">http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/jcollie/sle/</a> or for more information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;George Williams's &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I procrastinated about responding to this because I was busy and puzzled
<br>
as to whether I was missing something obvious.
<br>
&nbsp;Baum descibes 10^35 operations as an upper bound, and if you think that
<br>
number is a good summary of his conclusion, then you're being a bit
<br>
superficial.
<br>
&nbsp;I can't find anything in the &quot;Speed Limit for Evolution&quot; paper which bears
<br>
much resemblence to a criticism of Baum's conjecture. Were you claiming
<br>
that a limit on how much information could be encoded in genes implies
<br>
something about the computational power needed to produce that information?
<br>
That would seem as strange as saying that the ability to express a chess
<br>
move in a few bits implies that it couldn't take much cpu power to find
<br>
the best one.
<br>
&nbsp;Baum suggests that a nontrivial fraction of the cpu power needed to
<br>
simulate an organisms life is needed to determine how many offspring that
<br>
organism is fit to produce.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Another reason to expect slow (as in Kurzweil-speed) takeoff is that
<br>
progress so far on AI-like projects has consistently shown that incremental
<br>
progress at a rate no faster than what would be expected if learning is
<br>
cpu-bound is the norm.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm still wondering whether there are any arguments for hard takeoff that
<br>
address the questions about speed as directly as Baum does (which is
<br>
admittedly not nearly as direct an ideal argument would), and whether
<br>
thie issue ought to have any effect on how we should approach designing
<br>
a safe AI.
