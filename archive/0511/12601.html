<p>
For what it's worth, given the relatively small sample size, over 50%
<br>
of medical doctors whose thoughts on life extension / negligible
<br>
senescence I've come across, via articles, books, essays, and personal
<br>
conversation, still consider living to 150 fantastical. Of those who
<br>
are more accepting of it, they tend to consider it possible only in
<br>
100 or 200 years, at best. (Blatant linear, contra accelerating, view
<br>
of change, yes yes.)
<br>
<p>So I think your perspective on who and how many are comprehending
<br>
implications of modern and emerging biomedical techniques is a bit
<br>
off.
<br>
<p>I understand your point, though. I wonder if it could be distinguished
<br>
from the general &quot;but it's so OBVIOUS that thus-and-so!&quot; reaction felt
<br>
by all sorts of folk, right or wrong, SL4 or SL negative twelve (eh?
<br>
buh.), who have processed loads of evidence (or what they see as
<br>
evidence) for theory X, so much so that their internal estimates of
<br>
the prevalence of X-supporting-evidence in the world of ideas makes it
<br>
hard to understand how anyone could not have come across *sufficient*
<br>
X-supporting-evidence to not make the 'mistake' of floating ideas that
<br>
take not-X seriously.
<br>
<p>You know what you mean better than I. Does this characterize what
<br>
you're talking about, or do you have something else in mind? If the
<br>
latter, could you clarify, in part by distinguishing your
<br>
&quot;past/present shock&quot; from the above &quot;ain't it obvious!?&quot; shock?
<br>
<p>Another shock-ish experience of which I am reminded by your
<br>
description is the sort I have when I come across adults who lack even
<br>
basic understanding of functions or simple algebra. I boggle at what
<br>
it would be like not to understand something so basic, and so
<br>
fundamental to my understanding of *so many* other things. This is
<br>
perhaps only tangentially related to the sort of shock you described,
<br>
but it has its own symmetry, with its reflection across the axis
<br>
embodied in the wonder we feel at various 'big' (usually with respect
<br>
to complexity) things, like various aspects of cosmology (many worlds,
<br>
say), or that sturdy old chestnut, the Singularity.
