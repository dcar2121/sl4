Hi Jef,
<br>
<p>Yes, the story does reek of publicity-enhancement.  But all media types 
<br>
gravely distort the truth about events such as this one.  So that is 
<br>
nothing unusual.
<br>
<p>The claim of a connection between flying cars and string theory is 
<br>
indeed quite silly.  If the scientific literacy of the journalist were 
<br>
slightly higher, perhaps they would not include such a bizzare claim and 
<br>
instead focus on some other aspect of the boy's aspirations.  Is the 
<br>
flying car thing really what he is concerned about?  Maybe.  Even if so, 
<br>
perhaps his view could mature over a few years - a 12-year old making 
<br>
concrete contributions to science would be nothing to laugh at.
<br>
<p>There is actually significant evidence that intelligence (g) operates 
<br>
independently of context.  The notion that intelligence is highly 
<br>
dependent on context is reminiscent of the SSSM (Standard Social Science 
<br>
Model), which asserts that humans are essentially blank slates whose 
<br>
attitudes and abilities are shaped entirely by their upbringing and 
<br>
environment.  A few weeks ago, Michael Vassar posted an excellent 
<br>
article, &quot;Why G Matters&quot;, which is one of thousands of articles 
<br>
presenting important evidence for the context-independent predictive 
<br>
validity of g:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>The predictive validity of g is powerful in all job domains, but 
<br>
increases in intensity with the intellectual demands and abstractness of 
<br>
the task.  University physics is perhaps one of the most intellectually 
<br>
demanding and abstract domains known to man, and therefore it should be 
<br>
expected that a high g value will convey especially significant 
<br>
benefits, regardless of context.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Michael A.

<em>&gt;Mental health can probably be maintained as long as he is sheltered

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Regarding scientific contributions, I see a significant probability of

<em>&gt;some novel but narrow insights, but probable disappointment in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context of general and practical applicability to real-world problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While I don't doubt he's a prodigy, this story reeks of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;publicity-enhancement.  The claim that he qualified for university by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being able to recite an explanation of Shroedinger's equation is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shallow and says nothing about all the associated understanding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would normally be expected.  The gee-whiz claim that he's thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about flying cars in connection with string theory says more about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;child-like nature of his thoughts than about any kind of special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insight, and the statement that his father speaks for him because he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has not yet learned to communicate properly to adults using Korean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social norms hints strongly about the uneven nature of his education
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I find most significant about this and similar situations is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the popular conception of &quot;intelligence&quot; does not include its extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dependence on context.  If intelligence is understood in terms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capability of an agent to predict changes and thus respond effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to its environment, then any isolation from the environment has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect of reducing its effective intelligence in that broader context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a system within a co-evolutionary environent, the mismatch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes progressively worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hope that Yoo-geun gets the benefit of a special environment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which he can flourish and contribute to the diversity of thinking that
</em><br>
