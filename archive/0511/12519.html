<em>&gt; So yes, I agree that consciousness isn't a relevant criterion by which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should judge whether the true essence of &quot;I am&quot; was transferred during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading. I lose and regain consciousness all the time but I remain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same day after day, year by year because I've never lost my original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence.
</em><br>
<p><p>This kind of absolute belief in &quot;the true essence of 'I am'&quot;, while
<br>
understandable, is at the root of the apparent paradoxes of
<br>
consciousness, qualia, subjectivity vs. objectivity, self-identity,
<br>
free-will -- impeding practical thinking on morality and effective
<br>
frameworks for positive-sum interaction (formerly conceived as
<br>
government.)
<br>
<p>Worst of all, it leads to interminable circular arguments on the web.  ;-)
<br>
<p>There is no paradox when it is seen that the subjective POV is
<br>
entirely defined by its context within a coherent and ultimately
<br>
objective but unobtainable whole.
<br>
<p>To see this does not diminish the subjective experience of self--with
<br>
its feelings, emotions, values and sense of direct and immediate
<br>
apprehension of &quot;reality&quot;--but actually enriches us with a broader
<br>
understanding and appreciation of the bigger picture.  Such a view is
<br>
indeed foreign to us, in our parochial cocoons, with our culturally
<br>
reinforcing language and memes, and requires a metaphorical travel
<br>
&quot;into the void&quot;, letting go of the conventional framework and &quot;coming
<br>
out on the other side&quot; to see that the world still holds together, but
<br>
in a more encompassing, more consistent way.
<br>
<p>To see the world in this way is to recognize that our subjective
<br>
(increasingly intersubjective) values define our goals, and our
<br>
(increasingly objective) understanding of how the universe works
<br>
facilitates achievement of our goals.  And this is the path to greater
<br>
good.
