<em>&gt; Sorry, Mr Clark, but there are a helluvalotta well respected atheists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and disbelievers in the &quot;soul&quot; who hold a concept of &quot;mind&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; as being non physical; philosophers from Kant, Hegel and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berkely to those such as Heidegger or even (I suspect) Chalmers.
</em><br>
<p>Kant, Hegel and Berkeley are atheists or disbelievers in the soul? Wow, that
<br>
IS news.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concept of non-physical truth or information doesn't have to be as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inelegant as Descartes's Dualism.
</em><br>
<p>But the joining of physical and non-physical systems ends up two ways, both
<br>
hard to believe: The cartesian way (a physical element which is subject to
<br>
non-physical laws) and the leibnizian way (pre-established harmony of
<br>
physicality and non-physicality, at which point one can wonder what
<br>
difference non-physicality makes).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, there is one Fuckload (that's a nonSI measure for a lot) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that can't be measured by scientific method that are commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded as true.
</em><br>
<p>Most of which are, in all likelyhood, non-existent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How accurately can you measure Pi empirically?  Maybe 8 sig. figures?
</em><br>
<p>Infinity is the limit, when you can use functions and definition of the
<br>
circle. (Constructivist mathematics is empirical.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mathematical explorations aren't scientific.  They aren't empirical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are idealistic.  How do you test the concept of &quot;Zero?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The constructivist answer is by building algorithms in which the concept
<br>
plays a role, by building algorithms which give rise to the concept.
<br>
Not all theory of mathematics is Platonist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is nothing linking the Css of a human body at one time to the Css
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;that&quot; body at a different time.  Identity, whether of bodies or of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Csses is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p>I'd argue that there are invariants (similar to those in geometry) which are
<br>
core to an identity. In any case my argument is based purely on intuition,
<br>
as would be the denial of it, until we have more data.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Css has memories of other, earlier Csses, which give rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion of continuity.  However, as each Css-event is effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stand-alone, the only connection you have to your earlier and future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self is memory.
</em><br>
<p>And/or structural invariants (or because memories can fade).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When one wakes op in the morning, there is a sense of discontinuity with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Css the previous night.  The Css is presented with memories, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will act by habits normal to that body's Css.  Beyond these things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no more link to the previous night's Css that if the Css had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been &quot;transplanted&quot; from one body to another, aquiring the new body's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories and habits.
</em><br>
<p>Except that memories and habits are the staple of consciousness. Saying that
<br>
you can transplant consciousness without taking also memories and habits is
<br>
like saying you can transplant a heart without moving the atoms of the
<br>
heart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More importantly, the Css of 5 seconds later has no connection to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Css of 5 seconds earlier than memory, habit, and &quot;what the Css is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle of doing&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is to say, the two consciousness do not have anything more in common
<br>
than their essential characteristics ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that this idea of &quot;no identity&quot; is consistent with many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations of the idea of Consciousness, including bet not limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to idealistic and dualistic metaphysics.
</em><br>
<p>While failing once viewed from information theory or introspective
<br>
standpoints.
<br>
<p>--David.
