Herb M:  Have Mensa's tests been shown to predict life outcomes, or merely 
<br>
to produce internally consistant results.  If not the latter, who cares?  
<br>
Have physical correlates such as height, brain glucose consumption, brain 
<br>
size, and reaction time been found for any &quot;high ceiling&quot; tests?  If yes to 
<br>
all of the above, Tyler C and Michael A should probably start investigating 
<br>
and look for potentially promising programmers/theorists.  If no, we are 
<br>
probably better off using well validated tests taken at an earlier age, and 
<br>
I already posted how repeatable but small (about 2-fold for most rare IQ 
<br>
based positive life outcomes) the difference in outcomes is between 99th 
<br>
percentile and 99.99th percentile SAT scores at age 12.
<br>
<p>Phil G:  I'm pretty sure that the documented correlations between sub-task 
<br>
test scores decline fairly steadily with increasing 'g' even within the 
<br>
normal range, (with numerous IQ 50-70 outliers, primarily autistic but 
<br>
sometimes with other syndromes) strongly substantiating your position.
<br>
<p>J. Andrew Rogers:  The fact that the average human's performance on IQ tests 
<br>
&quot;threw you&quot; when you administered them is important.  For all of our 
<br>
arrogance, most Transhumanists grossly overestimate the abilities of 
<br>
ordinary humans.  This is substantially a consequence of how folk psychology 
<br>
works, and fails to work for outliers, but also a consequence of typically 
<br>
limited and iscolated life experience.  Unfortunately, it has serious 
<br>
consequences when predicting the future.  Our estimates of the likely 
<br>
behavior of large scale groups, the effort that will be devoted to a 
<br>
particular research objective, or the time until some task is accomplished 
<br>
are all grossly distorted.  For many transhumanists this means that boogie 
<br>
men such as &quot;terrorists&quot; are imagined as something that never was, 
<br>
disutility maximizers, and the resultant threats of bioterror and nanoterror 
<br>
are overestimated by many orders of magnitude.  For almost all 
<br>
transhumanists this means an underestimation of inertia, leading Chris 
<br>
Phoenix's fears of pre-emptory arms races and Nick Bostrom's utopian dreams 
<br>
of world government and benign regulation of dangerous tech.  At SL4, it 
<br>
probably means a serious overestimate of the immediacy of the existential 
<br>
risk associated with more powerful hardware.
<br>
<p>I strongly recommend that before wearing a &quot;futurist&quot; hat, all 
<br>
transhumanists try putting on a &quot;historical futurist&quot; hat.  Try to put 
<br>
yourself, with your current folk-psychology derived folk-psychohistory, in 
<br>
the role of a person in some recent decade, with the knowledge a person 
<br>
somewhat like yourself would have had then.  Observe where your model goes 
<br>
wrong and simply admit ignorance until you have fixed it.
