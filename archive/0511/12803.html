On Mon, 07 Nov 2005 &quot;Olie Lamb&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:olie@vaporate.com?Subject=Re:%20physics%20of%20uploading%20minds.">olie@vaporate.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Can you imagine a test to show which one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chairs is the black queen's bishop?  
</em><br>
<p>To determine that you would have to have a record of the game and know
<br>
the way the various chairs (AKA chess pieces) moved on the board.
<br>
Lacking that record the scientific method could not tell which chair was
<br>
the black queen's bishop, nor could any other method, nor is there much
<br>
point in saying the chairs were chess pieces.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People can make scientificcy statements about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untestable things, and I  will simply shrug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wait for the test. 
</em><br>
<p>This entire debate started when somebody on this list (not you) said
<br>
that even though science can not find the slightest difference between
<br>
one electron and another they were nevertheless enormously and
<br>
profoundly different because….. well just because.  That sort of
<br>
stupidly makes me blow a gasket, but now that I think about it maybe the
<br>
man was smarter that I thought and was just pushing my buttons. If so it
<br>
worked.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel kinda the same about an immortal soul. 
</em><br>
<p>Hey, you’re trying to slip in something under the RADAR, there is no
<br>
logical necessity that a soul be immortal. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;OK... you hypothecise that I have an immortal soul?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tell me a test, and I'd love to perform it&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Actually there is a simple and rather obvious test for that, but I can
<br>
guarantee you would not love to perform it.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I can see a huge difference between &quot;personal identity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a real thing and it being a mental illusion
</em><br>
<p>There you go again bad mouthing illusions! I like illusions, illusions
<br>
are a subjective phenomena just like is consciousness. Subjectivity is
<br>
far more important than objectivity, as long as I’m not dead
<br>
subjectively I’m happy.
<br>
<p>And yes it’s gibberish because whichever is true I will continue to feel
<br>
exactly the way I do now, just like adding zero to a number is the same
<br>
as subtracting zero from a number. Therefore the statement has zero
<br>
content. It’s gibberish.
