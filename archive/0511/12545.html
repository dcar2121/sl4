On Wed, 02 Nov 2005 &quot;Olie Lamb&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:olie@vaporate.com?Subject=Re:%20physics%20of%20uploading%20minds">olie@vaporate.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry, Mr Clark, but there are a helluvalotta well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected atheists and disbelievers in the &quot;soul&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who hold a concept of &quot;mind&quot; or 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&quot;consciousness&quot; as being non physical; 
<br>
<p>It’s not the non physical part that is bullshit, numbers, ideas, colors,
<br>
and many adverbs and adjectives are all non physical but perfectly
<br>
respectable because they are still amenable to the scientific method;
<br>
the soul is not. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; philosophers from Kant, Hegel and Berkely to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Heidegger or even (I suspect) Chalmers.  
</em><br>
<p>Just as some people are willing to abandon the word “God” but not the
<br>
idea of God (I believe in a higher force blah blah blah) others would
<br>
rather eat ground glass than use the word “soul”, so they invent
<br>
euphemisms. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, there is one Fuckload (that's a nonSI measure for a lot)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things that can't be measured by scientific method that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonly  regarded as true.  How accurately can you measure Pi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirically?  Maybe 8 sig. figures? 
</em><br>
<p>Are you trying to tell me with a straight face that the soul and Pi have
<br>
an equal amount of scientific fact behind them. Please please tell me
<br>
you’re not saying that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mathematical explorations aren't scientific.  
</em><br>
<p>Mathematical ideas can be proven wrong, Looney soul theories like I’ve
<br>
read on this list never can be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you test the concept of &quot;Zero?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The concept of Zero is useful, you couldn’t build a bridge or fly an
<br>
airplane without it; the concept of the soul on the other hand isn’t
<br>
worth a damn to anyone except theologians who do get a paycheck out of
<br>
it which they then examine to see if enough zeros are printed on it.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Css has memories of other, earlier Csses, which give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to the illusion of continuity. 
</em><br>
<p>An illusion? Who cares if it’s an illusion? We’re talking about
<br>
consciousness here and subjectivity is the name of the game. I like
<br>
illusions, I want the illusion to continue just as it has.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have serious doubts about the continuity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Css across things like sleep.  I'm pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undecided about whether there is an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;personal identity&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I believe the above contains absolutely no meaning; you are just playing
<br>
with words. 
<br>
<p>John K Clark
