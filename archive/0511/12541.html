<p><p>Sorry, Mr Clark, but there are a helluvalotta well respected atheists 
<br>
and disbelievers in the &quot;soul&quot; who hold a concept of &quot;mind&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; as being non physical; philosophers from Kant, Hegel and 
<br>
Berkely to those such as Heidegger or even (I suspect) Chalmers.
<br>
<p>The concept of non-physical truth or information doesn't have to be as 
<br>
inelegant as Descartes's Dualism.
<br>
<p>However, there is one Fuckload (that's a nonSI measure for a lot) of 
<br>
things that can't be measured by scientific method that are commonly 
<br>
regarded as true.
<br>
<p>How accurately can you measure Pi empirically?  Maybe 8 sig. figures? 
<br>
<p>Mathematical explorations aren't scientific.  They aren't empirical.  
<br>
They are idealistic.  How do you test the concept of &quot;Zero?&quot;
<br>
<p>However, the idea that consciousness (Css), pattern or information in 
<br>
some way transcends the physical does not imply self in the normal 
<br>
concept.  I present what I call the Hume2 interpretation of self (as 
<br>
relevant to time), which can be gleaned from an unusual and extreme 
<br>
interpretation of David Hume (much like the &quot;no cause&quot; readings):
<br>
<p>There is nothing linking the Css of a human body at one time to the Css 
<br>
of &quot;that&quot; body at a different time.  Identity, whether of bodies or of 
<br>
Csses is an illusion.
<br>
<p>A Css has memories of other, earlier Csses, which give rise to the 
<br>
illusion of continuity.  However, as each Css-event is effectively 
<br>
stand-alone, the only connection you have to your earlier and future 
<br>
self is memory.
<br>
<p>When one wakes op in the morning, there is a sense of discontinuity with 
<br>
the Css the previous night.  The Css is presented with memories, and 
<br>
will act by habits normal to that body's Css.  Beyond these things, 
<br>
there is no more link to the previous night's Css that if the Css had 
<br>
been &quot;transplanted&quot; from one body to another, aquiring the new body's 
<br>
memories and habits.
<br>
<p>More importantly, the Css of 5 seconds later has no connection to the 
<br>
Css of 5 seconds earlier than memory, habit, and &quot;what the Css is in the 
<br>
middle of doing&quot;
<br>
<p>Note that this idea of &quot;no identity&quot; is consistent with many 
<br>
interpretations of the idea of Consciousness, including bet not limited 
<br>
to idealistic and dualistic metaphysics.
<br>
<p>The moral implications of this are bizaare- it makes hedonism 
<br>
pointless.  Since &quot;you&quot; - the Css of right now - has no more connection 
<br>
to the Css of 5 seconds later than to the Css of a different body, so 
<br>
there is no advantage in taking that lollypop for yourself, rather than 
<br>
giving it away.  You won't be able to enjoy it, a different Css will.  
<br>
You can still be benevolent, but there's no advantage in being 
<br>
benevolent to your later self than your neighbour.
<br>
<p>Note:  I do not subscribe to this view.  Just as I think that there is 
<br>
&quot;Cause,&quot; I believe that there might be some mechanism that connects 
<br>
consciousnesses.  I understand how this might work on the half-second 
<br>
level - this is what I'm doing my PhD on - but I have serious doubts 
<br>
about the continuity of Css across things like sleep.  I'm pretty much 
<br>
undecided about whether there is an absolute &quot;personal identity&quot;.
