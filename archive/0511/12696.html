</em><br>
<p>Right.  But the problem is that the *potential* to make profound discoveries
<br>
is mighty difficult to measure.  Someone may have this potential and then
<br>
have it not be actualized for reasons totally unrelated to cognitive
<br>
capability -- lack of motivation, unfortunate personal circumstances, etc.
<br>
<p>It's clear that
<br>
<p>a)
<br>
the ability to rapidly solve moderately hard logic puzzles
<br>
in isolation and under pressure
<br>
<p>is not identical to
<br>
<p>b)
<br>
the ability to solve extremely hard puzzles that integrate logical
<br>
reasoning with other sorts of reasoning (like information integration, and
<br>
strategic decision-making, and the creation of new sorts of concepts, etc.),
<br>
in a context of access to other humans and knowledge resources and without
<br>
a high degree of time pressure or psychological pressure
<br>
<p>It should be obvious that the cognitive skills required for these two
<br>
things are overlapping but quite different.
<br>
<p>The IQ test basically measures
<br>
the former whereas real-world intellectual achievement is based on
<br>
the latter.  But quantifying the latter by means of a test seems far
<br>
more difficult.  Any reasonable test of this sort of ability would have to
<br>
last at least a few months, and it would be very hard to control for
<br>
&quot;cheating&quot; of various types.
<br>
<p>The idea of the &quot;g factor&quot; was in part that there is some general
<br>
intelligence
<br>
capability that underlies both a and b.  The more recent &quot;multiple
<br>
intelligences&quot;
<br>
idea argues against there being any single g factor, and argues that b is
<br>
a result of the intersection of multiple somewhat independent cognitive
<br>
abilities,
<br>
only some of which are measured in a.
<br>
<p>What makes things confusing however is that there is a significant
<br>
correlation
<br>
between a and b --- certainly a predicts b better than other quantities such
<br>
as
<br>
physical strength, or short-term memory size, or the ability to do rapid
<br>
arithmetic,
<br>
or grades in a typical school.  (In principle, grades in school could
<br>
measure
<br>
b better than a, but that would occur only if schools were intellectually
<br>
challenging and students were motivated...)
