FWIW, some old news:

<br>
<p>In recent times the interest for quantum models of brain activity has
<br>
rapidly grown. The Penrose-Hameroff model assumes that microtubules
<br>
inside neurons are responsible for quantum computation inside brain.
<br>
Several experiments seem to indicate that EPR-like correlations are
<br>
possible at the biological level. In the past year , a very intensive
<br>
experimental work about this subject has been done at DiBit Labs in
<br>
Milan, Italy by our research group. Our experimental set-up is made by
<br>
two separated and completely shielded basins where two parts of a common
<br>
human DNA neuronal culture are monitored by EEG. Our main experimental
<br>
result is that, under stimulation of one culture by means of a 630 nm
<br>
laser beam at 300 ms, the cross-correlation between the two cultures
<br>
grows up at maximum levels. Despite at this level of understanding it is
<br>
impossible to tell if the origin of this non-locality is a genuine
<br>
quantum effect, our experimental data seem to strongly suggest that
<br>
biological systems present non-local properties not explainable by
<br>
classical models.
