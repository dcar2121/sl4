<em>&gt;&gt;Your phrase &quot;chaotic nature of dynamical complex systems like weather

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a chaotic system is (not the same, usually) and what the characteristics

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why can't a weather simulation be complex and chaotic?
</em><br>
<p>You are right: weather systems *can* display both complex systems 
<br>
behavior and chaotic behavior, but what I was trying to get at was the 
<br>
fact that these really don't happen at the same level, so your comment 
<br>
about the chaotic nature of complex systems did not make any sense.
<br>
<p>A chaotic system tends to wander at random through its state space, 
<br>
whilst displaying regularity when its trajectory is examined in 
<br>
particular ways.  I would conclude that the global weather system was 
<br>
chaotic if we all got every kind of weather, at random times, wherever 
<br>
we lived on the planet, but that certain patterns could be discerned in 
<br>
the randomness.  That clearly does not happen on a fairly broad scale 
<br>
(we have never had 95 degree weather on a November day in upstate New 
<br>
York, for example).  On the other hand, if we looked at the connection 
<br>
between millimeter-scale air currents and large weather events (like 
<br>
tornadoes and hurricanes), we find mostly a random relationship, but on 
<br>
the other hand it is not completely random because at the origin point 
<br>
of every hurricane there is almost certainly a millimeter-scale air 
<br>
movement that looks unusual (a vortex emanating from the flap of a 
<br>
butterfly wing, for example).  This is classic Chaos, of course.  But 
<br>
notice that we had to switch scales to see the chaos.
<br>
<p>Complex systems, by contrast, do not wander at random through their 
<br>
entire state space.  They are described as being at &quot;the edge of chaos&quot; 
<br>
precisely because they show the kind of extremely ordered or restricted 
<br>
behavior that emerges as you tunr the knob (so to speak) on the 
<br>
controlling paramters of a chaotic system and turn it back into a 
<br>
regular, ordered (non-chaotic and non-complex) system.  Just before the 
<br>
parameter change makes the chaotic system regular, there is the 
<br>
possibility of it being quasi-ordered.  If you look at the weather 
<br>
system at a large scale (storm systems, fronts, tornadoes, hurricanes, 
<br>
rotating cells, etc), you can see a very crude example of complex 
<br>
behavior, but it is not a good one (not very systematic complexity). 
<br>
The emergent features are there (telltale signs of complexity), but they 
<br>
have poor structure and poor ability to interact with each other - 
<br>
mostly they just crash and merge when they meet each other, which is not 
<br>
very &quot;ordered&quot; behavior in my book.
<br>
<p>But what really made your comment confusing, for me, was when you said 
<br>
that &quot;He [Sununu, with his 386 climate simulation] observed how small 
<br>
changes in the inputs and assumptions led to large changes in the 
<br>
results and (correctly) reasoned that running on a supercomputer isn't 
<br>
going to mitigate that problem&quot;.  The chaotic or complex features of 
<br>
weather systems do not automatically buy you the conclusion that a small 
<br>
change in the inputs/assumptions causes large changes in the results. 
<br>
For a chaotic pendulum, for example, a small change in the initial 
<br>
conditions gets you nothing at all:  the trajectory is different, but 
<br>
the phase-space portrait is the same.  Even a change in the exact 
<br>
physical parameters of the system (longer or shorter pendulum, different 
<br>
placement of the trajectory disturbing objects, etc. etc), you would 
<br>
still observe similar phase-space diagrams. For a big complex adaptive 
<br>
system like an economics simulation  you might change some parameters 
<br>
and get big global changes, but as you systematically change the 
<br>
parameters you would not necessarily observe random changes at the 
<br>
global level.  Sometimes the global changes consequent on local or 
<br>
system parameter changes are small in magnitude (just not very 
<br>
understandable or obvious or analytically derivable).
<br>
<p>Because of the poor correspondence between the global weather system and 
<br>
a complex system, I would expect to find that when many simulations were 
<br>
done (by a supercomputer that hadthe power to do them), some fairly 
<br>
robust relationships between parameters and global trends would emerge. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, my understanding of the results is that this *is* what happens. 
<br>
More simulations and finer scale lead to broadly convergent predictions.
<br>
<p>More subtly, the simulations tell us that disturbing the atmosphere 
<br>
towards (e.g.) greater CO2 concentration causes a tendency toward 
<br>
unpredictability and wild fluctuations.  In other words, the simulations 
<br>
distinguish between calm regimes and wildly fluctuating regimes, and 
<br>
they predict that wild fluctuation is what the CO2 problem is inflicting 
<br>
on the world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;You also misunderstand what a supercomputer simulation is used for:  not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;just finer grained modelling, but modelling vast numbers of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;variations.  Sununu could not possibly have learned anything from his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;silly little simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say he was right necessarily. I said he may not be as stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as someone originally thought. Is it possible?
</em><br>
<p>If someone is purported to be smart, but comes to the conclusion that 
<br>
their tiny little desktop simulation is as good as a supercomputer, and 
<br>
if a five minute conversation with a simulation expert could have 
<br>
revealed that they were profoundly mistaken, then most certainly that 
<br>
person is stupid.
<br>
<p>It is a bit like the kind of macho behavior that occurs when someone 
<br>
wants to go ice skating on a pond, but dismisses the expert advice (that 
<br>
the temerature has got to be below a certain level for a certain number 
<br>
of days) and instead just stamps on the ice at the edge and declares it 
<br>
to be good enough.  That person is stupid.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;But I think you only made this comment as an excuse to start a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;flame war on the subject of global warming ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see any good reason to impugn my motives. Are you trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make me feel unwelcome here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David
</em><br>
<p>Heavens, no.  I am sorry you got that impression:  I put a facetious 
<br>
smiley in to indicate that I suspected you were *maybe* trying to be 
<br>
provocative (as some others have been, just recently, and as some are 
<br>
being right now, on another branch of this same thread).
<br>
<p>There are enough other people on this list who are casually insulting, 
<br>
that I would be sad if I had descended to the same level of rudeness. 
<br>
Apologies if it looked like I was being insulting.
<br>
