</em><br>
<p><p>Except that CO2 decreases are also preceded by temperature declines  
<br>
-- it is a very consistent pattern.  This strongly suggests that CO2  
<br>
levels are directly regulated by temperatures that vary independent  
<br>
of CO2 levels.  While the static thermal characteristics of various  
<br>
atmospheric mixes are reasonably well understood, the dynamics of  
<br>
such things as they interact with the planet and biosphere under a  
<br>
broad range of parameters are largely a mystery.  Given the evidence  
<br>
of other strong dynamics at play (e.g. parallel atmospheric warming  
<br>
on neighboring planets), it would seem incredibly premature to  
<br>
attribute it entirely or even mostly to anthropogenic CO2 at the  
<br>
moment.  In all probability, the underlying dynamics of climate  
<br>
change do not neatly package into a soundbite any more succinct than  
<br>
&quot;shit happens&quot;; no thirty minute sitcom answers with an obvious moral  
<br>
lesson here, no matter how much we desire one.
<br>
<p>This is a very common theme, whether discussing AI, the Singularity,  
<br>
or planetary atmospheric dynamics.  People want the universe to be  
<br>
explained by something that is simple, succinct, and which requires  
<br>
little effort to absorb or use.  In reality, most systems of any  
<br>
complexity do not become &quot;simple&quot; until one exerts an extraordinary  
<br>
amount of effort trying to grok them.
<br>
<p>Saying that CO2 is the primary driver of climate is approximately  
<br>
like saying that an AI is nothing more than an expansive library of  
<br>
&quot;common sense&quot; facts.  It is turning an observation about the system  
<br>
into the system itself.  This is much, much cheaper than grokking the  
<br>
system, but it has only a shadow of the utility of grokking the  
<br>
system and is a dangerous basis to make broad assertions from.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are a lot of feedback cycles in play, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the opinion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific community...
</em><br>
<p><p>The substantial conclusions of the scientific community are far  
<br>
thinner than the conclusions frequently attributed to them by  
<br>
ideologues.  I have no problem with the idea that the planet is  
<br>
warming; the variance in global temperature over the last century has  
<br>
been placid compared to most centuries over the last million years,  
<br>
so I would consider the regularity of the last century to be an  
<br>
anomaly.  My problem is with the level of certainty people have  
<br>
regarding the nature of the system given such thin understanding -- I  
<br>
have no preference for any conclusion as long as it is reasonable and  
<br>
rational.
