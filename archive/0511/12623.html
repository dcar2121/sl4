<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
I appreciate your willingness to describe your own experiences. Not being
<br>
any kind of genius myself, I found your self-report to be both fascinating
<br>
and illuminating.
<br>
<p>When I was an undergraduate at New College in Florida, one of my fellow
<br>
students was a 12-year-old &quot;boy genius.&quot; I don't want to reveal his name
<br>
because he has always avoided publicity, refusing press interviews and so
<br>
forth.
<br>
<p>In a student body of fewer than 500, he stood out wherever he went. I won't
<br>
say too much about his social skills except to say that I and others I spoke
<br>
too all had the disconcerting feeling of never actually interacting with him
<br>
but rather being &quot;observed&quot; by him.
<br>
<p>Here's just one example: I was playing pinball in the student union
<br>
building. He came up and stood next to the machine on its long side (that
<br>
is, neither next to nor behind me). As I played the silver ball, using the
<br>
flippers and gently nudging the machine in order to influence the ball's
<br>
trajectory, he gave occasional light pushes to the pinball machine. As soon
<br>
as I noticed him doing this, I asked him politely to stop.
<br>
<p>He didn't. Finally, exasperated, I said &quot;Do you want to play a ball?&quot; He
<br>
declined. But he continued to mess with my game. That did it. I took him by
<br>
the shoulders and moved him into the playing position. &quot;If you want to play,
<br>
then play&quot; I said. Reluctantly, he played one ball which quickly &quot;drained&quot;
<br>
down the center. Then he walked away and never bothered me again.
<br>
<p>He graduated at 16 and went to Caltech where he was to be a math TA while
<br>
working on his degree in physics. After earning his PhD, he turned his
<br>
attention away from bleeding edge research and went into public policy work.
<br>
That amazed me! I had hoped that he might at least find the proverbial &quot;big
<br>
problem&quot; that you mentioned and then make a major contribution. Somehow,
<br>
advising politicians on the public policy implications of science does not
<br>
fit my concept of a really big problem.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra
