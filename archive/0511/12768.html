<p>I could give up audio above 20kHz without *any* loss; usually only  
<br>
very young people can hear at frequencies quite that high anyway.  
<br>
Most people over twenty years old don't have ranges that can go  
<br>
higher than about 15kHz, AFAIK.
<br>
<p>However, I think it would be worthwhile to ask whether or not any of  
<br>
my cortical real estate is being &quot;wasted&quot; on those frequencies even  
<br>
though my cochlea can't transmit them. I think that any neurons or  
<br>
synapses that may have been specialized early in my life to respond  
<br>
to such high frequencies would have eventually switched jobs or died  
<br>
off altogether once my ears had stopped transmitting to them.
