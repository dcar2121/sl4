<em>&gt; SIAI contains basically Eliezer (who isn't known to have

</em><br>
<p>The SIAI does not currently have any paid staff doing AGI
<br>
design or implementation. It's a little under two years
<br>
since I started working full-time on AGI technology
<br>
development, but this has been necessarily been privately
<br>
funded. Besides myself, my company currently only has one
<br>
part time software engineer and two part-time sales/business
<br>
development staff. Funding permitting, I intend to hire a
<br>
couple of full time software developers next summer.
<br>
Unfortunately I rate the chances of finding anyone capable
<br>
of doing serious AI development through standard recruiting
<br>
as essentially zero, so these staff will be working only on
<br>
the commercialisation aspects and supporting software. As I
<br>
have often stated, I am not currently attempting to build a
<br>
complete AGI, but I am working on a set of components that I
<br>
intend to be a sufficient basis for such a project (such as
<br>
possibly the 'official' SIAI project) in the future. I would
<br>
certainly hire any decent AGI-qualified researchers that
<br>
are available in the UK, but I'm not aware of anyone suitable
<br>
at this time.
<br>
<p>On the issue of project size, I'm not sure (and I don't think
<br>
anyone is) what the shape of the staff_count/researcher_
<br>
quality/completion_time/success_probability surface looks
<br>
like, particularly as I ascribe so much of the success
<br>
probability to whether the team has the right general attitude
<br>
and methodology. I expect that serious manager expertise is
<br>
needed to prevent the staff_count/success_prob curve peaking 
<br>
quite early. But if I had unlimited funds, I'd aim for about
<br>
five core researcher/designers and perhaps twenty supporting
<br>
engineers, and see how that works out in practice. You can
<br>
have as many additional theorists as you like (e.g. FAI
<br>
theorists) as long as they're not interfering with development
<br>
work on a day-to-day basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the microsofts and Sun's of the world see exciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results, it won't take much for them to replicate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overtake small firms with anything but a colossal head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start,
</em><br>
<p>That depends on several factors, such as the opacity of the
<br>
design, its closeness to existing techniques, the level of
<br>
detail publically disclosed, where the code is actually
<br>
deployed (e.g. network versus local application delivery)
<br>
and critically how good the competitor's industrial espionage
<br>
and startup's security procedures are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; unless someone manages to develop much AI theory in relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolation, and keep from having to release much or any of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software to public attention, which seems extremely unlikely.
</em><br>
<p>It's not so unlikely for researchers that have a clue and are
<br>
aware of the high stakes and dangerous players involved. Just
<br>
look at James Rogers, who insists that he's going to keep any
<br>
AGI successes quiet and refuses to reveal anything about his
<br>
design. I'd guess that Novamente and A2I2 have given this at
<br>
least some thought, if only from the IP protection angle (which
<br>
is basically essential to any IT business these days), but
<br>
right now I wouldn't give them a significent chance of avoiding
<br>
a serious attempt to steal their code (and/or have their staff
<br>
hired away).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a theory gap (proprietary or simply advanced software theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is difficult to discern by untrained, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse-engineers(also possible)),
</em><br>
<p>IMHO this is highly likely for any AGI design that actually
<br>
works on current hardware. AGI is very hard to understand,
<br>
extremely difficult to explain, and I'm willing to bet damn
<br>
near impossible to reverse engineer without the full source
<br>
and development documentation (and pretty difficult and time
<br>
consuming even then).
<br>
<p>Plus appropriate software patents /may/ slow down commercial
<br>
competitors in the US. They will of course do nothing against
<br>
rest-of-world competitors and military projects.
