<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Martin Striz
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You should be extremely suspicious of any such universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quantifiers (e.g., Entire scientific community) on such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; controversial issue, or else we must be suspicious of you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your posts, as to accuracy or honesty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The conclusions of the IPCC, which has gathered data from a large body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of scientists, 
</em><br>
<p>But not all (&quot;entire scientific community&quot;) as you claimed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is taken as the concensus view of the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community.  
</em><br>
<p>Taken by whom?  You have introduced a lost performative
<br>
(no real subject in the sentence.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Michael Behe may be a scientist, and he may disagree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturalistic evolution, but I would still say that the ENTIRE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific community supports naturalistic evolution.  
</em><br>
<p>And on that subject it would be a reasonably accurate
<br>
use of the word 'entire' since there is no real dispute
<br>
by scientists who work in the field.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think...
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm being remiss in that claim.
</em><br>
<p>You are.  Since even a contributer to the panel you site
<br>
has offered strong factual evidence that arrives naturally
<br>
at a different conclusion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Maybe there is a problem; maybe there isn't.  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human activity is staving off the expected (due in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; geological times) 'next Ice Age' but more likely human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; activity is having a small effect on natural swings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; global temperatures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The IPCC concluded that about half of the 1 degree centigrade rise in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperature in the last 100 years can be attributed to human activity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  When something accounts for 50% of the variance, that's signficant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but you are also claiming that the entire amount
<br>
is significant.  
<br>
<p>This is as much in doubt scientifically as the amount
<br>
and that claim is not generally accepted by everyone
<br>
in the field (as you now have been informed.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Before making up one's mind to the point of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;certain&quot; and unwilling to consider additional facts it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would do well to hear the explanations of Patrick J.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Michaels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm always open to new data.  I don't think that there's such a dearth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evidence on this matter that the &quot;jury is still out&quot; as some would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say about evolution.  
</em><br>
<p>So you have read and understood Michaels?
<br>
<p>Or are you just assuming he has nothing to offer
<br>
you since you 'already know' the answer?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolutionary theory involves a complex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multidisciplinary body of knowledge, with gaps and ostensible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inexplicables, but there's enough data there to be make a sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.  I feel the same way about climate change.
</em><br>
<p>Feelings don't count for much in science.  Sorry, you
<br>
are reasoning from a very poor analogy which may be
<br>
much of your problem with logic and evidence.
<br>
<p>Analogies are great for understanding and approximation,
<br>
perhaps even as roads to investigation, but they can be
<br>
terribly misleading when misapplied as you are doing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Michaels is a professor of environmental sciences at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the University of Virginia, past president of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Association of State Climatologists, past program chair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Meteorological Society, contributing author and reviewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Change...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wait a minute!  Isn't that the UN Panel you quoted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; providing definite evidence and proof of your position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe you should READ what Michaels has to say on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subject so that you can know the disagreements and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand how the actual findings are frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; misinterpreted by the press and others with a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axe to grind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Start with the very affordable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Meltdown : The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Politicians, and the Media - Patrick J. Michaels; Paperback

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or the more expensive:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Shattered Consensus: The True State Of Global Warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by Patrick J. Michaels (Hardcover - October 28, 2005)
</em><br>

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/002-87143">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/002-87143</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 61-7898438
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Keep and open mind and research both sides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Things are NOT so clearly decided (among the experts)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the press would have us believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't look to the press.  I look at the primary literature.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of the controversy.  
</em><br>
<p>Then you lied when you claimed the entire scientific
<br>
community and dismissed the former poster derisively
<br>
without evidence or data to support your point but the
<br>
mere claim that the &quot;entire scientific community&quot;
<br>
agreed with your point.
<br>
<p>You knew there was a controversy but you tried to dismiss
<br>
him as an idiot who did not know the question has been
<br>
answered completely in your favor.
<br>
<p>If you knew of the controversy that was not just rude, but
<br>
also dishonest.
<br>
<p>The question that remained for me was it intentionally 
<br>
dishonest (a lie) or were you deceiving yourself through
<br>
some form of neurotic thinking.
<br>
<p>Based on your new claim the question is answered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The job of the IPCC is to winnow the data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and come to an honest and objective (as far as humanly possible)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.  
</em><br>
<p>So have you read the entire report or are you taking 
<br>
just the &quot;conclusion&quot; as a simple answer to a very 
<br>
complex question?
<br>
<p>If you have listened to the scientists, even those who
<br>
support the human causation you know they are not as a
<br>
group so willing to call this question closed.
<br>
<p>It is only the press, and those like you, who adopt a
<br>
juvenile simplification.
<br>
<p>Real scientists are much more cautious in almost all 
<br>
cases of such controversy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Their conclusions often are not as alarming as the press
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have you believe.  In the 2001 report (the last full report), as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said, they attribute half of the 1 degree rise in temperature over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last century to human activity.  CO2 and halocarbons are major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributors to that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the references.  Here are a few for you:
</em><br>
<p>You are welcome.  
<br>
<p>I appreciate the references but would appreciate them
<br>
more if you indicated the speficic value of these and
<br>
