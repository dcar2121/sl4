<p>I don't know about you, but I could stand to have a lot more O
<br>
bandwidth than I do. I think a word processing-like application could
<br>
be a very effective extension of our short term memory if we could
<br>
type four or five hundred words a minute, about as fast as we think,
<br>
and if navigating the document and moving the cursor around were
<br>
equally fast. This sort of aid could really help when your short-term
<br>
memory is mainly being used for stack-like data structures, and not as
<br>
helpful when you really need a lot of facts in memory at once to be
<br>
able to synthesize them. But I think humans' poor ability to deal with
<br>
stacks are one of the main things that inhibit our efficiency. The
<br>
size of our working memory just decreases the amount of complexity we
<br>
can deal with, and layers of abstraction can help a lot with that. If
<br>
we had a better stack, I think our effective ability to focus would
<br>
increase a lot. We would stop going off on tangents, getting
<br>
sidetracked and then forgetting what one was doing, etc. Ideally, we
<br>
would be able to recover our previous working memory from any point in
<br>
the recent past within a few seconds. We could optimize our working
<br>
set by choosing which facts to discard, instead of adding in new facts
<br>
and having random ones be discarded. The closer we can get to that
<br>
ideal, the smarter we can be, I think.
<br>
<p>I wonder how close we could get with our current tools (or tools
<br>
easily created)?

<p><em>&gt; (as long as you're not suffering from

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I use the Fingerworks Touchstream for a lot of my work. That seemed to
<br>
help my RSI a lot. Too bad they don't sell new ones any longer. I type
<br>
about the same speed on it as I do on regular keyboards, with a few
<br>
more mistakes, but few others report this level of success on it. I
<br>
adapted to it in about a week, with no affect on my normal keyboard
<br>
abilities.
<br>
<p>Long before I got the touchstream, I also took the month or so it
<br>
requires to learn Dvorak. (If you have to continue using the standard
<br>
layout in the meanwhile, though, expect to triple the time necessary
<br>
to use learn dvorak, and that's only if you faithfully practice.) My
<br>
typing speed is basically the same as before (90-100 wpm) but it's
<br>
much more comfortable, as Dvorak requires a lot less finger movement
<br>
to accomplish the same amount of typing. (Even the visual difference
<br>
is striking.)
<br>
<p>I bet my typing speed could be increased more, but that's a different
<br>
kind of training, and I haven't seen any typing programs aimed at
<br>
increasing the speed of an already very fast typist. (Any leads,
<br>
anyone?) I imagine the highest humanly possible speed with current
<br>
keyboards and human anatomy is around the 200-220 WPM range
<br>
accomplished by the world record holder (using dvorak--it's around 180
<br>
with qwerty, IIRC). It seems (advanced) piano practice techniques
<br>
might be relevant to this.
<br>
<p>As far as RSI goes, I believe the same techniques that allow you to
<br>
approach the limits of human ability in typing speed will require you
<br>
to solve the (extremely difficult to solve) bad habits that lead to
<br>
RSI in the first place. Many advanced pianists could affirm this.
