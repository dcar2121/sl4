At AC 2005, Peter Norvig (of Google) commented in passing that Google
<br>
doesn't currently have an AGI project.  They do have a 20% policy where
<br>
employees can spend 20% of their time on whatever interests them, and he
<br>
mentioned that a few people are doing AGI with their 20%.
<br>
<p>My guess is that in the quote below, the speaker meant AI as in &quot;one of our
<br>
clever natural language processors&quot;, not as in a strong AGI.

<p>I'm not worried about intelligence spontaneously emerging from the  
<br>
Google File System.  I'm much more concerned with Google's ability  
<br>
and capacity to work on AI in secret, while failing to sufficiently  
<br>
value the idea of friendly AI and rushing things in order to gain a  
<br>
crushing first-mover advantage in the marketplace.  They have been on  
<br>
a hiring binge of late, have an extensive R&amp;D budget, are notoriously  
<br>
private, and already use special-purpose machine learning for some of  
<br>
their projects.

one of my hosts after my talk. &quot;We are scanning them to be read by an
