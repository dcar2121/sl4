</em><br>
<p>Thank you Richard for the clarification and the defense (I was the
<br>
previous poster who made those comments).  The problem is one that PZ
<br>
Myers (of pharyngula.org fame) discussed with  Chris Mooney (of
<br>
Republican War on Science fame), in this exchange:
<br>
<p>&quot;Myers's question for Mooney was simple: Why is so much science
<br>
journalism so bad? The journalistic imperative of &quot;balance,&quot; Mooney
<br>
replied, has no parallel in the world of science. Consequently, the
<br>
media's formulaic use of &quot;he said/she said&quot; reporting often generates
<br>
a false sense of controversy about matters that scientists
<br>
overwhelmingly count as settled.&quot;
<br>
<p>Journalists are taught about fairness and balance, but in the real
<br>
world, there aren't always two (equal) sides to every debate.  The
<br>
stork is not an equal alternative explanation to our modern medical
<br>
understanding of reproduction.  The flat earth is not an equal
<br>
alternative explanation to modern cosmology.  No matter how many
<br>
nay-sayers, special creation is not an equal alternative explanation
<br>
to naturalistic evolution.  No matter how many detractors, the view
<br>
that humans are having an insignificant impact on earth's climate,
<br>
according to the evidence at hand and the vast majority of the experts
<br>
who actually know something about it, is not equal to the view that
<br>
anthropogenic climate change is real.
<br>
<p>There's a fairly  vociferous noise brigade capable of making an issue
<br>
out of a non-issue when it comes to Intelligent Design/creationism vs.
<br>
evolution, which exists in the USA because it's a particularly
<br>
religious country.  And there's a fairly vociferous noise brigade
<br>
capable of making anthropogenic climate change an issue where it's
<br>
otherwise a settled issue in most of the world.  They are particularly
<br>
noisy in places with wealthy people who have much to lose from
<br>
regulatory bodies and from being forced to clean up the pollution they
<br>
cause.  Much of the cost of  that pollution isn't factored into the
<br>
cost of the energy we use or goods we make.
<br>
<p>Every ordinary citizen has to pay to get their trash picked up
<br>
(through taxes or direct user fees), yet somehow the corporations
<br>
expect to get their trash cleaned up for free.  So the noise brigade
<br>
wails in order to sow just enough doubt in the public's mind. 
<br>
Scientists get paid off by corporations to publish just enough
<br>
contradictory information.  And we are still debating what should be a
<br>
settled issue.

<p>P.S.  The Skeptical Environmentalist cherry-picked his data.  Read the
<br>
Dutch report.
