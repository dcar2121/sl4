<p><em>&gt; my point is that the scientific method is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; final measure of truth. 
</em><br>
<p>The only thing that would take priority is my direct experience of
<br>
physical sensation; if you hit me on the head with a hammer I don’t need
<br>
the scientific method to know that it hurts, but other than that the
<br>
scientific method is indeed the final measure of truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The scientific method is a sub-branch of rationality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is itself a sub branch of ways-of-looking-at-the-world. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is the branch of looking at the world in ways that work and
<br>
there is the branch that does not work. If voodoo could predict how
<br>
variations in doll manufacture affected performance of the curse; if a
<br>
Fundamental Theorem Of Voodoo could determine the shape of the &quot;needle
<br>
penetration of doll versus distress of victim&quot; plot, then voodoo would
<br>
be as much a science as quantum mechanics. The important difference
<br>
between magic and science is not that one deals in chants, incantations
<br>
and crystal balls and the other deals in equations, computer code and
<br>
electron microscopes. The difference is that one works and the other
<br>
does not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The soul may be a load o crap, but just because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't run physical tests for it doesn't make it so. 
</em><br>
<p>Just because?! Good god man, that means you can never disprove any of
<br>
those silly soul theories, if that’s not crap what the hell is?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I have serious doubts about the continuity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Css across things like sleep.  I'm pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; undecided about whether there is an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;personal identity&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I believe the above contains absolutely no meaning;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you are just playing with words. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm saying &quot;I don't know&quot;. That has meaning! 
</em><br>
<p>You’re saying you don’t know if the statement is true or false. I’m
<br>
saying I know, I'm saying it is not true, I'm saying it is not false,
<br>
I'm saying it’s gibberish. I have a little gibberish detector that comes
<br>
in handy, especially in philosophy; first I assume the statement is true
<br>
and figure out what that would mean to the world, then I assume the
<br>
exact opposite to be true; if there is no difference in the resulting
<br>
world view then the statement has no content, in other words it is
<br>
gibberish. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Romans and Greeks did damn fine jobs of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building bridges without a zero. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh my God, I hadn’t thought of that! OK, you win, you’ve convinced me,
<br>
the Greeks knew how to make bridges so obviously the soul must exist.
