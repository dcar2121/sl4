<p>
Reality is defined by what a being can perceive, nothing more or less. Reality 
<br>
for me is different than your reality, but we can interact and affect each 
<br>
other's realities because we can affect each other's perceptions. A common 
<br>
reality that most of us have senses to perceive are obviously in the time-space 
<br>
realm. A simulation is simply an artificially created reality that is tailored 
<br>
towards the sensory perceptions of the inhabitants or test subjects.
<br>
<p>If I understand the conversation so far, trying to sense or discover the super-
<br>
reality that hosts our current one is an impossible task. Maybe I need to read 
<br>
those chapters in /Godel, Escher, Bach/ again where the characters are reading 
<br>
a book about them reading a book about them reading, etc. Coming back up the 
<br>
reality chain is an impossibility unless you maintain the path to how you got 
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>When creating an &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence, that being has its own reality. 
<br>
most likely not in our time-space world, but somewhere else that can only be 
<br>
defined by the computer's I/O devices and peripherals. The goal we are trying 
<br>
to achieve with artificially creating an intelligence, both general and domain-
<br>
specific, is to represent our human (or individual) reality in the machine's 
<br>
reality, have the machine operate, then make action decisions that translate 
<br>
back to our reality. There is a mapping of some sort between realities, which 
<br>
is a skill that programmers develop.
<br>
<p><p>I believe that a meta-reality needs to be defined, from which all realities can 
<br>
be defined by. This will allow translations between co-realities, and the 
<br>
Universe will be seen (or perceived) as a whole again. If this happens, I'm 
<br>
betting we're going to find aliens EVERYWHERE!
<br>

<p><p><em>&gt; What's interesting to me about Gordon's claim that &quot;I feel like I am very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real&quot; is WHAT THE HECK IS THE _DEFINITION_ OF REAL YOU'RE USING???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've thought about it a bit, and the only definitions of &quot;real&quot; I can come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with are defined by reference to a sim: I.e., basically, this world is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real if there is no other world underlying it (a simulating computer, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreaming mind, etc.).  Is there a _positive_ definition of &quot;real&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're thinking of, Gordon?
