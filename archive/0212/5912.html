<p>
Arona,
<br>
<p>What you have to understand is that there are a lot of different states of
<br>
consciousness...
<br>
<p>What we think of as &quot;ordinary waking consciousness&quot; is more diverse than is
<br>
ordinarily accepted.  But beyond that, there is a huge variety of states of
<br>
consciousness, which modern psychological science has done a very poor job
<br>
of exploring.  Buddhist psychology and other non-Western approaches to the
<br>
mind have done a somewhat better job, but their analyses are often
<br>
&quot;corrupted&quot; by being oriented toward the exaltation of one or another state
<br>
of consciousness as &quot;superior&quot; (and their analyses are often quite hard to
<br>
understand for reasons of cultural difference).
<br>
<p>LSD is a very flexible psychoactive agent, and can lead to a lot of
<br>
different states of consciousness....  But LSD trips do not tend to lend
<br>
themselves to concentrated coherent creative activity, though they may more
<br>
likely be helpful in laying the unconscious groundwork for future such
<br>
activity.
<br>
<p>The &quot;flow&quot; states that we're talking about are in some ways closer to
<br>
LSD-trip states, and in some ways closer to variants of the ordinary waking
<br>
state that involve concentrated attention.   You could think about flow,
<br>
LSD-trip, and ordinary concentration as being on three vertices of a
<br>
triangle in &quot;state of consciousness space.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Enlightenment&quot; is surely yet another state of consciousness ... or,
<br>
presumably, a collection of states of consciousness.  Perhaps the
<br>
&quot;enlightenment&quot; state of consciousness brought about via Buddhist meditation
<br>
is actually different in many ways from the &quot;enlightenment&quot; state brought
<br>
about through shamanic practice ... etc.
<br>
<p>Naturally, a nonhuman mind will have access to different states of
<br>
consciousness than we will.  And thru self-modification it will be able to
<br>
create fundamentally new states of consciousness with a lot more fluidity
<br>
than we can, with our fixed neural architecture.
<br>
<p>As for whether Eliezer is in a permanently enlightened, flow or
<br>
LSD-trip-like state of consciousness -- I'm not in his head, but even so I
<br>
have to admit I laughed a bit when i read this.  Having met Eliezer a couple
<br>
times in person, I did not get that impression!!  However, I am sure his
<br>
&quot;normal&quot; state of consciousness has its own special flavor, and perhaps that
<br>
flavor is a little further away from the &quot;human centroid state of
<br>
consciousness&quot; than most...
<br>
<p>I find that English has almost no words or phrases to describe various
<br>
states of consciousness &amp; their qualities.  For example, my state of
<br>
consciousness during the last 2 months is quite different than it ever was
<br>
before -- and I know exactly how, internally -- but to sum up the change
<br>
I've undergone in words, would require writing an essay, not a sentence (and
<br>
I don't intend to write that essay right now... )
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben G

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Re: Chess and Go study
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it's like being given access to something that's always been there.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if one is allowed to see something, be part of something that is always
<br>
there.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It always allows me to solve whatever problem I was struggling with. One
<br>
thing that can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be unsettling is the transition back to normal state. It can last 1-10
<br>
minutes, or a day sometimes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I'm not always sure what I  really saw while in that state. The only
<br>
way to check
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is to look at my code or whatever I wrote or did while in that state.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; Eliezer don't read the following paragraph or if you do, be so kind as
<br>
to give me a break&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I kinda feel there is definitely some sort of  correlation between LSD and
<br>
that state. I never did
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;any. I however  did some mushrooms (too much in one go) and hated it coz
<br>
the world was gone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not remember anything scaring me more than that. And I'm not prone to
<br>
fear. But I did not control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my thoughts well enough, all hell broke loose. I did mushrooms once more
<br>
after that, to beat the fear and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;kinda succeeded. I will however try to stay away from hallucinogenic for
<br>
the rest of my life. Thank you very much !!!!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I however am glad I tried as I never looked at anything the same way after
<br>
that =)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; Eliezer you can carry on reading &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to that peculiar brain state, I feel like I'll never get used
<br>
to the 'switching back'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's so severe that I can be a danger to myself or people around me. I'm
<br>
effectively unaware of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the world for a while. So I always try to make sure I do not get in that
<br>
state in the wrong places.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, life's a bit dull when coming out of that state. I immediately want
<br>
to rush back in. It took
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;me many years to realize that being in that state all the time might be
<br>
what various mystics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;call 'enlightenment'. The longest I've stayed in that state was during
<br>
1990 or 1991. I did not sleep more than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2-4 hours average per day for that whole year. I ate chess, dreamed chess,
<br>
saw people as chess
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pieces, related everything in life to chess. I never played the same
<br>
again. I do not even play anymore,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;apart from the occasional game. Nowadays it happens almost invariably
<br>
while designing objects.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Various papers at <a href="http://www.reciprocality.org">http://www.reciprocality.org</a> talks a lot about that
<br>
state. You probably know that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;site anyway...
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Could it be that Eli is in that state permanently ? I'm serious.
