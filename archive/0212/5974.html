<p>The responses so far have an implicit assumption: &quot;given ideal
<br>
conditions...&quot;.  Well folks, in reality conditions tend to be far
<br>
from ideal, and I am very skeptical that this will just go away
<br>
when the Rapture^WSingularity cometh.
<br>
<p>When you are actually given the choice of transforming yourself,
<br>
practical concerns will likely dominate your decision.  Like, can
<br>
you pay for it?  I'd like to inject one pragmatic consideration in
<br>
particular into this dicussion:  Will the change increase or decrease
<br>
your dependence on a specialized environment?
<br>
<p>A solitary Homo sapiens can only marginally survive in a natural
<br>
terrestrial environment.  If you drop me on a lonely island,
<br>
Robinson-style, I'll probably starve before long.  A survivalist
<br>
may avoid that fate but is quite likely to sooner or later suffer
<br>
a disabling injury or disease and perish in consequence.  Plain
<br>
humans only survive well in groups.  If you drop me into any human
<br>
society on Earth (that doesn't outright kill me out of xenophobia),
<br>
I will survive there.  I can eat the same food, I can learn their
<br>
language, etc.
<br>
<p>How will the proposed transformations affect this?  Becoming...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben3: A Ben in a humanoid robot body, with the ability to breathe in space,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fly, etc.
</em><br>
<p>... sounds enticing, doesn't it?  But, wait a second.  That magnificient
<br>
robot body will stop working if you don't follow the regular service
<br>
intervals specified by Robotics Inc., who also happen to be the
<br>
sole supplier of spare parts.  And the global Business Improvement
<br>
Act of 2025 has outlawed infringing on any company's monopoly.
<br>
<p>In contrast, consider the mad millionaire from Greg Egan's _Distress_
<br>
who turns his body into a self-sufficient ecology that would allow
<br>
him to survive even on a diet of old tires after the Big War.
<br>
<p>Uploading is a favorite of many transhumanists.  But living as a
<br>
brain in a jar, pardon, a program on hardware not under your control
<br>
is about as dystopian a vision as they come (&quot;I Have No Mouth And
<br>
I Must Scream&quot;).
<br>
<p>Personally, when I grow up I want to be a god.  That's Ben5 alright,
<br>
the unlimited upload.  But that assumes there is a sufficiently
<br>
redundant substrate for me to run on, either public or my personal
<br>
property, so that pulling the plug on me is at least as difficult
<br>
and legally discouraged as splitting my current meaty head with a
<br>
cleaver is; it assumes that I can still interact with and affect
<br>
the outside world; it assumes that either the substrate or the code
<br>
and database I consist of have mobility; and so on.
<br>
<p>We may be put to the choice when those ideal conditions have not
<br>
been met.
