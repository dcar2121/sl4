<p>Bill, the only worry I have with this statement is: I believe that solving
<br>
the temporal credit assignment problem requires  a lot of structures and
<br>
dynamics that are outside the scope of what's normally considered
<br>
&quot;reinforcement learning.&quot;
<br>
<p>For instance, I suspect that solving the temporal credit assignment problem
<br>
involves [at least] the combination of things related to what we now call
<br>
&quot;probabilistic higher-order inference&quot; and things related to what we now
<br>
call &quot;evolutionary programming&quot;.
<br>
<p>It may even require the synthesis (inside the  mind in question) of object
<br>
serving as goals and subgoals, and the spawning of inference or
<br>
inference-like problems relating to these goals/subgoals...
<br>
<p>So there is not *necessarily* a contradiction between reinforcement learning
<br>
(in your general sense) and &quot;planning behavior from goals&quot;.
<br>
<p>But there is a distinction between an architecture in which goals are
<br>
explicitly given from the outset (which is my understanding of Eliezer's
<br>
approach), and an architecture in which goals are expected to implicitly
<br>
emerge as a consequence of RL (which is how I understand your approach, and
<br>
Peter Voss's A2I2 approach as well).
<br>
<p>In Novamente, we have some simple goals given explicitly from the outset,
<br>
but they're more low-level goals than Friendliness; Friendliness to humans
<br>
is expected to emerge thru social-interaction-directed RL.  (At least that
<br>
is the current plan for Novamente; the design and implementation are
<br>
flexible, and there is the opportunity for substantial revision before we
<br>
get to the stage where Friendliness really matters.)
<br>
