Hi Jonathon,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You said...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that's a really good idea, I bet it has proved very useful...
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do you have a website with a demo of your project?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I hope you do not mind but I am copying my reply to you to the mailing
<br>
list since I have had similar questions from others on the list and am
<br>
giving you a few examples that some of the others may find interesting
<br>
and applicable to their AGI research.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sorry Jonathon, I do not yet have a website for my project.  I am afraid
<br>
my hosting costs would be very high.   Right now I require at least a
<br>
2.2 Ghz machine with 512MB of memory running .Net runtime to give
<br>
satisfactory run time for a single user!   I also require about 300MB of
<br>
disk to hold the Knowledge Base, executables and leave room for some log
<br>
files.  The only operating system I have tested this on yet is Windows
<br>
XP Professional.  Each web client would need to run a separate instance
<br>
of the application also due to the bot's need to maintain context within
<br>
each conversation.    
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My user interface is now a console mode screen to meet the Loebner
<br>
competition requirements but since it's written in VB.Net I don't think
<br>
it will be difficult to turn it into a web service.  I have some college
<br>
students giving me a bid on a Web interface and trying to get me and
<br>
inexpensive host site, but the last estimate I received from a national
<br>
ISP was about $750 a month. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I had hoped to get something up by March for the Chatterbot challenge
<br>
contest, but that will depend on what kind of cost and time my estimate
<br>
comes back with.   The number one priority for my time still has to be
<br>
increasing the base intelligence of the system.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Feel free to ask any questions you may have though and even if I can't
<br>
open my website up to everyone when it's done due to processing
<br>
constraints, I'll be sure to contact you and allocate some time for you
<br>
on the system.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I like your website.  I see you are into immortality also.  I read and
<br>
was very intrigued by the first part of your immortality how-to!  Will
<br>
you include your views on dietary restriction, antioxidant and nutrient
<br>
supplementation as well?   Please drop me a line when you complete it.
<br>
You should also consider publishing it on www.imminst.org they are a
<br>
site that is devoted to immortality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You may already be aware of this site, but just in case you aren't I
<br>
thought I would mention it to you also.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<a href="http://www.find-a-drug.com/">http://www.find-a-drug.com/</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You must have a very interesting background you seem to have a lot of
<br>
background in neural systems.  I read through some of your other AI
<br>
articles and got lost very quickly.   I would be interested to see your
<br>
ISL spec when it's completed though.  The closest thing I have to your
<br>
ISL are my embedded pattern variables which contain information
<br>
regarding set membership:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In English: Cats, dogs, and rats are mammals
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In NPL:     [Mammal]=&quot;{cat|dog|rat}&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If input from user: &quot;A cow is a mammal&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Then NPL becomes [Mammal]=&quot;{cat|cow|dog|rat}&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Where [Mammal] is the pattern variable name. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{} says one of the enclosed set members is required
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| indicates a &quot;logical or&quot; set member seperator
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So if the user asks &quot;Is dog a mammal&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Pattern  1    &lt;&lt; Is a [Mammal] a  mam(m){a|e}l[eoln]
<br>
Response 1 &gt;&gt; Yes a [#Token3] is a mammal
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Pattern  2   &lt;&lt; Is a * a mam(m){a|e}l[eoln]
<br>
Response 2 &gt;&gt; No,  #proc(&quot;What is a &quot;[#star1])
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Patterns priority is controlled and pattern 1 will attempt to match
<br>
before pattern 2 so...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For any known mammal pattern 1 will be satisfied and the response Yes, a
<br>
dog is a mammal will be emitted.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For any other string such as &quot;Is a chair a mammal?&quot; the bot will say
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; and then ask itself the question 
<br>
&quot;What is a chair&quot; which would recurse another level down through the
<br>
pattern matcher with the new question and
<br>
append it's answer onto the &quot;No,&quot; from the first level match so that the
<br>
final response might be &quot;No, a chair is a piece 
<br>
of furniture used to sit on.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Note the [#Token3]], [#star1], and #proc(&quot;What is a &quot;[#star1]) are
<br>
functions used to reformulate thoughts based on information contained in
<br>
the original user input.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Note the mam(m){a|e}l in the pattern allows mammal to be spelled mamel,
<br>
mamal, mammal, or mammel to allow for common misspellings.
<br>
An additional Levenschtein distance calculation is also used if a less
<br>
common misspelling is encountered and the pattern does not match pattern
<br>
1.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is an extremely simple example.  My complete pattern language
<br>
definition can get complex allowing  all the ways of expressing a single
<br>
thought to be encapsulated into a single pattern.    The average pattern
<br>
length allowing for synonyms and variations in sentence structure runs
<br>
about 320 characters.  But some such as the pattern for greetings can
<br>
run 2400 characters in length to accomadate all of the various ways of
<br>
greeting a person.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I hope this gives you a taste of my research and would enjoy hearing
<br>
more about your research and background.  I did not find any
<br>
biographical info on yourself on your website
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Best Regards,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary A. Miller

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I view what I am doing distinct from expert systems because I do not
</em><br>
yet
<br>
<em>&gt; use either a backward or forward inference engine to satisfy a limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of goal states. The knowledge base is not in the form of rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but rather many matched patterns and encoded factoids of knowledge
</em><br>
many
<br>
<em>&gt; of which are transitory in nature and track the context of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation.  Each pattern may trigger a request for additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information like an expert system.  But the bot does not have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular goal state in mind other that learning new information
</em><br>
unless
<br>
<em>&gt; a specific request of it is made by the user.  I also differ from Cyc
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; that realizing the importance of English as a user interface from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning, all internal thoughts and goal states occur as an internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialog in English.  This eliminates the requirement to translate an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal knowledge representation to an external natural language
</em><br>
other
<br>
<em>&gt; than providing one or response patterns to specific input patterns.
</em><br>
It
<br>
<em>&gt; also makes it easy to monitor what the bot is learning and whether it
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; making proper inferences because it's internal thought process is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; displayed in English while in debug mode..  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
that's a really good idea, I bet it has proved very useful...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
do you have a website with a demo of your project?
