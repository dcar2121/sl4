</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am curious what you folks think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I guess I'm a bit odd.  I prefer the Ben1 scenario for myself (no 
<br>
multiplicity at any point), with a few modifications.
<br>
<p>Being human-level would probably be somewhat dangerous eventually, if 
<br>
not immediately or intentionally.  It would be rather unacceptable to me 
<br>
for a superhuman entity to use my body as feedstock for some building 
<br>
project, so what I intend is the design of an artificial intelligence to 
<br>
act as my servant and guardian.  This AI's ethics will be essentially 
<br>
the laws of robotics with humanity replaced by just me.  In addition, it 
<br>
will be encouraged(by its design) to self-improve, using whatever 
<br>
materials available and out of my sight, that doesn't hurt anybody else 
<br>
(it adopts my ethics as well).  It would quickly ascend to far beyond my 
<br>
own intelligence.  I'd ask/tell/order this AI to do whatever my whim 
<br>
desires.  Barring any immediate requests, it would ensure that other 
<br>
superhuman entities are aware of my existence and take care to avoid me. 
<br>
&nbsp;If I am not in immediate danger, it would improve itself and maybe 
<br>
communicate with other intelligences.  I would most likely, in time, 
<br>
replace my neurons with computational equivalents and maybe add 
<br>
facilities in my brain to communicate more effectively with my AI, 
<br>
perhaps even to the extent that my AI's consciousness is controllable 
<br>
like a muscle to me.
<br>
<p>However soon it is before Sol's gravity well becomes crowded to me, I 
<br>
will shoot myself off to another planet (outside of our solar system), 
<br>
which I will terraform and transform into my personal playground.  I 
<br>
will thenceforth live like Tom Bombadil (from Lord of the Rings). 
<br>
&nbsp;Perhaps I will indulge various whims: flight; transforming myself into 
<br>
various animals; constructing (either virtually or in reality) scenarios 
<br>
from history and my imagination which I would either watch or 
<br>
participate in; travelling (see the core of the galaxy, build 
<br>
interferometric telescopes at opposite ends of the galaxy, see what has 
<br>
become of earth in the aeons since I left it, etc); finding or making a 
<br>
wife; sheparding some presentient species towards transhumanity; seeing 
<br>
how quickly I could, with my own two hands (and probably only my hands), 
<br>
recreate all of human technology from Paleolithic to Nuclear Age; or 
<br>
other cool things I haven't thought of yet.
<br>
<p>Rather unambitious, aren't I? ^_^
<br>
<p>(This is my first post to the list, in case you're wondering who I am. 
<br>
&nbsp;My RL name is Steven Fodstad.  Nice to meet you.  I prefer people to 
<br>
call me Flarelocke or its diminutive form, Flare, as I find it rather 
<br>
disconcerting for people I haven't met to call me by name.  Besides, 
<br>
everyone else I know online calls me Flare.  I don't make JOIN posts in 
<br>
general because it just increases the list traffic without adding 
<br>
anything of value.  This community, however, seems too small for the 
<br>
appearance of someone unrecognized to go unnoticed, hence this footnote)
<br>
