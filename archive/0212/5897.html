<p>I agree, the variance between ranked Go players (or chess players, I
<br>
suppose) is probably weakly if at all correlated with IQ.  At that level, I
<br>
suspect, variations in ability are mostly caused by pretty specific
<br>
differences in intuitive/cognitive ability, not by differences in &quot;level of
<br>
general intelligence&quot; or &quot;general analytical or intuitive ability.&quot;
<br>
<p>But there's just *got* to be a strong correlation in the general population
<br>
between IQ and chess or Go ability....  The insinuation that there is not,
<br>
is what I referred to as obvious rubbish.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm a very mediocre chess player yet I have a very high IQ.
<br>
I've not played much chess ever ... but I also don't think I have an
<br>
aptitude for it, because I find it very difficult to get myself to
<br>
concentrate on *any* game.  I suspect that if I forced myself to practice
<br>
chess very very hard, I could become very good at it, but probably not as
<br>
many standard deviations above the mean as my IQ is.  Even now, though, I'm
<br>
pretty sure I could beat most people at chess, based on raw analytical
<br>
ability &amp; intuition (and this is borne out by the handful of times I've
<br>
played strangers socially).
<br>
<p>In terms of brain imaging, I agree with your comments.  There's probably an
<br>
interesting study hiding somewhere behind that stupid article.  But the
<br>
study is probably interesting in terms of where it (and other related
<br>
studies) will eventually lead, rather than because of the isolated
<br>
significance of the negative finding of activity in a certain brain area
<br>
during hcess or Go playing.
