<p>I am pretty good at chess.  I took to it from the moment I first 
<br>
encountered it  at age 11.  But Go is another story entirely.  I 
<br>
have never succeeded in getting &quot;the feel&quot; of the game.  I find 
<br>
the two games quite different in the type of mindset required to 
<br>
successfully master them.  So I think a direct question of which 
<br>
game requires more intelligence or is more difficult or whether 
<br>
they are equivalent is ill formed.
<br>
<p>There are also different ways of playing even within a single 
<br>
game.  Once in my life I played chess in a way that was almost 
<br>
completely different from my normal chess playing mode.  It is 
<br>
difficult to describe.  I saw/felt/intuited the possibilities 
<br>
from any position.  It was more like choreography than playing 
<br>
chess. I saw instantaneously how groups of pieces and moves 
<br>
would play against groups of response moves and pieces without 
<br>
the usual labor involved.  It was quite strange and wonderful. 
<br>
In this mode I beat a state champion three games in a row, each 
<br>
time  in less than 40 moves.  I am usually not *that* good to 
<br>
say the least.
