On Dec 15th 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The rule is, that &quot;it is almost always bad to lose a queen&quot;. On the
</em><br>
other 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hand, a lot of calculation will prove you, that checkmate is more
</em><br>
probable, if 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you've already lost your queen.
</em><br>
<p>While it is true that chess programs and players who have formalized
<br>
these rules as heuristics in their determination of the next best move,
<br>
play better than programs or players who do 100% brute force look-aheads
<br>
that is not where the complexity lies.  All is not really that cut and
<br>
dry!
<br>
<p>The complexity lies in the heuristic discovery and the application of
<br>
multiple conflicting heuristics in order to determine the best move.
<br>
<p>For instance if we followed the rule blindly to preserve our queen and
<br>
not let her be taken.  We would miss a some opportunities for checkmate
<br>
on the next move by sacrificing the queen.  Also many times it is
<br>
advantageous to trade queens in order to have a better position on the
<br>
board.
<br>
<p>It would be correct to say that the better the heuristics the better a
<br>
chess program will play.
<br>
<p>But even though computers are now capable of memorizing all chess
<br>
opening and endgames, and doing far more lookaheads than their human
<br>
counterparts, human grandmasters are still much better in discovering
<br>
and knowing when to apply what heuristics.  They are so good in fact
<br>
that when chess masters work with programmers to improve a program's
<br>
heuristics, the chess masters in many cases can not say why a move is
<br>
better or what heuristic they are using to know it is better.
<br>
<p>Although Samuel's Checkers program and Tsauro's Backgammon program were
<br>
able to learn to play optimal games by experience.  I have not read of a
<br>
chess program that was capable of truly learning the game and being any
<br>
good at it in this same manner.
