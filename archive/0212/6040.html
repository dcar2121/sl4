<p>
One hundred and fifty million kilometers away, a stable thing lights the 
<br>
darkness.  It is an accident, this stable thing; a chance coalescence of a 
<br>
cloud of interstellar dust.  It is an accident billions of years old, 
<br>
persisting to this day.  Even in an accidental universe, some accidental 
<br>
forms survive long enough, or happen frequently enough, to be seen: 
<br>
burning stars, falling raindrops.
<br>
<p>One hundred and fifty million kilometers away, a self-sustaining fusion 
<br>
reaction burns.  Hydrogen becomes helium; two nuclei become one nucleus, 
<br>
as the star's heat and pressure imparts the two nuclei with enough energy 
<br>
to pass over the lip of a potential energy surface and fall into the 
<br>
central well.  Like two planets accelerating toward each other under the 
<br>
influence of gravity, and colliding, converting gravitational potential 
<br>
energy into kinetic energy, and eventually heat; so the two nuclei, once 
<br>
over the lip, are attracted to each other by the strong nuclear force. 
<br>
Potential energy becomes kinetic energy, and then heat.  And eventually, 
<br>
as the heat works its way outward from the star's core, electrons rise and 
<br>
fall in their orbitals and photons are emitted from the star's surface, 
<br>
into space.
<br>
<p>Photons cross one hundred and fifty million kilometers of distance, to 
<br>
warm one side of the Earth; on the other side, heat radiates away into the 
<br>
background cold of the cosmos.  One hundred quadrillion seconds ago, these 
<br>
photons fell on a chance mixture of chemicals, a primordial soup where 
<br>
molecules randomly wandered in and out of stable attractors.  It was the 
<br>
sun, ultimately, that powered this wandering.  A solar photon carries 
<br>
energy that originates in protons and neutrons crossing the potential 
<br>
energy surface of the nuclear strong force.  In the day, solar photons 
<br>
raised the temperature of the primordial soup, and provided chemicals 
<br>
within it the energy needed to cross the weaker electromagnetic barriers 
<br>
that separate one molecular configuration from another.  In the night, 
<br>
heat radiated into the cold, preventing the primordial soup from growing 
<br>
steadily hotter until no molecular bonds could form.
<br>
<p>One hundred quadrillion seconds ago, the process of evolution began, with 
<br>
the accidental rise of a complex molecule that could construct copies of 
<br>
itself from the other stable molecules in its vicinity.  But evolution 
<br>
requires, not just replication, but mutation.  When the second 
<br>
self-replicating molecule came into existence, and the third, and the 
<br>
fourth, it was the continuing breakup of molecules by the Sun that ensured 
<br>
the presence of raw materials for these fitter molecules to construct new 
<br>
copies of themselves.  It was the light of day that broke up the molecules 
<br>
of the past generation and ensured that new replicators did not run out of 
<br>
raw material to replicate themselves.  It was the work done by the Sun 
<br>
that allowed evolution to produce order from chaos within the 
<br>
thermodynamic system that is Earth.
<br>
<p>As, later, it would be the sunlight of day that allowed plants to break 
<br>
down the dead bodies of evolution's debris into the simpler molecules that 
<br>
would be turned into the phenotypes of the next generation.  As, later, it 
<br>
would be the cool of night that allowed the entropy produced by 
<br>
evolution's computations to radiate into space.
<br>
<p>Today our planet completes another orbit around its original source of 
<br>
order, according to an arbitrary social boundary, rounded to the nearest 
<br>
planetary rotation.  A year is a useful time period for humans to reflect 
<br>
on; not too short, not too long.  The boundary must fall somewhere.  It 
<br>
falls today.
<br>
<p>On that boundary day, in addition to the tradition of reviewing the past 
<br>
year, we created the symmetrical tradition of reviewing the year to come; 
<br>
looking forward to the future to state predictions or goals.
<br>
<p>The Earth rotates on its planetary axis, and the succession of heat and 
<br>
cold, light and dark, slowly drives the ratchet of evolution.  Each 
<br>
succeeding generation is a little more interesting than the last.
<br>
<p>Like a wheel, the Earth is going somewhere as it rotates on its axis; like 
<br>
a wheel, the cycle of life and birth moves forward as it repeats.
<br>
<p>Nature's morality is not our own.  &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; is a 
<br>
misleading name for a war in which even the winners die.  Evolution is a 
<br>
poor design method, an incremental accumulation of fortunate accidents. 
<br>
If evolution moves in the direction of greater complexity, then that is 
<br>
only direction, and not purpose.  As the price of our existence, evolution 
<br>
has charged a toll measured in the death of billions of sentients and 
<br>
countless quadrillions of nonsentients.  The cycle that repeats with each 
<br>
birth and death is a cycle of war.
<br>
<p>But evolution's endless war is a cycle that moves forward as it turns. 
<br>
Not a traveling vehicle steered by an operator, only a log rolling down a 
<br>
fitness landscape.  Direction, but not purpose; a destination, but not a 
<br>
target; nonetheless, the cycle is heading somewhere as it turns.
<br>
<p>It's heading for the end of the war.
<br>
<p>One way or the other, it's heading for the end of the war.
<br>
<p>The orbit of the Earth around the Sun, its source of order, also 
<br>
determines a cycle, the cycle of the seasons.  From the perspective of 
<br>
biology, the seasons are the cycle that turns to drive the evolution of 
<br>
the shorter-lived forms of plant life.
<br>
<p>But from our perspective, a year is the cycle that turns to drive an 
<br>
individual human lifespan.
<br>
<p>Here is the place where we mark the end of one cycle and the beginning of 
<br>
another.  It's an arbitrary placemark, but it's a communal placemark.  A 
<br>
time set aside by tradition to ask each other, and more importantly, 
<br>
ourselves:  &quot;The wheel has turned; did it move forward?&quot;  One day, within 
<br>
the year, set aside as a reminder of the cycle; like one second, within a 
<br>
day, set aside for your alarm clock to ring in the morning.
<br>
<p>Evolution has direction, but no purpose.  Purpose is the privilege of 
<br>
intelligence alone.  Are you taking advantage of it?
<br>
<p>What was the direction of last year's cycle?
<br>
What purpose do you have in store for this one?
<br>
<p>What will you do with the gift of 2003?
<br>
