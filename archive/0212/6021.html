Ben,
<br>
<p>I agree with your comment that a non-AGI program could probably figure
<br>
out the earlier games using GA or brute-force methods.  However an AGI
<br>
with cognitive abilities based solely on these techniques will quickly
<br>
'run out of steam'.  The early lessons are designed for the learning
<br>
benefit of the non-brute-force processes - processes that can *create*
<br>
new methods of reaching correct answers, and then apply those methods in
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>I imagine an AGI is going to have a variety of ways of reaching correct
<br>
answers.  Some will be 'canned' methods like sequential-search,
<br>
random-walk, heuristic-lookup and so on.  Others will be 'learned'
<br>
methods that are created on-the-fly and found to be useful.  These
<br>
'learned' methods will be few (or even non-existant) at the start of
<br>
teaching, and will require much more processing than brute-force
<br>
techniques for the first games.  But as the lessons and microdomains
<br>
become more complex, the 'learned' methods should come into thier own.
<br>
Such methods might come up with correct answers all by themselves, or
<br>
narrow the search-space for brute-forcing.  I am sure there are many
<br>
ways it could be programmed to work... haven't done it yet though ;&gt;
<br>
<p>IRT:
<br>
<em>&gt; Where things get a bit more interesting is with your idea of games to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teach conditionals, loops and so forth.
</em><br>
<p>That particular lesson &quot;Lesson 16 -  Algorithmic Fundamentals&quot; is too
<br>
large right now.  It should be split up into two or three separate
<br>
lessons, each with a number of games.  However, the incremental step
<br>
from the previous games to the games in lesson 16 is not great.  With
<br>
each step I have attempted to make the correct answer 'findable' by a
<br>
combination of
<br>
<p>a) applying lessons learned in previous games and
<br>
b) a bit of semi-random guessing.
<br>
<p>I do think this is still true of all the games in lesson 16, but it is
<br>
currently not obvious to the reader -- *that* I can correct by adding
<br>
more detailed explanations... not only of what is to be learned, but why
<br>
it should be 'easy' to learn it.
<br>
<p>IRT: &quot;...basal arithmetic...&quot;  Yes, that one was already on my list of
<br>
games :) but it would *have* to come *after* the learning of symbols
<br>
(lesson 16).  I decided to cut out a *lot* of possible games by
<br>
introducing a new microdomain right after lesson 16.  My reason for this
<br>
was to expand the learning space in a new direction, a new dimension.
<br>
Too much learning within a single microdomain would lead to very narrow
<br>
understanding.  Beyond a certain point there are diminishing returns
<br>
within a given microdomain.
<br>
<p>There is a lot more work to do with the doc, and even more fun afterward
<br>
creating an automated teacher and all the game data.
<br>
