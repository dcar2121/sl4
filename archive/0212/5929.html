<p>A while ago Eli asked people to state the obvious.  Here's me doing it.
<br>
<p>The belief that an SI will treat humans like humans treat bugs is an 
<br>
odd one, but is understandable given a certain outlook.  Humans avoid 
<br>
and kill bugs because they present a threat to genetic reproduction.  
<br>
Bugs kill humans either directly or through diseases.  Bugs are also 
<br>
indicators of unsafe conditions (excessive mold or bacteria growth).  
<br>
Humans don't present such a threat to an SI, so we wouldn't be treated 
<br>
like bugs, though we might be treated like pebbles.
<br>
<p>Luddites, however, view themselves differently.  They see themselves as 
<br>
threats to technology.  Luddites think they are the bugs to an SIAI:  
<br>
they are tiny and can't do much, but if the SIAI isn't careful they can 
<br>
kill it.  The difference between an UnFriendly AI and a Friendly AI is 
<br>
that the UnFriendly AI will (most likely) treat humans like dead matter 
<br>
(Luddites only think of themselves as capable of killing an SIAI) while 
<br>
a Friendly AI will see humans as other general intelligences.
