<em>&gt; I strongly believe that during AGI proof-of-concept development, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial that we not only look at what the system accomplishes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *how* it does it - i.e. the design's construct validity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I strongly agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]  I think it is also important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for early systems/tests to both deal with noisy environments and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense data far in excess of what the system can handle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>For the first four semesters in the curriculum I have specified zero
<br>
noise for the teaching interface.  This is pragmatism on my part,
<br>
because progamming an AGI to deal with noisy data is more work.  However
<br>
there is no reason the exact same teaching output couldn't have noise
<br>
introduced, if this was deemed useful.
<br>
<p>In semester 5 (currently very incomplete) the nature of the interface
<br>
would inevitably contain noise.  The video and audio feeds especially
<br>
so.  I have plans to create a number of games to learn about dealing
<br>
with noise in Semester 5.  Throughout the curriculum my purpose is to
<br>
present useful ideas, procedures and information to the AGI so that it
<br>
can expand its areas of competancy.  IMO dealing with noisy environments
<br>
is just one of many areas of competancy, all be it a very important one!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the really difficult issues is designing these development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs without embodying too much of the designer's specific AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory/ architecture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  This difficulty has caused some revision already when I asking
<br>
myself, &quot;How would this game work with a2i2, Novamente, a future Cyc or
<br>
FAI seed?&quot;  I have described the microdomains digitally for simplicity
<br>
of presentation.  Many of them could just as easily be presented
<br>
visually, or auditorily if that is required.
<br>
