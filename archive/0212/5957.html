<p>
I'm not going to write my own thoughts on this subject.  Talking about 
<br>
post-Singularity life tends to devour people's souls and I was always 
<br>
taught that was impolite.  Yes, sometimes I dream.  But I know I'm 
<br>
dreaming.  Some people seem under the impression they're awake.
<br>
<p>What is it that you want?
<br>
<p>What is it that you are trying to accomplish with all these technological 
<br>
tricks and toys?
<br>
<p>Whatever it is you're really wishing for, you can be sure that the kind of 
<br>
gadgetry dreamed up by human science fiction writers - even the very best 
<br>
science fiction writers like Greg Egan - is not the best way to go about 
<br>
it.  We notice our technology because it's clumsy.  Because the technology 
<br>
is so awkward that it is visible, and has visible side effects, and 
<br>
imposes visible constraints on what can be accomplished by it. 
<br>
Nanotechnology and utility fog may be able to build a flying carpet; 
<br>
current technology leaves us with airplanes; an upload just is where they 
<br>
want to be.  To a medieval scholar the only understandable difference 
<br>
between nanotechnology and femtotechnology is that one can turn lead into 
<br>
gold, and the other can't; and there's no distinction at all between 
<br>
femtotechnology and chromotechnology because the medieval scholar doesn't 
<br>
know enough to invent a task that chromotechnology can perform but 
<br>
femtotechnology can't.  Sufficiently advanced technology is *very* 
<br>
distinguishable from magic.  Magic is just as awkward as insufficiently 
<br>
advanced technology.
<br>
<p>And so we have the odd concept of cyborgs.  Of neural links to computer 
<br>
systems.  Of humanoid robot bodies.
<br>
<p>The future will not be science fiction because it will have no buttons to 
<br>
press.
<br>
<p>And faced with that possibility, people tend to panic, and fall back on 
<br>
comforting habits learned from the cozy books of childhood.  It can be 
<br>
dizzying to confront the question &quot;But what, exactly, do you actually 
<br>
want?&quot; once the crutch of wishing for gadgetry is stripped away.
<br>
<p>But let's ask anyway.  Forget about the toys.  What is it that you want?
<br>
<p>Forget about the technology.  What are the patterns in reality that you 
<br>
are trying to alter?
<br>
<p>The pattern of yourself.
<br>
<p>You are not your body.  But you can't see the inside of your mind.  You 
<br>
can't see the kind of improvements that are really worthwhile.  You can't 
<br>
imagine changing yourself, so you imagine changing your body instead.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the first thing that changes will be your ability to understand 
<br>
change, and the changes you want to make.
<br>
<p>The SF plots that have been posted to this thread don't look to me like 
<br>
changes at all, just running in the same place, because they don't alter 
<br>
any of the things I have learned to see as important.  It seems like 
<br>
displacement activities for deeper wishes that are harder to verbalize.
<br>
<p>Has anyone here said &quot;I wish to be happy&quot;, or &quot;I wish that it didn't take 
<br>
so much effort just to exist&quot;, or &quot;I wish I understood reality and my 
<br>
place in it&quot;, in among the dreams of cloning and robot bodies?
<br>
<p>I don't know if what matters is the journey or the destination.  I don't 
<br>
know if the philosophy of the trip is to stop and smell the flowers, or 
<br>
race for the light as fast as possible.  In the first case, I might have 
<br>
some small idea of who I'll be immediately afterward, though I consider it 
<br>
unhealthy to spend too much time thinking about it.  In the second case, I 
<br>
think little or nothing can be said at all.  To spend too much time 
<br>
thinking about slow paths is to forget that you don't know whether the 
<br>
path will be fast or slow.
<br>
<p>People contemplating the slow path lose their objectivity and begin 
<br>
spinning fantasy scenarios in which the entire course of technological 
<br>
progress ends up stretched over a thousand years or whatever.  If humans 
<br>
end up walking down the slow path, and smelling the flowers, it will be 
<br>
because some Friendly AI blazed a trail all the way to the end, just to 
<br>
make sure that there are no dangers that slowly blossoming humans wouldn't 
<br>
see.  No gamma-ray bursts, exploding galaxies, decaying laws of physics, 
<br>
hostile superintelligences, what-have-you.  Even if the greatest amount of 
<br>
fun comes from stopping to smell the flowers, there has to be at least one 
<br>
sentience who sacrifices leisure and burns for the light as fast as 
<br>
possible.  Otherwise we might end up prey for anything that we weren't 
<br>
smart enough to know about.  If we end up doing this the slow way, it'll 
<br>
be because whichever sentience blazed the trail (a Friendly seed AI or its 
<br>
heir, I expect) comes back and says:  &quot;It's safe, and desirable, to stop 
<br>
and smell the flowers.&quot;
<br>
<p>To summarize the parts of this that I consider it polite to talk about:
<br>
<p>1)  We don't know whether it's the journey or the destination;
<br>
2)  Even if it is the journey that counts, and not the destination, I 
<br>
expect at least one sentient mind will blaze a trail for the rest;
<br>
3)  And as a result of that superintelligence being around, anyone making 
<br>
a slow journey will do so without any visible gadgetry, because only 
<br>
clumsy technology is visible.
<br>
<p>So if you're thinking that what you want involves chrome and steel, lasers 
<br>
and shiny buttons to press, neural interfaces, nanotechnology, or whatever 
<br>
great groaning steam engine has a place in your heart, you need to stop 
<br>
writing a science fiction novel with yourself as the main character, and 
<br>
ask yourself who you want to be.
