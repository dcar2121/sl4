<p>Actually, most of what makes something beautiful is panhuman.  Humans 
<br>
like certain compositions of objects.  Also, all humans find normal 
<br>
human babies beautiful.  We also all find puppies cute.  We might learn 
<br>
to have a fear of them, but we'll still think that they're cute.  Both 
<br>
of these are adaptions.  The variation in art is usually cultural, most 
<br>
often due to differences in technique and media.  The underlying nature 
<br>
of what makes something beautiful is still the same.
<br>
<p>It's like the old saying that great works of literature shine through 
<br>
even freshmen translations.
<br>
<p>For ethics, culture only deals with transitive and recent changes.  Its 
<br>
effect on ethics is noticeably different from that of evolved ethics.
