GM&gt; I have always read that sociopaths lack any empathy and therefore feel
<br>
GM&gt; nothing for their victims.
<br>
GM&gt;
<br>
GM&gt; An interesting question then arises: If an entity is not capable of
<br>
GM&gt; feeling empathy (which implies having similar emotions) will
<br>
GM&gt; sociopathic tendencies result or must trauma and abuse to the entity
<br>
GM&gt; occur first to teach it the tendency for sociopathic acts.
<br>
<p>I don't think trauma or abuse is required; at a certain stage of their
<br>
development many children act in ways that in adults would be
<br>
considered sociopathic.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure empathy necessarily implies having _similar_ emotions.
<br>
A sentient being able to imagine itself in another sentient's shoes and
<br>
&quot;feel what they feel&quot; may not be necessary, or even possible, if the
<br>
gap between them is large enough.  Perhaps imagining or modeling
<br>
_that_ they feel something (in some cases, even as simply as
<br>
pleasant/unpleasant) is sufficient.
<br>
<p>What do I mean when I say I empathize with my cat's fear of the vacuum
<br>
cleaner?  Well, I know what fear feels like to me, and I imagine that
<br>
what the cat is feeling is sort-of-similar to what I would feel if a
<br>
huge, loud-roaring weird-looking strange-moving animal suddenly
<br>
invaded my space.
<br>
<p>What about squirrels hopping away from me?  Pigeons?  Fish? Bugs?
<br>
Going down the line, my empathy changes in quality -- I really have a
<br>
harder time imagining a bird's fear truly resembles mine, and on the
<br>
bug level it seems almost algorithmic rather than &quot;anticipating
<br>
imminent pain and getting adrenalized to avoid it&quot;. 
<br>
<p>But I can imagine/model _something_ going on; and even if what I feel
<br>
is on an entirely different level, I've both felt guilty for killing
<br>
bugs on some occasions, and set them free on others.  Except roaches.
<br>
DEATH TO ROACHES!!11!1!  Ahem.
<br>
<p>I don't mean to imply our relationship to bugs will compare to an
<br>
FAI's relationship to us, or anything of the sort.  I'm saying that
<br>
empathy in its classic, full meaning may not be possible, and is
<br>
probably not necessary, to achieve behaviour we would consider
<br>
empathetic.
<br>
<p>James Rogers:
<br>
JR&gt; It isn't a lack of empathy that makes one a true sociopath.  It is a
<br>
JR&gt; lack of empathy in addition to a lack of rationality that makes one a
<br>
JR&gt; sociopath.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure about the &quot;lack of rationality&quot;, that would depend on
<br>
your exact definition.  Although DSM-IV lists &quot;impulsivity/failure to
<br>
plan ahead&quot; as one of the (7, 3 required to qualify) features of
<br>
&quot;Antisocial Personality Disorder&quot;, the type of person you describe
<br>
below would I think be considered a less impulsive, or better
<br>
concealed, sociopath, rather than not being considered one at all.
<br>
Many psychopaths have managed to function for quite a while before
<br>
getting caught.
<br>
<p>JR&gt; I can easily imagine an entity that is devoid of empathy
<br>
JR&gt; being a perfectly functional member of society as long as they are
<br>
JR&gt; rational.  You might not even notice that they lack real empathy
<br>
JR&gt; of any sort.
