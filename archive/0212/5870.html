<em>&gt; The Singularity and, specifically, FAI is a faster, safer way of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I utterly disagree.  We will be amazingly lucky if the current 
<br>
brains are good enough to produce FAI much less to deal with the 
<br>
world in the meantime.  I don't believe we are necessarily smart 
<br>
enough and sane enough now to do the job.  I think quite a bit 
<br>
of improvment may be required.  There is no particular reason 
<br>
why a super-human will simply and only be a super-chimp btw.
<br>
<p>Which brings up another favorite topic.  We all hope to migrate 
<br>
&quot;off-the-meat&quot; or at least beyond our current limitations afaik. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the FAI does the heavy lifting or not I wonder how 
<br>
much consideration most of us give to what can and should be 
<br>
left behind of our evolutionary psycho-sociological baggage. 
<br>
Quite a bit of that stuff is not at all suited for a much 
<br>
different space and especially not suited for much increased 
<br>
powers.  So are we into hacking our psychology and sociology?  I 
<br>
know some of us address this directly, some also indirectly in 
<br>
fiction.  Some are addressing understanding this &quot;baggage&quot; and 
<br>
sorting and discarding from it now.  As we get deeper 
<br>
understanding and ability to manipulate this baggage physically 
<br>
and psychologically I see even less reason to fear super-humanity.
<br>
<p>I also would not like to say to most people that we could make 
<br>
them much smarter, stronger, longer-lived and so on but chose 
<br>
not to because we were afraid of the consequences unless we 
<br>
built a FAI and let it figure it out.  In the meantime humans 
<br>
can grovel in the mud.
