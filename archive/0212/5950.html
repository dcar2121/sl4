<p>
The Fermi Paradox, updated with current thinking, depends on at least 2
<br>
assumptions:
<br>
<p>1.  There are many advanced civilizations in our galaxy with the ability to send
<br>
representative entities across interstellar distances to visit or interact with
<br>
other civilizations.   Fermi's original thinking was based on projections from
<br>
fission physics.  Today, we'd include deuterium fission, mag sails, and
<br>
matter/antimatter drives among the potentially feasible drive/deceleration
<br>
technologies.  The specific drive technology doesn't matter, but it is
<br>
reasonable to assume that it will be feasible for us to accelerate a minimum
<br>
payload mass of several kilograms to near light speed in the not too distant
<br>
future.  Note that in the case of humans, a craft of less than 10,000 kg implies
<br>
that the craft does not carry living humans, (even in suspended animation) but
<br>
instead contains an AI.
<br>
<p>2.  At least some portion of such civilizations have the desire to conduct such
<br>
visits.  Note that this is more than just an ability to visit, it is an actual
<br>
desire to interact with alien species.  Implicit in this assumption, though
<br>
rarely noted, is the assumption that interstellar travelers benefit from their
<br>
travel, or at least don't incur great penalties.
<br>
<p>The paradox is that we *don't* see a sky full of various visitors.
<br>
<p>We can append an even stronger paradox which is that sufficient technology to
<br>
get to the stars would imply mature nanotechnology and the ability to conduct
<br>
engineering schemes on such a large scale as to be perceptible across
<br>
interstellar distances--such as moving several suns into geometric shapes for
<br>
the heck of it.
<br>
<p>Several explanations for this paradox have been proposed on this list and on
<br>
other lists:
<br>
<p>A. There is a &quot;great filter&quot; which dramatically reduces the number of visitors.
<br>
One such filter is that all or nearly all civilizations with sufficiently
<br>
advanced technology destroy themselves--e.g. fusion war, gray goo, green goo,
<br>
and so forth.  Alternately, any civilization that doesn't keep quiet gets
<br>
stomped by nasty civilizations that prey on fledgling intelligences.
<br>
<p>B.  All civilizations that escape destruction develop Super intelligent AI,
<br>
transcend and become incomprehensible to pre-transcend entities.  This is an
<br>
interesting alternative because it implies that visitors could actually be
<br>
already here and we'd know it if we just had sufficient intellect to perceive
<br>
them and interact with them.
<br>
<p><p>I can think of a new explanation that reduces the likelihood of the paradox:
<br>
penalties associated with both the mass constraint and the Einstein time
<br>
dilation caused by near-light-speed travel.
<br>
<p>The essence is that assumption 2 doesn't hold, even if we assume 1 is still
<br>
valid: that the stay-at-homes have such great advantages relative to travelers
<br>
that no (or very few) entity ever wants to travel.   The idea is that entities
<br>
with more computing power have an overwhelming developmental advantage over
<br>
entities with less computing power.  And that the mass and relativistic time
<br>
dilation constraints of near-light-speed space travel drastically reduce the
<br>
relative computing power of the travelers.   Time dilation is a relative
<br>
disadvantage because computation amongst travelers proceeds more slowly than
<br>
amongst stay-at-homes.
<br>
<p>I think the potential reality of such developmental relativism is likely more
<br>
apparent to the readers of this list than to others, and of particular interest
<br>
to this list it potentially opens up a little window into post-singularity
<br>
life.  It implies that development proceeds for a long time after a given
<br>
civilization's singularity.  If post singularity development ever plateaus, then
<br>
you'd expect to see a bloom of star travel, since travelers then wouldn't lose
<br>
too much developmental advantage relative to homebodies.  It also implies that
<br>
post singularity entities &quot;care&quot; a lot that they don't fall behind their peers.
<br>
This could mean that post-singularity entities continue to compete amongst
<br>
themselves, or it could mean that they greatly desire to continue to be able to
<br>
comprehend each other.  Alternately, it could also mean that post-singularity
<br>
entities become one giant entity and the prospect of splitting into
<br>
developmentally divergent entities is abhorent to such an entity.
