<p>
I had an interesting (at least to me) reaction to the
<br>
‘multiple bens’ E-mail.
<br>
<p>I read it with the assumption that when the multiple
<br>
bens keep in touch it is analogous to having someone
<br>
you know very well (a brother for instance) tell you
<br>
in detail about some experience they just had. I know
<br>
that the communication link could be enhanced to be so
<br>
much incredibly more that it approaches (or exceeds)
<br>
first hand experience, but since it wasn’t specified I
<br>
didn’t assume that at first. I assumed that only the
<br>
first ben is a continuation of you.
<br>
<p>Then I thought, how nice for you to create enhanced
<br>
clones that will have interesting experiences. Each
<br>
clone alone gets the full benefits of its experiences.
<br>
The only pleasure you will get is in watching them,
<br>
and in living their good (and bad) times vicariously,
<br>
much like watching your kids grow up. But wait, you
<br>
already have kids and are watching them grow up… 
<br>
<p>Then I thought, since you made the first ben immortal,
<br>
why don’t you just do your same scenario, only
<br>
serially rather than in parallel. By definition
<br>
‘immortal’ means there’s enough time to do it
<br>
serially. Then the first ben gets all the experiences
<br>
first hand. You could try the scenarios for a few
<br>
millennia each as a spot check, then decide which one
<br>
you wanted. I mean what’s the hurry with all the
<br>
parallelism given that you have forever (or at least
<br>
until the universe winds down and by then that problem
<br>
may be solved as well). Also with parallelism there
<br>
will always be a resource problem since each ‘enhanced
<br>
clone’ you make may have similar tendencies to
<br>
replicate 5 or more times, and anyone can see that
<br>
eventually (given immortality) the single proto-ben
<br>
just ate up all the resources (read ‘all the matter in
<br>
the universe’). What about the other 5 billion
<br>
proto-people, what resources do they get?
<br>
<p>One problem I have with the multiple-ben scenario
<br>
seems to be that my human brain views another copy
<br>
(regardless of how identical) as another person,
<br>
another identity. And any experience they get is
<br>
theirs, not mine. The only way I can see this working
<br>
for me is if ,when another copy is created ,the
<br>
original is destroyed or put into indefinite stasis.
<br>
Then I can think of the clone as a continuation of me
<br>
and not someone else who resembles me. You see if
<br>
creating identities similar to yourself is really all
<br>
that fulfilling then Ben basically is already immortal
<br>
if he considers his self to be perpetuated through his
<br>
kids, and then through their kids ... and he should
<br>
already have total fulfillment all queued up through
<br>
his progeny who will eventually do most everything he
<br>
has ever wanted. Why then is he proposing more
<br>
progeny?
<br>
<p>I think what solves this identity problem in my mind
<br>
is the bandwidth of the communication links between
<br>
identities. As the communication gets improved, then
<br>
at some point the experience is basically first hand.
<br>
Of course to fully experience multiple versions of
<br>
myself simultaneously, then ‘I’ would have to have
<br>
increased capability beyond what it would take to make
<br>
my enhanced clone what I originally defined it to be.
<br>
And I am assuming that each self would also want the
<br>
simultaneous experiences of each of the others so all
<br>
selves would need increased capacity. (Not a problem ,
<br>
just an observation.)
<br>
<p>Then I thought, why create all of these other selves,
<br>
why not just create one high capacity self with high
<br>
bandwidth connections to other enhanced people who
<br>
thought of ways to enhance themselves that I have and
<br>
that I haven’t even dreamed of. With enough raw
<br>
processing power I could live all lives. The
<br>
connections would be non-intrusive so it didn’t in any
<br>
way impede on other’s experiences. There is the
<br>
problem that some lives would be crappy, but that
<br>
could be solved with an intelligent filter which only
<br>
passes those experiences on to me that I would like.
<br>
Given many people would choose enhancement and
<br>
immortality, and given how many people there already
<br>
are (5 billion plus), then virtually all of my
<br>
fantasies would be played out (i.e. all 5 bens and
<br>
many many more). 
<br>
<p>Then the train of thought ended where it always ends
<br>
when I think about things like this. All of this is
<br>
just my human brain daydreaming about how to achieve
<br>
one of its basic goals, to get pleasure
<br>
(=fulfillment=whatever you want to call it). I contend
<br>
we are all hedonistic to the extreme. Why don’t I just
<br>
leave everything else the same and change what gives
<br>
me pleasure to be ... nothing, and then I could bliss
<br>
out forever over nothing at all and save a lot of
<br>
effort. And yes I am aware of previous discussions on
<br>
this. But wait you say, how unfulfilling, ‘I’ could
<br>
NEVER be happy with such a shallow existence. But
<br>
remember only your human brain sees it as shallow
<br>
(read as ‘non-pleasurable’) and only because it is
<br>
evolved not to take that ‘shallowest’ route, or else
<br>
you wouldn’t be here. All of the too-shallow people
<br>
didn’t survive (must... resist ...temptation ...to
<br>
diverge here). I contend that you were evolved to look
<br>
for more than that. Looking for more than that gives
<br>
you more pleasure than taking only short term pleasure
<br>
and hence all the hoohaa about beauty and esthetics
<br>
and ‘making progress’ and 'enjoying challenges' and
<br>
the 'desire to be moral' and blah blah blah is
<br>
evolutions ploy, which is what guaranteed your
<br>
existence today. Everything that you do is because you
<br>
believe it will give you pleasure (even sacrifice and
<br>
working hard is rewarded by pleasurable feelings that
<br>
it is the ‘right’ thing to do in the long term). And
<br>
yes there is a shortcut. Probably just flipping a
<br>
single bit somewhere shuts down all that desire to
<br>
accomplish all these grand scenarios and makes you
<br>
ecstatic to forego them. Eternal ecstasy. I think
<br>
people who don’t see this are missing something very
<br>
fundamental. This is to be expected since evolution
<br>
would have guaranteed that it was hard to see and
<br>
accept. Now if I could just find that bit...
<br>
<p>The only true goal of the singularity is to find that
<br>
bit for everyone, flip it, and then guarantee their
<br>
ssurvival forever.
