</em><br>
<p>Stephen Pinker does a good job of analyzing human altruistic
<br>
values in How the Mind Works. Humans evolved as social animals
<br>
and thus have some respect for social pressure (those who don't
<br>
often end up in prison). Of course, individuals often exploit
<br>
social pressure to further their own selfish values. So I guess
<br>
the source of social pressure is a mixture of evolution and
<br>
individual actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; the solution is to make alteration of reinforcement learning values a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessary condition for granting a human super-intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I don't see this flying.  I certainly wouldn't accept it.  Maybe I will when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get to 'almost-super' intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>I think regulation of the values of super-intelligent brains,
<br>
whether artificial or human, will be a subject of political
<br>
debate. Wealthy institutions and individuals will have obvious
<br>
motives for creating super-intelligent brains with values other
<br>
than universal human happiness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given that the combination of super-intelligence and human values is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Do you think right now, with an unaltered learning system, the average person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the _capacity_ to handle super-intelligence without being destructive?  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not asking if you think it's likely or not, just if the average person were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised in the perfect environment, perfect parents, perfect culture, perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools, etc etc, could they handle super intelligence?  And would a super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent society be able to create that perfect cultural environment?  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, would it all be self stabilizing?  Or do you think the brain has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental, insurmountable, physical flaws as it stands now?  I'm not saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements wouldn't help, I'm just objecting to the prospect of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardwired CONSTRAINTS on how and what we think.
</em><br>
<p>Even the most altruistic mind cannot escape being destructive to
<br>
someone's interests, in this world full of conflicting interests.
<br>
But the rest of us are toast in a world inhabited by super-
<br>
intelligent brains acting against our interests. The constraints
<br>
on the reinforcement learning values of super-intelligent brains
<br>
are like many other laws: a social contract to protect people (and
<br>
animals) from the actions of other people. I feel that I have
<br>
the capacity to safely drive 50 mph on city streets, but respect
<br>
the need for speeding laws to protect me from all the other nuts
<br>
on the road.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
