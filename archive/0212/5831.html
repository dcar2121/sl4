</em><br>
<p>This is all part of how the brain works.  You won't notice it until you 
<br>
are watching it and something funny happens.  When I look at a picture, 
<br>
I can judge the quality of the composition in a second or less.  That's 
<br>
all the longer it takes.  I will immediately get an #ugly or #pretty 
<br>
from my brain.  You don't have to actively reason; your brain will do 
<br>
it for you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Also, if you really truly do not have anything in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brain saying that puppies or babies are cute, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your brain may be broken in that respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One being's break may be another beings advantage.
</em><br>
<p>All being said, it's broken from a normative human standpoint.  Also, 
<br>
be careful in judging when your brain is broken.  Often it's just you 
<br>
lying to yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As far as your brain is concerned, it's anything that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like to sense and might seek out to sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I agree with that:  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that's not really what I meant.  Literally, yes, beauty is 
<br>
what your brain says is beautiful, but there is still common ground in 
<br>
beauty panhumanisticly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, not many people will refuse members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their kin group food (note that there is some cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; influence as to how large you actively consider your kin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; group, but it's usually several levels out, even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; America).  Also, there are ethics concerning how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sharing you'll permit, even with kin groups.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; degree of support hinges on the degree of relatedness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If a person is related too little, you might even refuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have heard this argument before, and have observed that it closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponds to how humans behave *generally speaking*.  However, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour may change for individuals who understand EP and take it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart.  Such a person might say to themselves: &quot;I am genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to decide this way... but is it in my best interest?  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it still make sense?&quot;  Sometimes I ask these questions to myself, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find that the answer is: No - not in my best interest, and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sense.  Does that mean my mind is broken?  I think not.  Newly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'patched' perhaps. ;)
</em><br>
<p>Some parts of your brain don't hold up well to tampering of any form, 
<br>
depending on the particulars of your goal system (EP will not have the 
<br>
same effect on everyone that it has had on you).  Some parts of your 
<br>
brain are neigh impossible to tamper with, though, so don't get 
<br>
disappointed if your stuck with some bit of irrationality when all is 
<br>
said and done before the Singularity.
