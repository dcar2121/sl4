<p>GW&gt; I don't know about you, but if this is a simulation, it sucks and I
<br>
GW&gt; want out.  It's not Friendly to let someone suffer when they don't have 
<br>
GW&gt; to and have asked for the suffering to stop.  I think, in this case, 
<br>
GW&gt; it's more likely that our theory of Friendliness is correct than that 
<br>
GW&gt; we are seeing `unfriendly' Friendliness.
<br>
<p>There are a number of hidden assumptions underlying your reasoning
<br>
above, among them:
<br>
- You don't have to suffer, i.e. suffering is unnecessary.  Perhaps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the suffering we are going through is a necessary part of some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;process, which our current POV cannot see.
<br>
- You have asked for the suffering to stop.  Perhaps this needs to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be asked in the proper way, with the proper tools and preparation,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the proper degree of sincerity.  (I won't get into the relevant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;occult and mystical practices here, but some techniques may or may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not resemble &quot;asking to be let out&quot; or &quot;asking for the suffering to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stop&quot;.)
<br>
- That any simulation would necessarily be monitored (probably,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by implication, by its creator).  Perhaps we are the manifestations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a single higher mind in a simulation of its own devising that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;will &quot;end&quot; when we reunite, possibly through the Singularity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(certain mystical speculations could be read this way); perhaps it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is only you in a simulation of your own devising or that of someone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;else (us humans of 2040 having devised direct brain interface gear and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an amnesia drug, say; or us Pleiadaians having done something
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;similar, the better to understand these peculiar Gaians).  There are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other possibilities.
<br>
<p>In short, I think you're limiting the idea of simulation to a specific
<br>
kind of simulation we might create, run by certain rules we might
<br>
choose.
<br>
<p>GW&gt; I understand the Prime Directive and I say that Captain Kirk could have
<br>
GW&gt; helped a lot more people if he had dropped a few replicators on 
<br>
GW&gt; 20th-Century-Earth-looking planets than if he had just ignored them.  
<br>
GW&gt; I'm aware that it's possible to do more harm than good, but 
<br>
GW&gt; anthropologists have come a long way in helping the people they study 
<br>
GW&gt; come towards the modern world.  I think that deciding the best course 
<br>
GW&gt; of action to help an underdeveloped civilization would be an easy task 
<br>
GW&gt; for an SI.
<br>
<p>I've never watched much Trek, so I can't speak to Kirk's actions or
<br>
lack thereof, but the Prime Directive as written doesn't say one can't
<br>
interfere at all.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the right of each sentient species to live in accordance with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;its normal cultural evolution is considered sacred, no Starfleet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel may interfere with the healthy development of alien
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;life and culture. Such interference includes the introduction of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a world who society
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is incapable of handling such advantages wisely. [...]
<br>
<p>There are hypotheses one could sketch under which interference might
<br>
take/have taken place on Earth; a lot depends on the understanding of
<br>
&quot;healthy development&quot;.  One could even speculate that such
<br>
interference does or has taken place, albeit surreptitiously.
<br>
Insufficient data.
