<p>
Eliezer suggests in CFAI that a Friendly AI may decide to divide the solar
<br>
system into six billion equal parts and give each person property rights
<br>
over a six-billionth share.
<br>
<p>Why equal shares, instead of shares proportional to current net worth in
<br>
US dollars, contribution to the development of the Singularity,
<br>
popularity, or some other measure of moral worth? Clearly the overriding
<br>
principle being applied here is moral symmetry. But Eliezer goes on to say
<br>
that each new person born after the Singularity would only be guaranteed a
<br>
Minimum Living Space, which presumably is much smaller than a
<br>
six-billionth share of the solar system. So there's an obvious asymmetry 
<br>
across time.
<br>
<p>An even greater asymmetry is that only existing individuals get a share. 
<br>
Potential individuals, people who may have been born but were not due to 
<br>
historical accidents, are completely dispossessed. If an SI really cared 
<br>
about moral symmetry, should it not be symmetrical across the entire 
<br>
configuration space of possible intelligences? I imagine it would sample 
<br>
this space according to a uniform distribution, instantiate the 
<br>
randomly selected individuals, and give each one an equal share of the 
<br>
universe. No one would be allowed to reproduce in any other way.
<br>
<p>A remaining question is, assuming the colonizable universe is limited in
<br>
computational resources, how many individuals should be instantiated? Or
<br>
equivalently, how much of the universe should each person be given? The
<br>
principle of moral symmetry does not seem to provide definite guidance
<br>
here. One possibility is that each individual would be instantiated just
<br>
long enough for it to have one conscious experience. This would minimize
<br>
the inequality between the lucky ones who are chosen and the unlucky ones
<br>
who are not.
<br>
<p>More seriously, the Friendly AI would have to divide up the universe
<br>
somehow. I really don't see a method to do it that does not seem arbitrary
<br>
or absurd in some way. It would be a treat just to see what it actually
<br>
decides upon, and why.
