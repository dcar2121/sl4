I don't think that Eliezer is in C4 personally.  It seems to me like he
<br>
experiences basically the same states of consciousness as the rest of us
<br>
creative geek visionaries....  Although of course everyone has their own
<br>
flavors of the states of consciousness, and we visit them with somewhat
<br>
different frequencies....
<br>
<p>Sorry if my reply seemed to belabor the obvious !!  I can get overly
<br>
didactic sometimes, I guess...
<br>
<p>Regarding &quot;we never create, we're simply allowed to experience something
<br>
that is always present&quot; -- to me this comes down to the definition of &quot;I&quot;
<br>
(the &quot;we&quot; in your sentence).  Remember Nietzsche's statement that
<br>
consciousness is like a commander who takes responsibility for the actions
<br>
of his troops....  In a sense &quot;we&quot; never do anything; it is just done and
<br>
then &quot;we&quot; (the conscious &quot;I&quot;) take credit for it....  And the unconscious
<br>
forces that &quot;cause&quot; our actions are rarely isolated brain processes, they
<br>
are generally tied in with broader physical, cultural, social patterns ...
<br>
something outside ourselves.  So I'm not sure how different creative
<br>
activity is from *everything else*, in terms of the role of self and the
<br>
role of interior vs. exterior causality....  It is clear that in what you
<br>
call C4 one is atypically *aware* of the lack of &quot;causal actor&quot; status for
<br>
the conscious &quot;I&quot;, though...

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: C4
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not ask if Eli was enlightened but whether he was in C4 permanently.
<br>
What in my words, made you think I did not understand that there are several
<br>
states of consciousness ??? *smile* I'm not really interested in the whole
<br>
LSD thing, I was just drawing a parallel. Same for enlightenment, just a
<br>
parallel. You missed my point: we never create, we're simply allowed to
<br>
experience something that is always present. I believe that without that
<br>
'whatever' that is shared with us, we'd never create anything. We're way too
<br>
arrogant thinking that it's coming from us. I'm not a religious guy, I just
<br>
feel that any act of creation, love or whatever you wish to call it, does
<br>
not come from us, never did and never will. It's like a river, and sometimes
<br>
it flows through some of us. It's very hard form me to formalise it without
<br>
sounding like some Born Again Christian or some similar stuff....
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arona,
