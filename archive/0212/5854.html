</em><br>
<p><p>I know these people; you are simply incorrect.  Most of the people who
<br>
acquire vast wealth (at least in the US) do so primarily as a
<br>
CONSEQUENCE of their love of building things and creating value in the
<br>
world.  Society values people who create and build, and therefore making
<br>
a ton of money is a foregone conclusion if you are good at this whether
<br>
that is your intention or not.
<br>
<p>This is also why you see billionaires working long hours.  It isn't so
<br>
that they can make their next billion, it is because they enjoy the
<br>
process of building things; the money is a secondary issue. For many,
<br>
money serves only as a metric of the quality of their creation.
<br>
<p>You have to understand the psychology:  When people give them money for
<br>
whatever business they are in, they see it as those people showing
<br>
appreciation for the quality of their work.  In their minds, they are
<br>
artists.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps it is the recognition and fear of one's eventual mortality today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that encourages the very rich to share the wealth through philanthropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to invest in their afterlife so to speak.  Once a person has reached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this level of success and power, I would defy anyone to reeducate them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the fact that giving a large portion of their money away is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal way to further their own self-interests especially if their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-spans were hugely extended.
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, this all follows from invalid assumptions.  They use the money
<br>
they earn from one business to build another in hopes that society will
<br>
appreciate that work of art as well.  They don't give their money away
<br>
until they have decided they have nothing left to offer society doing
<br>
what they do best. And many of these people work until the day they die,
<br>
hence why they don't just starting throwing money at philanthropic
<br>
pursuits. 
<br>
<p>And they do invest heavily in life enhancing technologies, they are just
<br>
smarter about it.  Why do you think so many of the wealthiest people in
<br>
the US are heavily invested in very speculative bio-tech?  Regardless,
<br>
investing heavily in bio-tech research stands to deliver far more value
<br>
to themselves and society at large than giving their money away to
<br>
social causes, PARTICULARLY as it applies to their own longevity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We live in a day again where the middle class is being eroded from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top and bottom. The rich do get richer and the poor are becoming more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numerous.  I have a tremendous respect for people like Bill Gates who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are spending large amounts of their money in this life to improve living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions in so many parts of the world.  I would pray to see this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become the norm instead of the exception.  But unfortunately too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billionaires still operate under the philosophy that &quot;whoever dies with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most toys (or billions) wins the game&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Tripe.  You know nothing about the psychology and motivations of
<br>
business people.
<br>
<p>If you want them to listen to you, you have to show them how they can
<br>
maximize their value to society by listening to you.  They are already
<br>
very good at it, so you need to have a better answer than donating their
<br>
money to nebulous social causes.  They aren't idiots; they can see how
<br>
precious little value is actually generated from most philanthropic and
<br>
charitable causes.  Most have the confidence in their ability to
<br>
generate value (and the track record I might add) that they would rather
<br>
maximize value the way they know best rather than handing the reins to a
<br>
bleeding heart with good intentions and no clue.
<br>
<p>What do you actually care about, pursuing a faddish social cause or
<br>
maximizing the value that these people generate for all mankind?  And
<br>
are you honest enough to see the difference?  If we all had the sense of
<br>
value creation that most of these people have, we would all live in a
<br>
wealthier and happier society.
