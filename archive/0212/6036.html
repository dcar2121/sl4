<em>&gt; Going to four levels of learning doesn't make any sense, anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, let's subtract 1 from all of those levels; it's a bit easier to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep track of them then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At level 0 there is no learning involved, per se.  The mind is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being force fed facts:  they magically appear in its memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At level 1 there is normally learning involved that we are all familiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with.  It's the kind that goes on between children and parents, goes on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while reading, and goes on in schools (or at least is supposed to).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Level 2 is more interesting.  This is where you learn techniques like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associating memories with each other to strengthen your ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember them and that practice helps you get better at complex tasks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like algebra and calculus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Level 3 is flat out exciting.  Now you can learn to learn better.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't understand the theory of Friendly AI, all you have to do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprogram yourself to be able to learn it.  It goes further than that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though.  At this level you already get the ability to reprogram
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself to reprogram yourself better.  You're working at that level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already, so it's no problem to just jump over and rewrite the running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code (assuming the system supports it, but in the general case it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already available).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a level 4 exists, this would be extending to ontotechnology but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be debatable to continue to think of this in terms of levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning.  That would certainly still be an applicable domain, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things were already starting to open up at level 3 and the seams are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; busted wide open at level 4.
</em><br>
<p>Bateson reckons that level 3 learning occurs in humans only very slowly,
<br>
i.e. over years via complex forms of &quot;cognitive maturation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Basically, your comments are strongly in accordance with Bateson's
<br>
reflections on the topic, which is not surprising...
