<p>Michael:
<br>
If we limit ourselves to the domain you specified, namely what &quot;we currently
<br>
consider to be the material manifestation&quot; then you are correct. But why
<br>
limit ourselves to that? Why not plunge into the depths of reality, seeking
<br>
the foundation of it all?
<br>
<p>Matter must still exist at the lowest level of implementation. It is
<br>
irrelevant whether we, as observers, are in a simulation that resides
<br>
immediately above that material level, or whether we live in a sim embedded
<br>
in another sim embedded within still another sim, unto as many iterations as
<br>
one cares to go. It is simply not possible for there to be sims all the way
<br>
down. At the lowest level, the bedrock of reality is material.
<br>
<p>That is my claim. Why do I make it? Because it seems reasonable to me and
<br>
because it comports with our everyday experience. If that experience is in
<br>
fact merely experience within a simulation, then our sim is fortuitously (or
<br>
designedly) emulating the reality that lies however many levels below us.
<br>
<p>Can I prove this claim? No. I cannot prove this claim any more than I can
<br>
prove that other minds exist. I am not a solipsist even though disproving
<br>
solipsism is not logically possible.
<br>
<p>So I take this leap of faith. Why do I take it? Because I find that seeking
<br>
answers within a materialist model has proven to be more scientifically and
<br>
technologically fruitful than any other approach. This does not mean that
<br>
one cannot make great progress in mathematics, logic, philosophy and the
<br>
arts by taking an idealist approach. Clearly, many have done so by that
<br>
route. But when it comes to designing experiments that tease out the
<br>
responses of nature, or to designing machines that improve our ability to
<br>
predict and control reality, the materialist approach is without peer.
<br>
<p>Basically then, I argue for materialism for pragmatic reasons.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Michael LaTorra
