</em><br>
<p>I was not speaking of children and I don't think a metaphor of 
<br>
human adults as children relative to a FAI is at all 
<br>
appropriate.  A FAI worth its salt will know that Friendliness 
<br>
relative to humans requires persuasion in non-coercive human 
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To what extent will / should an entity far more intelligent than us

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that infantilizing adult humans can be 
<br>
considered Friendly.  However, absolutely restricting the 
<br>
ability to physically coerce another human is not making all 
<br>
humans children.  It is merely perfectly (ok, as much as 
<br>
possible) implementing a global rule against the initiation of 
<br>
force.
<br>
<p>Desires as such have very little to do with friendliness or 
<br>
freedom.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ======
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A tangentially related issue:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; Not to mention that the above is massively boring.  You would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; have to remove part of human intelligence to have many people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; &quot;happy&quot; with simply continuous pleasure.  Pleasure is also quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; relative for us.  Too much of a &quot;good thing&quot; results in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; devaluation of that pleasure and even eventual repugnance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if you could devise an &quot;optimal path&quot; -- the best rythm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternating ups and downs, challenges and rewards -- is that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a superintelligence should guide us along, or would that be _less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimally rewarding_ because we hadn't chosen that path completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently?  
</em><br>
<p>What if we stop thinking up rather low grade &quot;solutions&quot; and 
<br>
think about higher level ones and how those may be made most 
<br>
likely?  Human actualization is not about getting the most 
<br>
pleasure jollies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This boils down to the same ethical issues, in a sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed earlier in this thread re: uploading / changing somebody so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want to upload / giving somebody full, convincing memories of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole life experience they went through that ended up with them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanting to upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Such would be coercion and coercion of the very brain/mind to 
<br>
boot.  It would be strictly unethical.  No free being would ever 
<br>
trust a system that would allow itself such a path.  It is too 
<br>
easy in such a system to end up as a drone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not trying to make a point here, these are honest questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You don't seem to be particularly headed toward resolution 
<br>
though.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;To take a different stab at this than ethics, one can judge answers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;What is the Meaning of Life?&quot; esthetically.  E.g., &quot;it's all just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;random coincidence&quot; is ugly and nihilistic; &quot;it's so that God could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;judge you and reward/punish you for Eternity&quot; seems trite and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;simplistic; &quot;to become more and more aware of everything around you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;to get to know things Deeply, until even the most ugly thing to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;becomes beautiful and the most hated thing loved&quot; seems a step up from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;that.  Although still trite when put in those terms...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; Ethics is generally considered more philosophically fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; than aesthetics.  So using the latter to formulate and justify 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; the former is not very workable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except maybe to point out that the notion of &quot;objective ethics&quot; is at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least as difficult as the notion of &quot;objective aesthetics&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>That is not a meaningful observation in this context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Somehow we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to reconcile the notion that &quot;it's all subjective&quot; with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that it's not _all_ _just_ subjective, that some things _are_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dammit, better/more artful than others.  
</em><br>
<p>It is impossible to reconcile opposites.  It is not all just 
<br>
subjective so why should I reconcile what is to that spurious idea?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To tie this in with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier statement, perhaps the ethical as well as the aesthetical is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that which increases your intelligence and / or the opportunities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actualizing its potential...words such as &quot;uplifting&quot; are often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied in such contexts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a shorter statement would be that the Good is that which 
<br>
actualizes the life/existence of the sentient beings involved. 
<br>
The &quot;Good&quot; applies both to judging/providing a partial basis for 
<br>
Ethics and Aesthetics.
