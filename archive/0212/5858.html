<em>&gt; &quot;Bill Gates may not be all that altruistic. Perhaps he is trying to

<em>&gt; I can appreciate your cynicism in this day and age.  But since it's

</em><br>
<p>Yeah... it is off-topic, actually.  I've seen debates over Bill Gates, pro 
<br>
and con, before - there's one going on right now on the Extropians list 
<br>
under the heading &quot;fruits of Bill Gates labor worth $50 billion&quot;, if you 
<br>
want to join in.  In my observation, off-topic threads can rapidly take 
<br>
over a mailing list - there seem to be certain high-entropy threads, such 
<br>
as capitalism vs. socialism, Mac vs. Linux vs. Windows, whether an 
<br>
uploaded brain scan is &quot;really you&quot;, et cetera, which seem to represent 
<br>
the default condition of a mailing list, and into which any mailing list 
<br>
&quot;wants&quot; to slide unless energy is continually expended to prevent that. 
<br>
So this thread really *is* off-topic, and I'm ruling it out of order for 
<br>
SL4.  This should not be taken as indicating disagreement (or agreement) 
<br>
with any of the statements made; but there really are better mailing lists.
<br>
<p>One exception to this general principle is Friendly AI discussion, which 
<br>
usually represents a high-entropy state of AI mailing lists, but has been 
<br>
explicitly permitted on SL4, since it has to happen somewhere.
