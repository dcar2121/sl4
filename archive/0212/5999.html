The is-the-universe-a-simulation topic has been beaten to death repeatedly 
<br>
on this list. Unless there's something sufficiently new or different to be 
<br>
said about it I declare this thread closed. (The extropian and wta-talk 
<br>
lists might be more appropriate places for this.)

<em>&gt; GW&gt; it's more likely that our theory of Friendliness is correct than that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; we are seeing `unfriendly' Friendliness. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are a number of hidden assumptions underlying your reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above, among them:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - You don't have to suffer, i.e. suffering is unnecessary.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the suffering we are going through is a necessary part of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   process, which our current POV cannot see.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - You have asked for the suffering to stop.  Perhaps this needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   be asked in the proper way, with the proper tools and preparation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and the proper degree of sincerity.  (I won't get into the relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   occult and mystical practices here, but some techniques may or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   not resemble &quot;asking to be let out&quot; or &quot;asking for the suffering to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   stop&quot;.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - That any simulation would necessarily be monitored (probably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   by implication, by its creator).  Perhaps we are the manifestations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of a single higher mind in a simulation of its own devising that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   will &quot;end&quot; when we reunite, possibly through the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (certain mystical speculations could be read this way); perhaps it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   is only you in a simulation of your own devising or that of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   else (us humans of 2040 having devised direct brain interface gear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   an amnesia drug, say; or us Pleiadaians having done something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   similar, the better to understand these peculiar Gaians).  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   other possibilities. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, I think you're limiting the idea of simulation to a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of simulation we might create, run by certain rules we might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; I understand the Prime Directive and I say that Captain Kirk could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; helped a lot more people if he had dropped a few replicators on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; 20th-Century-Earth-looking planets than if he had just ignored them.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; I'm aware that it's possible to do more harm than good, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; anthropologists have come a long way in helping the people they study 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; come towards the modern world.  I think that deciding the best course 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; of action to help an underdeveloped civilization would be an easy task 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GW&gt; for an SI. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never watched much Trek, so I can't speak to Kirk's actions or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack thereof, but the Prime Directive as written doesn't say one can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   As the right of each sentient species to live in accordance with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   its normal cultural evolution is considered sacred, no Starfleet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   personnel may interfere with the healthy development of alien
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   life and culture. Such interference includes the introduction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a world who society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   is incapable of handling such advantages wisely. [...] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are hypotheses one could sketch under which interference might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take/have taken place on Earth; a lot depends on the understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;healthy development&quot;.  One could even speculate that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference does or has taken place, albeit surreptitiously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Insufficient data.
