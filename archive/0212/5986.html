<p>
When this thread started I immediately thought of Eliezer's reply, even though 
<br>
I thought it was a bit long-winded -- What is it that you want?
<br>
<p>We are of course assuming that that is the correct question to ask. And if it 
<br>
is, the answer is very simple, even for trans/post-humans. We want more 
<br>
pleasure, and less pain. Every single response so far can be reduced to this 
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>But pleasure/pain can also be regarded as indicators for action/change for the 
<br>
purpose of self-preservation. Pleasure means keep doing it because it's good 
<br>
for you, pain means something is wrong and needs to be fixed. Altering a body's 
<br>
senses through drugs and whatnot are self-defeatiing, eventually bringing the 
<br>
ultimate pain of (brain) death. An intelligent person or body designer would 
<br>
associate some sort of pain with taking euphoric drugs or having sex (or mutual 
<br>
masturbation in this day and age) all the time.
<br>
<p>Also realizing that it is Ben0 that &quot;wants&quot; to be cloned for the purpose of 
<br>
increased pleasure, that pleasure must lie at a different level, at the &quot;set of 
<br>
all Bens&quot;, or his communities of relationships, or the whole human race, etc. 
<br>
As an SL4er, we know that clones by definition, at any level, are discrete 
<br>
entities unto themselves, even if all of the Bens decide together to have an 
<br>
incestuous relationship and take over the world.
<br>
<p>Maybe if we don't have the technology to clone one's corporeal body and mind to 
<br>
upload into, maybe there is some room in the alleged unused 90% of our brain to 
<br>
host another being, a virtual clone of one's mind. Like hosting another 
<br>
operating system on the same machine a la VMware <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">http://www.vmware.com/</a> . It 
<br>
sounds like a schizophrenia disorder, but if it is controlled in a sandbox with 
<br>
the flick of the mind's switch, then it is an issue of body resource 
<br>
management. Maybe this is what dream states are for anyway.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
