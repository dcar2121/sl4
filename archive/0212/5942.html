</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been thinking about what I'm going to do with myself in 15-30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years or so...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I think I'd like to do is to create a *series* of 5 Bens:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben1: pretty much like me, but with an immortal, illness-free body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more control over things like sleep, anger, etc.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben2: a human-computer hybrid, with a human body but a neural link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into computer systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben3: A Ben in a humanoid robot body, with the ability to breathe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, fly, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben4: an uploaded computer program seeded with my mind, and allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to grow more intelligent, but specifically required to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication with Ben1, Ben2 and Ben3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben5: an uploaded computer program allowed to evolve and self-modify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any direction ... quite probably it will soon become clever enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be disinterested in Ben1, Ben2, Ben3 and Ben4 and effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;disappear&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>### I've given a lot of thought to this area of long-range planning, too. I
<br>
have somewhat different dreams. Since the core of my volitional system is
<br>
the wish to preserve and expand the functioning of my conscious
<br>
information-processing systems, I would easily dispense with options 1
<br>
through 3, except for strictly utilitarian purposes - whenever there are
<br>
physical objects to be moved and no subsentient routine is up to the task,
<br>
I'd use any combination of the bodies you mention. However, for the bulk of
<br>
my life's thinking I would remain incorporeal, with augmented intelligence
<br>
and modified emotional systems. The exact direction of the modification
<br>
would depend on the survivability of the mods. Most likely I would spawn a
<br>
large number of copies, synchronized and connected to each other to varying
<br>
degrees - roughly equivalent to your Ben4, but multiplied and networked. I
<br>
think there might be limits to the processing power and intelligence that
<br>
can be present in a single conscious process, and should my mind reach this
<br>
limit, spawning would offer a way of circumventing it.
<br>
<p>In the process of empirical modification I would probably sometimes produce
<br>
copies which would evolve away from the rest of the spawn, representing an
<br>
analogy to your Ben5. Other possibility would be intentional production of
<br>
copies (call them Rafal X) which would not share my volitional focus while
<br>
still retaining my memory and personality. Currently, I am a conglomerate of
<br>
memories and a goal system with an explicit supergoal of self-maintenance,
<br>
including propagation of the goal system, an advanced Kohlberg stage 6
<br>
system. Normally I would not see X copies as identity-preserving. However,
<br>
under some special circumstances, X copies might be a way of preserving and
<br>
propagating memories and traces of personality. Such circumstances would
<br>
include encounters with borganized or hive-like minds. The Rafal X would be
<br>
beyond human Kohlberg or Bateson stages, could call it a Kohlberg 7.
