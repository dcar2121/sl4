</em><br>
<p>Well, I believe that a totally deeper/different understanding of mind,
<br>
reality and cosmos will come along with the Ben4/Ben5 incarnations.  Since
<br>
Ben5 was hypothesized as a being with exponentially increasing intelligence,
<br>
it's pretty clear he's going to go beyond all that's human pretty quickly,
<br>
including the notions of happiness existence and understanding....
<br>
<p>In this message, I will try to more fully elaborate the psychology &amp;
<br>
philosophy underlying my hypothetical interest in multiple, progressively
<br>
advanced incarnations.
<br>
<p>Of course, I recognize the tremendously greater profundity of the
<br>
transformation into Ben5 (who will lose the human notion of self, will go
<br>
beyond all human ways of thinking, acting and perciving), as opposed to the
<br>
minor transformations into Ben1-Ben4.
<br>
<p>However, I find myself drawn in two opposite philosophical directions:
<br>
<p>1) the desire to transcend, to become better and better and more and more,
<br>
to attempt to become infinite -- in intelligence, awareness, power, wisdom,
<br>
knowledge...
<br>
<p>2) the acceptance of what is.  What is, is -- and need there be any more?
<br>
In a way, truth lies in acceptance of the moment, not the seeking to get out
<br>
of the moment into a different sort of moment.
<br>
<p>Accepting Ben0, the current Ben, who without technological innovation will
<br>
grow old and die, would be the ultimate expression of philosophy 2.  But I
<br>
don't go quite that far toward philosophy 2!
<br>
<p>The multiple hypothetical Bens represent a set of points on the continuum
<br>
from philosophy 2 to philosophy 1.
<br>
<p>So it's really not about gadgets and robots.  It's about the acceptance
<br>
versus the desire for betterment.
<br>
<p>It could be that the lower Bens will choose to annihilate or upload
<br>
themselves, or that the higher Bens will intentionally absorb them....  Hard
<br>
to tell!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up walking down the slow path, and smelling the flowers, it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because some Friendly AI blazed a trail all the way to the end, just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sure that there are no dangers that slowly blossoming humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see.  No gamma-ray bursts, exploding galaxies, decaying laws of physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hostile superintelligences, what-have-you.  Even if the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun comes from stopping to smell the flowers, there has to be at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience who sacrifices leisure and burns for the light as fast as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that is one scenario, but there are there alternatives.
<br>
<p>For example: Maybe when a being gets intelligent enough, it pulls an Honest
<br>
Annie and stops communicating with lesser minds.  So that there's a fairly
<br>
low upper limit on the intelligence of beings who bother to help out lesser
<br>
beings with nifty technologies.
<br>
<p>In the multiple-Bens scenario, the question is: Is it Ben5 or Ben4 who will
<br>
be involved in making the universe safe for his (intentionally) less-evolved
<br>
brothers ... if indeed these less-evolved brothers are allowed to (or choose
<br>
to) exist at all...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1)  We don't know whether it's the journey or the destination;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Even if it is the journey that counts, and not the destination, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect at least one sentient mind will blaze a trail for the rest;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  And as a result of that superintelligence being around, anyone making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a slow journey will do so without any visible gadgetry, because only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clumsy technology is visible.
</em><br>
<p>But, in the Honest Annie scenario, this line of reasoning might not hold....
<br>
<p>And even in the helpful-superintelligence scenario, some could use clumsy
<br>
technology by choice -- or by choice of their neighborhood god
<br>
(superintelligence) -- ...
<br>
