<p>Well, I think that Gary's and James's views are both serious
<br>
overgeneralizations.
<br>
<p>Like James, I have known a fair number of really rich people.
<br>
<p>Some are as James describes: people who enjoy doing a lot of things,
<br>
creating a lot of value, and generally being a key part of making the modern
<br>
world...
<br>
<p>But some are more like Gary describes.  Especially among investment bankers
<br>
and finance-industry sales types I've known, it's not that common to find
<br>
people driven by the desire to create value.  There is a lot of pure and
<br>
simple greed, and a lot of fraud and dishonesty and backstabbing too.  Of
<br>
course there are also some wonderful and honest people -- one can't
<br>
generalize too strongly about any walk of life...
<br>
<p>Others, particularly the wealthy who've *inherited*  money, are just hapless
<br>
fools trying to prove something to themselves or their families, and
<br>
frittering their wealth away on dumb schemes and investments rather than
<br>
creating real business value OR doing philanthropy.  While it takes a lot of
<br>
ability to get rich [except in rare cases of luck], a lot of rich folks seem
<br>
to have dumb and immoral kids, and an awful lot of the money in the world is
<br>
commanded by these inheritors of wealth rather than by wealth-creators.  Of
<br>
course, some wealth-inheritors are fabulously intelligent and creative but
<br>
this seems to be a minority case...
