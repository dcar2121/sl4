Hi John,

<em>&gt; &gt; Society has a gradual (lots of short-term setbacks, to be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that IQ is not a perfect measure of Intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, although an average IQ is considered to be around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100, it is misleading to state the largest IQ in history as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being &quot;only twice the average&quot;.  IQ is measured on a bell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curve.  A 200 would be located extremely far out on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right side of the curve.  It is very hard to imagine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities that a person with a 200 IQ might have.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be able to find solutions to problems that 1,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons of average intelligence working together could not.
</em><br>
<p>The fact that IQs have a normal distribution doesn't imply
<br>
anything about whether they are a linear, logarithmic or other
<br>
scale of intelligence. IQ is defined as a linear measure
<br>
of mental development rate (as ratio of mental to calendar
<br>
age), but of course that doesn't make it a linear measure
<br>
either. And the fact that a person with an IQ of 200 can solve
<br>
problems that 1000 people with IQs of 100 cannot is due to the
<br>
difficulty of collaboration on certain problems, rather than
<br>
any logarithmic scaling. This is nicely discussed in Fred
<br>
Brook's The Mythical Man-Month.
<br>
<p>It is hard to find a good measure of intelligence against
<br>
which to judge whether IQ is a linear or logarithmic scale.
<br>
One candidate measure is suggested in Deric Bownds book Biology
<br>
of Mind. He says that human brains were a survival and breeding
<br>
advantage because they enabled humans to know 150 to 200 other
<br>
humans well, and thus to work in large teams. A person with an
<br>
IQ of 200 cannot know 200,000 other people well and is not 1000
<br>
times smarter than averge humans by that measure.
<br>
<p>In fact, as humans build super-intelligent machines, I think
<br>
that &quot;number of people you can know well&quot; will be a good and
<br>
practical way to measure their intelligence. Machines providing
<br>
intelligent services to humans will be able to provide better
<br>
services by knowing more people. The ability of machines to
<br>
understand a billion humans and their interactions will define
<br>
their higher-level consciousness, in the same way that the human
<br>
ability to understand events over long times periods and involving
<br>
many other minds defines our higher-level consciousness compared
<br>
to animal brains.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Bill
