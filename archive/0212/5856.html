<p><p>I wasn't actually talking about the Wall Street crowd.  I meant people

who actually build and run businesses.  The old finance community tends
<br>
to be populated with jackals -- that I can agree with -- but it also
<br>
seems that their influence and importance is actually waning, at least
<br>
in the circles that I frequent.  More and more finance seems to be done
<br>
through organizations/companies/people who have a few war stories under
<br>
their own belts.  There is relatively low capital viscosity these days,
<br>
or at least more channels, which is pricing the old Wall Street finance
<br>
community out of the market.
<br>
<p>Very little wealth is actually inherited in the US.  I consider this to
<br>
be a blessing.
