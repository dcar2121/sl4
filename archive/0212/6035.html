<em>&gt; Bateson in his book &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; and his earlier writings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; learn how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn.  He gives examples of each in human thinking, and posits 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; human brain doesn't extend to &quot;learning how to learn how to learn how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn&quot; in significant ways.
</em><br>
<p>Going to four levels of learning doesn't make any sense, anyway.
<br>
<p>First, let's subtract 1 from all of those levels; it's a bit easier to 
<br>
keep track of them then.
<br>
<p>At level 0 there is no learning involved, per se.  The mind is just 
<br>
being force fed facts:  they magically appear in its memory.
<br>
<p>At level 1 there is normally learning involved that we are all familiar 
<br>
with.  It's the kind that goes on between children and parents, goes on 
<br>
while reading, and goes on in schools (or at least is supposed to).
<br>
<p>Level 2 is more interesting.  This is where you learn techniques like 
<br>
associating memories with each other to strengthen your ability to 
<br>
remember them and that practice helps you get better at complex tasks 
<br>
like algebra and calculus.
<br>
<p>Level 3 is flat out exciting.  Now you can learn to learn better.  If 
<br>
you can't understand the theory of Friendly AI, all you have to do is 
<br>
reprogram yourself to be able to learn it.  It goes further than that, 
<br>
though.  At this level you already get the ability to reprogram 
<br>
yourself to reprogram yourself better.  You're working at that level 
<br>
already, so it's no problem to just jump over and rewrite the running 
<br>
code (assuming the system supports it, but in the general case it's 
<br>
already available).
<br>
<p>If a level 4 exists, this would be extending to ontotechnology but 
<br>
would be debatable to continue to think of this in terms of levels of 
<br>
learning.  That would certainly still be an applicable domain, but 
<br>
things were already starting to open up at level 3 and the seams are 
<br>
busted wide open at level 4.
