</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
SA&gt; I was not speaking of children and I don't think a metaphor of 
<br>
SA&gt; human adults as children relative to a FAI is at all 
<br>
SA&gt; appropriate.  A FAI worth its salt will know that Friendliness 
<br>
SA&gt; relative to humans requires persuasion in non-coercive human 
<br>
SA&gt; activities.
<br>
<p>Alright, I think we're talking past each other here.  Of course I
<br>
don't have the right to deny others the choice to be a wirehead.
<br>
I was raising the issue of whether an _FAI_ would offer that option, and
<br>
if it did, to what extent it should try to persuade people choosing it
<br>
that there are better things.
<br>
<p>I was not trying to reduce the FAI-human relationship to a simple
<br>
parent-child one, but there are analogous elements if:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- self-actualization of human potential is &quot;best&quot; for humans
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- many humans will choose quick and shallow satisfaction over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that deeper one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- the FAI &quot;knows better&quot;
<br>
<p>Here in the US, it's certainly not just children who eat too much
<br>
McDonald's and candy...
<br>
<p>I don't think an FAI should force anybody to do anything.  But the
<br>
question of where &quot;persuasion&quot; crosses that line is a bit tricky with
<br>
a superintelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ======
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A tangentially related issue:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SA&gt; Not to mention that the above is massively boring.  You would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SA&gt; have to remove part of human intelligence to have many people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SA&gt; &quot;happy&quot; with simply continuous pleasure.  Pleasure is also quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SA&gt; relative for us.  Too much of a &quot;good thing&quot; results in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SA&gt; devaluation of that pleasure and even eventual repugnance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What if you could devise an &quot;optimal path&quot; -- the best rythm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; alternating ups and downs, challenges and rewards -- is that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a superintelligence should guide us along, or would that be _less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; optimally rewarding_ because we hadn't chosen that path completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; independently?  
</em><br>
<p>SA&gt; What if we stop thinking up rather low grade &quot;solutions&quot; and 
<br>
SA&gt; think about higher level ones and how those may be made most 
<br>
SA&gt; likely?  Human actualization is not about getting the most 
<br>
SA&gt; pleasure jollies.
<br>
<p>Yes, that's my point.  That there may be an optimal path towards
<br>
actualization, consisting of the right sequence of challenges and
<br>
rewards, in any given instance.  My question is whether we would feel
<br>
cheated out of &quot;real&quot; challenge if offered such a path (should it
<br>
exist).
<br>
<p>Should an FAI offer such paths?  Or should it just restrict itself to
<br>
giving people freedom, i.e. disallowing the initiation of force?
<br>
<p>If it does more, then what is that more and where are the lines it
<br>
shouldn't cross?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Except maybe to point out that the notion of &quot;objective ethics&quot; is at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; least as difficult as the notion of &quot;objective aesthetics&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>SA&gt; That is not a meaningful observation in this context.
<br>
<p>Perhaps it is for those who claim objective ethics are possible while
<br>
they might agree if asked that beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
<br>
or determined by (cultural, historical, personal) context.  If
<br>
aesthetics is context-dependent surely ethics is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Somehow we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have to reconcile the notion that &quot;it's all subjective&quot; with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; notion that it's not _all_ _just_ subjective, that some things _are_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dammit, better/more artful than others.  
</em><br>
<p>SA&gt; It is impossible to reconcile opposites.  It is not all just 
<br>
SA&gt; subjective so why should I reconcile what is to that spurious idea?
<br>
<p>Because humans hold contradictary ideas, which is why I used &quot;the
<br>
notion that&quot; rather than &quot;the fact that&quot;.  If we're going to build
<br>
superintelligences we need to get beyond that and other paradoxes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; To tie this in with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; earlier statement, perhaps the ethical as well as the aesthetical is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that which increases your intelligence and / or the opportunities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; actualizing its potential...words such as &quot;uplifting&quot; are often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; applied in such contexts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>SA&gt; Perhaps a shorter statement would be that the Good is that which 
<br>
SA&gt; actualizes the life/existence of the sentient beings involved. 
<br>
SA&gt; The &quot;Good&quot; applies both to judging/providing a partial basis for 
<br>
SA&gt; Ethics and Aesthetics.
<br>
<p>I can agree with that statement, and I'm curious what role you feel an
<br>
FAI should play in regards to it.
