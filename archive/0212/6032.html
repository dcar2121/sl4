</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'shock levels' :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Automaton. Fixed learning about X,Y,Z...No training.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Learner. Learns X,Y,Z.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Meta Learner. Learns to learn X,Y,Y....
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.
</em><br>
<p>These very closely resemble the &quot;levels of learning&quot; introduced by Gregory
<br>
Bateson in his book &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; and his earlier writings.
<br>
<p>He discusses learning, learning how to learn, and learning how to learn how
<br>
to learn.  He gives examples of each in human thinking, and posits that the
<br>
human brain doesn't extend to &quot;learning how to learn how to learn how to
<br>
learn&quot; in significant ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The assumption in the given training course is class 2). At least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's true that Michael's tests do not explicitly seek to distinguish
<br>
learning from metalearning etc.
<br>
<p>However, I think they can be used to test metalearning ability, with a
<br>
little cleverness...
<br>
<p>If a system is able to &quot;learn how to learn&quot;, then it should be able to carry
<br>
over learning from one test to the next in the test suite.
<br>
<p>So, one could test metalearning as follows, using his test suite of tests
<br>
T(1),...,T(N).  Given a particular AI system S, for each test T(K) one could
<br>
<p>a) test S on the test T(K)
<br>
<p>b) test S on a number of prior tests drawn from {T(1),...,T(K-1)} , and then
<br>
test it on the test K
<br>
<p>[One would want to choose prior tests T(i) so that knowledge of how to pass
<br>
T(i) does not obviously provide material assistance in knowing how to pass
<br>
T(K).]
<br>
<p>If the system can learn how to learn, then it should learn to pass the test
<br>
K *significantly faster* in case b) than in case a).  Because it should have
<br>
learned how to learn, to some extent, from its experience with the prior
<br>
tests.
<br>
<p>One could construct a similar regime to test learning how to learn how to
<br>
learn, though it would be a lot more elaborate and time-consuming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like Peter, I see assumptions (in the intro) that belie an implicit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific philosophical/design position.
</em><br>
<p>Peter Voss did not say anything nearly this strong, as I interpreted his
<br>
e-mail.
<br>
<p>Of course, he can clarify his opinion for himself if he so wishes ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Renamed, say, &quot;Training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a Class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) , Human-grounded unembodied AI&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>The problem with making a test suite for an embodied AI, is that the test
<br>
suite is inevitably very body-dependent.
<br>
<p>Humans would fail a test suite created for dolphins, and vice versa -- etc.
<br>
etc. etc.
<br>
<p>I note that IQ tests, SAT tests, and the like, do not take explicit account
<br>
of embodiment.
<br>
<p>I think that tests involving embodiment are interesting.  But I don't think
<br>
that a test NOT involving embodiment is intrinsically inapplicable to
<br>
embodied AI's.
<br>
<p>Indeed, if the &quot;embodiment is necessary for AI&quot; theory is correct, then
<br>
embodied AI's should do far better on tests NOT involving embodiment in any
<br>
explicit way.  No?
<br>
<p>I do not think Michael's tests are anywhere near adequate as a training
<br>
regime for a baby AI.  I tend to agree with Peter on one point: I think that
<br>
learning in a noisy, rich environment is probably necessary for the easy
<br>
development of robust cognition.  I also think that learning in a context
<br>
encouraging spontaneous non-goal-directed behavior is important -- not just
<br>
testable, goal-oriented behavior.
<br>
<p>However, I think that tests like Michael's can serve as an important
<br>
component of a baby AI training regimen.  And they do have the advantage of
<br>
being relatively AI-approach-independent.  Whereas spontaneous behaviors and
<br>
rich-environment-oriented behaviors are going to be a lot more dependent on
<br>
the sort of sensors and actuators and body that an AI has...
