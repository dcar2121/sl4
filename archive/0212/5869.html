<em>&gt;&gt;I think many people, especially intellectuals, can be seduced by the meme of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;idealism.  The idealist (or Platonic) concept that information (or Forms)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;precede material manifestation is very attractive to people whose lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;revolve around theorizing, computation, and programming.  Many philosophers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mathematicians and logicians succumb to this point of view (Raymond Smullyan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and Saul Kripke, for instance).  Some physicists do, too (e.g., Frank
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Tipler).
</em><br>
<p>Not so fast.  If we happen to be in a sim, then it is quite 
<br>
proper to speak of information preceding what *we currently 
<br>
consider to be* &quot;the material manifestation&quot;.  If we are not in 
<br>
a sim, it is likely that we will someday choose to be in a 
<br>
computationally mediated reality in whole or part where the 
<br>
&quot;matter&quot; is not really primary to the inhabitants of the VR 
<br>
unless they choose to forget the nature of their &quot;reality&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that isn't shocking, then I don't know what is.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite understand how extensive is your idea of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or forms *preceding* material manifestation.  To be sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, I fall into the class of people possibly seduced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you not admit that the constraints that appear to restrict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter to certain patterns, forms, is universal?  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical constraints limit the possibilities, or properties,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many physical systems can evolve to.  (A concrete example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a TM that searches for 4 integers satisfying Fermat's Last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theorem.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Those constraints are described by mathematics to some degree. 
<br>
This doesn't mean the material system was given by the 
<br>
mathematics though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Life, the universe and everything may be implementable on a variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;different material platforms under a range of different physical parameters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;But they cannot be implemented without SOME material platform.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, so it seems, and I'd be willing to wager on it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing to be found to be true for any finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of time in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  But is the bedrock material platform something you are 
<br>
actually aware of necessarily?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Mitchell Porter had written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think our contemporary attempts to make a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;information ontology are going to require a [] compromise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;with materialism before they get off the ground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can search for some explanatory links between physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the one hand, and mathematics and its constraints (that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I spoke of above) on the other.  Somehow it does seem that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one depends on the other, or they depend on each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People will IMO long search for an understanding of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical reality gives rise to mathematical reality, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vice-versa (as one of those seduced physicists---Tegmark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---likes to postulate).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Patterns exist in our observed reality.  Mathematics formalizes 
<br>
the recognition of and provides additional tools for the capture 
<br>
and manipulation of patterns.  Why does it need to be any more 
<br>
complex than that?  Why leap to the mathematics determining the 
<br>
reality (or whatever facsimile thereof we happen to inhabit)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But just as Mike LaTorra stated in another post in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread, there is no guarantee that results will ever be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forthcoming---we should reject the idea that there *must*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be discoverable causal relations between them.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some things do need to be accepted empirically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>At the quantum level, for some fudamental events, it certainly 
<br>
does seem to be the case that there are not necessarily any 
<br>
causal relationship.
<br>
<p>Causality is really not bound up in strict materialism or 
<br>
non-Idealism.  I'm not sure why it came up as I am missing that 
<br>
context.
