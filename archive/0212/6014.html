</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### First off, if the simulation problem is still banned from this list, let
<br>
me say I am sorry, and any replies could be posted to WTA or ExI. But then,
<br>
on the other hand, I have a feeling that my thoughts on this subject might
<br>
have some bearing on AI, however remotely.
<br>
<p>Some caveats: There are many implicit assumptions that go into even simple
<br>
deliberations, such as the feeling that the complex can be derived from
<br>
simpler objects, and the feeling, shared by many, that the simplest
<br>
mathematical objects are a form of ultimate, if limited, truth. It is very
<br>
difficult to think without such forms of reasoning, indeed, I would
<br>
immediately lapse into incoherence if I tried to shut them out of my mind.
<br>
Yet, on a very basic philosophical level, we cannot wholly reject the idea
<br>
that these forms of thought are not the only possible ones. We could live in
<br>
a very special simulation, designed to analyze the lives of constructs too
<br>
incoherent to exist in the &quot;real world&quot;. In other words, even our concepts
<br>
of mathematics and logic could be in principle not generalizable beyond our
<br>
limited purview. This would of course invalidate any ideas we might have
<br>
about anything, including the simulation problem.
<br>
<p>These caveats aside, one could try to derive some conclusions assuming that
<br>
our notions of mathematics are generalizable to whatever simulation level
<br>
(if any) we might be located in.
<br>
<p>If indeed it is true that the complex is formed from the simple, then it
<br>
should be possible to delineate the minimum number of simple steps and
<br>
elements leading from a set of mathematical axioms and simple objects, to
<br>
the subjectively observed reality. There would be two classes of such
<br>
observable realities: the ones which could be mathematically explained
<br>
without recourse to any notions of &quot;hidden variables&quot; - complex phenomena
<br>
irreducible to mathematical transformations, and the ones where the
<br>
existence of such variables must be postulated.
<br>
<p>To use a thought experiment: Let's suppose that a group of evil politicians
<br>
and their lackey scientists would take a number of newborns, and put them
<br>
into a VR environment consisting of a finite but very large Euclidean space,
<br>
populated by simple geometrical shapes. Certain interactions between to
<br>
shapes would result in food being delivered intravenously to the newborns,
<br>
and screens and electrodes implanted in the sensory and motor cortices would
<br>
allow the test subjects to interact with the environment. It is conceivable
<br>
that a society might develop among the minds who would perceive themselves
<br>
as simple geometric shapes (if allowed by the rules of the simulation).
<br>
Their scientists might develop a sophisticated understanding of mathematics
<br>
(the one shared with us) and local simulated physics (not shared with us).
<br>
However, any attempts at understanding the structure of their own minds and
<br>
bodies would be doomed without assuming the existence of highly complex
<br>
entities (brains, bodies, evil politicians) not directly derivable from the
<br>
simple mathematical objects and the observed version of reality accessible
<br>
to them. There would be a chasm between mathematics and physics. In effect,
<br>
they would have to postulate the existence of &quot;supernatural&quot; phenomena, an
<br>
irreducible cleft between body and mind, between structure and qualia.
<br>
<p>If we, in our tinkering with the world, ever produce a simple set of
<br>
principles from which everything else, including the subjective experience,
<br>
naturally flows, then we would live in the first class of worlds - either
<br>
real, as real as natural numbers, or an ab initio simulation, which AISI are
<br>
one and the same. Should we ever stumble on a problem that cannot be reduced
<br>
to a concatenation of simple enough mathematical problems, this would be a
<br>
reason to suspect we live in a simulation. If you need to invent a god (a
<br>
conscious, goal-oriented entity) to explain the world, and even your best
<br>
efforts do not allow you get rid of this invention, there is a good chance
<br>
you are in a simulation.
<br>
<p>Since the problem of qualia is to me the most vexing one in all of
<br>
philosophy, I am eagerly awaiting the ability to explore qualia in
<br>
Turing-capable machines. If there are such machines which would deny
<br>
experiencing qualia, while otherwise being capable of functioning and
<br>
self-monitoring at the same level and using similar information-processing
<br>
structures as humans do, I would seriously worry about the possibility of
<br>
the existence of souls, and other such rigmarole. Being the inveterate
<br>
skeptic I therefore expect that machines will have the same capability for
<br>
subjective experience as humans do, and it will be possible to tie this
<br>
experience to complex information-processing steps, built out of simpler
<br>
ones.
