<p>
I'm pleased to announce that Fictionwise have now put up my novel about VR,
<br>
uploads, time travel, the Omega Point and all that jazz, written in the
<br>
mid-'70s, at
<br>
<p><a href="http://ww.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook8404.htm">http://ww.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook8404.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Here's their blurb:
<br>
<p>======
<br>
<p>The classic that coined 'Virtual Reality'! Maggie Roche is an unemployed
<br>
poet and single mother in 2009. Before the day's done, she is spied on by a
<br>
robotic rat, physically attacked, drugged into panic and rapture, seduced,
<br>
drawn into conspiracy, then flung four thousand years into her own future.
<br>
In the alien world of the Upload Lifeform Lords, who are human-machine
<br>
hybrids of overwhelming power, she learns that she is the first true time
<br>
traveler in history, hunted by friend and foe. More than her own survival is
<br>
at stake--the entire future of the cosmos will be reset by these terrifying
<br>
events. Damien Broderick's classic science fiction novel of time travel to
<br>
the end of the universe has long been out of print in the USA. First written
<br>
in the mid-1970s and published in 1982, The Judas Mandala introduced the
<br>
terms 'virtual reality' and 'virtual matrix', and anticipated both Frank
<br>
Tipler's influential Omega Point Theory and the cyberpunk fiction of William
<br>
Gibson. This revised edition retains these startlingly creative elements,
<br>
while bringing the novel firmly into the 21st century ... but not
<br>
necessarily our 21st century. Broderick adds a new Afterword, written
<br>
specially for this Fictionwise edition, that describes the hilarious
<br>
publishing history of this ground-breaking novel and includes the full text
<br>
of an omitted chapter.
<br>
<p>======
<br>
<p>That last phrase is a teeny bit misleading: the chapter was omitted from the
<br>
*first* edition, it's omitted from the main text of *this* edition.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick
