<p>IQ is no longer defined as a ratio of mental to calendar age, and hasn't 
<br>
been for quite some time.  Today IQ is actually *defined as* a normal 
<br>
distribution, with, if I recall correctly, 16 IQ points being equal to one 
<br>
standard deviation.  That is, if you have an IQ of 132, it *means that* 
<br>
your test scores are in a percentile two standard deviations from the mean.
<br>
<p>A person with an IQ of 200 can solve problems that 1000 people with IQs of 
<br>
1000 cannot due to &quot;difficulty of collaboration&quot;, but it should be noted 
<br>
that this is the kind of &quot;difficulty of collaboration&quot; that would require, 
<br>
at least, computer-mediated telepathy to solve.  I suspect a single 
<br>
computer-mediated dual human could outthink Einstein - he was smart, but 
<br>
he didn't have twice as much brain mass as one human - but I could prove 
<br>
to be wrong about that.  On the other hand, six hundred chimps 
<br>
collectively have a hundred times as much prefrontal computing power as 
<br>
one human, but even a computer-mediated 600-chimp Beowulf cluster might 
<br>
prove unable to outthink a human, the complex adaptations necessary being 
<br>
absent.  But the &quot;g-factor&quot; in variation in intelligence between 
<br>
individual humans should not be confused with &quot;general intelligence&quot;, 
<br>
i.e., the factor that separates humans from chimps, as opposed to Einstein 
<br>
from Joe.
