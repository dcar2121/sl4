</em><br>
<p>SA&gt; All the above said though, I have no right to choose for anyone 
<br>
SA&gt; else.  If they want the equivalent to being a wirehead then they 
<br>
SA&gt; must have room to choose that although not to bind others to 
<br>
SA&gt; supporting their decision directly.
<br>
<p>But here, we get into the subtle details (where mr. S. is known to
<br>
hang out) of how one determines what an entity wants.  If you're a
<br>
parent, you know that ultimately your child's happiness is better
<br>
served by a healthy diet than always giving in to the child's
<br>
*proclaimed* desire -- for McDonald's and candy, say (I am
<br>
conveniently sidestepping media saturation influence here, which does
<br>
play a big role).
<br>
<p>To what extent will / should an entity far more intelligent than us
<br>
take on a parent role?  To what extent or in which cases will / should
<br>
ve decide that we'll ultimately be more deeply satisfied taking the
<br>
slightly more difficult path?  Should it just rely on reported
<br>
desires?
<br>
<p><p>======
<br>
A tangentially related issue:
<br>
<p>SA&gt; Not to mention that the above is massively boring.  You would
<br>
SA&gt; have to remove part of human intelligence to have many people 
<br>
SA&gt; &quot;happy&quot; with simply continuous pleasure.  Pleasure is also quite 
<br>
SA&gt; relative for us.  Too much of a &quot;good thing&quot; results in the 
<br>
SA&gt; devaluation of that pleasure and even eventual repugnance.
<br>
<p>What if you could devise an &quot;optimal path&quot; -- the best rythm of
<br>
alternating ups and downs, challenges and rewards -- is that something
<br>
a superintelligence should guide us along, or would that be _less than
<br>
optimally rewarding_ because we hadn't chosen that path completely
<br>
independently?  This boils down to the same ethical issues, in a sense,
<br>
discussed earlier in this thread re: uploading / changing somebody so
<br>
they want to upload / giving somebody full, convincing memories of the
<br>
whole life experience they went through that ended up with them
<br>
wanting to upload.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to make a point here, these are honest questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; To take a different stab at this than ethics, one can judge answers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;What is the Meaning of Life?&quot; esthetically.  E.g., &quot;it's all just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; random coincidence&quot; is ugly and nihilistic; &quot;it's so that God could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; judge you and reward/punish you for Eternity&quot; seems trite and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simplistic; &quot;to become more and more aware of everything around you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to get to know things Deeply, until even the most ugly thing to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; becomes beautiful and the most hated thing loved&quot; seems a step up from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that.  Although still trite when put in those terms...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
SA&gt; Ethics is generally considered more philosophically fundamental 
<br>
SA&gt; than aesthetics.  So using the latter to formulate and justify 
<br>
SA&gt; the former is not very workable.
<br>
<p>Except maybe to point out that the notion of &quot;objective ethics&quot; is at
<br>
least as difficult as the notion of &quot;objective aesthetics&quot;.  Somehow we
<br>
have to reconcile the notion that &quot;it's all subjective&quot; with the
<br>
notion that it's not _all_ _just_ subjective, that some things _are_,
<br>
dammit, better/more artful than others.  To tie this in with your
<br>
earlier statement, perhaps the ethical as well as the aesthetical is
<br>
that which increases your intelligence and / or the opportunities for
<br>
actualizing its potential...words such as &quot;uplifting&quot; are often
<br>
applied in such contexts.
