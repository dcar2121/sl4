<p><em>&gt; Samantha Atkins:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; Complexity as such is no meaningful measure of &quot;rightness&quot; at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; all. It certainly will not help us make moral decisions, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; difficult or otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My sense is that a &quot;higher&quot; ethics or morality does have some relation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increasing complexity (or consciousness or intelligence).  On an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitive or perhaps esthetic level I feel this is the &quot;purpose&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience -- although I wouldn't propose that as an objective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurable reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>me:
<br>
I have less problem with a particular kind of complexity such as 
<br>
intelligence being part of a standard than just &quot;complexity&quot; in 
<br>
general.  Values are more specific in my thinking.  What still 
<br>
seems to be missing is quality of life (QoL) portions of the 
<br>
morality/ethics meta-justification.  Very loosely speaking I 
<br>
would say &quot;The Purpose&quot; is increasing the amount of intelligence 
<br>
and its potentials as well as opportuinities for actualizing 
<br>
that potential.  But that doesn't roll of the tongue easily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't properly formulate my exact &quot;reasons&quot; for this feeling, as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't something arrived at through reasoning.  But roughly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say we gave an AI the goal to minimize human suffering and maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human pleasure.  We could well end up with endless pleasure-center
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulation or its pharmaceutical or virtual equivalent.  And although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this would give us pleasure, it's an inward-oriented and stagnant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decadent path for sentience to take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And it fails my loose stab at the general criteria of morals 
<br>
above of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Pure pleasure also is less esthetically pleasing.  It's superficial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not &quot;deeply&quot; satisfying, it doesn't fulfill.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Christian terms it would be a sinful path.  I am not religious nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was I raised as such, but in certain ways the statement that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above would &quot;go against God's plan&quot; resonates -- perhaps if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substitute &quot;Life, the Universe &amp; Everything&quot; for &quot;God&quot;.  To say this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, indeed, to anthropomorphize the Universe, to ascribe it goals or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose, for which there is no scientific excuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not to mention that the above is massively boring.  You would 
<br>
have to remove part of human intelligence to have many people 
<br>
&quot;happy&quot; with simply continuous pleasure.  Pleasure is also quite 
<br>
relative for us.  Too much of a &quot;good thing&quot; results in the 
<br>
devaluation of that pleasure and even eventual repugnance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ultimately, it feels more Right to me for sentience to be oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards the complexity found &quot;outside&quot; itself, i.e. to embrace the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unknown, rather than to navelgaze.  Facing challenges and hardship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assimilating more of the Universe's complexity, seems ethically on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher plane than &quot;just&quot; refraining from hurting other sentients.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put &quot;outside&quot; in scare quotes because there is much of the Unknown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside ourselves as well -- generally the scarier, darker, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult stuff).  Increasing intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All the above said though, I have no right to choose for anyone 
<br>
else.  If they want the equivalent to being a wirehead then they 
<br>
must have room to choose that although not to bind others to 
<br>
supporting their decision directly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; To take a different stab at this than ethics, one can judge answers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What is the Meaning of Life?&quot; esthetically.  E.g., &quot;it's all just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random coincidence&quot; is ugly and nihilistic; &quot;it's so that God could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judge you and reward/punish you for Eternity&quot; seems trite and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplistic; &quot;to become more and more aware of everything around you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get to know things Deeply, until even the most ugly thing to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes beautiful and the most hated thing loved&quot; seems a step up from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  Although still trite when put in those terms...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ethics is generally considered more philosophically fundamental 
<br>
than aesthetics.  So using the latter to formulate and justify 
<br>
the former is not very workable.
