</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Demonstrably untrue.  Although I find babies interesting and

</em><br>
<p>While this kind of argument usually gets me in trouble, maybe it won't 
<br>
be misconstrued here.
<br>
<p>I argue that you are not looking closely enough at your own mind.  I am 
<br>
not a big fan of dogs.  I'm not scared of them, but I'm not going to 
<br>
keep one in my house.  When I see a puppy or any dog I don't really 
<br>
feel like it's cute.  At the same time, I can tell that there is part 
<br>
of my brain saying &quot;cute cute cute&quot; even though other parts of my brain 
<br>
are overriding it enough that its influence can be very subtle and 
<br>
difficult to notice.
<br>
<p>Also, if you really truly do not have anything in your brain saying 
<br>
that puppies or babies are cute, then your brain may be broken in that 
<br>
respect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The underlying nature of what makes something beautiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is still the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An interesting opinion.  Care to define beauty?
</em><br>
<p>As far as your brain is concerned, it's anything that you like to sense 
<br>
and might seek out to sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; For ethics, culture only deals with transitive and recent changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Its effect on ethics is noticeably different from that of evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, an interesting opinion.  Would you provide us with an example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or two of how a cultural ethic is different from an evolved ethic?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would one reliably identify this defference?
</em><br>
<p>Evolved ethics are tied in with morality.  For example, humans have 
<br>
ethics helping them to share food.  They have the moral of helping 
<br>
their kin, and the ethic of sharing their food with kin.  These are 
<br>
ethics that usually don't break down unless there is some split in the 
<br>
kin group (the kin group has reason to believe that some sect of the 
<br>
kin group is not as closely genetically related as they thought).
<br>
<p>A cultural ethic is that you should not expose someone else's True Name 
<br>
on the Internet.  It is in response to very recent events that have not 
<br>
yet had time to become evolved ethics (and won't).
<br>
<p>You can tell the difference by how easily the rule is broken.  For 
<br>
example, I carelessly tricked someone into breaking the True Name ethic 
<br>
a couple of months ago or so (I've probably got the timing all wrong, 
<br>
so just know that it happened somewhere between a few weeks and 6 
<br>
months ago).  On the other hand, not many people will refuse members of 
<br>
their kin group food (note that there is some cultural influence as to 
<br>
how large you actively consider your kin group, but it's usually 
<br>
several levels out, even in America).  Also, there are ethics 
<br>
concerning how much sharing you'll permit, even with kin groups.  The 
<br>
degree of support hinges on the degree of relatedness.  If a person is 
<br>
related too little, you might even refuse support.
