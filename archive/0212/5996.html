</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Illogical.  Of course you feel real.  You are perfectly real in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context of the sim.  That you are not let out when you ask could mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a variety of things, like that you really aren't ready to be let out.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not necessarily a sign of &quot;unfriendliness&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about you, but if this is a simulation, it sucks and I 
<br>
want out.  It's not Friendly to let someone suffer when they don't have 
<br>
to and have asked for the suffering to stop.  I think, in this case, 
<br>
it's more likely that our theory of Friendliness is correct than that 
<br>
we are seeing `unfriendly' Friendliness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If we are living in a simulation, then an Unfriendly Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; occurred, in which case I wouldn't put to much faith in being still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; around when the simulation ends.  So, in my opinion, if this is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simulation, we're out of luck.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still doesn't follow.
</em><br>
<p>In a Friendly Singularity, you would not be allowed to hold a mind in a 
<br>
simulation that wants out.  Since we can't get out, if this is a 
<br>
simulation, we are very likely not living in a Friendly Singularity.  
<br>
If we are in an Unfriendly Singularity, the chance of anyone even being 
<br>
very friendly decreases (remember, most of the reason that humans are 
<br>
friendly is evolution; you can win, though, if you become the biggest 
<br>
kid on the block by about 100 times).  Hence I think that lacking 
<br>
strong indicators of high morals, if we're forced into this kind of 
<br>
suffering here, I doubt we'll be given some computronium and told to go 
<br>
enjoy living in the Singularity when the simulation ends.
<br>
<p>Also, this is not a logical proof; it's a series of probabilistic 
<br>
calculations.  In the end, P(living in a simulation) &lt;&lt; P(not living in 
<br>
a simulation), in my mind, anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  If we've already been contacted, human ideas of morality are 180 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; degrees off the mark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, how so?  I can think of many things you might have had in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; mind but I am not sure what you were thinking of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Human morality points in the direction of altruism (human morality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; itself is not altruism, but approximates it).  Altruism, as we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; understand it, means helping people.  As an example, the Prime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Directive is very selfish, since it's essentially preserving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; societies as they are when they could help them live the good life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like everyone in the Federation for the sake of anthropological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; study.  If the Prime Directive is moral, our understanding of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; altruism is completely off the mark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, a lot depends on what really is &quot;helpful&quot;.  It might be quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumptious to assume that critters that don't know how to help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves know exactly what help would or would not look like from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures more capable and intelligent.  The Prime Directive is not in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the least &quot;selfish&quot; unless you do not comprehend it.  From your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarks, I think you do not.  The Prime Directive is to keep from at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best replacing a civilization with a remake of ones own and at worse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plant the seeds of a civilization's destruction, sense of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointlessness or other serious malaise by becoming known at the wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way and in the wrong time.
</em><br>
<p>I understand the Prime Directive and I say that Captain Kirk could have 
<br>
helped a lot more people if he had dropped a few replicators on 
<br>
20th-Century-Earth-looking planets than if he had just ignored them.  
<br>
I'm aware that it's possible to do more harm than good, but 
<br>
anthropologists have come a long way in helping the people they study 
<br>
come towards the modern world.  I think that deciding the best course 
<br>
of action to help an underdeveloped civilization would be an easy task 
<br>
for an SI.
<br>
<p>Maybe a Singularity can't get here to help us.  Oh well, back to plan A.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I believe that civilizations, like individuals, sometiems need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make their own mistakes and learn from them or not.  It is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kindness to attempt to free them from having to struggle and learn.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This produces only a dependent person or civilization much too easily.
</em><br>
<p>Such changes are not always bad.  America was not brought up to its 
<br>
current level of technology by a more advanced country, yet it is 
<br>
highly dependent on the rest of the industrialized world.  Dependence 
<br>
is not necessarily a bad thing; it's a sign of an integrated system.  I 
<br>
think a large amount of strife comes from feeling that your tribe is 
<br>
much lower than it used to be because you are in a larger system of 
<br>
tribes than you used to be.
