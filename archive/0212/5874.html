<p>I think that issues of upgrading should be divorced from uploading.  If it 
<br>
turns out that what I really want, under my rules - which incidentally 
<br>
explicitly include allowances for sufficiently intelligent benevolent 
<br>
entities being allowed to extrapolate &quot;what I really want&quot; on my behalf - 
<br>
is a flash-upgrade to superintelligence, then I would expect uploading and 
<br>
upgrading to be the same process.  If it turns out that &quot;it's the journey, 
<br>
not the destination&quot;, then there's no reason why uploading (presumably a 
<br>
fast process) and upgrading (a process whose speed is determined by 
<br>
independent moral factors) would be the same physical operation or occur 
<br>
at around the same times.
<br>
<p>There's nothing special about the physical uploading process that makes it 
<br>
a uniquely important time for software upgrades; it's not analogous to, 
<br>
e.g., wanting to clean up and organize your stuff before moving to a new 
<br>
house.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also would not like to say to most people that we could make them much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter, stronger, longer-lived and so on but chose not to because we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were afraid of the consequences unless we built a FAI and let it figure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it out.  In the meantime humans can grovel in the mud.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  There are more risks than I once realized - the human brain is 
<br>
not as resilient as I once thought, when whacked with a nonancestral 
<br>
hammer - but even so I believe that if human enhancement technology 
<br>
becomes available, it should be used.
<br>
<p>Of course &quot;stronger&quot; and &quot;longer-lived&quot; are no-ops in Singularity 
<br>
scenarios, whatever their humanitarian benefits; &quot;smarter&quot; is the only 
<br>
part that could possibly be controversial.
