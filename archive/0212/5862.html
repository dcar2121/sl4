<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ is no longer defined as a ratio of mental to calendar age, and hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been for quite some time.  Today IQ is actually *defined as* a normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution, with, if I recall correctly, 16 IQ points being equal to one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard deviation.  That is, if you have an IQ of 132, it *means that*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your test scores are in a percentile two standard deviations from the
</em><br>
mean.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Don't put too much emphasis on IQ.  Here are a some reasons why  (I won't
<br>
explain the implications of many of these points, you are going to have to
<br>
figure these out on your own):
<br>
<p>1) It doesn't accurately depict the value of the large &quot;base&quot; intelligence
<br>
you get for merely being human.
<br>
<p>2) It is a relative measure.    A car is a car.  Some can go faster and some
<br>
can go slower.  But all travel at a pretty amazing pace relative to...
<br>
<p>3) Hard work often trumps IQ.  In my experience, it is a 80/20 split in
<br>
favor of hard work.
<br>
<p>4) Statistical measures of success (such as the stats that show people with
<br>
high IQs earn more money than people with low IQs) are biased due the fact
<br>
that IQ (SAT and GRE) is used as means of allocating scarce resources
<br>
(higher education at premium schools).   A genetic fallacy.  Coase would
<br>
have a field day here.
<br>
<p>5) Common sense is a better survival trait that a high IQ (I used to be a
<br>
pilot -- we are all a little Darwinian in our outlook).
<br>
<p>6) Education plays a major role in performance on IQ tests (oh, I have seen
<br>
this question before...)
<br>
<p>There are a lot more.
<br>
<p>Basically, this is an intro into why I think it is very difficult (nigh
<br>
impossible) to build an AI that is superior than a human (across the board).
<br>
There isn't a clear target to aim at, or a meaningful measure of success.
<br>
<p>I am much more in favor of IA and letting an entrepreneurial mind adapt to
<br>
the new tools that are made available.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>John Robb
