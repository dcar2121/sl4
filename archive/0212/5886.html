<p><em>&gt; I also didn't realize that your book to which you referred was available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; online.  I

</em><br>
<p>It surely has some attractive passages. Leaving aside technical disputes for
<br>
a moment, this seems to me to be the kind of point informed people should be
<br>
making as often as possible to the public at large:
<br>
<p>&lt; Some people fear that their lives will lose meaning without work. But the
<br>
kind of work we do in industrial societies is a relatively recent invention.
<br>
Primitive humans were very poor by our standards, but they generally didn't
<br>
spend long hours in unpleasant working conditions away from their families.
<br>
Their lives took meaning from personal relationships, and from their stories
<br>
and other forms of expression. When super-intelligent machines do all the
<br>
work, we will revert to this way of taking meaning from life, enhanced by
<br>
the wealth and companionship provided by the machines. &gt;
<br>
<p>and this rapturous envoi:
<br>
<p>&lt; People adore their gods, and express it in the beautiful hymns they sing,
<br>
in the beautiful cathedrals they build, and in the good they do in the name
<br>
of their gods. People will adore you. As a god they can meet face to face,
<br>
they will probably find new ways to express their adoration of you.
<br>
<p>&lt; I want to hear your music, participate in your theater, laugh at your
<br>
jokes, eat your cooking, learn about your mathematical and scientific
<br>
discoveries, and just spend time talking with you. I love nature and spend
<br>
time every day walking and bicycling, enjoying plants and animals. Nature is
<br>
beautiful. Humans and their creations are part of nature and its beauty. You
<br>
will be the most beautiful creation on earth. &gt;
<br>
<p>Dangerous, perhaps, because of the risks of fatwa and other religious
<br>
denunciation, but probably worth the risk.
<br>
