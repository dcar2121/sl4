<p>GO Abstract
<br>
<p>GO is a board game thought to be different from chess in many aspects,
<br>
most significantly in that GO emphasizes global strategy more than local
<br>
battle, a property very difficult for computer programs to emulate. To
<br>
investigate the neural basis of GO, functional magnetic resonance
<br>
imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activities of subjects engaged
<br>
in playing GO. Enhanced activations were observed in many cortical
<br>
areas, such as dorsal prefrontal, parietal, occipital, posterior
<br>
temporal, and primary somatosensory and motor areas. Quantitative
<br>
analysis indicated a modest degree of stronger activation in right
<br>
parietal area than in left. This type of right hemisphere lateralization
<br>
differs from the modest left hemisphere lateralization observed during
<br>
chess playing.
<br>
<p><p>Chess Abstract
<br>
<p>Chess is a game that involves many aspects of high level cognition and
<br>
requires sophisticated problem solving skills. However, there is little
<br>
understanding of the neural basis of chess cognition. This study
<br>
employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify
<br>
cortical areas that are active during the analysis of chess positions
<br>
compared with a spatial task with matched visual stimuli. Bilateral
<br>
activation was revealed in the superior frontal lobes, the parietal
<br>
lobes, and occipital lobes. Some small areas of activation were observed
<br>
unilaterally in the left hemisphere. The left hemisphere showed more
<br>
activation than the right. Results are discussed in relation to a
<br>
similar brain imaging study on the game Go.

<p>Michael Atherton's web site at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~athe0007/vita.html">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~athe0007/vita.html</a> provides more data.
<br>
<p>The goal of the current study is to identify the important cortical
<br>
areas in chess playing and compare their activation between novice and
<br>
advanced chess players. Chess playing is a mental process that involves
<br>
many aspects of cognitive functions. The study of chess playing at the
<br>
behavioral level has been important to our understanding of mental
<br>
operations in general problem solving and the development of expertise.
<br>
A detailed description of the cortical areas involved during chess
<br>
playing will no doubt help us to constrain theories of chess playing and
<br>
further our understanding of this unique human cognitive function.
<br>
Patterns of cortical activation of players of different levels of
<br>
sophistication were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging
<br>
(fMRI). Subjects were presented with mid-game positions and instructed
<br>
to select the best next move within 30 seconds. Cortical activation in
<br>
this condition was contrasted with periods when subjects viewed a blank
<br>
chessboard and chessboards with randomly placed pieces. To control for
<br>
subjects' eye movements and attentional level in the random condition,
<br>
subjects were asked to search for small low-contrast marks on some of
<br>
the chess pieces. The most consistent activation during chess playing
<br>
was found in the Inferior Parietal Lobule. This may reflect the demand
<br>
on spatial orientation during chess playing. Surprisingly, there was no
<br>
or very weak differential activation in the prefrontal cortex.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>So, he did do lots of MRI scans, but found nothing much in the
<br>
prefrontal cortex.
<br>
<p>But I suspect this could vary depending on the playing style/experience
<br>
of the player. As Tomaz said rules plus experience can save you a
<br>
ferocious amount of calculation. If you are calculating the position
<br>
from first principles every time you will be mentally exhausted at the
<br>
end of a game. In competitive chess, once you have memorised the normal
<br>
openings plus standard variations, you won't be calculating much at all
<br>
until the middle game. And then experienced players will know almost
<br>
instinctively what the next move should be. If you watch a master
<br>
strolling around playing a hundred simultaneous games, he is obviously
<br>
not calculating every move. Even if you deliberately play to complicate
<br>
the positions, it won't slow him down much. And he will still win almost
<br>
all the games.
<br>
Memory plays a big part in how chess masters win games.
<br>
When you have played so much chess that almost every position gives you
<br>
the 'deja vu' feeling of familiarity, then you play the same way that
<br>
you 'feel' you did before. Just a quick scan round the board to make
<br>
sure you are not overlooking something really stupid, then play.
