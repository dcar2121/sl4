<br>
<p>===
<br>
Visionary author Bruce Sterling views the future like no other writer. In
<br>
his first nonfiction book since his classic The Hacker Crackdown, Sterling
<br>
describes the world our children might be living in over the next fifty
<br>
years and what to expect next in culture, geopolitics, and business.
<br>
<p>Time calls Bruce Sterling &quot;one of America's best-known science fiction
<br>
writers and perhaps the sharpest observer of our media-choked culture
<br>
working today in any genre.&quot; Tomorrow Now is, as Sterling wryly describes
<br>
it, &quot;an ambitious, sprawling effort in thundering futurist punditry, in the
<br>
pulsing vein of the futurists I've read and admired over the years: H. G.
<br>
Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and Alvin Toffler; Lewis Mumford, Reyner Banham,
<br>
Peter Drucker, and Michael Dertouzos. This book asks the future two
<br>
questions: What does it mean? and How does it feel? &quot;
<br>
<p>Taking a cue from one of William Shakespeare's greatest soliloquies,
<br>
Sterling devotes one chapter to each of the seven stages of humanity: birth,
<br>
school, love, war, politics, business, and old age. As our children progress
<br>
through Sterling's Shakespearean life cycle, they will encounter new
<br>
products; new weapons; new crimes; new moral conundrums, such as cloning and
<br>
genetic alteration; and new political movements, which will augur the way
<br>
wars of the future will be fought.
<br>
<p>Here are some of the author's predictions:
<br>
<p>. Human clone babies will grow into the bitterest and surliest adolescents
<br>
ever.
<br>
. Microbes will be more important than the family farm.
<br>
. Consumer items will look more and more like cuddly, squeezable pets.
<br>
. Tomorrow's kids will learn more from randomly clicking the Internet than
<br>
they ever will from their textbooks.
<br>
. Enemy governments will be nice to you and will badly want your tourist
<br>
money, but global outlaws will scheme to kill you, loudly and publicly, on
<br>
their Jihad TVs.
<br>
. The future of politics is blandness punctuated with insanity.
<br>
The future of activism belongs to a sophisticated, urbane global network
<br>
that can make money-the Disney World version of Al Qaeda.
<br>
<p>Tomorrow Now will change the way you think about the future and our place in
<br>
it.
<br>

<p>I... don't *think* so...
