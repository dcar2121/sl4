<br>
<p>BG&gt; Thoughts?
<br>
<p>BG&gt; Can anyone with more neuro expertise tell me: Is this guy correct as regards
<br>
BG&gt; what is currently technologically plausible?
<br>
<p>INABS but the &quot;replace a neuron at a time&quot; strategy has been raised
<br>
before (I think _The Mind's I_ features one such scenario).  I don't
<br>
think isolating single &quot;brain functions&quot; is relevant with that method;
<br>
besides, as Michael Roy Ames points out there's more to mind than io.
<br>
<p>I'm a lot less sanguine than the author when he states that
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the technology to monitor and record all output and input
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a single neuron in vivo.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been done, and preliminary work with this technique has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shown that accurately modeling its responses to a given input is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the daunting task many thought it would be.  
<br>
<p>but as I said, INABS.  I just suspect that there may be subtle and
<br>
less subtle effects left out by such an approach, e.g. don't neural
<br>
connections grow/change when we &quot;learn&quot; stuff?  And how does the whole
<br>
hormonal / neurotransmitter thing figure into neuron-level brain
<br>
simulation?
<br>
<p>I'm also unclear on how this equals uploading.  If successful, the
<br>
procedure would result in having your brain running on somewhat more
<br>
durable hardware, but still interfaced with all that goopey organic
<br>
stuff so prone to decay and rot.  (And replacing that is a lot
<br>
trickier: I don't think we'd be able to handle the &quot;body shock&quot;
<br>
involved in moving to the much starker proprioceptive interfaces of
<br>
something on the level of say, ASIMO, we'd need to figure out that
<br>
nasty visual interface thing, etc.)
<br>
<p>So you end up walking around with a laptop in your backpack with a
<br>
thick cable plugged into your spine, or a Beowulf cluster on a
<br>
handle-free Segway rolling along behind you...while your body
<br>
continues to age and no drug can get you high ;)
<br>
<p>Overall, I suspect the author is overoptimistic in regards to what
<br>
current tech can do (in a real world full brain scenario, not a few
<br>
neurons in a lab), and there's nothing new about the basic strategy
<br>
he outlines.  His implication that amnesia is a 100% hardware problem
<br>
somehow typifies something about the whole approach that I don't know
<br>
quite the right word for, Technocratic?
