<p>I haven't read CFAI in a long time, but to me this doesn't make sense.
<br>
No-one owns anything. Ownership is a human, maybe even animal, concept
<br>
that is a strategy for the strong to get stronger and hence the weak to
<br>
get weaker, So long as everyone is playing the same ownership Game. A
<br>
hostile intelligence would use the ultimate divide and conquer strategy
<br>
to claim ownership of all. Why can't we just share the whole Universe,
<br>
and why should a &quot;strong&quot; being who has a higher tolerance for survival
<br>
with limited resources be given equal or more than a &quot;weaker&quot; being with
<br>
a lower tolerance?
<br>
<p>Semantically speaking, if an AI is going to be friendly to humans, it
<br>
should provide access to an abundance of resources, with no
<br>
over-consumption. Then maybe humans would learn to be friendly to each
<br>
other as well.
<br>
<p>To quote from the recent (terrible) /Spiderman/ movie, &quot;With power comes
<br>
great responsibility.&quot; A &gt;H AI (or sysop? Are we still using that term?)
<br>
that has &gt;H power will have responsibility, and humans will be the
<br>
benficiaries. Ownership will only create conflict. I know it sounds very
<br>
spiritual and philisophical, but there really is no law of nature that
<br>
includes ownership as a requirement for perpetuating life. It has caused
<br>
mostly problems for humans so far. I seriously doubt that an advanced
<br>
society would value ownership so highly.
<br>
<p>If I get my fair share of space, I'll share it with anyone who asks for
<br>
it and is friendly enough to do the same.
<br>
<p>cheers,
