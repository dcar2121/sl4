<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;The board games chess and GO take practice, not intellect, brain
</em><br>
scans
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of players suggest. Intelligence areas appear inactive when people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; puzzle over game strategy.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This study could in fact be valid if there were no flaws in their
<br>
methodology.  Have there been any other studies to confirm this.?
<br>
<p>Since I am a chess player let me offer the following observations. 
<br>
<p>When people are first learning chess they seem to struggle with first
<br>
remembering names of the piece and learning how the pieces move and
<br>
other simple misc rules of the game.  This activity involves rote
<br>
memorization.
<br>
<p>Once that phase has been mastered in the second phase players become
<br>
concerned with preventing their pieces from being captured and capturing
<br>
their opponents pieces in the next move.  This involves the self
<br>
discipline to force ones mind to spatially examine each piece of yours
<br>
and your opponents to identify which pieces may be taken and the cost of
<br>
taking the piece.
<br>
<p>In the third stage the users attempt to discipline their minds to look
<br>
more moves ahead and begin to form high level heuristics for strategy
<br>
such as control as many squares as you can etc...  
<br>
<p>And finally after much experience at playing, pattern recognition based
<br>
upon previous games that you've played becomes key in helping to
<br>
deciding where and how deeply to focus your attention.
<br>
<p>If the player is serious and has the motivation they may read and
<br>
memorize classical games based upon masters of the games.
<br>
<p>I would bet money that disproving the notion that excellent chess does
<br>
not require high intelligence would be as simple as giving IQ tests to
<br>
the ranking Chess masters and above and comparing their IQ scores to
<br>
lower ranked players who have also played the game seriously for a few
<br>
years.  I would be very surprised if there was not a high positive
<br>
correlation between IQ and their USCF Chess rating. 
<br>
<p>I would also think studying MRI's of a person learning chess and
<br>
progressing through the stages of learning would be very instructive.
<br>
It may be that as a person learns chess that some area of the brain
<br>
becomes hardwired so to speak for performing much of the pattern
<br>
recognition and looking ahead in the game.  That may be why the
<br>
cognition does not show up in the normal area of the brain where
<br>
thinking is normally observed.  Or intellect may have other components
<br>
within the brain that have not yet been discovered.
