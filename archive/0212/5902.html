Well, there's a lot to say and I don't have much time to type tonight...
<br>
<p>The most remarkable thing, I think, is the loss of the ordinary distinction
<br>
between voluntary &amp; involuntary...
<br>
<p>You're doing something, and it's not *exactly* as though you're &quot;possessed&quot;
<br>
by some other force who's controlling you (the &quot;divine inspiration&quot; idea),
<br>
yet it's also not much like ordinary conscious thinking, where you proceed
<br>
step by step and are aware of the choices you're making and the boundaries
<br>
between one decision and the next.  One act flows into the next which flows
<br>
into the next, as if there's a larger pattern into which each of your acts
<br>
fits, and which is guiding your actions....  &quot;Happiness&quot; isn't quite
<br>
right -- the visceral sense of pleasure may rise and fall during the
<br>
experience but isn't a key part of it --
<br>
<p>of course, this state has fuzzy boundaries.  Sometimes it's not much more
<br>
than &quot;being really on a roll with what you're doing&quot; and other times it can
<br>
verge on a mystical ecstatic state...
<br>
<p>others have written about such things at greater length and with more
<br>
eloquence!!  Alas, I must now go and unpack some more boxes; we just moved
<br>
into a new house.  At least my oft-neglected flesh container will get some
<br>
exercise ;-&gt;

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben , would you mind telling me more about your experiences with that
<br>
state ? It fascinates me !!!!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you =)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the &quot;flow&quot; state you're talking about, but I've never experienced
<br>
it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while playing chess or any other game...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can get there improvising music, writing, or doing math, or very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occasionally programming...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to have a mastery of the details sufficient that even abstract,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult combinations of details are &quot;automated&quot; for you.  Then you can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think, create, act in terms of wholes rather than details...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most humans don't get into this state *ever*, and most of
<br>
us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can access it sometimes, can only access it for certain types of
<br>
tasks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or in certain circumstances.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to get into a &quot;flow&quot; state in a wider variety of
<br>
circumstances
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and contexts will be one of the advantages of having a mind that's more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully adaptive and self-modifiable (such as an AI mind, an uploaded
<br>
mind, or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a neuro-digital hybrid mind).
