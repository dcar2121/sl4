<em>&gt; We don't know how to do these things.  Sure, we might currently be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to identify the particular nerve-bundles that operate a person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right arm and monitor them, but there is a lot more to controlling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your right arm than just the nerve bundles and the signals that get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed along them.  A *lot* more.  Creating a right-arm-signaling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model based on this monitoring is, IMO, plausible.  But that model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would bear little relationship to the existing wetware functionality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its myriad connections to everything else.  The brain/mind is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely described by its I/O.  There is a lot going on in my brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that never produces more than a raised eye-brow or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not worth the time to read.

<p>You're probably right about the URL -- it was a bit too frivolous to forward
<br>
to the list -- sorry!
<br>
<p>However, &quot;The brain/mind is not solely described by its I/O&quot; does bring up
<br>
an interesting point.
<br>
<p>The guy's idea is not that the brain/mind is solely described by its I/O,
<br>
it's rather that *each brain subsystem* is solely defined by its I/O.  The
<br>
I/O of a brain subsystem, in  most cases, involves signals that originate &amp;
<br>
terminate within the brain and never see the outside world or the rest of
<br>
the body....
<br>
<p>If we recorded the I/O of each brain subsystem over a period of time, and
<br>
built a model of this I/O, then we *might* be able to piece these together
<br>
to make a digital replica of the brain.  [The idea of reimplanting
<br>
digitally-replicated subsystems into the functioning brain opens up a whole
<br>
other can of worms, obviously.]   The time period would have to be long
<br>
enough to ensure that we were capturing the learning/adaptation behavior of
<br>
the brain subsystem, not just its steady-state behavior at a given point in
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Of course, the viability of doing this brain-subsystem recording in a
<br>
nondestructive way is another issue entirely...
