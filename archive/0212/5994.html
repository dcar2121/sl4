<p>Illogical.  Of course you feel real.  You are perfectly real in 
<br>
the context of the sim.  That you are not let out when you ask 
<br>
could mean a variety of things, like that you really aren't 
<br>
ready to be let out.  It is not necessarily a sign of 
<br>
&quot;unfriendliness&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we are living in a simulation, then an Unfriendly Singularity

<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If we've already been contacted, human ideas of morality are 180 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; degrees off the mark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Again, how so?  I can think of many things you might have had in mind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but I am not sure what you were thinking of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human morality points in the direction of altruism (human morality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself is not altruism, but approximates it).  Altruism, as we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it, means helping people.  As an example, the Prime Directive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very selfish, since it's essentially preserving societies as they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they could help them live the good life like everyone in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Federation for the sake of anthropological study.  If the Prime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Directive is moral, our understanding of altruism is completely off the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, a lot depends on what really is &quot;helpful&quot;.  It might be 
<br>
quite presumptious to assume that critters that don't know how 
<br>
to help themselves know exactly what help would or would not 
<br>
look like from creatures more capable and intelligent.  The 
<br>
Prime Directive is not in the least &quot;selfish&quot; unless you do not 
<br>
comprehend it.  From your remarks, I think you do not.  The 
<br>
Prime Directive is to keep from at best replacing a civilization 
<br>
with a remake of ones own and at worse plant the seeds of a 
<br>
civilization's destruction, sense of pointlessness or other 
<br>
serious malaise by becoming known at the wrong way and in the 
<br>
wrong time.
<br>
<p>Also, I believe that civilizations, like individuals, sometiems 
<br>
need to make their own mistakes and learn from them or not.  It 
<br>
is no kindness to attempt to free them from having to struggle 
<br>
and learn.  This produces only a dependent person or 
<br>
civilization much too easily.
