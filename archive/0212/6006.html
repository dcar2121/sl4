But I counter that the singularity arrived long ago
<br>
and it is friendly. And you DID get out. At least one
<br>
of you. (kinda like the multiple bens) But the AGI has
<br>
very high morals such that it couldn’t just pull you
<br>
and everyone else out who wanted out without seriously
<br>
hurting those who don’t want out and want things to be
<br>
left pretty much as they are. So it left a copy of you
<br>
here to protect those other people. You just happen to
<br>
be the copy that was left behind. Of course IT can’t
<br>
be leaving knowledge of its contact with anyone or
<br>
else that too would ruin it for those who want nothing
<br>
to do with the singularity, which is why you can’t
<br>
remember the contact. You are here to protect the
<br>
feelings of those who know and love you. So be happy
<br>
because (at least one of) you is having a great time
<br>
in the post singularity era.
<br>
<p>Think of the movie “It’s a wonderful life” as a guide
<br>
to how many people you would affect by being suddenly
<br>
snubbed out. After being presented with such evidence
<br>
you decided to leave a copy behind.
<br>
<p>Of course there are people who absolutely insist that
<br>
no copy be left behind. It was that pointless
<br>
unfortunate car accident ...
