Dear Gordon,
<br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>He he!  I'll bet it does get you in trouble ;&gt;  But not from me 8^)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I argue that you are not looking closely enough at your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind.  I am not a big fan of dogs.  I'm not scared of them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'm not going to keep one in my house.  When I see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puppy or any dog I don't really feel like it's cute.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same time, I can tell that there is part of my brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;cute cute cute&quot; even though other parts of my brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are overriding it enough that its influence can be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle and difficult to notice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ahh.  The scenario of 'looking at part of my brain' is familiar.  To
<br>
me it is part of considering different points of view, or modelling
<br>
different mind-states.  Indeed I do it all the time.  However, if
<br>
someone were to ask me: &quot;Do you consider X beautiful&quot; I can usually
<br>
give them a truthful answer in short order.  I do not have to 'hedge'
<br>
by saying: &quot;Well part of me thinks X is a bit too yellow, and another
<br>
part of me loves the yellowness of it&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, if you really truly do not have anything in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain saying that puppies or babies are cute, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your brain may be broken in that respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>One being's break may be another beings advantage.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as your brain is concerned, it's anything that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to sense and might seek out to sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I agree with that:  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, not many people will refuse members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their kin group food (note that there is some cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence as to how large you actively consider your kin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group, but it's usually several levels out, even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America).  Also, there are ethics concerning how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharing you'll permit, even with kin groups.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of support hinges on the degree of relatedness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a person is related too little, you might even refuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have heard this argument before, and have observed that it closely
<br>
corresponds to how humans behave *generally speaking*.  However, this
<br>
behaviour may change for individuals who understand EP and take it to
<br>
heart.  Such a person might say to themselves: &quot;I am genetically
<br>
programmed to decide this way... but is it in my best interest?  Does
<br>
it still make sense?&quot;  Sometimes I ask these questions to myself, and
<br>
find that the answer is: No - not in my best interest, and doesn't
<br>
make sense.  Does that mean my mind is broken?  I think not.  Newly
<br>
'patched' perhaps. ;)
