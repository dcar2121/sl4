<em>&gt; 1) Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of &quot;polyphonic reality&quot; (introduced in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis of Dostoevskian fiction).  Polyphonic reality is a kind of reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inbetween objective &amp; subjective reality -- a reality composed of multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations, all interpreting each other...
</em><br>
<p>I did some brief Googling about this, e.g. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/yazdanpour/y-ch2.htm">http://www.geocities.com/yazdanpour/y-ch2.htm</a> . From what I understand, this is 
<br>
more or less equivalent to what I called co-realities, with the reader's mind 
<br>
existing in a super-reality. In practical terms what this means is that any 
<br>
intelligence that is operating in these realities at either of these two levels 
<br>
can only cognize or recognize elements of the reality that they are in that are 
<br>
translated or projected into the observed reality, which is always derived from 
<br>
your current reality. Characters represented in the narration in a polyphonic 
<br>
novel cannot possibly comprehend what is taking place from the other realities, 
<br>
only the reader of the polyphonic novel can. Programmers creating an artificial 
<br>
intelligence in the computer's reality of digital computation, but the computer 
<br>
on it's own cannot understand the programmer's reality, without some sort of 
<br>
technology provided by the programmer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) Some theories of quantum-electrodynamics in curved spacetime (one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many not quite successful approaches to grand unified physics).  In these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories, different observers in different reference frames may literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceive different realities: a particle may be existent in one observer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, but nonexistent in another's.  (This is a much stronger kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativity than one finds in special or general relativity theory proper.)
</em><br>
<p>Interesting, but it is still a defined subset of realities that can exist in 
<br>
what I think of as the Universe or omniverse. In my meta-reality definition, 
<br>
its purpose would be to derive sub-realities from it but designing them to 
<br>
allow information to be translated from one reality to another.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The idea of &quot;finding aliens everywhere&quot; once we can perceive alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realities, is related to my idea that when minds (e.g. AI's) become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently intelligent, they may find a way to access domains of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond our physical universe (or beyond the concept of &quot;physical universe&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altogether).
</em><br>
<p>I think you are correct in this statement, and the solution to finding the way 
<br>
across domains or realities i.e. from humans to digital computers, is to either 
<br>
define a mapping to translate events that can be parsed forward and back (the 
<br>
hard way), or understand the process of how humankind learns stuff and program 
<br>
that into the digital computer and let it run, i.e. seed AI. Although this is 
<br>
easier to do, we still don't have the communication tools or languages, formal 
<br>
or informal, to fully express this process although some humans are much better 
<br>
than it than others of course.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I tried once to create a unified physics theory in which each particle is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewed as the Feynman sum of &quot;every possible subjective reality's view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that particle.&quot;  I never finished formulating the theory, and decided that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to create &quot;real AI&quot; was a more critical way for me to spend my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time...
</em><br>
<p>On a slightly personal note, how much knowledge have you personally gained from 
<br>
watching and teaching your own children from babies, and in what ways has this 
<br>
affected your work in learning processes? Also, I will not dare to assume that 
<br>
studying the learning processes can only be done by observing babies, but also 
<br>
old people, and even senile people.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
