<em>&gt; [...] after humans meet super-intelligent machines they will want to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligent themselves [...] Human values are mostly self-interest. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social animals humans have some more altruistic values,
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I wish I had the exact quote at hand, but in Ridley's &quot;The Origins of Virtue&quot;
<br>
he emphasized that it's _among peers_ that cooperation and non-zero sum
<br>
interactions really pay off for the individuals, even when they are greedy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't ever want to be a non-peer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very powerful humans can transcend social pressure....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Society has a gradual [...] long-term trend toward equality...
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You made some good points.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As social animals humans have some more altruistic values, but these mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depend on social pressure.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Implying we didn't create these social pressures on our own?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the solution is to make alteration of reinforcement learning values a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary condition for granting a human super-intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see this flying.  I certainly wouldn't accept it.  Maybe I will when
<br>
I get to 'almost-super' intelligence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that the combination of super-intelligence and human values is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think right now, with an unaltered learning system, the average person
<br>
has the _capacity_ to handle super-intelligence without being destructive?  I'm
<br>
not asking if you think it's likely or not, just if the average person were
<br>
raised in the perfect environment, perfect parents, perfect culture, perfect
<br>
schools, etc etc, could they handle super intelligence?  And would a super
<br>
intelligent society be able to create that perfect cultural environment?  That
<br>
is, would it all be self stabilizing?  Or do you think the brain has
<br>
fundamental, insurmountable, physical flaws as it stands now?  I'm not saying
<br>
improvements wouldn't help, I'm just objecting to the prospect of more
<br>
hardwired CONSTRAINTS on how and what we think.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This may provide a way to increase human intelligence before we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it works
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As others here have said many times, it's the transitions that will be
<br>
painful and risky.
