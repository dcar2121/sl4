Michael,
<br>
<p>I think this is a great direction to be thinking in, and a good .5'th
<br>
draft..
<br>
<p>Now a few specific comments..
<br>
<p>I think that everything up thru section 13 in your document could be done
<br>
fairly straightforwardly by a genetic programming system with a reasonable
<br>
number of training examples and a reasonable amount of processing power.  By
<br>
&quot;reasonable&quot; I mean: Hundreds of training examples for each game, and
<br>
perhaps a few dozen machines of processing power.
<br>
<p>Where things get a bit more interesting is with your idea of games to teach
<br>
conditionals, loops and so forth.  But this part of the document is very
<br>
sketchy, and I'm looking forward to seeing some details and examples of this
<br>
stuff in the next draft...  For all the games prior to this algorithmic
<br>
stuff, I see nothing that distinguishes AGI systems from machine learning
<br>
algorithms that learn rules based on training examples.  [Note that it is
<br>
precisely the &quot;microworld&quot; nature of the tasks that will, I conjecture,
<br>
allow simple ML algorithms to do very well on them.]
<br>
<p>I'd like to see more tests specifically intended to require *abstract*
<br>
learning.  For instance, suppose one teaches a system to do arithmetic in
<br>
bases 2 and 5.  Does it then learn more quickly how to do arithmetic in base
<br>
4, if given some training examples?  I.e., when being taught arithmetic in a
<br>
number of bases, at what point does it shift from learning a separate model
<br>
of arithmetic in each base, to learning a general model of basal arithmetic
<br>
with a &quot;base&quot; parameter as an input?  Probably more tests could be
<br>
formulated along these lines....
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: Curriculum for AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let the games begin!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few weeks ago I started trying to put together a teaching curriculum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Friendly AI.  After making a couple abortive attempts, I realized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (even more than before) that there was one hell of a lot of things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI needed to learn before ve could understand the first thing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly content.  So, I punted the idea of Friendly content up a level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or five), and attempted to figure out how to teach an AI what it needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to know before that.  I created some lesson outlines, game descriptions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching goals and microdomain definitions.  I now have about 40 pages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of (rather incomplete) notes.  They could easily be fleshed-out to 240
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pages... but... before doing that perhaps I should take a reality-check.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are links to three formats of the notes:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; HTML - Readable stuff starts after a long table of contents.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; RTF (Works with Abiword)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Described within is one way (out of many) to teach an AI from 'scratch'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The teaching format may seem a little restrictive or 'constrained', but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I made it that way so programming an automated teacher would be fast and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The basic idea is to teach an AI through the playing of games.  Starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with very simple games, and gradually getting more complex.  By playing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the games in various microworlds it is intended that the AI build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety of concepts without being overwhelmed with complexity.  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts can then be applied to real-world real-time data, and could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to acquire a small subset of human language (and various other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills).  Education through game playing... hey, it works for kids!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What problems do you see with this approach?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Comments, new game ideas, and new microdomain ideas welcome.
