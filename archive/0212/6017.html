<p><p>I don't know anything about your application, but couldn't a properly

threaded app handle this with a single process image plus a little context

<br>
<p>$750/month for what?  That much money will get you a few Mbps (not even
<br>
oversubscribed) on a GigE fiber backbone and rackspace around here (and many
<br>
other parts of the country).  And these are at standard commercial rates for
<br>
a dedicated circuit straight to the core, not preferential rates or with
<br>
looser SLAs.  It sounds like you are getting ripped on prices.
<br>
<p>What are you looking for precisely?  Go ahead and respond offline, but I
<br>
might be able to help you out.  I am an original principal at one of the
<br>
fastest growing top-tier network providers in the world currently (and
<br>
attracting a good amount of buzz both for our network performance and the
<br>
fact that they are making money and growing while everyone else goes
<br>
bankrupt).  This is one of my investments that I am actively involved in on
<br>
a weekly basis among other things, so I can personally see what they could
<br>
do for you.  They continue to be exceptionally price competitive for what
<br>
they offer.
<br>
<p>[ /OFFTOPIC ]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Note the mam(m){a|e}l in the pattern allows mammal to be spelled mamel, mamal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammal, or mammel to allow for common misspellings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An additional Levenschtein distance calculation is also used if a less common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misspelling is encountered and the pattern does not match pattern 1.
</em><br>
<p><p>This seems like a very brittle way of doing things.  A smart system should
<br>
be able to automatically read through misspellings based on the context of
<br>
the entire sentence.  It makes for vastly smaller memory and computational
<br>
requirements than trying to exhaustively search some arbitrary parameter
<br>
space.  Statistical methods would be better here, but you'd need a pretty
<br>
clever data structure to make such searches efficient.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some such as the pattern for greetings can run 2400 characters in length to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomadate all of the various ways of greeting a person.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm guessing that if you efficiently compressed all those greetings you are
<br>
testing for, it would take less than 2400 characters (or 4800 bytes, since
<br>
you are probably storing Unicode using .NET), probably by a fair margin.
<br>
Not that this is particularly important to you, but there is a theoretical
<br>
notion buried in there.  I realize that what you are doing is mostly chatbot
<br>
type stuff, but it seems incredibly exhausting, both in time and resources
<br>
to try and scale this.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
