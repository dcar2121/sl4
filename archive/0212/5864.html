<em>&gt; Basically, this is an intro into why I think it is very difficult (nigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible) to build an AI that is superior than a human (across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the board).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There isn't a clear target to aim at, or a meaningful measure of success.
</em><br>
<p>This strikes me as a rather silly argument.  The fact that &quot;superiority&quot; is
<br>
subjective is no reason that we can't build AI's that have vastly superior
<br>
intelligence to humans in many meaningful senses.
<br>
<p>Are cars and trains &quot;better&quot; than horse-drawn carriages?  Are planes
<br>
&quot;better&quot; than birds?
<br>
<p>Is human intelligence superior to dog intelligence?  Perhaps dog
<br>
intelligence is superior in some senses.  It may be superior at finding
<br>
other dogs to mate with, for example....
<br>
<p>The vagueness of the word &quot;superior&quot; should be dealt with by proposing
<br>
particular, contextually-meaningful measures of superiority.
<br>
<p>I can define a lot of meaningful measures of &quot;superior intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>For example, if I can create a program that can:
<br>
<p>1) Prove any mathematical theorem from the math research literature (without
<br>
being shown the proof)
<br>
<p>2) Figure out how to modify humans (via genetics and/or pharmacology and/or
<br>
nanotech) so that humans don't age.
<br>
<p>3) Create a molecular assembler a la Dreyfus
<br>
<p>4) Create original music that the majority of humans find extremely
<br>
emotionally moving
<br>
<p>5) Effectively manage a team of people working on a project via e-mail and
<br>
chat communication
<br>
<p>6) Interact with humans in a way that makes many humans feel positively
<br>
spiritually touched
<br>
<p>7) Formulate a unified theory of the four known physical forces
<br>
<p>8) Defeat any human in all games of mental skill
<br>
<p>9) Perform surgical operations on humans with more skill than any human
<br>
<p>10) Operate mobile robots that drive cars, fly airplanes and spaceships, and
<br>
climb mountains
<br>
<p><p>then I will rate this program as having &quot;superior general intelligence&quot; to a
<br>
human.  Perhaps you don't agree with this list of goals [of course, the
<br>
details could be modified], but it's certainly clear and meaningful....
<br>
<p>If you don't agree that this constitutes &quot;superior intelligence&quot;, it doesn't
<br>
really matter to me.  You can go along [choosing to have your life extended
<br>
by this program's inventions, perhaps!] thinking that your intelligence is
<br>
superior or equal to its.  I'll bet it won't be too concerned with your
<br>
interpretation of the human concept of &quot;superiority&quot; either ;)
<br>
