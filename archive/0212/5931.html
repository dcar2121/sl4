<p>
Will a FAI develop a sense of self preservation and self interest?  It
<br>
seems prudent from an evolutionary perspective to insure an organism
<br>
does not engage in risky behavior for no reason thereby risking it's
<br>
very existence.  Such as radically altering it's own code with out doing
<br>
a backup :)
<br>
<p>If so, imagine a scenario where a group of Luddites attempt to get
<br>
legislation passed that would in fact turn off the AI.  The AI would of
<br>
course know about this from its daily scan of the internet.  
<br>
If self preservation was higher on it's list of goals than it's goal to
<br>
preserve human life or obey laws made by man then it would be reasonable
<br>
to expect it to do everything within it's means to insure it's continued
<br>
existence.  In this case conducting electronic attacks on it's attackers
<br>
via Email, electronic falsification of records that would implicate or
<br>
otherwise tie up its attackers.  And if it had been replicated into into
<br>
robots, cars, houses, etc... and kept communication with it's brothers
<br>
then it could have the physical apparatus to enact self-defense as well.
<br>
<p>Please don't get the idea that I am against FAI. Quite the contrary, but
<br>
I like to play devils advocate in order to insure the proper safeguards
<br>
will be in place protecting the FAIs from the fear of the Luddites.
<br>
Variations of this topic have of course been done to death in science
<br>
fiction but to just say FAIs will be nice, warm and fuzzy all the time
<br>
without the architecture in place to keep them that way will leave the
<br>
entire field open to harsh cross-examination.
