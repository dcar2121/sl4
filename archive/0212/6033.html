<p>This seems to be the key, here.  What's listed in CFAI is probably 
<br>
*Eliezer's* best idea of what an FAI might do in this situation.  
<br>
Although Eliezer's ideas are probably closer to what might actual 
<br>
happen than, say, George Bush's ideas, they are still a far cry from an 
<br>
accurate portrayal of the future.  As such, certainly you have a point, 
<br>
but the point is that Eliezer's idea has a hole (and I take it you 
<br>
don't see how to patch the hole either, but it's still good to point it 
<br>
out).  Maybe there's no way to do it and there's nothing immoral about 
<br>
personal resource differences.  Maybe minds won't even own personal 
<br>
resources as they do today, possibly making the point moot (e.g. the 
<br>
Singularity is a big time-share system, like Unix).
<br>
<p>At any rate, it's an interesting question, but, as you seem to 
<br>
understand, it's not really a decision we get to make; it's a decision 
<br>
our creation gets to make (so we need to make it a good, moral one).
