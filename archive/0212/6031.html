<em>&gt;I strongly believe that during AGI proof-of-concept development, it is

crucial that we not only look at what the system accomplishes, but *how* it
<br>
does it - i.e. the design's construct validity.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;

<em>&gt;One of the really difficult issues is designing these development programs

without embodying too much of the designer's specific AGI theory/
<br>
architecture.
<br>
<p><p><p>Hi Michael et al,
<br>
<p>I have had a look at your doc. Two issues, IMO:
<br>
<p>Issue a. Learner Type
<br>
-------------------------------------
<br>
The issue of 'intuition' and other comments in the doc about pre-configured
<br>
knowledge indicates that there is something in need of more attention. Can I
<br>
suggest explicitly recognising it? The choices are roughly classes like
<br>
'shock levels' :-)
<br>
<p>1) Automaton. Fixed learning about X,Y,Z...No training.
<br>
2) Learner. Learns X,Y,Z.....
<br>
3) Meta Learner. Learns to learn X,Y,Y....
<br>
4) Meta-Meta Learner. This machine is Eliezer's  SL4 self-modifying
<br>
subliming beastie! Perfoms brain surgery on itself. Too hard for my poor
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>The assumption in the given training course is class 2). At least it appears
<br>
to be. In my rough personal view of things, Class 2 is an AI and Class 3 is
<br>
an AGI. I hold that that the training of class 3) is a whole different thing
<br>
to class 2).  A class 3 embodied AGI goes to Montessori (eg edelman's
<br>
roaming block eater NOMAD? at the neurosciences institute). A somewhat
<br>
different learning regime.
<br>
<p>Issue b. The symbol grounding issue:
<br>
----------------------------------
<br>
&quot;Symbol grounding will occur when the AI connects an internal model with
<br>
external reality....&quot;
<br>
<p>Are you sure your procedure actually does that? There is an assumption that
<br>
the nature of the sensor, connection and relation to computational substrate
<br>
are irrelevant. I would hold that the grounding, in the assumed AI of the
<br>
training course, is not in the AI at all, but in the human observers of it.
<br>
=========================================
<br>
So....
<br>
<p>&quot;&gt; What problems do you see with this approach?&quot;
<br>
<p>Like Peter, I see assumptions (in the intro) that belie an implicit and
<br>
specific philosophical/design position. Renamed, say, &quot;Training for a Class
<br>
2) , Human-grounded unembodied AI&quot;, it would recognise context but doesn't
<br>
achieve much else except to let the readers doing class 3 with embodiment to
<br>
look elsewhere in a more generalised training standard - another chapter in
<br>
a future version of your training program, perhaps. Some sort of calibrated
<br>
teaching/testing in each classification has to be a good thing for design
<br>
comparisons.
<br>
<p>I hope this is of some use.
<br>
<p>That's my US$0.02 = A$0.04ish. A bargain! :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers to you all for Y2K+3.
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
<p><p>Colin Hales
