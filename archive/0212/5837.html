<p><em>&gt; I think many people, especially intellectuals, can be seduced by the meme of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealism.  The idealist (or Platonic) concept that information (or Forms)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precede material manifestation is very attractive to people whose lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolve around theorizing, computation, and programming.  Many philosophers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematicians and logicians succumb to this point of view (Raymond Smullyan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Saul Kripke, for instance).  Some physicists do, too (e.g., Frank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tipler).
</em><br>
<p>If that isn't shocking, then I don't know what is.  I don't
<br>
quite understand how extensive is your idea of information
<br>
or forms *preceding* material manifestation.  To be sure,
<br>
however, I fall into the class of people possibly seduced.
<br>
Do you not admit that the constraints that appear to restrict
<br>
matter to certain patterns, forms, is universal?  For example,
<br>
mathematical constraints limit the possibilities, or properties,
<br>
that many physical systems can evolve to.  (A concrete example
<br>
is a TM that searches for 4 integers satisfying Fermat's Last
<br>
Theorem.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Life, the universe and everything may be implementable on a variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different material platforms under a range of different physical parameters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But they cannot be implemented without SOME material platform.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so it seems, and I'd be willing to wager on it
<br>
continuing to be found to be true for any finite
<br>
period of time in the future.
<br>
<p>Mitchell Porter had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think our contemporary attempts to make a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information ontology are going to require a [] compromise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with materialism before they get off the ground.
</em><br>
<p>We can search for some explanatory links between physics
<br>
on the one hand, and mathematics and its constraints (that
<br>
I spoke of above) on the other.  Somehow it does seem that
<br>
one depends on the other, or they depend on each other.
<br>
People will IMO long search for an understanding of how
<br>
physical reality gives rise to mathematical reality, or
<br>
vice-versa (as one of those seduced physicists---Tegmark
<br>
---likes to postulate).
<br>
<p>But just as Mike LaTorra stated in another post in this
<br>
thread, there is no guarantee that results will ever be
<br>
forthcoming---we should reject the idea that there *must*
<br>
be discoverable causal relations between them.  Perhaps
<br>
some things do need to be accepted empirically.
