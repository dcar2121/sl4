</em><br>
<p>No, it's bad pop-science reporting of something which may or may not be
<br>
rubbish.  The point at which I started laughing was:
<br>
<p>&quot;Chess is considered one of the most mentally taxing of pursuits. And the
<br>
Chinese game GO, in which players use stones to ring-fence territory on a
<br>
grid, is thought to be on a cerebral par.&quot;
<br>
<p>Go *on a par* with chess?  Yeah, right.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Two things immediately occur to me:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 1) Gee, I guess we don't have that fine-grained an understanding of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; where the &quot;intelligence areas&quot; are yet.
</em><br>
<p>But the reporter doesn't know that.  I think it's possible to tell, from
<br>
the reporter's article, that someone did an investigation involving the
<br>
g-factor, chess and Go, and (possibly) some kind of neuroimaging, and that
<br>
the result of this investigation was that the researchers didn't find a
<br>
correlation they expected to find.  I've never heard of a link between
<br>
g-factor and the activation of specific brain areas under functional
<br>
neuroimaging, and it's hard to see what kind of link could possibly be
<br>
established.  So my guess is that the original research involved
<br>
tests of the correlation between g-factor and Chess/go ability, possibly
<br>
*within* ranked players rather than between players and non-players.
<br>
(After all, testing ranked players relative to the rest of the population
<br>
might merely uncover the fact that, e.g., only intellectually oriented
<br>
people tend to gravitate to chess or Go.)  I'm not clear where the
<br>
neuroimaging would come in, or even whether there was any neuroimaging at
<br>
all or just the reporter imagining things, but my guess is that if
<br>
neuroimaging was done, it failed to light some areas that light during
<br>
g-factor tests, or else it simply showed lateralization and had nothing to
<br>
do with the g-factor part of the study.
<br>
<p>Alternatively the original study may have only involved neuroimaging,
<br>
which failed to show as much lighting of the prefrontal cortex as the
<br>
researchers expected, and everything else is the reporter's invention.
<br>
It's hard to see why anyone would do a simultaneous study of Chess and Go
<br>
involving independent tests of g-factor AND functional neuroimaging -
<br>
offhand I'd expect it to be one or the other.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; 2) There are a lot of different aspects of intelligence.  When playing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; speed chess, for instance, it might be true that not that much &quot;deep
</em><br>
<em> &gt; thinking&quot; activity is going on during the game.  But the thinking
</em><br>
<em> &gt; activity has gone on beforehand, creating the knowledge that's being
</em><br>
<em> &gt; accessed during play.  The thinking has gone on during prior games,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; during reading about chess and studying games, and unconsciously at
</em><br>
<em> &gt; various times during waking and sleep...
</em><br>
<p>Incidentally, I don't find it too hard to believe that variance between
<br>
ranked Go players is not much correlated with g-factor, and that while Go
<br>
aesthetic perceptions are trained by &quot;deep thinking&quot;, the application of
<br>
those learned aesthetics is a more specialized function.
