<p>I feel like I am very real.  While I have not tried myself (though I 
<br>
probably should), Eliezer has asked to be let out and no answer came.  
<br>
This leads me to believe that we are not living in a Friendly 
<br>
simulation.
<br>
<p>If we are living in a simulation, then an Unfriendly Singularity 
<br>
occurred, in which case I wouldn't put to much faith in being still 
<br>
around when the simulation ends.  So, in my opinion, if this is a 
<br>
simulation, we're out of luck.

<p><em>&gt;&gt;  If we've already been contacted, human ideas of morality are 180

</em><br>
<p>Human morality points in the direction of altruism (human morality 
<br>
itself is not altruism, but approximates it).  Altruism, as we 
<br>
understand it, means helping people.  As an example, the Prime 
<br>
Directive is very selfish, since it's essentially preserving societies 
<br>
as they are when they could help them live the good life like everyone 
<br>
in the Federation for the sake of anthropological study.  If the Prime 
<br>
Directive is moral, our understanding of altruism is completely off the 
<br>
mark.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Sure, it's depressing that civilizations might blow themselves up all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the time, but that doesn't make it less likely to be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another possibility is that civilizations that don't blow themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up act a good bit differently after Singularity than most of our idas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how we would act.  For all I know that might be quite localized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in more inward turning or busy with some fascinating problem that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't require or support widespread travel.  The Fermi Paradox 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hinges on alleged civilizations not acting like we believe such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization owuld act.
</em><br>
<p>This is still what I said before:  we're too far away from other 
<br>
Singularities to notice if they exist.
<br>
<p>I think a very likely possibility is that a Singularity has happened 
<br>
far away in the Universe and the probes being sent to help the rest of 
<br>
the Universe haven't reached us yet.
