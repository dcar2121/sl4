<p>As a person with broken empathy circuits (not missing, just broken), 
<br>
faking emphatic reactions is sometimes necessary.  I say broken because 
<br>
sometimes I feel empathy, but it's not generally when appropriate, like 
<br>
when a member of my kin group dies or is sick or gets a new job.  
<br>
Usually it's only the first time I read or watch a great book or movie 
<br>
that I'll feel empathy for some of the characters.  I haven't, however, 
<br>
done anything radically bad for my genes, so I seem to be getting along 
<br>
fine without it.
<br>
<p>The point is moot, though.  Empathy is a complex adaption that evolved 
<br>
over millions of years in response to situations arising from living in 
<br>
kin groups.  In a sense, empathy is coming to morality backwards 
<br>
(trying different kinds of behavior until you find one that works 
<br>
well).  An FAI would, rather, find what is moral first and then behave 
<br>
in ways that follow those morals.  If empathy was the best class of 
<br>
emotions that it could develop to do this, then that's what it would do.
<br>
<p>BTW, if you've been wondering what anthropomorphic thinking, is, this 
<br>
is a perfect example.  Humans evolved in a certain environment and are 
<br>
adapted to that environment.  An FAI is designed (at first by humans 
<br>
and later by itself) to converge on normative altruism.
