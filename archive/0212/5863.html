<p>Hard work is important, but there are some mental skills necessary to 
<br>
accomplish certain tasks.  For example, you can't do algebra (well, 
<br>
anyway) until you are able to intuitively understand the abstraction of 
<br>
a variable.  No amount of hard work will help you solve for x in a 
<br>
complex system of equations if you still aren't comfortable working 
<br>
with variables.  The American education system generally doesn't teach 
<br>
algebra until you are mentally developed enough to understand 
<br>
variables, but if you ever encountered it at a young age, there's a 
<br>
good chance you were completely lost because variable was an idea you 
<br>
couldn't get a grasp on.
