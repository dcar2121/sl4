<em>&gt; &gt; The views bundled into SSSM may have been moderately common,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but far from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consensus.  Reality is rarely as cleanly defined as our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retrospective models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is the an implicit claim that there was no consensus model,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuzzy as it may be at the edges, in the social sciences?
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Social sciences&quot; is a big category, the different social sciences are quite
<br>
different culturally as well as conceptually
<br>
<p>I know that there was no consensus model in sociology in the 60's and early
<br>
70's.  Rather, it was a time of upheaval, with a bunch of old conservatives
<br>
battling a bunch of young Marxists.
<br>
<p>In psychology, there's been a pretty severe cultural split, between
<br>
experimentalists (who took a behaviorist and then later cognitivist
<br>
perspective) who refuse to even think about the mind as a whole, and
<br>
clinicians who rely on a variety of mutually conflicting intuitive
<br>
conceptual models of the mind.  No consensus either...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To this day the level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural relativism and belief in the power of environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects is quite strong in government projects.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I see a lot of the government-project world, thru my mother who runs a
<br>
grant-funded social service program (www.womensassoc.org), and who worked at
<br>
a high level in the Philadelphia Housing Dept. for a while.
<br>
<p>I don't see very much in the work of her program or others like it, that
<br>
significantly reflects cultural relativism or belief in environment rather
<br>
than heredity.
<br>
<p>While they do try to respect different cultures, the focus of her program
<br>
and others like it is on teaching people what they need to survive and
<br>
prosper in mainstream US society -- not on teaching people what they need to
<br>
survive in a particular subculture.  It's pretty pragmatic stuff.
<br>
<p>Regarding heredity vs. environment -- I don't see how social service
<br>
programs could really incorporate opinions on this issue, even if they
<br>
wanted to...
<br>
<p>Clearly, improving childrens' environments is valuable.  If kids are not
<br>
being taught to read, and if they're not being fed well, this should be
<br>
remedied.
<br>
<p>In a practical social service setting, one doesn't *know* much about the
<br>
heredity of kids ... we can't look at their genes and tell how to best help
<br>
them ... so all we can do is try to help people as best we can.  Environment
<br>
can be improved; heredity, using current technology, cannot...
