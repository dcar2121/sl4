Yeah, it's like being given access to something that's always been there.
<br>
As if one is allowed to see something, be part of something that is always there.
<br>
It always allows me to solve whatever problem I was struggling with. One thing that can
<br>
be unsettling is the transition back to normal state. It can last 1-10 minutes, or a day sometimes.
<br>
Also, I'm not always sure what I  really saw while in that state. The only way to check
<br>
is to look at my code or whatever I wrote or did while in that state. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; Eliezer don't read the following paragraph or if you do, be so kind as to give me a break&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I kinda feel there is definitely some sort of  correlation between LSD and that state. I never did
<br>
any. I however  did some mushrooms (too much in one go) and hated it coz the world was gone.
<br>
I do not remember anything scaring me more than that. And I'm not prone to fear. But I did not control
<br>
my thoughts well enough, all hell broke loose. I did mushrooms once more after that, to beat the fear and
<br>
kinda succeeded. I will however try to stay away from hallucinogenic for the rest of my life. Thank you very much !!!!
<br>
I however am glad I tried as I never looked at anything the same way after that =)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; Eliezer you can carry on reading &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Coming back to that peculiar brain state, I feel like I'll never get used to the 'switching back'. 
<br>
It's so severe that I can be a danger to myself or people around me. I'm effectively unaware of 
<br>
the world for a while. So I always try to make sure I do not get in that state in the wrong places.
<br>
Also, life's a bit dull when coming out of that state. I immediately want to rush back in. It took
<br>
me many years to realize that being in that state all the time might be what various mystics
<br>
call 'enlightenment'. The longest I've stayed in that state was during 1990 or 1991. I did not sleep more than 
<br>
2-4 hours average per day for that whole year. I ate chess, dreamed chess, saw people as chess
<br>
pieces, related everything in life to chess. I never played the same again. I do not even play anymore,
<br>
apart from the occasional game. Nowadays it happens almost invariably while designing objects.
<br>
Various papers at <a href="http://www.reciprocality.org">http://www.reciprocality.org</a> talks a lot about that state. You probably know that
<br>
site anyway...
<br>
<p><p>PS: Could it be that Eli is in that state permanently ? I'm serious.
