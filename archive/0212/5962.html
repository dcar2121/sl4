<p>I've brought up my complaint about this answer to the FP previously: 
<br>
Your answer does not explain why I will not, about 5 seconds after the 
<br>
Singularity, design/test/launch a self-replicating probe &quot;manned&quot; by 
<br>
some sort of mind (either sentient or not, depends on what I decide 
<br>
then) that will go off and scour the whole reachable Universe for 
<br>
sentients that need help. Note that I do not have to go with the probe, 
<br>
and it only takes a few seconds of realtime to accomplish which probably 
<br>
isn't enough to completely destroy my livelihood in the post-Singularity 
<br>
rat race.
<br>
<p>Your whole answer seems predicated on the idea that post-Singularity 
<br>
life would have to actually journey around the Universe in person, which 
<br>
seems silly.
