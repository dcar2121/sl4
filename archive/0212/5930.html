Gordon Worley:
<br>
GW&gt; Empathy is a complex adaption that evolved over millions of years
<br>
GW&gt; in response to situations arising from living in kin groups.  In a
<br>
GW&gt; sense, empathy is coming to morality backwards (trying different
<br>
GW&gt; kinds of behavior until you find one that works well).
<br>
<p>Now that I've started to read up a little on Evolutionary Psychology,
<br>
I find that I disagree with a certain over-simplification I sense in
<br>
statements such as the above (not with the basic notion of EP, which
<br>
seems pretty sound).  Of course all behaviour is &quot;just&quot; a complex
<br>
adaptation, in some sense.  You didn't say &quot;just&quot;, but I feel it's
<br>
implied in your statement and others I've read -- it feels dismissive,
<br>
like saying beauty is &quot;just&quot; in your mind.
<br>
<p>It's a hindsight thing, and a question of at which point the hindsight
<br>
gets applied.  Looking back from here it may seem that the only
<br>
&quot;purpose&quot; of empathy was survival of the species, or the gene; looking
<br>
back from some future date it may seem that morality was its
<br>
&quot;purpose&quot;; that feelings of empathy, combined with early reasoning
<br>
ability, gave rise to basic morals such as embodied in the golden
<br>
rule and concepts such as karma.  Or even that this sense of morality
<br>
which prompted humans to create a Friendly AI and bring about the
<br>
Singularity was the &quot;purpose&quot; of empathy.
<br>
<p>Of course ascribing purpose to evolution is to anthropomorphise it, in
<br>
a sense; that's hard to avoid in any discussion of evolution, although
<br>
not as hard to conceal.
