<p>BG&gt; What I'm curious about is if anyone has clearly-articulable reasons or
<br>
BG&gt; feelings leading them to prefer a different sort of choice -- e.g. &quot;option 5
<br>
BG&gt; only&quot; or &quot;option 2 only&quot; etc. -- or a different option not on the list (e.g.
<br>
BG&gt; &quot;my brain transplanted into a chinchilla's body&quot; -- but with a detailed
<br>
BG&gt; explanation ;)
<br>
<p>Thanks for the stimulating thoughts.  Some comments on your choices:
<br>
<p>BG&gt; Ben3: A Ben in a humanoid robot body, with the ability to breathe in space,
<br>
BG&gt; fly, etc.
<br>
<p>I'd be interested in trying a variety of bodies, and a variety of
<br>
input systems.  What would it be like if I could widen the spectrum of
<br>
light visible to me?  What if I had eyes all around my head -- would
<br>
my (uploaded) brain's visual cortex be able to reconfigure itself to
<br>
deal with the increased input without radical alteration?  What would
<br>
a dolphin's body and sensorium feel like -- and if I hung out in a
<br>
dolphin body with (real) dolphins for a while, would there be a
<br>
learning/adjustment period after which I could communicate with them?
<br>
<p>I'd also be interested in the experience of breathing in space... ;)
<br>
<p>BG&gt; Ben5: an uploaded computer program allowed to evolve and self-modify in any
<br>
BG&gt; direction ... quite probably it will soon become clever enough to be
<br>
BG&gt; disinterested in Ben1, Ben2, Ben3 and Ben4 and effectively &quot;disappear&quot;...
<br>
<p>Will this Ben5 be embodied / provided with the tools for embodiment
<br>
(sensorium, action on the outside world) or will it be self-contained
<br>
(i.e., in a virtual/mathematical mindspace of sorts)?
<br>
<p>I also imagine that a Ben5 would soon disappear off our radar, in a
<br>
sense.  I wonder whether this disappearing act would represent some
<br>
form of enlightenment, or some sort of transcension to a &quot;higher
<br>
reality&quot;.
<br>
<p>Would Ben5, after that point, be distinguishable from a Tom5,
<br>
Dick5, and Harry5 after they reach that point -- when individual
<br>
identity as we understand it is left behind, does consciousness
<br>
converge or diverge?
<br>
<p>To be honest, I have some doubts about the Ben5 scenario myself.  I'm
<br>
not at all yet certain that the kind of consciousness we are isn't
<br>
inherently complexity-limited in some ways.  A paranoid personality
<br>
allowed to evolve and self-modify would quickly spin into some form of
<br>
self-destruction, I'd imagine...so given infinite self-modifiability,
<br>
wouldn't the smallest flaws in our personalities or mental health
<br>
spiral out of control?  Perhaps we could modify our personality in
<br>
such a way to avoid this, but that presumes we know how to handle the
<br>
self-modification tools and know what to change and how, which in turn
<br>
presumes we're &quot;given&quot; those tools and that knowledge by an external
<br>
process such as an FAI.  I can't quite picture us bootstrapping it all
<br>
the way given just the &quot;mental room&quot;...
