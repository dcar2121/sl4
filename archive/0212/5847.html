</em><br>
<p>FYI:  This is not currently the view of the Singularity Institute.  (As 
<br>
far as I know.  I'm just one Director, after all.)  I can see ways for 
<br>
human enhancement to go wrong, but I can also see ways for it to go right; 
<br>
in that highly abstract respect it's not much different from FAI.  *What* 
<br>
might go wrong is to some extent different.
<br>
<p>Given the enormously greater effort I've put into thinking up safe FAI 
<br>
strategies, versus safe human enhancement strategies, even if FAI did 
<br>
&quot;look safer&quot; it might not count for much; maybe putting an equal amount of 
<br>
computing power into coming up with human enhancement strategies would 
<br>
yield equally good or even better strategies.
<br>
<p>I for one would like to see research organizations pursuing human 
<br>
intelligence enhancement, and would be happy to offer all the ideas I 
<br>
thought up for human enhancement when I was searching through general 
<br>
Singularity strategies before specializing in AI, if anyone were willing 
<br>
to cough up, oh, at least a hundred million dollars per year to get 
<br>
started, and if there were some way to resolve all the legal problems with 
<br>
the FDA.
<br>
<p>Hence the Singularity Institute &quot;for Artificial Intelligence&quot;.  Humanity 
<br>
is simply not paying enough attention to support human enhancement 
<br>
projects at this time, and Moore's Law goes on ticking.
<br>
<p>It would require less computing power to make sense of reality in general, 
<br>
and complex Singularity strategies in particular, if all the positive 
<br>
support ended up on one side, and all the negative support ended up on the 
<br>
other side.  But that kind of totally clear-cut choice usually only 
<br>
develops in issues of fact, in the natural sciences, a decade after the 
<br>
initial controversy is over.  It doesn't often characterize complex 
<br>
planning in real-world scenarios.  Sometimes, yes, but not often.
