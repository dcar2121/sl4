<p>
Simon,
<br>
<p>I agree, the multiple conflicting universes posited in &quot;QED in curved space&quot;
<br>
do not exhaust the full spectrum of universes that may be seen to exist from
<br>
a more general perspective.  For one thing, they are only universes where
<br>
the physics theory of &quot;QED in curved space&quot; is a good approximation, but
<br>
there may be other universes with very different sets of &quot;physical laws&quot;...
<br>
(a reference to John Wheeler's notion that in the beginning there were no
<br>
fixed physical laws, and then physical laws evolved.  Perhaps, in fact,
<br>
different physical laws evolved in different &quot;reality-streams&quot; from the
<br>
primordial atemporal lawless beginning-point...)
<br>
<p><p>***
<br>
On a slightly personal note, how much knowledge have you personally gained
<br>
from
<br>
watching and teaching your own children from babies, and in what ways has
<br>
this
<br>
affected your work in learning processes? Also, I will not dare to assume
<br>
that
<br>
studying the learning processes can only be done by observing babies, but
<br>
also
<br>
old people, and even senile people.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>I learned a great deal about learning from watching my kids learn.  However,
<br>
it's hard to know when one is being over-anthropomorphic in modeling ideas
<br>
about AGI-learning on observations of human-child learning...
<br>
<p>You also learn a lot about shifting subjective realities from watching small
<br>
children.  A baby's subjective reality is not much like a 4-year-old's,
<br>
there is a heck of a lot of reality-building going on in the interim ... and
<br>
contemporary psych. science does not tell us much about the
<br>
subjective-reality-building process.  It is nice if a parent is sometimes
<br>
able to almost enter into their child's reality..
<br>
