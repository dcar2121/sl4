<p>
I'm archiving a bunch of articles from the 1990s, and remembering how
<br>
exciting that decade was.  We had a lot of new ideas about AI
<br>
architectures, such as situated activity, hybrid architectures,
<br>
dynamical-systems architectures; not to mention the continuing fallout
<br>
from the 1980s over connectionism and reactive behavior.  We had
<br>
reinforcement learning, latent semantic analysis, statistical natural
<br>
language processing, wavelets, and hidden Markov models for the first
<br>
decent speech recognition.  We had people trying to deal with action
<br>
selection and attention in cognitive archtectures for the first time.
<br>
We had functional MRI, brain function localization, and the decoding
<br>
of population representations, temporal spike train coding, and
<br>
chaotic basins of attraction in the brain.  We had decent compression
<br>
for the first time - gzip and MPEG.  We had genetic algorithms,
<br>
genetic programming, nonlinear science, self-organizing systems, &quot;the
<br>
edge of chaos&quot;, artificial life, virtual reality, the World Wide Web,
<br>
Linux and open-source, developed the theory of quantum computers, had
<br>
the first nanocomputer designs, solved the first tough problems with
<br>
biocomputers.  We also developed most of the transhumanist ideas that
<br>
we're still playing with today.
<br>
<p>I could list a lot of things from the 1980s, also.  But I can't think
<br>
of much that was kicked off in this decade that's as exciting as any
<br>
of the things I just mentioned from the 1990s.  Support vector
<br>
machines?  Blogs?  Web services?  Greasemonkey?  Micropayments?
<br>
Outsourcing?  That's all I can think of at the moment.  Am I getting
<br>
old?  Am I out of the loop?  What's going on out there?  I can't even
<br>
think of any new movements in science fiction from the 2000s.
<br>
<p>There are some exciting things in other fields - genome sequencing
<br>
(developed in the 1990s), RNA interference, gene therapy (largely
<br>
1990s also), microarray protein expression analysis - but I can't
<br>
think of much in AI/comp sci/math that excites me lately.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is because I left the university in 1997 and went to work
<br>
in industry - but, I never found out about any of those exciting
<br>
things from my university classes anyway, so that explanation doesn't
<br>
satisfy me.
