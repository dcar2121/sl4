<p>
there is no question that IQ/g plays a huge factor in measuring a
<br>
persons chances of having a positive role in SL4-related developments.
<br>
<p>but there are a couple of policy issues here (which I'll mention
<br>
quickly before this thread is no doubt sniped):
<br>
<p>We have the elite cadre factor, e.g. only the smarties get to make the
<br>
decisions and get the good jobs; just as much an ethical minefield as
<br>
aryanism or genetic predisposition evaluations. We can't be sure that
<br>
a sub-140 intellect might not be blessed with a certain neuronal
<br>
misfiring that gives them an edge in developing cognition-replication
<br>
algorithms or molecular nano-switches. But we can be sure that
<br>
excluding them based on their IQ takes us well on the way to being
<br>
Eugenics practitioners. Apotheosis is great but not at the cost of
<br>
Altruism, there's no point being transhuman if you can't live with
<br>
yourself.
<br>
<p>Then there is the issue of telling children with high or low IQ's what
<br>
their chances of making a difference are. Growing up in New Zealand I
<br>
heard of testing but also that any child who took one was under no
<br>
circumstances to be told what their result was. Now residing in
<br>
Australia I have met a fair few people who were tested as children and
<br>
given particularly high scores - in the 180 range. Some of these
<br>
people are close friends and... I love them dearly but someone was
<br>
kidding themselves with these tests. These people are bright sure but
<br>
are just _not_that_smart_ and for the most part are holding down
<br>
minimum wage and have a fairly limited worldview. Is it because they
<br>
thought from test result on that everything was going to be handed to
<br>
them on a to-your-braininess-sire silver platter? And what about the
<br>
stupid kids? Did they ever even bother trying out for college? Do they
<br>
content themselves with the fact that they must be 'emotionally' or
<br>
'linguistically' intelligent while they work as labourers but can
<br>
solve the Times Cryptic - yet scored some second-rate IQ as a
<br>
grade-schooler?
<br>
<p>Coming back to the 150 vs 180 point now that I've had a bit of a rant
<br>
(I've been coding for 21 hours straight x-)  :  the extra computation
<br>
no doubt helps, but we're not currently setup as a techno-creative
<br>
society in a way that our highest of higher-order intelligence gets to
<br>
have the lion's share of execution cycles on our cognition machines.
<br>
We still have to click mice/squint at screens/adjust backrests, spend
<br>
precious tens-of-minutes commuting/queueing/holding, waste cycles in
<br>
meetings/lifts/gopherings. That extra oomph has got to help but
<br>
isolating it from the distraction and noise and ramp-up is the rub.
<br>
<p>FWIW I've never had an IQ test; it wasn't offered a kid and like most
<br>
adults, I think, I'm now a little bit scared to find out exactly how
<br>
average I really am, and just settle myself with beating allcomers at
<br>
a bit of chess :-). This is probably the cause behind all the
<br>
'emotional intelligence' rubbish; just hairdressers who don't really
<br>
get a kick out of thinking of themselves as bottom-rung in the brain
<br>
stakes so amp up their fashion sense so they can look down at us nerdy
<br>
types. I get the same way about some of the super-brains in IT that
<br>
I've met (some have their initials credited somewhere on _your_
<br>
machine, trust me) but who are trekkie saps and think a good bushwalk
<br>
makes a rockin' weekend (it doesn't.   don't be a sap :-)
<br>
<p>Also, I don't think cognating SL4 is as big a deal as some of you
<br>
think it is. For a start, I'm here, and I feel I'm pretty average joe,
<br>
apart from some NZ's-most-wanted action when I was a post-adolescent
<br>
wannabe-crim; and most of the people I talk to about this subject
<br>
matter are fairly good with it if at least healthily sceptical. In a
<br>
world where Elvis Lives and  Jesus Cometh the Singularity is just
<br>
another salacious shock-jock premonition; the risks are there, but
<br>
don't forget that every generation has been convinced it's the last...
