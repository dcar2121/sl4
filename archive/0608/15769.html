</em><br>
<p>I am not familiar with any published approaches to the problem that are 
<br>
&quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;viable&quot;.  I include CFAI and CEV in this summary.  CFAI 
<br>
is not powerful and probably not viable; CEV is a statement of goals.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you have a systematic problem with airy references 
<br>
to literature that exists somewhere only you can see it.  Give three 
<br>
examples.
<br>
<p>I fully expect that Richard Loosemore's response will complain about how 
<br>
dreadfully unfair and unprofessional it is of me to dare say that he has 
<br>
a systematic problem about anything, and what an awful place the SL4 
<br>
mailing list is; but he will not, of course, give the three examples.  I 
<br>
am giving this challenge, not in the hopes that Loosemore will respond 
<br>
with actual examples, but so that everyone else knows that the above 
<br>
paragraph is, in fact, false - a bluff, to put it bluntly.  If Loosemore 
<br>
was interested in responding constructively, Anissimov asked politely 
<br>
one day ago, and Loosemore could have chosen to respond to that.
<br>
<p>It should moreover be obvious that if Loosemore is *not* bluffing and 
<br>
wants to decisively win this argument, he can give three examples and 
<br>
*then* complain about how terribly he's been insulted.
