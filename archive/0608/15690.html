</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  I meant that, according to the study, IQ differences
<br>
*over 150 or so* don't matter all that much, in the same way that IQ
<br>
differences under 50 probably don't matter all that much.  It doesn't
<br>
matter if your IQ is 20 or 50, you're incredibly retarded either way.
<br>
150 is a very, very high threshold, just beyond the third sigma, and
<br>
only corresponds to 1/1000 of the population.  The difference between
<br>
IQ 150 and IQ 140 is huge, and the difference between IQ 140 and IQ
<br>
130 is huge.  This is why Eliezer writes about prospective seed AI
<br>
programmers, &quot;If we were to try quantifying the level of brainpower
<br>
necessary, our guess is that it's around the 10,000:1 or 100,000:1
<br>
level.&quot;  The difference between 160 and 150 could also be huge, I just
<br>
posted the article link to get some discussion started on it.
<br>
<p>Please, please, please at least skim this paper:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>The idea that IQ doesn't matter &quot;all that much&quot; is among the most
<br>
frequently repeated myths with the greatest amount of available
<br>
evidence to demolish it.  The whole &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; thing is
<br>
pop-psychological nonsense, considered fringe thinking by the
<br>
mainstream psych community.  IQ matters for social skills.  IQ matters
<br>
for real-life achievement.  IQ matters for common sense.  IQ matters
<br>
for which people will be able to wrap their brains around what I'm
<br>
arguing in this post and for which people it will go in one ear and
<br>
out the other.
<br>
<p>And by the way, discussions of IQ are most definitely SL4.
<br>
Conversations about intelligence and comparisons between intraspecies
<br>
and interspecies intelligence differentials make up the core of the
<br>
argument that most people on this list *still* don't understand: the
<br>
Singularity is about smartness, not technology, and the second you
<br>
build something smarter than you, everything we know flies out the
<br>
window.
