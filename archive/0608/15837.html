</em><br>

<em>&gt; the experts in the Bayesian field -- at least, as far as saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human reasoning can be explained by or is even consistent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesianism.
</em><br>
<p>Mark, are you familiar with heuristics and biases *specifically*?  That 
<br>
is, have you read _Judgment Under Uncertainty_ or some other work that 
<br>
contains the literal substring &quot;heuristics and biases&quot; on the front or 
<br>
back cover?
<br>
<p>Because I can't think of *anyone* in H&amp;B who has ever claimed that human 
<br>
thought is Bayesian.  (No memory is available to my recall attempt, so I 
<br>
infer that the frequency is low or zero.)  Bayes is prescriptive, not 
<br>
descriptive.  I'm too young to remember a time from the distant past 
<br>
when anyone thought that human thought actually followed 
<br>
probability-theoretic inference rules.  Today, &quot;everyone knows&quot; that 
<br>
human thought isn't Bayesian - it is an elementary point on which the 
<br>
whole field of heuristics and biases is based; if human thought operated 
<br>
using Bayesian procedures, rather than a toolbox of heuristics, there 
<br>
would be no systematic biases.  Even allowing for the possibility of 
<br>
occasional error, the errors would center around a Bayesian mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer keeps saying &quot;RTFM!  (To name a specific M, &quot;Judgment Under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uncertainty&quot; would do him some good.)&quot;.  Richard keeps saying &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that topic but IT IS NOT RELEVANT TO MY POINT&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Try googling &quot;feminist bank teller&quot;.  The first entry you come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with is David Chart's &quot;Inference to the Best Explanation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesianism, and Feminist Bank Tellers&quot;.  He also seems to a)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand Bayesianism, b) refer to and understand the experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results, and c) not believe that Bayes is relevant to the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental model.
</em><br>
<p>I read the referenced paper, which seems quite ordinary except for the 
<br>
implicit inference (from what the paper is arguing against) that someone 
<br>
in the field of mental models is still seriously putting forth Bayesian 
<br>
inference as a descriptive model of human reasoning.  If so, they would 
<br>
seem to be rather ignorant of heuristics and biases.  Which is why Chart 
<br>
is trying to remedy their ignorance, with an extremely basic example - 
<br>
or so it appears.
<br>
<p>Chart's paper is at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000322/00/ibefbt.html">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000322/00/ibefbt.html</a>
<br>
<p>Sample quote from the paper:
<br>
<p>&quot;Tversky and Kahneman give their own interpretation of the results. They 
<br>
suggest that we use a 'representativeness heuristic', and that a 
<br>
feminist bank teller seems more representative of Linda's background 
<br>
than merely being a bank teller. Their interpretation obviously has a 
<br>
close affinity to the interpretation I have provided, and on certain 
<br>
theories of explanation, particularly unification models, it may turn 
<br>
out to be the same interpretation.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, then, this result suggests that, if the choice is between 
<br>
Inference to the Best Explanation and Bayesianism, we use Inference to 
<br>
the Best Explanation. We make mistakes which are to be expected on an 
<br>
explanatory model of inference, but which are surprising and hard to 
<br>
explain on a Bayesian model. Thus, according to Inference to the Best 
<br>
Explanation, we should tentatively conclude that we use explanatory, not 
<br>
Bayesian, inference.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, Chart is proposing something compatible with the 
<br>
standard explanation in heuristics and biases (&quot;it may turn out to be 
<br>
the same interpretation&quot;).  This is also my impression on reading 
<br>
Chart's paper; what Chart is describing is very close to the standard 
<br>
model in H&amp;B, possibly identical with it (as Chart says), just described 
<br>
a different way so as to render it applicable to an ongoing dispute in 
<br>
the related field of mental models.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; except insofar as Richard keeps seeming to think modeling is part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the heuristics-and-biases subfield, which it isn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you give an example of where Richard does this?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Richard's error is much worse; he thinks heuristics-and-biases 
<br>
is a subfield of mental models.
<br>
<p>E.g. Loosemore:  'These people (Chater and Oaksford, at least) know 
<br>
everything there is to know about the entire field of human reasoning, 
<br>
including the subfield that Yudkowsky refers to as &quot;heuristics and biases&quot;.'
<br>
<p>My unreliable impression is that there are at least an order of 
<br>
magnitude more researchers working on heuristics and biases.  H&amp;B is a 
<br>
large experimental field, while &quot;mental models&quot; is a comparatively 
<br>
small, comparatively more theoretical field.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I think that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; he's pretty clear that his point is that he believes that heuristics
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and biases (at least as performed by Bayesians)
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Bayesians&quot; wouldn't use heuristics, they would use the inference rules 
<br>
of probability theory.  The notion of a Bayesian &quot;performing&quot; a 
<br>
heuristic, or a bias, is nonsense.
<br>
<p>The above sentence demonstrates (1) a severely erroneous picture of what 
<br>
H&amp;B is all about, which seems to have been (2) virally transmitted by 
<br>
Loosemore to Waser, which is (3) why I'm considering banning Loosemore 
<br>
from the list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's pretty clear that his point is that he believes that heuristics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and biases (at least as performed by Bayesians) are not relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since they are not the mental model which is actually employed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sole example of General Intelligence - i.e. humans (in fact, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty much a rephrasing of his point).
</em><br>
<p>The whole above paragraph is wildly ignorant of what the H&amp;B folks do: 
<br>
use experiments to pin down a descriptive model of human reasoning which 
<br>
EVERYONE IN THE FIELD KNOWS AND ACCEPTS IS NOT BAYESIAN.  This was the 
<br>
very first point made in the field - &quot;Wow!  Human reasoning is not 
<br>
Bayesian!&quot; - by Ward Edwards in the 1960s, if I recall correctly.
<br>
<p>I therefore doubt your assertion that:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I *think* that I've read the majority of the relevant stuff.
</em><br>
<p>This also seems rather unlikely given:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I understand that you got mired in the back-water and opinions of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; H&amp;B folk.
</em><br>
<p>H&amp;B a backwater?  Kahneman, one of the founders of the field, recently 
<br>
won a Nobel Prize in Economics - for that particular work, mind you. 
<br>
I've yet to see a paper on mental models mentioned in the mainstream 
<br>
press, while you can find plenty of press articles about various 
<br>
particular results in heuristics and biases.  Not that I have anything 
<br>
against the real researchers in the field of mental models; H&amp;B is a 
<br>
much larger field than AGI research, too.  But Loosemore's concept that 
<br>
the large experimental field of H&amp;B is a subfield of the small and 
<br>
relatively theoretical field of MM, is another example of his severe 
<br>
ignorance.  Your above comment seems to imply that you have been misled 
<br>
by the implicit assumptions you picked up from Loosemore.  Which is very 
<br>
much the sort of thing I'm worried about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The h&amp;b field claim to understand something.  The mental modeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people contest that understanding.  
</em><br>
<p>Not in Chart's paper.  Please provide references - though, mind you, my 
<br>
working assumption at this point is that you are wholly ignorant of the 
<br>
large field of heuristics and biases, working with mistaken assumptions 
<br>
picked up from Loosemore, and therefore not capable of assessing what 
<br>
would constitute a conflict between the two fields, as evidenced by your 
<br>
misassessment of Chart's paper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well now, I provided a direct reference to an article that clearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supports Richard (with all of the feminist bank teller experiments as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's experimental basis).
</em><br>
<p>The referenced paper by Chart does not support Richard's explicit 
<br>
assertion that the conjunction fallacy arose from a particular 
<br>
misunderstanding by the research subjects (a possibility that was long 
<br>
since refuted a million ways from Sunday, see the paper referenced in my 
<br>
reply to Medina), nor Richard's rather huge implicit mistake in thinking 
<br>
that heuristics-and-biases is a subset of the field of mental models, or 
<br>
Richard's misconception that H&amp;B holds that humans are using Bayesian 
<br>
inference procedures subject to noise.  In fact, if you read the paper 
<br>
by Chart carefully, it contradicts-in-passing the later point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer *really* needs to do so.  This is *not* an odd dispute.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an ongoing, inter-field debate.
</em><br>
<p>I am not aware of this being an ongoing inter-field dispute.  References 
<br>
please.  (Bearing in mind that I strongly suggest you read up 
<br>
*specifically on heuristics and biases* before you attempt to determine, 
<br>
from your own knowledge, what is or is not an inter-field dispute.)
