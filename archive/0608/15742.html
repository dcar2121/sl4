<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>Your comments about the relevance of intelligence are correct:  they 
<br>
simply do not relate to IQ, and the best way to understand this is to 
<br>
switch to my new, improved test called the &quot;Post Office Quotient&quot;.
<br>
<p>The POQ is a measure of how far your domicile is from all the City 
<br>
Central Post Office buildings in your region.  It is a U-shaped measure 
<br>
that goes very low the nearer you get to the building, then peaks at a 
<br>
distance determined by (among other things) the distance to the nearest 
<br>
town, and then goes very low again when you get as far as possible from 
<br>
all the Central Post Offices.
<br>
<p>I submit that with this measure you will be able to write a chart that 
<br>
does not differ substantially from the one you presented:
<br>
<p>+1 POQ point = +1.763% income,
<br>
Annual gain / POQ point US $55-65 billion
<br>
0.4-0.5% GDP
<br>
3 point POQ increase:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty rate            -25%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Males in jail            -25%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High school dropouts    -28%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parentless children    -20%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare recipiency    -18%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-of-wedlock births    -15%
<br>
<p>If, Michael, you were to concede the point and from this day forth 
<br>
advocate that we look for people with high POQ in order to staff a 
<br>
singularity research program, then you would be doing something exactly 
<br>
equivalent to what you are now doing.  I would just be a bit more 
<br>
obvious that it was nonsensical.
<br>
<p>What causes people with high POQ to be so successful, and what causes 
<br>
people who have the ability to MEASURABLY solve problems more quickly 
<br>
(or more effectively, for open ended IQ tests) is that POQ and IQ are 
<br>
correlated with intelligence, which is a cluster of abilities, some of 
<br>
which we understand and many of which we don't, and some of which we can 
<br>
measure, and some of which we can not.
<br>
<p>In amongst all those abilities that we do not completely understand, 
<br>
there are some that can be measured.  The number you get out of that 
<br>
measurement process is IQ:  it only measures what CAN be measured, and 
<br>
we have no reason to believe (and plenty of reasons NOT to believe) that 
<br>
IQ is a direct measure of intelligence-in-the-large.  (And please do not 
<br>
go off on a red herring about the generality of g:  those studies, no 
<br>
matter how comprehensive, are still subject to the criticism that they 
<br>
measure what CAN be measured, and have no relevance to components that 
<br>
cannot be measured).
<br>
<p>What is distressing (and what illustrates my point about high-IQ people 
<br>
being just as guilty of closed-mindedness as anyone else) is that you, a 
<br>
person of supposedly high intelligence, are not addressing the issue I 
<br>
raised in the above to paragraphs:  you seem to be evading it or denying 
<br>
it for ideological reasons.  And just for the record, the summary of the 
<br>
issue is that
<br>
<p>1) There is a difference between correlation and causation, and
<br>
2) There is a difference between a partial component of intelligence and 
<br>
the whole thing, and
<br>
3) If a thing can only be partially measured (i.e. only a component of 
<br>
it can be measured), that fact does not give anyone the licence to 
<br>
pretend that the measurable bit IS the entire thing.
<br>
<p>These things are about empirical science.  I truly do not understand why 
<br>
you (and others) do not seem to either understand them or rank them as 
<br>
important enough to sway the discussion.
<br>
<p>You are not alone in having this attitude, by the way:  I have met 
<br>
psychometricians who have seriously said that because g is such a strong 
<br>
predictor of behavior, and because there exists such a single factor 
<br>
that can by a good predictor, therefore g is a measure of THE mechanism 
<br>
that is intelligence.  I have said it to them and I will repeat it here: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;those folks are allowing their obsession with statistics and 
<br>
mathematics to trump science.  They are not scientists.
<br>
<p>Now, if you were advocating that we look for &quot;intelligent&quot; people to 
<br>
staff a singularity research program, then, hey, that is what we are all 
<br>
doing anyhow.  It is just that because intelligence is such a difficult 
<br>
thing to pin down, we know that it would be stupid to take high IQ to be 
<br>
the only measure of their potential ability.
<br>
<p>And as for the idea that IQ per se (rather than intelligence in the 
<br>
large) is relevant to AGI:  sure, it is as relevant as POQ.  I suggest 
<br>
that after we build a candidate AGI we send it out into the world to get 
<br>
a job, and find a place to live, see where it ends up, and then measure 
<br>
its POQ.  And, yes, that is a little facetious, but you get my point: 
<br>
concentrating on POQ or IQ now is putting the cart before the horse.
<br>
<p>*Intelligence* (and finding out what intelligence actually is, and how 
<br>
it works) is what we need to be concentrating on.
<br>
<p>[Lastly, an aside:  I did not accuse you personally of being obsessed by 
<br>
IQ because yours is (presumably) high, I simply pointed out an 
<br>
observation I had made of a majority of the people who adulate high IQ].

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational exuberance about IQ because of a personal high score.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I just watched Anders Sandberg's talk at Transvision 06, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practically the entire thing focuses on IQ and its importance.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cites Linda Gottfredson multiple times, as well as citing the Terman

</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance of IQ and everyone is respectful, but when I do the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing I'm being &quot;ridiculous&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In his talk (available at <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjrauhal/tv06/">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjrauhal/tv06/</a>),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he listed many points, including these:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence is one of the Singularitarian Principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/sing/principles.html#intelligence">http://yudkowsky.net/sing/principles.html#intelligence</a>):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;At the heart of an appreciation of the Singularity lies an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciation of intelligence.  The Singularity places a horizon across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our understanding because we can't predict what someone smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us is going to do; if we could, we'd be that smart ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence isn't just the ability to come up with complex solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to complex problems; it's the ability to see the shortcuts, the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and obvious-in-retrospect solutions to complex problems - even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional or philosophical problems.  Intelligence isn't just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-speed thinking, perfect memories, or other party tricks;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence is also wisdom, and self-awareness, and other things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend into every aspect of mind and personality.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Certainly. But how is the measurement of IQ by tests relevant to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; development of artificially enhanced intelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Some of the same features of IQ test problems will be targetted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by AI designers as tasks that their system must be able to solve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, a better understanding of human IQ variance in the space of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds-in-general will begin with a thorough analysis of that human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variance.  This is important to the argument that human-equivalent AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is anthropomorphic.  There is no such thing as long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-equivalent AI: you either have a retard or a superintelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The transition time from A to B could be measured in the minutes or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; However,  the discussion in this thread  has not been about that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; angle, but rather about how to best measure the differences between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humans in a way that correlates with real intelligence, and this seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; only secondarily relevant to SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's transhuman intelligence that lies at the heart of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, but we respect intelligence on the human scale as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This respect for intelligence is our shield against being blinded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology, one of the primary safeguards that prevents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarianism from turning into just another banal fanaticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cloudy thinking in the service of the Singularity wouldn't be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtue; it'd be another dreary manifestation of the same old human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity that we're trying to get away from.&quot;
