<p>Damien, the guy's just an ordinary crackpot and I wish I'd seen it 
<br>
sooner.  The single worst sin on John Baez's Crackpot Index:  &quot;50 points 
<br>
for claiming you have a revolutionary theory but giving no concrete 
<br>
testable predictions.&quot;  Also, &quot;20 points for talking about how great 
<br>
your theory is, but never actually explaining it&quot;, &quot;10 points for 
<br>
claiming that your work is on the cutting edge of a 'paradigm shift'&quot;, 
<br>
and &quot;10 points for pointing out that you have gone to school, as if this 
<br>
were evidence of sanity&quot;.
<br>
<p>When Richard showed up on this list, I was disturbed by his evasiveness 
<br>
and swiftness to take offense.  But he'd claimed to be a polymath and 
<br>
that is the sort of person I want on this list, so I put up with it.  In 
<br>
retrospect, it seems obvious that Richard never actually demonstrated 
<br>
any technical knowledge of any of the fields he claimed for his own, 
<br>
just grandiose talk about Complex Systems.
<br>
<p>Bleh.  What a waste of time.
