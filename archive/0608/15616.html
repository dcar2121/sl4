</em><br>
<p><p>To expand a little on this: you remind me of a remark I think Eliezer made
<br>
awhile back to the effect that religious belief puts an upper bound on
<br>
rationality. I'm not sure the reverse isn't the case. It is true of course
<br>
that some people hold irrational beliefs for religious reasons, the most
<br>
notorious example in modern times being the creationism versus evolution
<br>
debate. On the other hand it may be for some people that having a place to
<br>
stand, so to speak, outside our world, may free them to look more
<br>
objectively at empirical propositions within this world.
<br>
<p>I'm reminded of the remark, related to the popularity of New Age memes:
<br>
&quot;when people stop believing in God, it's not that they believe nothing -
<br>
it's that they'll believe anything&quot;. That is, in the absence of religion,
<br>
people may find they have to choose a place to stand within this world:
<br>
their _empirical_ beliefs may have to be modified away from the function of
<br>
reflecting reality in order to serve this second purpose. This can have
<br>
significantly negative effects.
<br>
<p>Consider for example hard takeoff. Stepping back and taking a cold look at
<br>
it, the belief that such power can be obtained by shuffling bits in a RAM
<br>
chip is in the same ballpark as the belief that you can summon demons by
<br>
chanting phrases in Latin: it's something whose source is very clearly the
<br>
internal workings of the human mind rather than external reality. Even
<br>
without applying domain-specific knowledge, it's not something an objective
<br>
observer would ever have ended up with.
<br>
<p>So why did we, such smart rational people, ever take something like that
<br>
seriously? Because in the absence of traditional religion we needed a place
<br>
to stand; and my purpose here is to offer an alternative.
