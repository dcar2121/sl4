<em>&gt; This list is, in the end, a party held in my living room.  I surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't ask you to be grateful for that, or respect me for it, and Heaven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forbid that I should ask you to bow before me; but from time to time, I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Lest it be interpreted otherwise, I in no way disagree with this; as a
<br>
libertarian, I hold strong views on the rights of property owners.
<br>
<p>I took the trouble to write a longer reply a little while ago, slightly
<br>
because I think Richard Loosemore's views might be of value (I still think
<br>
that, but he can easily post them elsewhere, so that's not worth getting
<br>
worked up about)...
<br>
<p>But because self-deception in any form is so lethal to any progress in AGI,
<br>
I felt it was necessary to reply to it. Ben Goertzel, by being wise (not
<br>
&quot;Wise&quot;, please note) seems to have somehow avoided it thus far, and has the
<br>
only actual publicly known AGI project that seems to be headed in the right
<br>
compass direction. I didn't avoid it; I walked the Pattern, to use a
<br>
literary reference, came out the other end. Other people have avoided it or
<br>
got out of it by various means.
<br>
<p>If you and the SIAI in general were devoting your full resources to a pure
<br>
blind alley, then I probably wouldn't trouble to post so much.
<br>
<p>The fact that you are devoting your full donated resources to that precise
<br>
pressure point that, as far as I can see, gives you the maximum probability
<br>
of exterminating sentient life... that is why I still fret. And why I still
<br>
attempt to point out lines of the truth whenever it comes up without
<br>
repeating myself. No offense intended - I know, obviously my post is
<br>
offensive anyway, but please understand that it's not gratuitous. Think
<br>
about how you'd react in my position.
