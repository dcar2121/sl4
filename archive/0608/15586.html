<p>&lt;skipping several paragraphs that could be picked for nits, but to
<br>
little effect.&gt;

<p><em>&gt; We aren't grabbing towards a higher intelligence to solve our problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we want our daddies.  We are phrasing these discussions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of superintelligence because we see the abrupt emergence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence as *inevitable*.  Again, if you don't, this whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion is close to pointless.  Sure, if you don't believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence is around the corner, you will put everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards working with what we have today - humans.
</em><br>
<p>Truly, this is the crux of our disagreement.  I see the benefits of
<br>
working with what we have now as outweighing what I see as a very
<br>
small probability that a galactic paper-clip generating AI is anywhere
<br>
close to right around the corner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's time for humanity to grow up and begin taking full responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for ourselves and our way forward.   We can and will do that when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are ready to implement a framework for #1 and #2 above.  It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely begin as a platform for social decision-making optimizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objective outcomes based on subjective values in the entertainment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; domain, and then when people begin to recognize its effectiveness, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may extend to address what we currently think of as political issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can do all this, and then someone builds a superintelligence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizes for paperclips, and we all die.  Looks like we should've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been working on goal content for that first seed AI, huh?
</em><br>
<p>I like that Eliezer is exploring this area, but I'm far from agreeing
<br>
that this is the overwhelming priority that it's portrayed to be by a
<br>
certain elite set of people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You were right to refer to a superintelligence, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superintelligence will not be one separate from humanity.  It will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a superintelligence made up of humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, Global Brain, metaman, etc.  This is all well and good, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community of chimps networked together with the best computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and decision systems does not make a human.  We are talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about building something godlike, so it doesn't make sense to refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in the same way we refer to humans, no more than it makes sense to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about chimps in the same way we talk about humans.
</em><br>
<p>See my response to Eliezer for why I think this is naive due to its
<br>
excessively narrow focus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Singularitarians believe in the technological feasibility of something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - building a recursively self-improving optimization process that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starts from a buildable software program.  Our arguments for the speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intensity of the self-improvement process come from cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science and comparisons of the relative advantages of humans and AIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/articles/relativeadvantages.htm">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/articles/relativeadvantages.htm</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You obviously dont believe that the self-improvement process in AIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will play out at this speed, otherwise we would be on the same page.
</em><br>
<p>Correct.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We are talking superior intelligence capable of developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology and whatever comes after that, with the resources to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rip apart this planet in seconds, minutes, hours, whatever.
</em><br>
<p>I'm familiar with the arguments for planet-destroying
<br>
&quot;superintelligence&quot;, and that it's conceivable in a narrow sense, but
<br>
do you see the inherent contradiction in the concept of an
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; with such a silly goal?
<br>
<p>Well, I'm not trying to win an argument here so I'll let it rest, but
<br>
I do occasionally wish to contribute what I see as a worthwhile view
<br>
even if it doesn't support this particular version of Pascal's Wager.
