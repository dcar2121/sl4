Hi Jeff,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the rational reply.    :-)  &lt;Please do me a favor and re-read 
<br>
my last paragraph way down below after skimming this&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You've missed something, Mark -- the example that started this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subthread of the argument (the feminist bank teller question and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical responses it gets) *is a canonical heuristics-and-biases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example*.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I got that.  Richard's point (and my reply to your point) is that
<br>
that exact same example is *also* specifically used by the mental modeling
<br>
folk to show that the experts in that field don't agree with the experts in
<br>
the Bayesian field -- at least, as far as saying that human reasoning can be
<br>
explained by or is even consistent with Bayesianism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer keeps saying &quot;RTFM!  (To name a specific M, &quot;Judgment Under
<br>
Uncertainty&quot; would do him some good.)&quot;.  Richard keeps saying &quot;I understand
<br>
that topic but IT IS NOT RELEVANT TO MY POINT&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try googling &quot;feminist bank teller&quot;.  The first entry you come up with
<br>
is David Chart's &quot;Inference to the Best Explanation, Bayesianism, and
<br>
Feminist Bank Tellers&quot;.  He also seems to a) understand Bayesianism, b)
<br>
refer to and understand the experimental results, and c) not believe that
<br>
Bayes is relevant to the human mental model.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks to me as if Richard is merely following the experts in the
<br>
field of mental modeling and using the canonical example of the
<br>
heuristics-and-biases folk that the mental modeling folk use to refute the
<br>
claim that humans are Bayesian.  Claiming that Richard hasn't read the
<br>
literature when he's clearly exactly repeating the literature is
<br>
nonsensical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; except insofar as Richard keeps seeming to think modeling is part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristics-and-biases subfield, which it isn't.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you give an example of where Richard does this?  I think that he's
<br>
pretty clear that his point is that he believes that heuristics and biases
<br>
(at least as performed by Bayesians) are not relevant since they are not the
<br>
mental model which is actually employed by the sole example of General
<br>
Intelligence - i.e. humans (in fact, that's pretty much a rephrasing of his
<br>
point).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you arguing that it *isn't* fair to say that heuristics-and-biases
<br>
is one particular model (sub-field) that mental modeling may consider (and
<br>
reject)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That Richard thought his alternative explanation was something novel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us to think about demonstrates pretty clearly a lack of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of one of the most basic series of experiments in the subfield of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristics and biases.  This was Eliezer's point.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't understand Richard to think that his alternative explanation
<br>
was *novel*.  Could you give me an example of where you believe that Richard
<br>
did this?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I would argue that Eliezer's point was *not* that Richard's
<br>
explanation was novel but that it had already been thought of and &quot;proven&quot;
<br>
wrong -- a point that is clearly *still* under contention if you read the
<br>
literature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As someone else who has read a good bit of h&amp;b literature, it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ridiculous how Richard, and now you, are reacting.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The h&amp;b field claim to understand something.  The mental modeling people
<br>
contest that understanding.  To me, that something seems covered by both
<br>
fields BUT that the h&amp;b folk have a large vested interest in their
<br>
particualr understanding.  My reaction is to the lack of scientific
<br>
integrity that I feel is being shown.  If Eliezer can come up with a valid
<br>
argument that Richard is wrong (with specific experimental results), then he
<br>
should do so.  The fact that there is a field of experts that supports
<br>
Richard's point of view tends to argue that Eliezer can't do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Richard's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative proposal demonstrates ignorance of *basics* in a field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's claiming competency in.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean the mental modeling field whose experts apparently have
<br>
the same ignorance (or NOT -- as Eliezer says, RTFM)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only thing further that Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might do in support of his point is provide direct references to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feminist bank teller articles...
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well now, I provided a direct reference to an article that clearly
<br>
supports Richard (with all of the feminist bank teller experiments as it's
<br>
experimental basis).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but, knowing that he's right on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, I wouldn't really fault him for not going out of his way to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richard's research for him.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do *you* *know* so firmly that he is correct?  I *think* that I've
<br>
read the majority of the relevant stuff and I'm strongly leaning the other
<br>
way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it would potentially clear up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (very odd, because so basic, IMO) dispute regarding the feminist bank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teller and h&amp;b.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer *really* needs to do so.  This is *not* an odd dispute.  It is
<br>
an ongoing, inter-field debate.  What is odd is that Eliezer has the
<br>
arrogance to claim right, wrong, and ignorance when it is clearly he who is
<br>
not aware of the debate.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think that you need to do some googling and get up to speed.  I
<br>
understand that you got mired in the back-water and opinions of the H&amp;B
<br>
folk.  It happens to everyone.  Now, someone is saying that there are other
<br>
valid opinions out there.  Are you going to investigate or are you going to
<br>
rely upon one expert who isn't even willing to discuss the subject on a
<br>
scientific basis?
<br>
