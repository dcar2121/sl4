<p>
Tennessee,
<br>
<p>An AGI is not a concrete &quot;thing&quot;, it is a huge space of possibilities.
<br>
&nbsp;It is a set defined only by the characteristics of general
<br>
intelligence and being built artificially.  There are more possible
<br>
AGIs than there are bacteria on earth.
<br>
<p>The 'interests' of an AGI will be defined by its goals.  If we have an
<br>
AGI whose goal is to maximize paperclips, then it will only care about
<br>
pieces of knowledge that contribute to accomplishing that goal.
<br>
Everything else can be completely ignored, except insofar as it is
<br>
predicted to contribute to achieving its goals more effectively.
<br>
<p>Happiness and boredom are conscious feelings generated by human
<br>
brainware.  While an AGI might experience feelings that we might
<br>
compare to boredom and happiness, their effects and underlying
<br>
conscious experiences might be entirely different.
<br>
<p>If you have the ability to program a brain any way you want, then you
<br>
could tie the emotion of 'boredom' to any stimulus and the emotion of
<br>
'happiness' to any stimulus.  For example, you could program an AGI
<br>
that feels 'bored' when it accomplishes its goals, but its underlying
<br>
goal system continues to push it towards accomplishing those goals,
<br>
even though it feels eternally bored doing so.  There might be AGIs
<br>
that feel happy at the thought of being destroyed.  When the mind is a
<br>
blank slate, any stimulus can theoretically lead to any conscious
<br>
sensation, with the right programming.
<br>
<p>An AGI built to gather knowledge and continuously maximize utility
<br>
might never become bored.  Even if there were diminishing returns for
<br>
its efforts, it could be programmed to be extremely satisfied with
<br>
every marginal return, no matter how minute.  It could be programmed
<br>
to be eternally happy even if no further utility is available.
<br>
<p>I get the impression that you don't appreciate how alien an
<br>
arbitrarily programmed mind can truly be.  The following chapter in
<br>
CFAI only takes about half an hour to read, and it will change the way
<br>
you think about AI forever:
