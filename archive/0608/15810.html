<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>The amazing and terrible thing is that your knowledge of cognitive 
<br>
psychology appears to be so shallow that you STILL have no idea that 
<br>
your original outburst (in <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html</a>) had 
<br>
nothing whatever to do with the argument that I presented.
<br>
<p>You cannot misinterpret someone else's argument (by garbling their 
<br>
words, or by only reading the first few sentences of their argument), 
<br>
and then call that person a fool who knows nothing nothing of the entire 
<br>
field.  Especially when that person starts to demonstrate greater depth 
<br>
of knowledge than you, by quoting more sources and laying out detailed, 
<br>
coherent arguments that you ignore.  At least, you cannot do this and 
<br>
expect to be taken seriously.
<br>
<p>Until you get that point, everything you say is justmore ranting  -  and 
<br>
the longer you go on avoiding the actual argument that I presented (you 
<br>
haven't talked about it or shown any sign that you understand it, not 
<br>
once in all these messages), the more you will dig yourself deeper and 
<br>
deeper into a hole, and destroy your own credibility.
<br>
<p>Here *I* am, the one who has gone to so much trouble on this list to 
<br>
advance arguments and explain myself in great detail, and to address 
<br>
counterarguments (whenever they have actual content) with as much care 
<br>
as I can.
<br>
<p>And there *you* are:  your collected responses to my arguments are 
<br>
filled with ad hominem abuse, content-free sarcasm and attacks based on 
<br>
distortions of what I said.  You make sweeping, unsupported allegations 
<br>
about the general character and quality of what I have to say, but you 
<br>
never get down to it and discuss any issues that are relevant to the 
<br>
actual arguments I present.

<em>&gt;&gt; In the recent past you have *twice* thrown out insulting challenges in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; response to something I have written, and each time you then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disappeared when I got back to you:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; On the first occasion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     Your message:   <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     My reply:       <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14773.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14773.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you implied that I was completely ignorant of the literature, that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was just making things up, and that I should go and read some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; baby-level references.  I gave a thorough response, including detailed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; references that showed my knowledge of the literature to be at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as good as your own, countered everything you said and backed up the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; claim that I originally made.  Hey, what more could I have done?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And your reply showed that you were, still, completely ignorant of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature.  I will followup to this effect.  Please note, all, that my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post cited above is *not* a &quot;challenge&quot; - it does not request any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response from Loosemore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All it tells Loosemore to do is read the literature on heuristics and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases, which I still have trouble believing he's ever done.  Maybe he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read it and forgot it - I don't do much of that myself, but I understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it happens to other people.  He certainly did not absorb the basic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts in the field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But what did you do?  You ignored my reply completely.  Nada; nothing; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; total silence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see where your reply contains a specific request that I respond, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let alone a challenge to do a simple thing that I have claimed to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; On the second occasion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     Your message:   <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15321.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15321.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     My reply:       <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15328.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15328.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I again made an immediate reply, in which I pointed out that a proper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; response to your request could go one of two ways, and I invited you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to choose which direction you preferred it to go (I wanted to give you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the option of not wasting time on what I thought we would both agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was the less interesting line of attack).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You said:  &quot;Falsifiable predictions are not the issue.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You offered to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Try to argue me into believing this absurd proposition, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Have me accept that the argument must take place &quot;at the paradigm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I was concerned, my point was made.  I felt this was evident 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any member of the audience who had followed the thread thus far.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw no reason to reply further.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; I fully expect that Richard Loosemore's response will complain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; about how dreadfully unfair and unprofessional it is of me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; dare say that he has a systematic problem about anything, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; what an awful place the SL4 mailing list is...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; References please?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Justin Corwin's post &quot;Offended respondent&quot; is a fairly good case example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, more recently:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Please bear in mind that many aspects of how to do it are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussed on this list.  Whatever the purpose of SL4 might be, any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attempt to talk about real technical issues gets immediately swamped 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by low-quality noise and vitriol...... as a result of this you might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think that there is no serious technical work in existence (about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specific problem of building a coordinated, complete AGI, including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all the motivational/moral/ethical aspects, and including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; considerations of safety and friendliness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This impression would be a mistake.  To take just the issue of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; friendliness, for example:  there are approaches to this problem that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are powerful and viable, but because the list core does not agree with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them, you might think that they are not feasible, or outright 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dangerous and irresponsible.  This impression is a result of skewed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; opinions here, not necessarily a reflection of the actual status of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; those approaches. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You might think there is no serious technical work in existence?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fine, name just *one*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The list core doesn't agree with them&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That rather implies they were presented to the SL4 list at some point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's &quot;a result of skewed opinions here&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Point us to opinions somewhere else in the online world, somewhere else 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can see them, that evaluate the same proposal a different way.
