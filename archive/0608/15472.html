If I were Norvig - having written the book that he did, and if I 
<br>
genuinely believed that this book was a summary of the best approach to 
<br>
AI - I would also be pessimistic about future advances in the field.
<br>
<p>Also, if I were Norvig, and if Google had a massive Skunkworks project 
<br>
to build the first AGI, I would *also* say what he said. :-)
