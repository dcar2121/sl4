<p>
I think this is fairly relevant, as it offers one specific and
<br>
concrete example of where high IQ, good education, and curiosity
<br>
aren't enough to lead to serious accomplishment.
<br>
<p>I'm smart. At 6, my IQ was tested to be in the 98th percentile, with a
<br>
raw score of 142, or some such number. I have a wide variety of
<br>
interests and skills, ranging from the Singularity to Lojban, computer
<br>
programming, and music performance. In these respects, I'm sure I'm
<br>
not terribly exceptional among the participants of this list. And yet
<br>
I'm not able to accomplish much of anything. I dropped out of a
<br>
second-rate university (instead of transferring to a more challenging
<br>
school, and not because I could do better with self-study). I can't
<br>
finish personal programming projects that I start. I can barely pay my
<br>
bills on time (not for a lack of money).
<br>
<p>I have pretty severe ADD. The only medications that work are
<br>
stimulants, and I have anxiety problems, which they exacerbate. I have
<br>
delayed sleep phase syndrome, where without treatment, I get sleepy
<br>
about an hour later every day. This makes it really hard to get enough
<br>
sleep, and without enough sleep your mental acuity nosedives. I
<br>
probably only spend a third of my days fully rested. Stimulants also
<br>
exacerbate this problem.
<br>
<p>Perhaps related to all of these things, (especially the ADD,) even
<br>
though I have tons of interests and ideas for things to accomplish,
<br>
I'm incapable of being motivated to do them. I can barely motivate
<br>
myself to clean my dishes or take out the trash. I spent the last week
<br>
or so programming a web application related to Lojban. It was about
<br>
all I could think about during that period, and about all I could do.
<br>
I finished a good portion of it, (with a working release,) and started
<br>
on a second portion. Yesterday I lost interest, and now I can barely
<br>
bring myself to look at the code I started.
<br>
<p>I suspect that those with high IQ tend to be afflicted with ADD,
<br>
depression, anxiety, and other phychological maladies at higher rates
<br>
than others. The people that end up accomplishing a lot are those
<br>
without these problems. People that can sustain a focus on a topic for
<br>
months and years on end. People that can easily control their
<br>
motivational systems. In other words, people with self-discipline.
<br>
<p>I don't blame myself for these problems, and I'm not writing this for
<br>
sympathy. (And I flatly reject the claim that any of these things a
<br>
moral failing. That discussion isn't germane.) I'm working on them,
<br>
and with luck, I'll be able to fix them eventually. But that's not
<br>
certain, and if I don't I would be completely useless (even if I were
<br>
smart enough) for anything resembling a creative-participatory rule in
<br>
creating a Friendly singularity. I'm sure that, to a great extent,
<br>
many of these problems could be mostly worked-around by the proper
<br>
social environment, like a Manhattan or Apollo project. (Problems like
<br>
depression or psychosis can't, but ADD can.)
<br>
<p>But for most circumstances, problems like mine are a huge handicap,
<br>
and at my level of intelligence, a vastly more significant bottleneck
<br>
than IQ. Especially, problems like mine can keep me and others like me
<br>
from getting the education (self- or not) and the recognition needed
<br>
to be selected into programs that can provide the right kind of
<br>
supporting environment to work around these problems. With the right
<br>
upbringing and early education, I may have never been seriously
<br>
adversely affected by this things.
<br>
<p>While ADD is particularly my problem, I'm certain that there are other
<br>
kinds of afflictions that produce similar effects.
<br>
<p>I don't think my problems are all that unusual among genius-types,
<br>
which is why I think they're relevant to the list and the discussion.
<br>
Others may disagree, of course.
<br>
