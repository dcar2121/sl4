<p>I think we're looking at something completely different... the 90s were 
<br>
given by tremendous intellectual
<br>
vitality, and tremendous amounts of money and energy being invested in 
<br>
moving the race dramatically
<br>
forward.
<br>
<p>The millenium has been marked by tremendous backlash; the explosive 
<br>
growth of fundamentalist religion
<br>
especially in the first world nations, a virtual collapse of support for 
<br>
science and engineering as the best
<br>
and perhaps only answer to human sustainability, and an overwhelming 
<br>
struggle for those in power and
<br>
wealth to hold on to that power and wealth at any cost (up to and 
<br>
including killing the very goose that lays
<br>
the golden eggs.) We seem to be caught up in the lethargy caused by 
<br>
profound cynicism and resignation.
<br>
Worse, a lot of really brilliant people are living in/on hope/denial... 
<br>
and we really need to get back to the
<br>
business of growing the future.
<br>
<p>I think it's imperative that we begin at the societal level, and begin 
<br>
teaching our children that they are the
<br>
future, and that blazing the way to a bright and powerful tomorrow is 
<br>
way cooler that playing &quot;Gangsta&quot;,
<br>
or commiting acts of virtual mayhem on portable game stations (not that 
<br>
the two a necessarily mutually
<br>
exclusive.) Done properly we might begin stemming the tidal wave of 
<br>
highschool drop outs and college
<br>
failures marking the latest generation of Americans.
<br>
<p>A failure to do such, bodes poorly for the vision we all so passionately 
<br>
embrace, and has us looking
<br>
squarely in the face of a slow and hot spiral into oblivion for 
<br>
humanity, and the vast majority of higher
<br>
life forms currently enjoying the planet.
