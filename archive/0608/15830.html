</em><br>
The problem is not that morality doesn't evolve rapidly, but that rapid 
<br>
has a different meaning when applied to technological flowering and to 
<br>
cultural habits.  Morality does evolve quite rapidly, in any ranking of 
<br>
social habits and customs.  It can turn on it's head in 40 years.  But 
<br>
the last forty years took us from mainframes to the World Wide Web and 
<br>
from 300 baud modems to broad-band connections that are artificially 
<br>
limited to the slow speed of 240 Kilobaud (peak).   It also took us from 
<br>
a world where homosexuality wasn't talked about...but usually wasn't 
<br>
considered important (unless you were a politician or a minister) to a 
<br>
world dominated by AIDS.  From a world where all diseases were about to 
<br>
be wiped out, to a world where new exotic and virulent diseases were 
<br>
being imported from distant corners of the globe (or at least where this 
<br>
threatened).  It took us from a world where genes as the basic unit of 
<br>
evolution was a heretical new theory to a world where epigenetics has to 
<br>
fight against for acceptance...because the &quot;Selfish Gene&quot; has such a 
<br>
powerful hold on people's minds. 
<br>
<p>But note that evolution is still not accepted by most people.  Nearly 
<br>
150 years and people still don't accept it.  And most of the ones that 
<br>
do accept it don't understand what they're accepting, but they've 
<br>
decided to accept the term, without understanding the referent...or 
<br>
misunderstanding it.
<br>
<p>Morality is a social way of aiding individuals to come to socially 
<br>
responsible choices without understanding what's behind them.  It's 
<br>
originally taught through traditional means.  (Usually by the parents.)  
<br>
It depends on &quot;hooking into&quot; certain mental &quot;vulnerabilities&quot; that we 
<br>
have built into us.  (E.g., &quot;parents are more trustworthy than 
<br>
strangers&quot; is probably built-in.)  These vulnerabilities allow us to be 
<br>
taught to behave in &quot;customary ways&quot; without understanding why.  An 
<br>
adult is someone who makes &quot;small corrections&quot; in the model before 
<br>
passing it on to the next generation.  But notice that this system has 
<br>
hysteresis built into it.  Parents teach their children not what they 
<br>
have learned works, but a mix of what they have learned works, and what 
<br>
THEY were taught.  I doubt that the system can adapt to changes on a 
<br>
shorter time-scale than 20 years...unless the changes themselves are 
<br>
either episodic or periodic.  Neither of those describes a technological 
<br>
flowering. 
<br>
<p>Note that I'm avoiding the term &quot;Singularity&quot;.  One doesn't need a rate 
<br>
of change even approaching that to cause a thorough breakdown of 
<br>
&quot;traditional morality&quot;.   What changes would &quot;positronic robots with the 
<br>
3 laws&quot; cause?  All traditional labor would immediately become obsolete, 
<br>
but then how do people &quot;earn a living&quot;?  (Warning:  We are a good 
<br>
portion of the way there, people have seen it coming for 50 years or 
<br>
more, and we don't have the glimmer of an answer.)  What changes would 
<br>
&quot;free energy&quot; cause?  (Robot factories building solar cells + 
<br>
supercapacitors yield a system that approaches that.  Free...but not 
<br>
unlimited in quantity.)  This kind of change comes faster and faster 
<br>
even WITHOUT a Singularity.  And traditional morality can't cope with 
<br>
it.   This month someone announced &quot;mitochondrial repair&quot; on a mouse.  
<br>
It extended the mouse's life to the equivalent of 125 years for a human 
<br>
without noticeable adverse effects.  But it was done when the mouse was 
<br>
quite young.  They proposed a technique that *MIGHT* work on elderly 
<br>
adults.  It was done with a simple injection (of a complex substance).  
<br>
What happens to morality if people stop aging?  (Actually, most of this 
<br>
change has already happened, as parents no longer typically die just as 
<br>
their children are 20-30.  So the kids already are adapting to living as 
<br>
adults while their parents are still alive and healthy.)
<br>
<p>Morality adapts rapidly.  But it also has numerous breakdown modes.  
<br>
They don't all result in savagery.  Think of the &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; as 
<br>
preparation for drastic changes.  Notice how common fantasy has become.  
<br>
Also notice that fantasy normally operates in certain conventional 
<br>
modes.  Those rigidities are warning posts for changes that are likely 
<br>
to yield savage breakdowns.  They reveal directions that people don't 
<br>
like to think.
