<em>&gt;So you think goodness and evil are inherent, objective, context-free

</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  And at the root of the difference between times leading to war 
<br>
and times of peace is population growth in excess of economic growth.
<br>
<p>I ran into this on the Wikipedia recently on the entry &quot;War&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;Malthusian theories
<br>
<p>&quot;Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, wrote, &quot;For this 
<br>
land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the 
<br>
mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely 
<br>
furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and 
<br>
devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in 
<br>
civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your 
<br>
quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulcher; wrest that land 
<br>
from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the 
<br>
Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations 
<br>
and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766 - 1834) wrote that populations 
<br>
always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine.
<br>
<p>&quot;This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease 
<br>
in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the developed world, 
<br>
where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much 
<br>
larger population than was formerly the case, and where birth control has 
<br>
dramatically slowed the increase in population.&quot;
<br>
<p>Evolutionary psychology and memetics provide the evolved mechanisms.
<br>
<p>It's a depressing model.
<br>
<p>Most likely outcome is a massive die back of the human population in wars.
<br>
<p>But Northern Ireland is an example of how low birth rates can eventually 
<br>
turn off population support for warriors.  (A massive rise in income from 
<br>
technological advances should work too.)
