Of course IQ matters but I still think that, once one has a
<br>
sufficiently high IQ, there are things that matter more for real
<br>
achievement. I will agree that the emotional intelligence mantra has
<br>
been used to justify some amount of BS, but the fact remains that how
<br>
you handle people matters more than how you handle symbols on a piece
<br>
of paper.
<br>
The real world is *complex* and one has to deal with complexity. I
<br>
trust you will agree that a person is more complex than triangles and
<br>
circles.
<br>
Sorry to put it in these blunt terms but I used to be one of those
<br>
high IQ kids who would have happily traded a few IQ points for some
<br>
more people skills. I did learn some people skills along the way, but
<br>
there are people who handle &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; issues naturally.
<br>
These tend to be the real achievers, of course if they *also* have a
<br>
sufficiently high IQ.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all.  I meant that, according to the study, IQ differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *over 150 or so* don't matter all that much, in the same way that IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences under 50 probably don't matter all that much.  It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter if your IQ is 20 or 50, you're incredibly retarded either way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 150 is a very, very high threshold, just beyond the third sigma, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only corresponds to 1/1000 of the population.  The difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ 150 and IQ 140 is huge, and the difference between IQ 140 and IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 130 is huge.  This is why Eliezer writes about prospective seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers, &quot;If we were to try quantifying the level of brainpower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary, our guess is that it's around the 10,000:1 or 100,000:1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level.&quot;  The difference between 160 and 150 could also be huge, I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posted the article link to get some discussion started on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please, please, please at least skim this paper:

<em>&gt; The idea that IQ doesn't matter &quot;all that much&quot; is among the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequently repeated myths with the greatest amount of available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence to demolish it.  The whole &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; thing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pop-psychological nonsense, considered fringe thinking by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream psych community.  IQ matters for social skills.  IQ matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for real-life achievement.  IQ matters for common sense.  IQ matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for which people will be able to wrap their brains around what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing in this post and for which people it will go in one ear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And by the way, discussions of IQ are most definitely SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conversations about intelligence and comparisons between intraspecies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and interspecies intelligence differentials make up the core of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument that most people on this list *still* don't understand: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is about smartness, not technology, and the second you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build something smarter than you, everything we know flies out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; window.
