<em>&gt;&gt; Perhaps greater exposure to the high speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; development in computers has something to do with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In the early 1970's I helped build the world's slowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; computer (max speed of 2 Hz), as a teaching tool in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; high school.  It used electromechanical relays to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; operate.  Circa 1930 this would have been the fastest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; available technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The 'real' computer we had in the computer lab was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an IBM 1620.  I don't remember it's speed, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; had 16K of ram in a console the size of a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rolltop desk, and 10 MB hard drive the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a washing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Since my current PC has 50,000x the memory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 12,000x the storage in something like 1/1,000th
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the volume, it's reasonable to me to extrapolate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; similar large jumps in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, I think it's not even a problem of people being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the singularity. Right now, I would say the problem is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental - people don't even hear about it. I'd say that even most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer programmers don't know about it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, even in the cases that people have heard about it and don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it, I don't think it's a matter of understanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution on computer speed and capacity. I'd say it has more to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the fact that many educated people have a very rough idea of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our brain works, and an even rougher idea of what things a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do and how it does those things. Those two things combined cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people not to understand how a computer could simulate/emulate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't know if the average computer user has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as visceral a feel for the improvements that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have been happening.  To them the change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; screen size from 13&quot; to 19&quot; over 10 years might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seem like a doubling of screen real estate, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Windows takes as ong to boot up as it did 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; years ago, so it doesn't feel like a big change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not true, Windows XP takes much less time to boot up than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows 95... I think people who have been around for 10 years know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty well that computers evolved both qualitatively and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantitatively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
On identical hardware?  I'm sorry, but I don't think so.  Mind you, I 
<br>
don't really have any experience of MSWind XP, so I could be wrong, but 
<br>
I *think* you're noticing faster CPUs and disk drives.
