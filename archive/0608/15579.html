</em><br>
<p>As you're poking around the edge of this problem, let me make a few
<br>
observations:
<br>
<p>The concept of &quot;the human utility function&quot; is increasingly invalid as
<br>
individual human agents and their environment become increasingly
<br>
complex.  While we can usefully refer to certain &quot;universal human
<br>
values&quot;, such as the strong desire to protect and advance one's
<br>
offspring, even those are contingent.  More fundamental principles of
<br>
synergetic cooperation and growth provide a more effective and
<br>
persistent basis for future &quot;moral&quot; decision-making.
<br>
<p>Your statement &quot;some we might want a superintelligence to maximize...&quot;
<br>
obscures the problem of promoting human values with the presumption
<br>
that &quot;a superintelligence&quot; is a necessary part of the solution.  It
<br>
would be clearer and more conducive to an accurate description of the
<br>
problem to say &quot;some values we may wish to maximize, others to
<br>
satisfice.&quot;
<br>
<p>If we were to further abstract the problem statement, we might arrive
<br>
at something like recognition of every agent's desire to promote its
<br>
(evolving) values over increasing scope.  This subsumes the preceding
<br>
dichotomy between maximizing and satisficing with the realization that
<br>
each mode is effective within its particular limited context toward
<br>
promoting growth in the larger context.
<br>
<p>Given the preceding problem statement, it becomes obvious that the
<br>
solution requires two fundamental components:  (1) increasing
<br>
awareness of our values (those which are increasingly shared because
<br>
they work (passing the test of competition within a coevolutionary
<br>
environment), and (2) increasing awareness of principles of action
<br>
that effectively promote our values (this is our increasingly
<br>
subjective scientific/instrumental knowledge.)
<br>
<p>Note that this approach is inherently evolutionary.  There is no
<br>
static solution to the moral problem within a coevolutionary scenario.
<br>
&nbsp;But there are increasingly effective principles of what works to
<br>
maximize the growth of what we increasingly see as increasingly good.
<br>
<p>Back to the presumption of &quot;a superintelligence.&quot;  This phrasing
<br>
implies an independent entity and reflects the common assumption that
<br>
we must turn to an intelligence greater than us, and separate from us,
<br>
to save us from our critical problems.  Such a concept resonates
<br>
deeply within us and our culture but the concept is flawed.  We are
<br>
conditioned to expect that a greater entity (our parents?, our god?)
<br>
will know what is best and act in our interests.
<br>
<p>It's time for humanity to grow up and begin taking full responsibility
<br>
for ourselves and our way forward.   We can and will do that when we
<br>
are ready to implement a framework for #1 and #2 above.  It will
<br>
likely begin as a platform for social decision-making optimizing
<br>
objective outcomes based on subjective values in the entertainment
<br>
domain, and then when people begin to recognize its effectiveness, it
<br>
may extend to address what we currently think of as political issues.
<br>
<p>You were right to refer to a superintelligence, but that
<br>
superintelligence will not be one separate from humanity.  It will be
<br>
a superintelligence made up of humanity.
