Jef,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concept of &quot;the human utility function&quot; is increasingly invalid as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual human agents and their environment become increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex.  While we can usefully refer to certain &quot;universal human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values&quot;, such as the strong desire to protect and advance one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offspring, even those are contingent.  More fundamental principles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synergetic cooperation and growth provide a more effective and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistent basis for future &quot;moral&quot; decision-making.
</em><br>
<p>The phrase &quot;human utility function&quot; simply implies, in a broad sense,
<br>
that our desires are not random.  Anything that isn't purely random
<br>
has some kind of statistical structure, as our utility function does.
<br>
It doesn't mean that we're trying to reduce all human desires to a set
<br>
of equations and hand them to an AI that monolithically enforces them
<br>
for all eternity.  Contingencies, synergetic cooperation, growth,
<br>
etc., are all forms of moral information content that we want to pass
<br>
on to our species-children (AI).  We have to pass *something* on, and
<br>
we have to pass it on in the form of algorithms, although these
<br>
algorithms can be very open-ended and evolve over time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your statement &quot;some we might want a superintelligence to maximize...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obscures the problem of promoting human values with the presumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;a superintelligence&quot; is a necessary part of the solution.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be clearer and more conducive to an accurate description of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem to say &quot;some values we may wish to maximize, others to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfice.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There is no &quot;final solution&quot; to the problem of morality, most likely.
<br>
If there is, we may discover it in millions of years.  A
<br>
superintelligence isn't meant to be a &quot;solution to morality&quot; per se.
<br>
It's just that, with computers and theory of AI being what it is, we
<br>
will eventually have to face superintelligence for sure, so whatever
<br>
solution we come up with to having a Nice Place to Live after
<br>
superintelligence arrives will inevitably involve whatever initial
<br>
conditions we decide to put into it.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure we want to maximize any values, because then by
<br>
definition they would override all others, unless their maximization
<br>
still leaves many degrees of freedom.  In general, when something is
<br>
maximized by a truckload of optimization pressure, it reduces the
<br>
possible degrees of freedom for future states.  In a certain sense, we
<br>
*want* this - &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in the thermodynamic sense is
<br>
radically different than &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in the sociopolitical
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we were to further abstract the problem statement, we might arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at something like recognition of every agent's desire to promote its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (evolving) values over increasing scope.  This subsumes the preceding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dichotomy between maximizing and satisficing with the realization that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each mode is effective within its particular limited context toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting growth in the larger context.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, maximizing or satisficing subgoals can be useful towards
<br>
maximizing some supergoal.  Don't be misled by the term &quot;supergoal&quot;
<br>
here - it can be an exabytes-large utility function that encourages
<br>
growth wholeheartedly while discouraging destruction, mayhem, torture,
<br>
or what have you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the preceding problem statement, it becomes obvious that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution requires two fundamental components:  (1) increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of our values (those which are increasingly shared because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they work (passing the test of competition within a coevolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment), and (2) increasing awareness of principles of action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that effectively promote our values (this is our increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective scientific/instrumental knowledge.)
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  These are things that would flow naturally from the correct
<br>
implementation of a CEV model.  Our smarter selves would want us to
<br>
increase awareness of our values and principles of action that
<br>
effectively promote those values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that this approach is inherently evolutionary.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; static solution to the moral problem within a coevolutionary scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But there are increasingly effective principles of what works to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximize the growth of what we increasingly see as increasingly good.
</em><br>
<p>No one ever suggested a static solution.  Only the Three Laws are
<br>
static.  The CFAI model is not static (have you read it?)  The CEV
<br>
model is also by no means static.  The post-CEV theorizing that goes
<br>
on today is not static either.  (Not to imply that CEV is being
<br>
ditched, just that more theorizing is going on after the document was
<br>
originally penned.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Back to the presumption of &quot;a superintelligence.&quot;  This phrasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies an independent entity and reflects the common assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we must turn to an intelligence greater than us, and separate from us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to save us from our critical problems.  Such a concept resonates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply within us and our culture but the concept is flawed.  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditioned to expect that a greater entity (our parents?, our god?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will know what is best and act in our interests.
</em><br>
<p>We are all operating on the assumption that when we build a
<br>
smarter-than-human intelligence, it will be capable of rapidly
<br>
bootstrapping to superintelligence, no matter what we do.  This is
<br>
because of the smartness effect, the ability to integrate new
<br>
cognitive hardware, run cognitive processes very quickly, etc.  If you
<br>
believe that we will build an AI and it will remain in the same
<br>
general intelligence/ability range as ourselves, then this entire
<br>
discussion is moot.
<br>
<p>We aren't grabbing towards a higher intelligence to solve our problems
<br>
because we want our daddies.  We are phrasing these discussions in
<br>
terms of superintelligence because we see the abrupt emergence of
<br>
superintelligence as *inevitable*.  Again, if you don't, this whole
<br>
discussion is close to pointless.  Sure, if you don't believe that
<br>
superintelligence is around the corner, you will put everything
<br>
towards working with what we have today - humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's time for humanity to grow up and begin taking full responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ourselves and our way forward.   We can and will do that when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are ready to implement a framework for #1 and #2 above.  It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely begin as a platform for social decision-making optimizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective outcomes based on subjective values in the entertainment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain, and then when people begin to recognize its effectiveness, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may extend to address what we currently think of as political issues.
</em><br>
<p>We can do all this, and then someone builds a superintelligence that
<br>
maximizes for paperclips, and we all die.  Looks like we should've
<br>
been working on goal content for that first seed AI, huh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You were right to refer to a superintelligence, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence will not be one separate from humanity.  It will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a superintelligence made up of humanity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Global Brain, metaman, etc.  This is all well and good, but a
<br>
community of chimps networked together with the best computing
<br>
technology and decision systems does not make a human.  We are talking
<br>
about building something godlike, so it doesn't make sense to refer to
<br>
it in the same way we refer to humans, no more than it makes sense to
<br>
talk about chimps in the same way we talk about humans.
<br>
<p>Singularitarians believe in the technological feasibility of something
<br>
- building a recursively self-improving optimization process that
<br>
starts from a buildable software program.  Our arguments for the speed
<br>
and intensity of the self-improvement process come from cognitive
<br>
science and comparisons of the relative advantages of humans and AIs.
<br>
(<a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/articles/relativeadvantages.htm">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/articles/relativeadvantages.htm</a>)
<br>
You obviously dont believe that the self-improvement process in AIs
<br>
will play out at this speed, otherwise we would be on the same page.
<br>
We are talking superior intelligence capable of developing
<br>
nanotechnology and whatever comes after that, with the resources to
<br>
rip apart this planet in seconds, minutes, hours, whatever.  That's
<br>
what we consider to be the natural consequence once a seed AI really
<br>
gets going.  The challenge is specifying its initial motivations in
<br>
such a way that it values us specifically and contributes to what we
<br>
see as growth rather than what it sees as growth, which could be
<br>
anything if we don't program it right.
<br>
<p>Do you agree with the point of view and points argued in this article?
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html">http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html</a>
<br>
<p>If not, we are talking past each other, in this context.
