<em>&gt; I'm always disappointed when important questions like this are being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignored, especially by those who claim to know the answer. It's a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single most important question in AI, still, after 50 years from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth of the field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is intelligence, exactly? What functions are necessary and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient for creation of a thought? What is a mechanism of thought?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me offer a car-human analogy which will hopefully make clear what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of answers others and I are probably seeking here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The purpose of a car is to transport people to their desired 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destinations. If we strip down the car to its necessary and sufficient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements that serve its purpose we'll end up with the engine, all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery that transfers motion to wheels, and the single structure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that houses all that plus the passengers. (A car stereo is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary nor sufficient to transport people so it must be left out :)).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could generalize the analogy and think about this in terms of means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transport, with a car, a bike, a motorcycle being just different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementations of the same idea, namely, that in order to change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locations one needs &quot;the engine&quot;, a mechanism that transfers motion to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other parts of the machine and a structure that houses all the these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts and the passengers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans, like a car as an example of *a* thing that transports people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just one of many possible implementation of intelligence. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone wanted to build a machine whose purpose would be to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, what would its &quot;engine&quot;, &quot;the mechanism for transferring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motion&quot;, and the &quot;structure that houses all the parts of machine&quot; be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having established that, we could then apply this process down to each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual part of the machine in order to implement &quot;the engine&quot; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence by focusing on its necessary and sufficient functions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that serve its purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If anyone is capable of answering these questions with a necessarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high degree of confidence, please do offer your insight.

I am speaking from a philosophical perspective...
<br>
<p>Well, I would say there are two things that define human minds -- 
<br>
ability to work out how to do difficult things, and self-consciousness.
<br>
<p>The ability to work out how to do difficult things does seem to me to be 
<br>
dependent on self-consciousness. I can imagine at least domain-specific 
<br>
software which is able to overcome new challenges without being 
<br>
self-conscious.
<br>
<p>I'm going to call the ability to work out how to do difficult things 
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot;.
<br>
<p>In animals, self-consciousness seems to scale with intelligence. This 
<br>
correlation seems very strong, so I posit a link.
<br>
<p>I'm going to say that a thought is the consciousness of an element of 
<br>
the processes of intelligence. In order to have a thought, one needs to 
<br>
be conscious and intelligent.
<br>
<p>I don't understand how to express this in terms of 'functions' because I 
<br>
don't understand what you mean by the term. However, the relevant 
<br>
concepts or necessary conditions I think are consciousness and 
<br>
intelligence. They are probably also sufficient, but I haven't thought 
<br>
it through. Memory is also probably required.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
