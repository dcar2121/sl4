<p>
I do not fit the stereotype of the Wise.  I am not Gandalf, Ged, or 
<br>
Gandhi.  I do not sit amidst my quiet garden, staring deeply into the 
<br>
truths engraved in a flower or a drop of dew; speaking courteously to 
<br>
all who come before me, and answering them gently regardless of how they 
<br>
speak to me.
<br>
<p>If I tried to look Wise, and succeeded, I would receive more respect 
<br>
from my fellows.  But there would be a price, one I will not pay.
<br>
<p>To pretend to be Wise means that you must always appear to give people 
<br>
the benefit of the doubt, and pretend to believe the best of them.  Thus 
<br>
people will admire you for your innocence and courtesy.  But this is not 
<br>
always true; and that which can be destroyed by the truth should be.
<br>
<p>To pretend to be Wise, you must always pretend that both sides have 
<br>
merit, and solemnly refuse to judge between them.  For if you took one 
<br>
side or another, why then, you would no longer be one of the aloof Wise, 
<br>
but merely another partisan, on a level with all the other mere 
<br>
bickerers.  As one of the Wise, you are omnipotent on the condition that 
<br>
you never exercise your power.  Otherwise people would start thinking 
<br>
that you were no better than they; and they would no longer hold you in awe.
<br>
<p>Oftimes it is greatly convenient, to pretend to be Wise.  When any 
<br>
conflict breaks out, you can sternly chide both sides, saying:  &quot;You are 
<br>
equally at fault; you must learn to see each other's viewpoints.  I am 
<br>
older and more mature, and I say to you: stop this pointless bickering, 
<br>
children, for you begin to annoy me.  Ponder well the wisdom of having 
<br>
everyone get along!&quot;  You do not need to examine the dispute, nor wonder 
<br>
if perhaps one side does have more merit than the other.  You need not 
<br>
judge between two sides, and risk having your judgment turn out to be 
<br>
embarassingly wrong, or risk having your judgment questioned as though 
<br>
you were only another ordinary mortal.  Indeed you must not ask 
<br>
questions, you must not judge; for if you take sides, you will at once 
<br>
lose your reputation for being Wise, which requires that you stand 
<br>
forever above the fray.
<br>
<p>But truth is not handed out in equal parts before the start of a dispute.
<br>
<p>And I am not one of the Wise.  Even if I wished to be, it is not within 
<br>
my nature.  I watch for logical flaws with falcon's eye; when I see an 
<br>
opening I strike like a snake; I do not sheathe my claws or blunt my 
<br>
teeth; this is my nature.  Also in my nature is that I do not hesitate 
<br>
to place my reputation in jeopardy to aid the side I believe is right. 
<br>
Even if it makes me seem but an ordinary mortal, no better than any 
<br>
other in the fray.  The respect I have earned, I have earned by other 
<br>
ways than by appearing gravely solemn; and respect has no purpose but 
<br>
what it can accomplish.  Respect is not to be hoarded, but spent.  Even 
<br>
when those pretending to be Wise chide me, saying:  &quot;Stop this pointless 
<br>
bickering, child!&quot; - yet I will not pretend to neutrality, nor rise 
<br>
above the fray.
<br>
<p>For not all conflicts are balanced; indeed an exactly balanced conflict 
<br>
is very rare.  Sometimes - indeed often - I have struck out against both 
<br>
sides in a dispute, saying:  &quot;You are both wrong; here is the third 
<br>
way.&quot;  But never have I told both sides of a dispute:  &quot;It doesn't 
<br>
matter who started it, just end it.&quot;  This is the path of convenience to 
<br>
yourself, and it comes at a cost to others; it is selfish.  There are 
<br>
aggressors and aggressed, in wars.  When some small nation is invaded by 
<br>
another, or is provoked endlessly, or when one nation provokes another 
<br>
and that other responds disproportionately; then it may prove convenient 
<br>
indeed to the Great Powers, to pretend that all violence is equally 
<br>
wrong and equally the fault of all sides, and selfishly seek a truce for 
<br>
this year, this election.  The Great Powers have no need to take sides, 
<br>
when they can more easily tell the two edges of the gaping wound:  &quot;Oh, 
<br>
just stop fighting, you foolish children!&quot;  Ignoring the rottenness 
<br>
inside, the festering horror, and perhaps the true evil... but that is 
<br>
pragmatism to a Great Power, which only wishes that the boat should go 
<br>
unrocked, and does not truly care for the health of lesser nations.
<br>
<p>And so too with those who pretend to be Wise: who pretend that there is 
<br>
no aggrieved, that there is no long-term problem to be addressed, that 
<br>
no side is ever in the right nor another in the wrong; that there are no 
<br>
causes for conflicts, only fools who are not Wise and who will 
<br>
spontaneously strike out at each other for no reason.  It only takes one 
<br>
to start a war.  But the Wise cannot acknowledge this in any particular 
<br>
case, for then they would be taking sides, and they would not be above 
<br>
the fray, merely another combatant.  They would lose the awe, in which 
<br>
the Wise are held, and which they most earnestly desire.
<br>
<p>I do not say that the Wise do this deliberately; but it is the 
<br>
constraint that settles around them, the invisible chain that governs 
<br>
their behavior.  No doubt the Wise truly believe that the combatants are 
<br>
but spoiled children; for if the Wise ceased to believe this, they would 
<br>
have to act, and no longer appear Wise.
<br>
<p>Have you not met them? the principal who cares not which child started 
<br>
it? the Chair who is above the mere fray of corporate politics? the 
<br>
Great Power who demands only an immediate truce? the priest who says 
<br>
that all alike are sinners and all must repent? the boss who sternly 
<br>
dictates that the conflict end now? have you not met them, the Wise?
<br>
<p>To care about the public image of any virtue - whether that virtue be 
<br>
charity, or wisdom, or rationality itself - is to limit your performance 
<br>
of that virtue to what all others already understand of it.  Therefore 
<br>
those who would walk the Way of any virtue must first relinquish all 
<br>
desire to appear virtuous before others, for this will limit and 
<br>
constrain their understanding of the virtue.  To earn the respect of 
<br>
others is not hard, if you have a little talent, if that is the limit of 
<br>
your desire.  But to know what is true, or to do what is right - that is 
<br>
far harder than convincing an audience of your wisdom.  I am not Wise, 
<br>
and I will not be Wise, and no one can be Wise if they would follow the 
<br>
Way of rationality.
<br>
<p>For the eye of the Wise is blinded, and it may sometimes miss the 
<br>
gapingly obvious.
