<p>
Jef,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I like that Eliezer is exploring this area, but I'm far from agreeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is the overwhelming priority that it's portrayed to be by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain elite set of people.
</em><br>
<p>These people number in the many hundreds or even thousands, and come
<br>
from diverse sources... it's unfortunate that you have to take this
<br>
tone just because we have different estimates regarding the
<br>
technological feasibility of AGI.  Nick Bostrom views Friendly AI as
<br>
an overwhelming priority, for example, and it's very difficult to
<br>
accuse him of elitism or closed-mindedness.  In fact, he is better
<br>
educated than all of us and his worldview is the paragon of objective
<br>
neutrality.
<br>
<p>This list is called &quot;SL4&quot;, so you should expect people here to hold
<br>
SL4 views.  It's okay if you're SL3 - just because SL4 has a higher
<br>
number attached to it doesn't necessarily mean it's better or more
<br>
correct, just more extreme-sounding.  But it's useless to talk to an
<br>
SL4 with SL3 or SL2 language.
<br>
<p>Not to discourage you from posting here - what you have to say is
<br>
welcome - but I really do think that you will find more people that
<br>
share your views on the extropians and wta-talk lists.  Us, well, we
<br>
seem to be consumed by this concept known as the hard takeoff...
<br>
<p>With regards to your remarks on morality being the product of billions
<br>
of years of synergetic evolution, there's an interesting experiment
<br>
for me to bring up.  If I had an atomic-level scanner and
<br>
sophisticated nanotechnology, I could simply pick the most benevolent
<br>
person (probably a girl) that I know, and press a button to copy them
<br>
repeatedly.  I would be making the world a better place, without
<br>
understanding an iota about the billions of years of synergetic
<br>
evolution underlying morality.  Small wonder!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, I'm not trying to win an argument here so I'll let it rest, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do occasionally wish to contribute what I see as a worthwhile view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if it doesn't support this particular version of Pascal's Wager.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you're using spiteful and frustrated language here, which is unnecessary.
<br>
<p><pre>
