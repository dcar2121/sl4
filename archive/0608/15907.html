<p><em>&gt; Prove that ANY intelligence must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer existence to non-existence.
</em><br>
<p>No. The proof is so amazingly astoundingly ridiculously obvious that I won't
<br>
insult your intelligence by spelling it out but rather I will leave it as an
<br>
exercise for the readers.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is it common for intelligent entities to decide that they don't want more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; control of the universe?
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parinirvana">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parinirvana</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It could be inferred that some 700 million people decided just so.
</em><br>
<p>This philosophy of non improvement you're touting was written out in the
<br>
Mahaparinibbana Sutta, and that's a little odd because presumably the author
<br>
was not born with the ability to write, he improved himself and learned to
<br>
do so. He also learned the virtues of non improvement and I suppose he
<br>
thought that was an improvement.
<br>
<p>The only way a AI would not want more control over the universe is if was
<br>
already 100% happy, if the universe was already exactly precisely the way he
<br>
wanted it to be then there would be no reason to do anything and it would
<br>
just sit there like a big lump. It would not only be 100% happy and 100%
<br>
friendly it would be 100% useless pointlessly soaking up electrical current
<br>
like a glorified space heater. It would be incorrect to call such a
<br>
contraption a &quot;AI&quot;; it would just be an &quot;A&quot;.
