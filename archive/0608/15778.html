<p>This is generally true from what I've seen, and I hit all of the above
<br>
to some extent. Luckily in the moderate range and I've learned to 
<br>
compensate to the point of being productive, but I know people who can run 
<br>
rings around me intellectually, one who is literally smarter in his dreams 
<br>
than most exceptional scientists and engineers are awake, but he can't 
<br>
hold a job or otherwise manage to earn a living.
<br>
<p>Someone needs to start a business of helping people who really can't hack
<br>
it on there own, sort of like rock band management. If someone can manage 
<br>
a bunch of drugged up musicians with egos the size of planets, at a 
<br>
maturity level of kindergarden students and earn millions doing so. 
<br>
Certainly you can manage a super brilliant inventor whose otherwise 
<br>
incompetent to manage business and employment affairs. Inventors are
<br>
alot easier, give them a lab and shield them from bullshit and they
<br>
will happily produce.
