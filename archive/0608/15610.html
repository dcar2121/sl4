&quot;So finally I was able to understand that if I believe this is _true_ - which
<br>
I do - then I can accept a 99% probability that we will fail...&quot;
<br>
<p>Hmm, interesting. It seems you've identified, and are experiencing, a relatively 
<br>
newly emerged example that may be one tiny member of a large class of 
<br>
psychological factors probably worth being added to Bostrom's existential risks 
<br>
work. Has he or anyone done any work on establishing whether particular belief 
<br>
systems/religions might actually increase (or decrease) existential risks?
<br>
<p>Probably not a very politically correct or easy subject to delve into, yet this 
<br>
is the same exact kind of factor that makes me uneasy having highly religious 
<br>
Presidents here in the USA who seem to privately believe &quot;A coming apocalypse is 
<br>
an unavoidable part of future reality, and not a bad thing because some will go 
<br>
to Heaven.&quot; I worry that subconscious factors involved with faith-based 
<br>
reality-view belief systems could affect important decision making if one were 
<br>
not superhumanly vigilant in remaining unbiased. Even if it shifts your 
<br>
priorities by a few percentage points, it might be important. Maybe you don't 
<br>
put in those extra 15 minutes a day on your work, or you take long vacations at 
<br>
your Texas ranch instead of learning more, and you miss something important, or 
<br>
your world-improving AGI is less optimized and a year later than it could have 
<br>
been so another 200k people die. Etc.
<br>
<p>The key problem I see with your particular belief system is that rather than 
<br>
providing you with access to important new realizations through acceptance of 
<br>
high likelihood of local failure, it could instead lead you astray by providing 
<br>
in the end what looks like yet another form of as you say &quot;a need to deny the 
<br>
possibility of failure&quot;. Except rather than outright denying it up front, you're 
<br>
just moving things around slightly and saying failure in this and many other 
<br>
localities is ok as long as not everywhere fails - you still apparently have the 
<br>
need in the end to deny to yourself that total failure could occur. So are you 
<br>
really the ultimate pessimist, or are you slyly giving yourself a crutch? If 
<br>
your currently unprovable belief system turns out to be wrong, and if it has had 
<br>
any then-negative influence upon your cumulative decision-making throughout your 
<br>
life up until that point, then that is a potentially large oops.
