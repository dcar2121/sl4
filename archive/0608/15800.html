Both memetic and genetic natural selection are inextricably interrelated.
<br>
The homo-sapien cognitive architecture substrate results from the genetic
<br>
natural selection of all human ancestry. This architecture defined the
<br>
original social organization (mortality) of our primate forbears. Memetic
<br>
natural selection comes into play and dominates the evolutionary replication
<br>
process with the arrival of language (especially written language). However
<br>
memes cannot remain successful replicators if they do not aid in the
<br>
survival of the host's genes. For this reason memetic fitness is mostly a
<br>
function of societies and not persons. A memetically fit cultural ethos is
<br>
an ethos that can efficiently organize a society so that it can successfully
<br>
compete against other societies for resources. With out a memetically fit
<br>
ethos (morality) a society/culture degenerates and sufferers form being
<br>
either absorbed by a more memetically fit culture or that society/culture
<br>
will suffer from memo/genocide. In the past more monolithic cultures would
<br>
label any behaviour that does not conform to that cultures ethos as
<br>
&quot;immoral&quot;. And in many cases such persons would be put to death for their
<br>
crimes.
<br>
These facts might lead one to the conclusion that morality both arises from,
<br>
and acts upon, genetic evolution. Additionally one might conclude that
<br>
&quot;morality&quot; is in a state of  evolution -constantly changing as certain memes
<br>
become more or less fit according to the pressures of natural selection.

<em>&gt; &gt;With humans you have to look beyond genes. While many animals have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;degree of learning from others, humans have taken this to an extreme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; What you say here invokes the SSSM, the standard social science model.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;react with more horror to the burning of the library of Alexandria than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any given war in history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would venture to say that most have never heard of the library of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alexandria, sad as that might be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Our knowledge and its transmission is now much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;important than individual genetic variation. A genetically &quot;unfit&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;individual with the right knowledge is much more fit than a genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;perfect&quot; individual who is ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We are rapidly heading toward making our genes completely irrelevant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;now gene therapy is available. We are no longer a species that depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the genes of ancestors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That true, but unrelated to the point of how we came to have a sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is moral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The disgust with the burning of the library of Alexandria gives a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hint of the current basis of morality. Its not just about passing on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;genes, few even know or care if Einstein or Plato had children, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rather about insuring the continued existance of human knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;What is good for the survival of genes is environmentally influenced if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;not determined.  So what we consider moral should be flexible to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;environmental situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I could provide and analyze lots of supporting examples.  But can anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;think of a counter example where this is not true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I tend to agree if you replace &quot;gene&quot; with information. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;morality depends on the situation. In general killing is a very bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thing, but if someone was about to take a torch to the last known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;repository of human knowledge I'd kill them and/or sacrifice myself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;save it with the absolutely certainty that I'd done the right thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fortunately this is less and less likely.
