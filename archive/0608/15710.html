Hi,
<br>
<p>On 8/22/06, Michael Vassar &lt;<a href="mailto:michaelvassar@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20A%20study%20comparing%20150%20IQ%2B%20persons%20to%20180%20IQ%2B%20persons">michaelvassar@hotmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:

</em><br>
<p>Sure... but there are many more examples of the latter to draw from...
<br>
<p>Anyway, I don't really find the analysis of human psychometrics all
<br>
that fascinating.  Intelligence is both multidimensional and difficult
<br>
to measure.
<br>
<p>IMO, rather than focusing on **measuring** intelligence, the
<br>
educational and employment and research systems in our society should
<br>
focus creating environments in which people can flexibly and
<br>
creatively explore the  potential of the various dimensions of their
<br>
intelligence...
<br>
<p>As a mildly amusing aside, last spring my 9 year old daughter (in
<br>
spite of being surprisingly non-nerdy for my family) did very well on
<br>
a test and placed into the local &quot;Magnet Elementary School Program for
<br>
the Highly Gifted&quot; starting next month.   What amuses me is the
<br>
nomenclature.  These days, what used to be called the &quot;honors track&quot;
<br>
at the local schools is now called the &quot;Gifted and Talented&quot; track,
<br>
whereas what used to be called the &quot;Gifted Program&quot; is now a program
<br>
for the &quot;Highly Gifted.&quot;  It's not too long before &quot;Gifted&quot; becomes
<br>
repurposed to mean &quot;Normal&quot; and another new word needs to be invented
<br>
for what used to be called &quot;smart&quot; ;-p
<br>
<p>Now, this Program for Highly Gifted is focused on teaching kids in a
<br>
way that encourages them to think and create rather than on learning
<br>
by rote.  But does it really benefit us to offer this kind of
<br>
opportunity only to the kids who score almost-perfectly on some test?
<br>
Rather than focusing on refining these tests (and this is certainly
<br>
not sour grapes: my family always does extremely well on such tests),
<br>
I'd rather see energy put into figuring out how to make the school
<br>
system as a whole focus more on thinking and creating and less on
<br>
rote.
<br>
<p>Yeah, better education costs money.  But obviously, properly-educated
<br>
people do a better job of pushing toward a positive Singularity...
<br>
<p>I won't turn this into a really long off-topic rant on the educational
<br>
system (or, oops, maybe I already did).  But I just wanted to make the
<br>
point that intelligence assessment is really not the most useful thing
<br>
to be thinking about, if we want to talk about human intelligence and
<br>
the Singularity.  We're just not going to be able to make a test that
<br>
will pick the N &quot;smartest&quot; people so we can fund them to create the
<br>
Singularity for us.  Intelligence and humanity are too
<br>
multidimensional for that.  If we want to maximize the odds of
<br>
positive Singularity we should create an environment in which the
<br>
diversity of natural intelligence is generally fostered.
<br>
<p>(Of course, none of that really matters if I'm right about Novamente,
<br>
and the project is properly funded and flourishes and we create a
<br>
superhuman AGI on a time-scale much faster than any education reform
<br>
can plausibly happen.  But if I should get tired of the currently
<br>
frustrating pace of fundraising for Novamente, and take up something
<br>
more entertaining like music or mathematics or proving theorems about
<br>
Friendly Ai instead, then perhaps these comments about education will
<br>
become relevant ;-)

<em>&gt; &gt;And, my conjecture would be that performance on an open-ended IQ test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would correlate slightly better with *dramatic* real-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intellectual achievement than performance on a timed IQ test.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(There are of course many jobs where highly rapid intellectual

<em>&gt; &gt;presumably predict performance at those better.)
