<p><em>&gt; Might I point out the possibility  of one of those good ol' cognitive

<em>&gt; bias here: Many SL4 members have scored high on IQ and similar tests,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are proud of that, and so may place an unresaonable focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing.
</em><br>
<p>This completely untrue.  Both Richard Loosemore and now you are
<br>
accusing me of talking about IQ overmuch because of an assumption that
<br>
I scored high and am proud of it.  But I know for a fact that there
<br>
are many people on this list with a greater IQ than mine.  This silly
<br>
notion - that examining IQ in detail, reading academic papers about
<br>
it, or arguing for its predictive validity are all symptoms of
<br>
irrational exuberance about IQ because of a personal high score.
<br>
<p>In fact, I just watched Anders Sandberg's talk at Transvision 06, and
<br>
practically the entire thing focuses on IQ and its importance.  He
<br>
cites Linda Gottfredson multiple times, as well as citing the Terman
<br>
study.  How come Anders Sandberg can talk for an hour about the
<br>
importance of IQ and everyone is respectful, but when I do the same
<br>
thing I'm being &quot;ridiculous&quot;?
<br>
<p>In his talk (available at <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjrauhal/tv06/">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjrauhal/tv06/</a>),
<br>
he listed many points, including these:
<br>
<p>+1 IQ point = +1.763% income (Schwartz),
<br>
Annual gain / IQ point US $55-65 billion
<br>
0.4-0.5% GDP
<br>
Weiss 1998: 3 point IQ increase:
<br>
Poverty rate			-25%
<br>
Males in jail			-25%
<br>
High school dropouts	-28%
<br>
Parentless children	-20%
<br>
Welfare recipiency	-18%
<br>
Out-of-wedlock births	-15%
<br>
<p>Here is a oft-seen informative chart on IQ he presented:
<br>
<a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/images/IQ.png">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/images/IQ.png</a>
<br>
<p>Intelligence is one of the Singularitarian Principles
<br>
(<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/sing/principles.html#intelligence">http://yudkowsky.net/sing/principles.html#intelligence</a>):
<br>
<p>&quot;At the heart of an appreciation of the Singularity lies an
<br>
appreciation of intelligence.  The Singularity places a horizon across
<br>
our understanding because we can't predict what someone smarter than
<br>
us is going to do; if we could, we'd be that smart ourselves.
<br>
Intelligence isn't just the ability to come up with complex solutions
<br>
to complex problems; it's the ability to see the shortcuts, the simple
<br>
and obvious-in-retrospect solutions to complex problems - even
<br>
emotional or philosophical problems.  Intelligence isn't just
<br>
high-speed thinking, perfect memories, or other party tricks;
<br>
intelligence is also wisdom, and self-awareness, and other things that
<br>
extend into every aspect of mind and personality.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly. But how is the measurement of IQ by tests relevant to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of artificially enhanced intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Some of the same features of IQ test problems will be targetted
<br>
by AI designers as tasks that their system must be able to solve.
<br>
Also, a better understanding of human IQ variance in the space of
<br>
minds-in-general will begin with a thorough analysis of that human
<br>
variance.  This is important to the argument that human-equivalent AI
<br>
is anthropomorphic.  There is no such thing as long-term
<br>
human-equivalent AI: you either have a retard or a superintelligence.
<br>
The transition time from A to B could be measured in the minutes or
<br>
hours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However,  the discussion in this thread  has not been about that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angle, but rather about how to best measure the differences between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans in a way that correlates with real intelligence, and this seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only secondarily relevant to SL4.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It's transhuman intelligence that lies at the heart of the
<br>
Singularity, but we respect intelligence on the human scale as well.
<br>
This respect for intelligence is our shield against being blinded by
<br>
ideology, one of the primary safeguards that prevents
<br>
Singularitarianism from turning into just another banal fanaticism.
<br>
Cloudy thinking in the service of the Singularity wouldn't be a
<br>
virtue; it'd be another dreary manifestation of the same old human
<br>
stupidity that we're trying to get away from.&quot;
