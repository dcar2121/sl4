<p>
I've done some thinking about this.
<br>
<p>The first conclusion I came to is that the morality of an action has
<br>
to do with the amount that it changes the integral of some Value
<br>
function over all space at t=infinity. If you give me any moral
<br>
system, I can give you a Value function like this that would describe
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>The second thing is that for morality to be objective (and I think
<br>
that it is; the idea that morality is just up in the air seems to me
<br>
like people just aren't trying hard enough) the Value function must be
<br>
a physically measurable quantity.
<br>
<p>Next there is the idea that the Value of an object is in tow parts:
<br>
the intrinsic Value, and the derived Value. The intrinsic value is is
<br>
just the Value of the matter in the object existing and being in that
<br>
particular configuration. The derived Value is the difference in the
<br>
total Value of the universe at t=infinity for the object continuing to
<br>
exist and for it ceasing to exist at the time that the derived value
<br>
is evaluated. That's just a fancy way of saying that the derived Value
<br>
is the effect that an object has on the Value of everything else.
<br>
<p>And lastly, (and I won't explain why right now because I am terrible
<br>
at doing so) the intrinsic value function is something like the Gibbs
<br>
free energy. The idea is that it is the complexity of an object (the
<br>
log of it really), but taking into account that a highly complex
<br>
object at zero T isn't going to affect much. This is the part I am
<br>
least sure of, but it's going to be something like that.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone know any work or paper people have done in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past or present about how to measure (quantify) morality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The motivation is, for a learning system to learn how to be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to measure how &quot;moral&quot; the machine already are, so that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; works for example in philosophy where people attempted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to device scheme/method/framework to measure morality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the moment, I can only imagine using some questionaire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type query to attempt to measure a person's &quot;moral IQ&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be it a normal person or machine person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS. I guess another approach is to try to find all the +ve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and -ve effects from an agent's actions and try to sum them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any reference to papers or books or other source will be
</em><br>
