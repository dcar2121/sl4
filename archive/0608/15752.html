</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Apollo took one approach, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and that worked.  In

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The difference with an AI to Singularity project is that--as far as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;know--nobody knows how to do it.  (Correct me if I am wrong here.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I notice that a burn rate for money is proposed, not a total to complete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The only way I feel confident would work is to duplicate the functions of

</em><br>

<em>&gt;I think that some people do have some clear ideas about how to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With some exceptions, they have no serious funding.
</em><br>
<p>The two may be connected.  A clear ideas that you can explain to someone 
<br>
with money will probably get you funded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;None of them (with the possible exception of Hugo de Garis) believe that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the way to do it is to emulate a brain.
</em><br>
<p>I have scoped this out from time to time.  The last time I did it I think 
<br>
it took 150 meters of silicon on a side.  It is going to take considerable 
<br>
time before the technology is up to the task.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Please bear in mind that many aspects of how to do it are not discussed on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this list.
</em><br>
<p>Very little of my knowledge about the subject comes from this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Whatever the purpose of SL4 might be, any attempt to talk about real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical issues gets immediately swamped by low-quality noise and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vitriol...... as a result of this you might think that there is no serious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical work in existence (about the specific problem of building a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coordinated, complete AGI, including all the motivational/moral/ethical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspects, and including considerations of safety and friendliness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This impression would be a mistake.  To take just the issue of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendliness, for example:  there are approaches to this problem that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;powerful and viable, but because the list core does not agree with them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you might think that they are not feasible, or outright dangerous and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irresponsible.  This impression is a result of skewed opinions here, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily a reflection of the actual status of those approaches.
</em><br>
<p>I remember a business plan a friend of mine wrote.  It's only function, as 
<br>
it turned out, was to bring it out every few years and laugh at it.
<br>
<p>I wonder if the AIs of the future will do the same reading our exchanges?
