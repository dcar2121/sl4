</em><br>
<p>FYI:  The name &quot;Johnson-Laird&quot; sounded familiar to me - I might have
<br>
picked it to check for that reason, I don't recall - but in general I'm
<br>
not good with names.  Or faces, for that matter.  I can tell they're
<br>
familiar but not what identity they should associate to.
<br>
<p>Maybe the most embarassing case of this:  I once had dinner with an old
<br>
email friend, spent around four hours with him, and it wasn't the first
<br>
time we'd ever met in person either - we'd met at least half a dozen
<br>
times over the years.  And then, less than a month later if I recall
<br>
correctly, I was looking, puzzled, at someone at a local Alcor
<br>
meeting... I was *sure* I knew that face...
<br>
<p>Sometimes I do feel very much like a stereotypical Absent-Minded Professor.
<br>
<p>More importantly, I am not so foolish as to think that the field of
<br>
cognitive psychology is small enough that any one human being could
<br>
reasonably be familiar with all of it.  I do not apologize for failing
<br>
to recognize Johnson-Laird's name.  If I were a specialist in
<br>
cognitive psychology, rather than Artificial General Intelligence which
<br>
draws on a dozen other disciplines (currently learning: nonclassical
<br>
mathematical logic), it would be embarassing.  If I'd made a
<br>
pinpointable stupid error (in one of my own predictions, thank you, not
<br>
my alleged interpretation of someone else on a mailing list, etc.) due
<br>
to my unfamiliarity with widely known theories originally propounded by
<br>
Johnson-Laird, that would be embarassing.
<br>
<p>It's nice that I can associate the name &quot;Rosch&quot; to prototype theories of
<br>
categorization, but the useful thing is to be familiar with the
<br>
prototype theories of categorization, whether I read them in Rosch or
<br>
elsewhere, and whether I associate them to Rosch's name or not.
<br>
<p>Johnson-Laird's ideas certainly sounded very familiar when I looked them
<br>
up, but I doubt I could have identified who &quot;Johnson-Laird&quot; was without
<br>
Google.  Such is the truth.
<br>
<p>Very recently I learned the Z*deh interpretation, a nonclassical logic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Any academic specialist in nonclassical logics would recognize the
<br>
name on sight, I'm sure, and readily fill in the missing letter.  But I
<br>
wouldn't expect, say, Peter Voss to know it (though he might), and not
<br>
because I disrespect Peter Voss.  There is far more human knowledge than
<br>
any one human can learn.  One month ago I would have recognized the name
<br>
as vaguely familiar without being able to say which field it associated
<br>
to; and in a year I may well have forgotten the name, though not the logic.
