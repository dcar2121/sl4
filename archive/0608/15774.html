<p>I need to respond to this message in two separate chunks.
<br>
<p>You say:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; If Loosemore
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; one day ago, and Loosemore could have chosen to respond to that.
</em><br>
<p>For your information, Yudkowsky, in the time since Michael Anissimov 
<br>
asked politely, one day ago, I have written some 2000 words of a book 
<br>
chapter and also a very detailed 2700-word reply to another polite 
<br>
request that came to me off-list, on the Apollo-Project topic.
<br>
<p>I had every intention of promising Anissimov a thoughtful reply to his 
<br>
request:  I simply didn't get the *time*.
<br>
<p>Err.... how much time do you normally give someone to respond, before 
<br>
you start denouncing them?
<br>
