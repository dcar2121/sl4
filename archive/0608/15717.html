Well, I was suggesting, not claiming, as I'm not confident with respect to 
<br>
whether Friendly singularities preserve the reference class or not, nor with 
<br>
respect to the validity of many worlds and anthropic inference.
<br>
Anyway, if we do take an anthropic inference path, we should expect integral 
<br>
over population, not time, to singularity to be maximized, e.g. we should 
<br>
not expect a nuclear war to reduce the population and delay singularity 
<br>
simultaneously unless the population reduction effect was the greater of the 
<br>
two.  However, anthropic inference *should* give us theories with more 
<br>
predictive validity than what we started with.  Here are some examples.
<br>
We should expect the demographic transition to turn around and exponential 
<br>
population growth to resume.
<br>
We should expect people who are trying to build GAIs to die or to be 
<br>
thwarted by amazing coincidences
<br>
We should expect general societal decay to decelerate technological advance
<br>
We should expect to personally survive dangerous situations due to amazing 
<br>
coincidences
<br>
We should expect GAI to never be developed, but if it is developed, we 
<br>
should expect major social changes of a variety of sorts to start to occur a 
<br>
couple decades ahead of time as anthropic pressures forcing society into a 
<br>
GAI unfriendly shape are relaxed.
<br>
One particular change that I would see as nearly sure evidence of strong 
<br>
anthropic selection would be the develop of fairly powerful genetic 
<br>
engineering, the use of which is then successfully suppressed on a global 
<br>
scale enabling the development of SENS and the addition to the human 
<br>
germline of novel and more powerful DNA repair mechanisms but not any other 
<br>
enhancements.  If the technology was afterwords actually lost, or if 
<br>
spaceflight was lost after successfully colonizing Mars or some other 
<br>
non-terrestrial environment, I would likewise see myself in, essentially, an 
<br>
anthropically generated sf novel, a splinter of the multi-verse of 
<br>
negligible probability.
<br>
<p>In fact, I don't anticipate any of the above occurances, but I see the value 
<br>
in explicating the implications of radical hypotheses so that they can be 
<br>
confirmed or disconfirmed.

<em>&gt;&gt;No-one is trying to organize society along the lines which will minimize

<em>&gt;&gt;path distance towards the singularity.  If anything, anthropic selection 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be extending the path beyond its probable length.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a very important statement.  What Michael is saying is that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are living in a timeline where many many humans are born before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroy themselves with UFAI or move into another reference class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(If I'm translating the idea correctly.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Given that our probability of being born into any given being in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reference class is roughly equivalent, it is likely that we will find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ourselves in the universe where many us-beings exist.  That is, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they make babies the most before dying or transcending.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A tremendous number of persons are being born today.  Every year
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increment that time extends before the Singularity occurs, that number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increases exponentially.  So there is an anthropic selection effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favoring our finding ourselves in worlds where time is maximally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prolonged before the Singularity occurs, while still preserving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This may be why the education system is so amazingly poor.  I often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found myself in elementary, middle, and high school thinking &quot;why is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this so amazingly awful?&quot;  In fact I printed out and read most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;KurzweilAI.net while ignoring my teachers in high school classes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For this reason, as Michael says, the time from now until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity will likely be measured in terms of its maximum probable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;length.  This could be anywhere between a few months and thirty years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's the funny thing about anthropic inference.  It seems like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;cheating&quot;, but when you think about it, it doesn't actually give us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theories with much more predictive validity than we already had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;begin with.
