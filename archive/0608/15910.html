I would assert not that goals are necessary for the existence of 
<br>
intelligence, but rather that goals are necessary for an intelligence to 
<br>
act, even as basic a act as deriving a conclusion.
<br>
<p>OTOH, goals could be either explicit or implicit.  A program could be 
<br>
designed to automatically derive all possible conclusions from the input 
<br>
data (until it was interrupted).  In this case I would assert that it 
<br>
had an implicit goal, even though there was nowhere given an explicit 
<br>
goal.  So perhaps a part of the question is &quot;what do you mean by goal?&quot;  
<br>
I guess that my first stab would be &quot;the tendency to achieve a selected 
<br>
subset of results out of all possible results&quot;.  I tend to model it 
<br>
(mentally) as an attractive force...but that doesn't translate easily 
<br>
into multiple contexts.  Still, if consciousness is chaotic, thing of 
<br>
goals as &quot;attractors&quot;.  (Consciousness does have some features that 
<br>
appear to be chaotic, but I haven't convinced myself that it is really 
<br>
chaotic.  And haven't seen any advantage in closely investigating.  
<br>
Still, the mutability of memory feels like it has some implications 
<br>
here.  If so, then goals may literally be attractors.)
