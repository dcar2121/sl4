<p>Mildly, sure. Quick grin, move along.

<p><em>&gt;Same principle.

<p>I don't think so. But then nobody seems to have noticed that my 
<br>
original waspish comment was also a joke, whimsy with a razor blade. 
<br>
The trouble with any discussion from this point on is that we are 
<br>
both murdering butterflies with machine guns. But to do so for a 
<br>
moment: the deep background to my little joke was that way back in 
<br>
the day, when you were &quot;not a teenager&quot;, in documents that are 
<br>
probably no longer accessible on the net, you asserted with your 
<br>
typical immense confidence that morality was indeed surely universal, 
<br>
and that (if I recall correctly) the solution to a benevolent machine 
<br>
intelligence was to guide it towards this Universal Morality, or at 
<br>
any rate to encourage it (ver) to find that truth for itself 
<br>
(verself). A number of people, including me, explained why this was a 
<br>
rather daft idea that completely missed the point. Sometime later, 
<br>
you abandoned this opinion. It is therefore rather entertaining, if 
<br>
not thigh-slapping, to see you making a joke that dubs those who pant 
<br>
after morality as morons. Thud. Apologies to everyone for the 
<br>
appallingly heavy-handed exegesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Give me a break, Damien!  How intelligent do you think *you* would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to be, before you were so intelligent that *every single one* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of your jokes was necessarily a creation of deeply subtle wisdom?
</em><br>
<p>Sufficiently, I hope, to notice when my little joke, apparently at 
<br>
someone else's expense, came back to bite me on the ass. This is an 
<br>
equal opportunity comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;how would *you* feel if *I* insisted on interpreting every one of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your jokes as meaningful?
</em><br>
<p>But they are, and hilarious as well.
<br>
