<p>Richard Loosemore previously wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Human minds are designed for immensely sophisticated forms of cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing, and one of these is the ability to interpret questions that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not contain enough information to be fully defined (pragmatics).  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspect of this process is the use of collected information about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of questions that are asked, including the particular kinds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information left out in certain situations.  Thus, in common-or-garden 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nontechnical discourse, the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which of the following is more probable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     2) Linda is a bank teller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would quite likely be interpreted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which of the following is more probable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     2) Linda is a bank teller and NOT active in the feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It just so happens that this question-form is more likely than the form 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that follows the strict logical conjunction.  In fact, the strict 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical form is quite bizarre in normal discourse, and if we intended it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually ask it, we would probably qualify our question in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following way:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which of the following is more probable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     2) Linda is a bank teller, and she might be active in the feminist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        movement or she might not be - we don't know either way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would make this qualification precisely because we do not want the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioner to bring in the big guns of their cognitive machinery to do a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading-between-the-lines job on our question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might seem that this analysis of the Tversky and Kahneman studies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not apply to one of your other examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     Please rate the probability that the following event will occur in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1983...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     [Version 1]:  A massive flood somewhere in North America in 1983, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in which more than 1,000 people drown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     [Version 2]:  An earthquake in California sometime in 1983, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; causing a flood in which more than 1,000 people drown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Two independent groups of UBC undergraduates were respectively asked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to rate the probability of Version 1 and Version 2 of the event.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; group asked to rate Version 2 responded with significantly higher 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are two independent groups, so neither sees the other question and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore they cannot read between the lines and infer that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioner might be leaving out some information.  On the face if it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this seems like good evidence of the Conjunction Fallacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But is it?  The two groups have to separately visualize the scenarios. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the detailed scenarios that they visualize?  It seems prima 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facie quite reasonable that it never even occurred to the first group 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a flood could be a side effect of a massive earthquake:  they just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried to judge the likelihood of a flood for other reasons, and in their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience they did not recall any &quot;ordinary&quot; floods that caused that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many fatalities, so they respond with low probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other group, however, have had the idea put into their head that an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earthquake might occur, and that (by the way) this might lead to flood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fatalities.  They have no idea whether this connection (earthquake leads 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to flood) is valid, but that issue seems not to be the question (indeed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is NOT the question) so they take it as something of a given, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then simply fall back on their estimate of an earthquake probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with many fatalities.  Whether they are correct in their estimate or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, they rate *that* probability quite highly.  Higher than &quot;flood but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no earthquake&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, once again, the experimental design is effectively comparing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompatible processes going on inside these people's heads.  Or, to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more precise, it *could* be doing this (my suggested interpretation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to be tested:  I am only giving an existence proof for an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative explanation -- I could do the experiment, or maybe somebody 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<em>&gt; already did do the experiment.
</em><br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p>In other words, at the time Richard Loosemore wrote this post, he did 
<br>
not know someone had already done the experiment.  And if he was aware 
<br>
that the &quot;misreading&quot; explanation of the experiment had already been 
<br>
thoroughly refuted - why, it sure as hell doesn't sound like it, given 
<br>
what he wrote.  He sounds just like someone encountering the field for 
<br>
the first time.  If not, it certainly is a violation of academic ethics 
<br>
to claim for your very own 'my suggested interpretation' what was 
<br>
suggested years ago, without any hint that someone else might have 
<br>
suggested it first.
<br>
<p>But now - *after*, please note, I post a link to a research paper that 
<br>
describes various experimental tests that refuted &quot;misreading&quot; as an 
<br>
alternative hypothesis - up jumps Richard and says:  &quot;Oh, well, of 
<br>
course 'I am a cognitive scientist who is thoroughly steeped in the 
<br>
experimental and theoretical results of this field', who was familiar 
<br>
years and years ago with these results refuting 'my suggested 
<br>
interpretation', and I just meant it was a weak effect that contributed 
<br>
to the conjunction fallacy without being solely accountable for it -&quot;
<br>
<p>You really needn't bother at this point.
<br>
<p>Your butt is banninated from SL4.  You may post one final response. 
<br>
After that, goodbye.
