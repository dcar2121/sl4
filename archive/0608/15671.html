<p>
Given the basic disconnect, not so much in our thinking, but in our
<br>
priors, I wanted to leave this thread to anyone one who might consider
<br>
it productive.  However, while the first few items presented here seem
<br>
to adequately represent our conflicting views, I take exception to the
<br>
last paragraph.
<br>
<p>For the record, anyone who knows me is already aware that I fully
<br>
support and promote the use of AI to amplify human reasoning.  Due the
<br>
cognitive limitiations of our biological substrate, to remain
<br>
competitive we will *become* our AIs over time.  A higher level of
<br>
organization based on a multitude of diverse agents, both posthuman
<br>
and native machine intelligence, will perform at a level of
<br>
intelligence surpassing the understanding of any of the individuals
<br>
but trusted by those individuals.
<br>
<p>This differs from the dominant viewpoints on this list as discussed previously.

<em>&gt; &gt; So you think goodness and evil are inherent, objective, context-free

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not really... but this is beside the point for the purposes of what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was responding to.  Yyou're reading too far into my example.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point was simply that it will eventually be possible to 'manufacture'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kindness without having to struggle through any sort of complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synergistic process, as Jef Allbright seemed to imply with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Note that this approach is inherently evolutionary.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; static solution to the moral problem within a coevolutionary scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there are increasingly effective principles of what works to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximize the growth of what we increasingly see as increasingly good.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point is also that, eventually, everything reduces to engineering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As another example, imagine a social pact where one person's moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model is automatically updated based on silent requests from people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around them, sent to their brain over a wireless network.  This would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be &quot;augmented morality&quot;, and it would subtly contradict the implicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message Jef was putting across when he said,&quot;It's time for humanity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow up and begin taking full responsibility for ourselves and our way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward.&quot;  It's not &quot;taking full responsibility&quot; per se when you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using machines to update your morality automatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A society full of such individuals may be able to dispense with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing things face to face, or holding votes, or engaging in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other moral/political activity that humans engage in today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jef also said, &quot;We are conditioned to expect that a greater entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (our parents?, our god?) will know what is best and act in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.&quot;  The fact of the matter is, a greater and more intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity might indeed know what is best for us and act in our interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in ways far deeper, elegant, and long-lasting than we would be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act for ourselves.  The fear of this outcome stems from so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful humans who say they want the best for us but then abuse their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power.  But to deny its possibility is blatant anthropocentrism.
