<p><p>My reaction last time around was (paraphrased):
<br>
<p>Okay, you have briefly summarized your reasons for believing certain
<br>
approaches to AGI won't work; I think I'm somewhat clear on your reasons and
<br>
I agree with them, I've held a similar opinion for many years, now that
<br>
we've established I'm on board with that, what approach do you think will
<br>
work?
<br>
<p>My reaction this time is:
<br>
<p>Okay, you have written a long, detailed and excellent explanation of your
<br>
reasons for believing certain approaches to AGI won't work; I think I'm very
<br>
clear on your reasons and I agree with them, I've held a similar opinion for
<br>
many years, now that we've established I'm on board with that, what approach
<br>
do you think will work? ^.^
<br>
<p>Note that you won't get _everyone_ on this list to agree with you... about
<br>
anything really; you give the impression (correct me if I'm wrong) that SL4
<br>
consists of a tight-knit group of people who all share a set of core
<br>
beliefs. In fact there are large differences of opinion between many of the
<br>
participants on this list - take a look at the heated arguments that have
<br>
occurred over the years! So what you've got is the unsurprising situation
<br>
that some people agree with you and some don't. I think it best to proceed
<br>
on that basis, and having explained why certain approaches won't work, make
<br>
specific proposals for what approach you think will work.
