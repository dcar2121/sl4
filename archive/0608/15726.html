<em>&gt;     So let's please drop the IQ discussions and talk about whether an Apollo

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Any takers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it does. Now we're not sure yet exactly what the best approach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is - but then they weren't sure in the Manhattan Project either, so they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funded several approaches simultaneously, all under the one roof so they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could cross-fertilize. That's what I'd do if I had, say, $10M/year to spend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's interesting how little this is on the scale of things (and it could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably be reduced further by relocating to a place with soft currency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Novamente does that to some extent, IIRC; a significant fraction of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their team is in Brazil). Later, Google-scale infrastructure might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required - but that would only be after at least some working code had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been produced.
</em><br>
<p>Alas I think that the $10M/year would not be enough for an Apollo 
<br>
Project.  10M is only really about what a single decent startup would 
<br>
need to get through seed stage.
<br>
<p>I think that a coordinated project involving one central agency that did 
<br>
the core work, together with contracting out to many other companies, 
<br>
would be the way to go.
<br>
<p>Certainly it would be necessary to allow many different approaches, not 
<br>
just one.
<br>
<p>One of the big roles of the central agency would be to ensure that it 
<br>
did not turn into a Pork Barrel.  We do not want it to go the same that 
<br>
nanotechnology has gone, with all the standard corporate welfare outfits 
<br>
(er.. sorry I mean major corporations) creaming off the money to do what 
<br>
they were doing anyway, rebadged with the word &quot;Singularity&quot;).
<br>
<p>THE interesting question for me, however, is this:  could a community 
<br>
based project get its act together to do what NASA did for spaceflight, 
<br>
but without government backing?  We would not want governmet backing if 
<br>
we could help it, because the conditions today are not the same as they 
<br>
were in the 1960s, and I believe that the project would be 
<br>
pork-barrelized today where it was only partially true back then.
<br>
<p>And of course, it goes without saying that the other main role of the 
<br>
central agency would be to devote time and energy to safety 
<br>
(friendliness) issues.
<br>
<p>I'd be prepared to initiate such a project right now if the startup 
<br>
funds were available, because I believe it could actually work.  And in 
<br>
case I am not being clear, I don't mean just another advocacy group or 
<br>
think tank, I mean a project to get concrete things done.
