Some of you on this list have read my &quot;evolution psychology, meme and the 
<br>
origin of war&quot; paper.
<br>
<p>Here is additional supporting evidence for the thesis, though they don't 
<br>
discuss the evolved psychological mechanisms behind the behavior.

<p>****************
<br>
<p>Radiocarbon dating indicated that people relocated their residences to 
<br>
fortified interior locations 300 years after the island was colonized. 
<br>
&quot;These were all related people who arrived in Rapa,&quot; Kennett said. &quot;They 
<br>
generally get along and collaborate when they arrive, but with time and 
<br>
growing populations there was division, then competition between different 
<br>
family lineages, resulting in significant amounts of aggression. This 
<br>
division led to the establishment of fortifications in not very desirable 
<br>
locations, such as mountaintop ridges, where it's cold, windy, inhospitable 
<br>
for crops, and far away from water.&quot;
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>&quot;The archaeological landscape is phenomenal,&quot; Kennett said. &quot;There are 
<br>
domestic and agricultural terraces all around the island. Many of the ridge 
<br>
tops are flattened and there are staircases carved into the mountainsides. 
<br>
Arable land and access to fishing grounds were limited, and the farming 
<br>
areas and fish traps would have been well defended.&quot;
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>&quot;Rapa is a compelling story,&quot; Kennett said. &quot;To me, this is an example of 
<br>
what's happening on the planet today in terms of expanding populations, 
<br>
environmental degradation and increasing warfare. Rapa is a little 
<br>
microcosm of our planet. There are lessons about the consequences of 
<br>
population growth to be learned there.&quot;
<br>

<p>The National Geographic Society, Australian National University and the 
<br>
University of Oregon funded the research.
