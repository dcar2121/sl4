</em><br>
The Japanese PR claim was that it was that sort of project.  Actually it 
<br>
was an attempt to bootstrap the Japanese computer industry and support 
<br>
their mainframe builders.  Nothing went wrong.  You can argue that they 
<br>
didn't get their money's worth, but it was a pork-barrel project, so 
<br>
that's not an arguement.
<br>
<p>Actually, they were starting too soon to achieve the kind of 
<br>
breakthrough they were announcing they were trying for...and it would 
<br>
still be too soon.  At this stage what should be funded are lots of 
<br>
relatively small projects...say 8 college kids &amp; their parent's garage 
<br>
size.  Aim for &quot;just graduated&quot; and &quot;dissertation work&quot; to stretch your 
<br>
money.  DON'T pay top dollar, aim to build skill sets.  Require that the 
<br>
government (or other investors) get 50% of all profits &amp; of all IP (all 
<br>
three kinds).  Provide a &quot;business services&quot; unit to oversee compliance 
<br>
with relevant laws.  (Presume that EVERYONE hired under this program is 
<br>
a developer...so all overhead is born by the investors, and that means 
<br>
business licenses and tax law compliance as well as everything else.)  
<br>
After a year, demand a proposal for a &quot;demonstration&quot; that they think 
<br>
that they'll be able to do in a year, then allow them two years to build 
<br>
it.  If they fail, all of their work becomes Open Source (BSD or GPL?) 
<br>
and funding is cut in half.  And they get a year extension. 
<br>
<p>That kind of thing.  This shouldn't be expected to yield any 
<br>
breakthroughs, but LOTS of skill development and SOME technical 
<br>
progress.  And a few modest successes.
<br>
<p>I can see also funding around 1/3 as many projects at 3 times the 
<br>
funding, but these would need to be more carefully selected, and would 
<br>
need to show something before starting.  And possibly 1/9th as many 
<br>
projects at 9 times the funding.  etc.  At each step the criteria for 
<br>
selection would need to be more than proportionally stronger.  The idea 
<br>
here is not to create a monopoly, but a strong base.  Monopolies are the 
<br>
WRONG direction.
<br>
<p>OTOH, would anyone here really want to merge their project into one that 
<br>
was run by the government?  Defense contractors end up spending a lot of 
<br>
time lobbying Congress for support, and the government places insane 
<br>
restrictions on their businesses.  And they tend to favor a very few 
<br>
large companies that they can, essentially, totally control.  (I'll 
<br>
grant that the original transformation of the defense contractors was 
<br>
slow, but new ones are expected to fit into the existing framework 
<br>
immediately.)
<br>
<p>FWIW, and frustrating as it is, I suspect that underfunded and free is a 
<br>
better state for technical and philosophically correct development.  I 
<br>
also expect that the government is already funding lots of AI 
<br>
projects...and that it's those that need to be beaten if one desires FAI 
<br>
as opposed to UFAI.
