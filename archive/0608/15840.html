<p>Sorry, no books.  Lots of short articles and postings to mailing lists.

<p><em>&gt;as this is a subject that greatly interests me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please allow me to clarify my thinking on this as it appears to differ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somewhat from yours. You said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It's a bit hard to figure out how far back language came into play, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;genetic clocks on the area of the critical genes might give us a rough

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;influence on hunter gatherer selected &quot;morality&quot; mechanism genes.  Possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;even spoken language came too late.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Certainly you are correct that written language came too late to have any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant effect on  the pressures of genetic natural selection which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formed the human neurological/cognitive architecture. However, as you also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;noted, this architecture is quite plastic.
</em><br>
<p>Yes and no.  At the detail level, humans can learn a near infinity of 
<br>
memes.  The problems is a behavioral switch that ups the gain on xenophobic 
<br>
memes when it seems to be time to thin out the population because hard 
<br>
times are a-coming.  This happened once or twice a generation across the 
<br>
whole multimillion year history of our species so there was plenty of time 
<br>
for gene saving responses to be engraved in the genome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My basic supposition is that within the plastic confines of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neuro/cognitive architecture societies organize themselves according to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their needs for production and out of this organization arises a cultural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethos that informs the specifics of that culture's morality (usually in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the form of religion). The variations in social organization account for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the variations in morality among different human societies and cultures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;throughout the history of human civilization.
</em><br>
<p>EP folks consider the entire span of civilization to be a blink as far as 
<br>
evolution of psychological traits is concerned.  I take a far more paranoid 
<br>
view of the function(s) of religions.  And off hand, I would say that the 
<br>
variation in morality among human societies and cultures is low.  I.e., 
<br>
there are many more common elements than there are discordant ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So what I'm trying to say is that since the invention of written language 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;man's ability to replicate and transmit memes has been growing exponentially.
</em><br>
<p>True.  Maybe even super exponentially.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This process of meme transmission and replication with variation is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identical to technological evolution.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  There is, for example, a vast collection of Talmudic 
<br>
memes that contribute little or nothing to technological evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The result of all technological evolution results in a greater and greater 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability for man to alter his environment.
</em><br>
<p>True.  It is instructive to consider the environment in which the 
<br>
technological runaway started.  There were mines in England where coal, 
<br>
iron ore, limestone and fireclay could be mined out of the same shaft.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the past this has varied greatly from culture to culture.
</em><br>
<p>It still differs, perhaps more today than any time in the past.  The most 
<br>
primitive now use steel instead of chipped rocks, the most advanced do 
<br>
thing incomprehensible even to their own cultures ten years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This leads me to the conclusion that because there exists anthropogenic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environmental differences as a result of the differences in technological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution there necessarily also exists different natural pressures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;affecting genetic natural selection (albeit the genetic change caused by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these environmental differences is no doubt minuscule due to the short 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time frame in question but still probably more significant than most are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;willing to admit).
</em><br>
<p>Lactose tolerance is one of the genes that did change in response to the 
<br>
technology of dairy cultures if you would like an example.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I wish you would provide some examples where this happened.  I just can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;get a grip on what you are saying without examples.  Perhaps from &quot;Guns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Germs and Steel&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I'm trying to describe is merely a theory of human history based on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the interrelationship of memetic and genetic natural selection. As such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all of human history becomes an example. The gist of what I'm saying is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that morality and religion are functions of a society's culture. I define 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a society as any group of people independently organized for the purpose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of economic production,
</em><br>
<p>You make this sound like top down organization when an awful lot of 
<br>
production is emergent.  Certainly independent farmers will flood the 
<br>
markets where people went hungry in the former communist countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and culture as the conglomeration of memes which allow for this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coordination of activity. From this perspective it is most appropriate (in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my estimation) to view societies and their cultures as the primary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carrier's of memes. Hence the primary actors involved in memetic natural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selection are societies and it is societies that are more or less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memetically fit.
</em><br>
<p>You should read Diamond's Collapse.  He makes the case that societies that 
<br>
fail often do so after damaging their environment due to too much 
<br>
population growth.  In which case what memes they have don't matter a bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Usually the most memetically fit societies (having the most efficient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system of economic coordination) begin to expand empires and either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subsume or eradicate other society's cultures/memes - and sometimes their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genes too. The most common example of this might be the Spanish conquest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of mesoamerica but any example of imperial; expansion throughout history 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will do.
</em><br>
<p>Diamond and others make the case that the main reason Europeans took over 
<br>
the Americas was disease.  (And for the same reason lost control of Africa.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In sum one might say that before written language human evolution was in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system state of divergence but that since then human evolution (both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memetic and genetic) has been heading for convergence - resulting in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;globalization and eventually technological singularity.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the case for divergence in the stone age.  Hunter gatherers 
<br>
faced pretty much the same physical and social pressures the world 
<br>
over.  And while we might be headed for convergence, I don't think the 
<br>
divergence has ever been stronger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the mental mechanisms that underlie our (flexible) sense of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral are the result of stone age selection and are not going to be changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rapidly.
</em><br>
<p>That's true, but it isn't what concerns me.  Stone age selected mechanisms 
<br>
included a behavioral switch.  Human morality is pretty good when times are 
<br>
looking good.  When they start to look bleak &quot;kill the neighbors&quot; memes get 
<br>
in control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The flexible part comes from environmental conditions.  It is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;considered moral to steal or murder, but as we saw about a year ago, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;only takes a few days before people get hungry enough to steal and not much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more before murder would become common.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is part of what I'm trying to say. Because morality is a function of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social organization when social order breaks down many people tend to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revert to stone age ethics, i.e. do whatever it takes to survive.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You say that it is not considered moral to steal or murder. I disagree. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is only considered immoral to steal or murder within the confines of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain circumstances dictated by a given culture.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  And those are exactly what you would expect if the psychological 
<br>
traits for moral behavior were due do gene selection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For instance many nomadic tribes have organized their respective societies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around theft from agricultural societies. This form of theft becomes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sanctioned by that culture and hence it becomes moral for that culture. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The ancient Greeks had very strict rules about conduct amongst themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but treated &quot;barbarians&quot; in a manner that our culture would find morally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reprehensible (such as the practice of killing all children and raping all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;woman when a barbarian village was conquered).
</em><br>
<p>They typically killed all the male children at least.  This is not unique 
<br>
to humans either.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_bonding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_bonding</a>  Also 
<br>
see  Book of Numbers, from The holy Bible, King James version Chapter 31 vs 
<br>
6-18
<br>
<p>17: Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every 
<br>
woman who has known man by lying with him.
<br>
18: But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him, keep 
<br>
alive for yourselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A modern example might be between the secular west and Islam. It goes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without saying that much of what passes as moral  in Islam would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unthinkable in a secular state (such as the treatment of woman).
</em><br>
<p>It wasn't that long ago that secular state women were treated much like 
<br>
Islamic women are today.  The right to vote for women is less than 100 
<br>
years old in the US,   Birth control is much more recent. Griswold v. 
<br>
Connecticut (1965), legalized contraception for married people, and Roe v. 
<br>
Wade (1973) legalized abortion on a federal level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is why I see morality as primarily a very plastic memetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;epiphenomenon emerging from the interaction of our inherited neurological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;architecture with various environments.
</em><br>
<p>I see it as closer to deterministic depending on the environment, 
<br>
especially the environmental outlook.  The moral values we associate as 
<br>
positive are strongly correlated with good economic prospects and vice versa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, for all of these reasons, i believe that human morality has the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potential to change rapidly as society rapidly evolves - but perhaps this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is too optimistic.
</em><br>
<p>I assume we will get what we generally consider positive morality if wealth 
<br>
per capita takes a big step up due to technological advances.  But the 
<br>
pessimistic side is that falling income per capita, especially long term 
<br>
prospects for falling income per capita, will turn on genetic survival 
<br>
mechanisms that eventually contract decent treatment to close relatives.
<br>
<p>Sorry to be so mechanistic, but if I am right, it does provide a formula 
<br>
for improving morality, avoiding war and the like.

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You're talking to the guy who was writing about this since the mid 1980s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;The homo-sapien cognitive architecture substrate results from the genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;natural selection of all human ancestry. This architecture defined the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;original social organization (mortality) of our primate forbears. Memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;natural selection comes into play and dominates the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;replication process with the arrival of language (especially written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;language).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It's a bit hard to figure out how far back language came into play, though

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;However memes cannot remain successful replicators if they do not aid in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;the survival of the host's genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;True.  Consider Shakers and Mormons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;For this reason memetic fitness is mostly a function of societies and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;persons. A memetically fit cultural ethos is an ethos that can efficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;organize a society so that it can successfully compete against other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;societies for resources. With out a memetically fit ethos (morality) a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;society/culture degenerates and sufferers form being either absorbed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;more memetically fit culture or that society/culture will suffer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;memo/genocide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I wish you would provide some examples where this happened.  I just can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;get a grip on what you are saying without examples.  Perhaps from &quot;Guns,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;In the past more monolithic cultures would label any behaviour that does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;not conform to that cultures ethos as &quot;immoral&quot;. And in many cases such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;persons would be put to death for their crimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Most of our evolution took place before agriculture when &quot;culture&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;circulated in the hunger gather band or at most a bunch of related
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;bands.  If the few remaining examples of hunter gatherer life can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;extrapolated to the bulk of human evolution, then while violent death was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;common, putting a band member to death for &quot;crime&quot; was rare.  I would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the very concept of crime comes way too late to have had much influence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;human evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;These facts might lead one to the conclusion that morality both arises
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;from, and acts upon, genetic evolution. Additionally one might conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;that &quot;morality&quot; is in a state of  evolution -constantly changing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;certain memes become more or less fit according to the pressures of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;natural selection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If you used the term &quot;political correctness&quot; instead of &quot;morality&quot; I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be more likely to agree with you.
