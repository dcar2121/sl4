<p>
I recently took an IQ test - unfortunately, it was to help someone in
<br>
training, and so they couldn't tell me what my score was - but there
<br>
were hundreds of questions, and maybe 3 of them required thought, and
<br>
the only part of the test on which it seemed possible to lose points
<br>
was a speed-test in copying figures which seemed to have nothing to do
<br>
with intelligence.  There were some obvious problems and cultural
<br>
biases with the questions, despite the fact that the test has been
<br>
refined over many years by many psychologists.  (I think it was the
<br>
WAIS.)
<br>
<p>I would say that
<br>
<p>1) IQ tests are designed for placing people into one of 3 categories:
<br>
below average, average, or above average.  They are neither designed,
<br>
nor able, to distinguish between 2 sigma and 3 sigma above average.
<br>
<p>2) If a person whose IQ &quot;should&quot; be 180 takes one of these tests, and
<br>
gives an answer different from the one that is considered correct, I'd
<br>
trust the answer of the 180-IQ test-taker more than that of the
<br>
test-makers.  The presence of any ambiguous questions containing
<br>
subtleties that the test designers were not aware of, means that the
<br>
most-intelligence test-takers will not have the highest scores.
<br>
