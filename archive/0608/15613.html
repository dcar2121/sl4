<p><p>Singapore has some narrow competencies in biotech.  But then they  
<br>
have been investing heavily in that for years.
<br>
<p>The US still dominates most research of interest to this list, due to  
<br>
a very large population (third largest in the world after India), a  
<br>
robust and massive economy (25-30% of global total), and the majority  
<br>
of good universities.  For any timeline less than 10-20 years, the US  
<br>
is a safe bet for technological development.  Most of the countries  
<br>
that have the capability for interesting counterpoint have vastly  
<br>
smaller populations and economies -- a natural disadvantage.  As a  
<br>
poignant example, the capitalization of the greater Silicon Valley  
<br>
region of the US, a small region 100km on its long axis, is on par  
<br>
with the major economies of Europe.  And the US has more than just  
<br>
Silicon Valley producing significant technological output.
<br>
<p>As a pragmatic matter, if there is a technology that one thinks  
<br>
requires significant capitalization to develop, the safe bet is that  
<br>
it will be developed in the US.  To the casual outside observer of  
<br>
Silicon Valley, a boring suburban city, it is hard to imagine just  
<br>
how much capital and technical capability it wields.  The place does  
<br>
not look like much, but it is a potent focus of human ingenuity.  As  
<br>
much as I do not have any particular affection for the place, I fully  
<br>
recognize that nowhere else on the planet is remotely its equal at  
<br>
this time.
<br>
<p>That said, I do not think AGI requires particularly substantial  
<br>
capital investment, though in most parts of the world an  
<br>
&quot;insubstantial&quot; investment would be hard to come by.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
