<em>&gt; 4: The conjunction fallacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bright.  She majored in philosophy.  As a student,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which of the following is more probable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     2) Linda is a bank teller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 85% of 142 undergraduates at the University of British
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbia indicated that (1) was more probable than (2).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Tversky and Kahneman 1983.)  Since the given description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Linda was chosen to be similar to a feminist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissimilar to a bank teller, (1) is more representative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Linda's description.  However, ranking (1) as more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probable than (2) violates the conjunction rule of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability theory which states that p(A &amp; B) ? p(A).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a sample of 1,000 women; surely more women in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this sample are bank tellers than are feminist bank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tellers.  The original version of this study included 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other statements, such as &quot;Linda is an insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salesperson&quot; and &quot;Linda is active in the feminist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement&quot;, and asked students to rank the 8 statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by probability. (Tversky and Kahneman 1982.)  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it turned out that removing the disguising statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had no effect on the incidence of the conjunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fallacy - one of what Tversky and Kahneman (1983)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterize as &quot;a series of increasingly desperate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulations designed to induce subjects to obey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conjunction rule.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Human minds are designed for immensely sophisticated forms of cognitive
<br>
processing, and one of these is the ability to interpret questions that
<br>
do not contain enough information to be fully defined (pragmatics).  One
<br>
aspect of this process is the use of collected information about the
<br>
kinds of questions that are asked, including the particular kinds of
<br>
information left out in certain situations.  Thus, in common-or-garden
<br>
nontechnical discourse, the question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller.
<br>
<p>Would quite likely be interpreted as
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller and NOT active in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feminist movement.
<br>
<p>It just so happens that this question-form is more likely than the form
<br>
that follows the strict logical conjunction.  In fact, the strict
<br>
logical form is quite bizarre in normal discourse, and if we intended it
<br>
to actually ask it, we would probably qualify our question in the
<br>
following way:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller, and she might be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active in the feminist movement or she might
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not be - we don't know either way.
<br>
<p>We would make this qualification precisely because we do not want the
<br>
questioner to bring in the big guns of their cognitive machinery to do a
<br>
reading-between-the-lines job on our question.
<br>
<p>It might seem that this analysis of the Tversky and Kahneman studies
<br>
does not apply to one of your other examples:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;         Please rate the probability that the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         event will occur in 1983...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         [Version 1]:  A massive flood somewhere in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         North America in 1983, in which more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         1,000 people drown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         [Version 2]:  An earthquake in California
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         sometime in 1983, causing a flood in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         more than 1,000 people drown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two independent groups of UBC undergraduates were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respectively asked to rate the probability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Version 1 and Version 2 of the event.  The group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked to rate Version 2 responded with significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher probabilities.
</em><br>
<p>These are two independent groups, so neither sees the other question and
<br>
therefore they cannot read between the lines and infer that the
<br>
questioner might be leaving out some information.  On the face if it,
<br>
this seems like good evidence of the Conjunction Fallacy.
<br>
<p>But is it?  The two groups have to separately visualize the scenarios.
<br>
What are the detailed scenarios that they visualize?  It seems prima
<br>
facie quite reasonable that it never even occurred to the first group
<br>
that a flood could be a side effect of a massive earthquake:  they just
<br>
tried to judge the likelihood of a flood for other reasons, and in their
<br>
experience they did not recall any &quot;ordinary&quot; floods that caused that
<br>
many fatalities, so they respond with low probability.
<br>
<p>The other group, however, have had the idea put into their head that an
<br>
earthquake might occur, and that (by the way) this might lead to flood
<br>
fatalities.  They have no idea whether this connection (earthquake leads
<br>
to flood) is valid, but that issue seems not to be the question (indeed,
<br>
it is NOT the question) so they take it as something of a given, and
<br>
then simply fall back on their estimate of an earthquake probability
<br>
with many fatalities.  Whether they are correct in their estimate or
<br>
not, they rate *that* probability quite highly.  Higher than &quot;flood but
<br>
no earthquake&quot;.
<br>
<p>So, once again, the experimental design is effectively comparing
<br>
incompatible processes going on inside these people's heads.  Or, to be
<br>
more precise, it *could* be doing this (my suggested interpretation
<br>
would have to be tested:  I am only giving an existence proof for an
<br>
alternative explanation -- I could do the experiment, or maybe somebody
<br>
already did do the experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In each of these experiments, human psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fails to follow the rules of probability theory.
</em><br>
<p>Correct:  because in normal discourse, human psychology is required to
<br>
carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum cognitive processing than the
<br>
mere calculation of probabilities.
<br>
<p>People are not very good at doing strict probability calculations,
<br>
because those calculations require mechanisms that have to be trained
<br>
into them rather carefully, in order to avoid the problem of triggering
<br>
all those other mechanisms, which in the normal course of being a
<br>
thinking creature are actually a lot more useful.
<br>
<p>But now, how does all this apply to the topic of discussion, which is
<br>
whether or not we can make comments on Kurzweil's, or other people's
<br>
estimates of the probability of future scenarios?
<br>
<p>If anyone is out there making arguments that strictly depend on the
<br>
probabilities of conjunctions, and if they are screwing up in their
<br>
probability calculations, then go for it:  wap 'em on the head with the
<br>
Conjunction Fallacy and let's all agree that these futurist predictions
<br>
are wrong.
<br>
<p>But if the people involved are NOT intending to strictly conjoin their
<br>
probabilities, but are instead
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) giving clusters of likely contributing factors or trends that
<br>
depend on intuitive judgements that involve a battery of cognitive
<br>
mechanisms barely dreamed of in anyone's philosophy right now, or
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) giving semi-independent lines of argument in which the degree of
<br>
dependence is almost impossible to specify, whether you are a
<br>
self-avowed &quot;rational thinker&quot; or not, and which it would therefore be
<br>
churlish to attack because the probabilities were not conjoined properly,
<br>
<p>then all this talk of human irrationality is .... irrelevant and (dare I
<br>
say it) irrational.
<br>
<p>Irrational, because it presumes a model of human cognition that seems,
<br>
on the face of a lot of cognitive science evidence, to be impoverished:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it assumes a model that gives undue prominence to the role that is, or
<br>
should, be played by probability judgments.  There are other models of
<br>
cognition that do not give probabilities such a starring role.
<br>
<p>If an AGI researcher's entire worldview is that thought is or should be
<br>
based on &quot;rational&quot; judgement of probabilities, and that the human
<br>
cognitive mechanism is extremely badly designed and can be improved upon
<br>
by a more rational design, and if they apply this worldview to their
<br>
scientific search for the mechanisms required to build an AGI, are they
<br>
going to even *see* evidence that might contradict their worldview, or
<br>
will they instead blind themselves to the evidence?
<br>
<p>Will they ignore the possibility that human cognition does subtle things
<br>
that seem to more, rather than less powerful than strict probability
<br>
evaluation (as in the examples of human responses to the above
<br>
experimental questions)?  Will they scorn the human mind as &quot;irrational&quot;
<br>
and go looking for confirmatory evidence for this thesis?
<br>
<p>And if they did start to see this evidence, would they be able to cope
<br>
with the cognitive dissonance involved in discovering something that
<br>
undermined their worldview?  The rational behavior, after all, would be
<br>
to accept the evidence and go back and revise their worldview.  Not many
<br>
people can do that: cognitive dissonance trumps rationality, it seems.
