On 8/28/06, Richard Loosemore &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Conjunction%20Fallacy%20Fallacy%20[WAS%20Re:%20Anti-singularity%20spam.]">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; Jeff:  one of your biggest concerns is with the irresponsibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who spout their opinions without bothering to read the relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence, so how could you have missed the fact that I so explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejected this claim you impute to me, back there in the original post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did *you* read it thoroughly?  And what did you make of it?
</em><br>
<p>I noted that you never disavowed the alternative interpretation of the
<br>
feminist bank teller results, and that Eliezer *stayed focused on
<br>
replying to that claim of yours, rather than your main point*, and so
<br>
quite independent of whether your main point is right or wrong, the
<br>
issue of your interpretation of the feminist bank teller results
<br>
stayed open and your protestation meant roughly nothing.
<br>
<p>To summarize my view of this whole mess, before going back to
<br>
non-participant mode:
<br>
<p>You (Richard) said, (cf. <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14748.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14748.html</a>)
<br>
&quot;in common-or-garden nontechnical discourse, the question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller.
<br>
<p>Would quite likely be interpreted as
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller and NOT active in the feminist movement.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is a pretty straightforward claim.
<br>
<p>It has been disconfirmed in the h&amp;b lit.
<br>
<p>This is what Eliezer commented on in his reply here:
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html</a>.
<br>
<p>It's not your main claim.  That's great.  It doesn't matter, because
<br>
it's what Eliezer actually commented on.  He, like everyone, gets to
<br>
pick which subclaims he wishes to focus on, right?  Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From your later comment in the above referenced post…
</em><br>
&quot;&gt; [Eliezer said:] In each of these experiments, human psychology
<br>
fails to follow the rules
<br>
<em>&gt; of probability theory.
</em><br>
<p>[to which Richard replied:] Correct:  because in normal discourse,
<br>
human psychology is required to
<br>
carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum cognitive processing than the
<br>
mere calculation of probabilities.&quot;
<br>
<p>… it appears you thought Eliezer thinks the human brain does or should
<br>
merely calculate probabilities, rather than function in the complex,
<br>
specialized, modular fashion that it does.
<br>
<p>He doesn't.
<br>
<p>It's pretty obvious that he doesn't, given how big on evolutionary
<br>
psychology he is, and seeing as the EP folks heavily emphasize the
<br>
specialization of different components in the brain for particular
<br>
tasks in particular contexts.  If you'd ever taken a look at his
<br>
&quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot; paper, you'd know
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>And we all already know you disagree with Eli's
<br>
non-human-psychology-based, decision-theoretic approach to building a
<br>
thinking thing.  So, on that point (re how to build an AGI), you've
<br>
shared nothing new, and one wonders why you spoke up in the
<br>
Conjunction Fallacy thread at all.
<br>
<p>Paring away the ad hominem that came later, and the admittedly unusual
<br>
fact that Eliezer had to look up Johnson-Laird (though there's a
<br>
difference between having to look him up because he didn't know who he
<br>
was or what he did generally, and having to look up his large
<br>
bibliography of work to verify whether or not J-L did any work on
<br>
H&amp;B), you two have just been talking past one another.
<br>
<p>You, Richard, took Eli's reply to be a criticism of your main point,
<br>
when he hadn't responded to your main point at all.  Since Eli's
<br>
comment was so very clearly directed as applying to the
<br>
&quot;interpretation&quot; subclaim I quoted above (and which *he* quoted in his
<br>
reply, so as to be clear what he was replying to), your repeated
<br>
protestations that Eli wasn't addressing your claim fell (and continue
<br>
to fall) on deaf ears – he wasn't *trying* to reply to your main
<br>
claim, so why are you complaining that he's doing something wrong or
<br>
unfair?  You did a poor job of reading his email, viz. as if it, by
<br>
itself, were proffered as a wide-swath rejection of your overall claim
<br>
about how to build a (human-like) AGI, and responded in accordance
<br>
with that misreading, causing all this hullaballoo.
