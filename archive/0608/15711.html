I would expect that a designed AI would have an &quot;direct perception&quot; of 
<br>
the ratios of large numbers and &quot;lightening calculator&quot; features.  Also 
<br>
various other equivalent modules.  I'm less certain that it would have 
<br>
an intuitive recognition of human faces.  It might...if the builder 
<br>
chose for it to.  (I can see advantages as well as disadvantages.)  I 
<br>
would expect an AI to have &quot;direct perception&quot; of well formatted 
<br>
URLs...possibly including an automatic check to see whether they were 
<br>
live. (This though, isn't certain as it speaks to the environment in 
<br>
which it is presumed the AI will live.)  I would be surprised if it 
<br>
could easily learn to run and catch a ball.
<br>
<p>I don't really find IQ to be a useful concept.  I see intelligence as a 
<br>
coordination between many specialized modules.  I suspect that we aren't 
<br>
yet aware of most important modules that go into &quot;being human&quot;, but 
<br>
certainly many of them have to do with maleness or femaleness.  I don't 
<br>
think that an AI will implement very much of that set of modules.  OTOH, 
<br>
it will need to understand easily many things that have no relation to 
<br>
it's own lifestyle if it is to communicate easily with people, but most 
<br>
of these will probably be handled with a shallow mapping to &quot;stub 
<br>
routines&quot;.  The purpose will be to allow it to respond appropriately, or 
<br>
at least sensibly, when someone anthropomorphizes it.
