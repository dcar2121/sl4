<em>&gt; Perhaps greater exposure to the high speed of

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the early 1970's I helped build the world's slowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer (max speed of 2 Hz), as a teaching tool in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high school.  It used electromechanical relays to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate.  Circa 1930 this would have been the fastest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 'real' computer we had in the computer lab was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an IBM 1620.  I don't remember it's speed, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had 16K of ram in a console the size of a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rolltop desk, and 10 MB hard drive the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a washing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since my current PC has 50,000x the memory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12,000x the storage in something like 1/1,000th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the volume, it's reasonable to me to extrapolate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar large jumps in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>First of all, I think it's not even a problem of people being able to
<br>
understand the singularity. Right now, I would say the problem is more
<br>
fundamental - people don't even hear about it. I'd say that even most
<br>
computer programmers don't know about it!
<br>
<p>Second, even in the cases that people have heard about it and don't
<br>
understand it, I don't think it's a matter of understanding the
<br>
evolution on computer speed and capacity. I'd say it has more to do
<br>
with the fact that many educated people have a very rough idea of how
<br>
our brain works, and an even rougher idea of what things a computer
<br>
can do and how it does those things. Those two things combined cause
<br>
people not to understand how a computer could simulate/emulate a
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know if the average computer user has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as visceral a feel for the improvements that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been happening.  To them the change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screen size from 13&quot; to 19&quot; over 10 years might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem like a doubling of screen real estate, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows takes as ong to boot up as it did 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago, so it doesn't feel like a big change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's not true, Windows XP takes much less time to boot up than
<br>
Windows 95... I think people who have been around for 10 years know
<br>
pretty well that computers evolved both qualitatively and
<br>
quantitatively.
