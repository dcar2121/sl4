<p>The beauty of discontinuities is that they cannot be predicted.  Yet it is 
<br>
the discontinuity that brings about the  boldest changes, erupting a 
<br>
seemingly secure social environment.  It is not difficult to recognize 
<br>
trends in the environment which are drawing the attention of innovators, no 
<br>
matter if they are on 5th Avenue or in garages.  Tracking trends is an art 
<br>
in itself and is often best accomplished through the basic STEEP+ domains 
<br>
and then applying systems analysis to determine possible drivers.  Another 
<br>
way to peer into the &quot;going on&quot; of this decade is to actually go into the 
<br>
environments and talk with people, first hand.  This is how I, as an 
<br>
artist, learned about what was actually going on in science and technology 
<br>
in the 1990s.  I went into the domains I was unfamiliar with and met the 
<br>
innovators (and prognosticates) and listened to what they were saying.  Not 
<br>
everyone has the time to do this type of thing, so having contacts with 
<br>
people who do is necessary.  This says something for diversity in 
<br>
relationships, personal or organizational.
