<p>Depends on how far away it is.  The US is busy shutting down stem-cell
<br>
research, cloning, genetic engineering, and Drexlerian nanotech, and
<br>
recently I heard talk about restricting access to biotech equipment.
<br>
It may be only a matter of time before they target AI as well.
<br>
Singapore and China's governments are deliberately luring away
<br>
researchers in all of these areas, as well as AI.  Maybe Japan, too,
<br>
tho I haven't heard much about them lately.
<br>
<p>I think people don't pay enough attention to Singapore.  Would you all
<br>
say that the world leaders of technology, in terms of GDP committed to
<br>
research, are probably Singapore and Finland?  (I don't know the
<br>
numbers, so don't take my impression as authoritative.)
