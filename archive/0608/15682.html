<p>Despite numerous claims and anecdotes like the one above, IQ scores
<br>
are predictibly valid for performance in dozens of domains, and the
<br>
correlation between IQ and performance is much stronger than the
<br>
correlation between performance and any other metric.  IQ tests are
<br>
consistent, as in, if you take the test twice, you will score around
<br>
the same as long as you're trying seriously on both trials.
<br>
<p>Shane Legg in a post on this list just a few months ago
<br>
(<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0603/14358.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0603/14358.html</a>), responded to another IQ
<br>
doubter as follows:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find it kinda funny that {IQ/ objective measures of intelligence} is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often hailed around Transhumanist / Technophile circles, when it's so often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derided as bunkum in psych circles (to which many cog-sci stuff is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected}.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;In pop-science books that's the case, and now most of the population
<br>
seems to believe it. However if you look at the actual research that's
<br>
been done into IQ testing it's solid. Indeed in terms of various metrics,
<br>
such as consistency of results and the ability of the test scores to
<br>
predict future performance in mentally demanding tasks (e.g. future
<br>
academic performance), IQ tests are THE most rigorously validated
<br>
and proven psychological tests that exist. They reliably measure
<br>
something very important, there's really no doubt about it. &quot;
<br>
<p>Shane Legg also mentions that he has collected hundreds of research
<br>
papers on this, and you can email him offlist if you want to check
<br>
them out.
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly the best paper on IQ (g actually) and its importance is
<br>
&quot;Why G Matters&quot; by Linda Gottfredson:
<br>
<a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf</a>.  I
<br>
was somewhat skeptical about the power of IQ tests before reading this
<br>
paper, but the evidence presented in it is very compelling.  If you
<br>
are one of the millions of people who doubt IQ, you should read this
<br>
paper first, and if you are still doubtful afterwards, then I won't
<br>
argue.
<br>
<p>I doubt all sorts of personality tests, the Myers-Briggs Type
<br>
Indicator in particular, which is probably one of the most condensed
<br>
nuggets of pure bullshit in psychology.  )See
<br>
<a href="http://skepdic.com/myersb.html">http://skepdic.com/myersb.html</a> for example.)  So naturally I doubted
<br>
IQ tests as well... it doesn't *feel* like the questions are important
<br>
or difficult, but after looking at the relevant research, it turned
<br>
out that they in fact are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) IQ tests are designed for placing people into one of 3 categories:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below average, average, or above average.  They are neither designed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor able, to distinguish between 2 sigma and 3 sigma above average.
</em><br>
<p>According to much research, this statement is wrong.  The only reason
<br>
it is difficult to evaluate its effectiveness in the outer limits (4
<br>
sigma, not 3 sigma) is because of the scarcity of data points.  They
<br>
*are* designed to distinguish between 2 sigma and 3 sigma, and do so
<br>
with great regularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) If a person whose IQ &quot;should&quot; be 180 takes one of these tests, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives an answer different from the one that is considered correct, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust the answer of the 180-IQ test-taker more than that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test-makers.  The presence of any ambiguous questions containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtleties that the test designers were not aware of, means that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most-intelligence test-takers will not have the highest scores.
</em><br>
<p>According to Linda Gottfredson, &quot;complexity is the active ingredient
<br>
in IQ tests&quot;, and the specifics of the questions are not exceedingly
<br>
important.  Because the tests are calibrated using mountains of
<br>
statistical data, it is not necessary that the test-writers be as
<br>
smart as the highest scorers to measure them correctly.  This is
<br>
hopeful for future AI development instances where we may need to write
<br>
intelligence tests for entities smarter than ourselves.
