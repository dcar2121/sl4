</em><br>
<p>Everyone wants to see a draft specification.
<br>
<p>Under other circumstances this might be understandable, but if nobody
<br>
understands my *reason* for suggesting the type of development
<br>
environment that I outlined, then it would be a waste of time for me to
<br>
lay out the spec, because it would be judged against all the wrong
<br>
criteria. And if, on the other hand, people did completely get the
<br>
motivation for the environment, then the details would be much less
<br>
important.
<br>
<p>I am distressed, because the common thread through all the replies so
<br>
far has been an almost total miscomprehension of the basic reason why I
<br>
suggested the environment. And this is not entirely my fault, because I
<br>
have looked back over my writing and I see that the information was
<br>
clearly stated in the posts. I suspect that many people have too little
<br>
time to do more than skim-read the posts on this list, and as a result
<br>
they get incredibly superficial ideas about what was said.
<br>
<p>I will try a different way to illustrate the underlying reasoning.
<br>
<p>First, I need to ask you to accept one hypothetical... you're going to
<br>
have to work with me here and not argue against this point, just accept
<br>
it as a &quot;what if&quot;. Agreed?
<br>
<p>Here is the hypothetical. Imagine that cognitive systems consist of a
<br>
large number of &quot;elements&quot; which are the atoms of knowledge
<br>
representation (an element represents a thing in the world, but that
<br>
&quot;thing&quot; can be concrete or abstract, a noun-like thing or an action or
<br>
process .... anything whatsoever). Elements are simple computational
<br>
structures, we will suppose. They may have a bit of machinery inside
<br>
them (i.e. they are not passive data structures, they are active
<br>
entities), and they have connections to other elements (a variety of
<br>
different kinds of connections, including transient and long-term). For
<br>
the most part, all elements have the same kind of structure and code
<br>
inside them, but different data (so, to a first approximation, an
<br>
element is not an arbitrary piece of code, like an Actor, but more like
<br>
an elaborate form of connectionist &quot;unit&quot;).
<br>
<p>The most important aspect of an element's life is its history. When it
<br>
first comes into being, its purpose is to capture a particular
<br>
regularity (the co-occurence of some other elements, perhaps), and from
<br>
then on it refines itself so as to capture more precisely the pattern
<br>
that it has made its own. So, when I first encounter a dog, I might
<br>
build an element that represents &quot;frisky thing with tail that barks and
<br>
tries to jump on me&quot;, and then as my experience progresses, this concept
<br>
(aka element) gets refined in all the obvious ways and becomes
<br>
sophisticated enough for me to have a full blown taxonomy of all the
<br>
different types of dogs.
<br>
<p>Notice one important thing: the specific form of the final dog-element
<br>
is a result of (a) a basic design for the general form of all elements,
<br>
and (b) the learning mechanisms that caused the dog-element to grow into
<br>
the adult form, as a result of experience.
<br>
<p>Now, moving on from this set of basic assumptions, let's consider what
<br>
might happen if someone (a cognitive scientist) were to try to figure
<br>
out how this cognitive system works, given very poor access to its
<br>
functioning.
<br>
<p>The scientist might start out by declaring that they have an idea for
<br>
the format of the adult elements, derived from various ideas about what
<br>
ideas and concepts are, and how they relate to one another. What is
<br>
more, the scientist might discover that they can do quite well at first:
<br>
they can write out some supposed adult elements (including both the
<br>
presumed form, and the specific content), specify how they interact with
<br>
each other, and show that IF they give the system that innate knowledge,
<br>
they can get the system to show a certain amount of intelligent behavior.
<br>
<p>But now along comes a complex systems theorist to spoil the party. The
<br>
CST says &quot;This looks good, but in a real system those adult elements
<br>
would have developed as a result of the learning mechanisms interacting
<br>
with the real world, right? And the system would recognise real-world
<br>
patterns as a result of the recognition mechanisms (which also got
<br>
developed as a result of experience) operating on raw sensory input, right?&quot;
<br>
<p>The cognitive scientist agrees, and says that the learning mechanisms
<br>
are a tough issue, and will be dealt with later.
<br>
<p>But now the complex systems theorist looks a little concerned, and says
<br>
&quot;I understand that there is a distinction between the structure (the
<br>
basic design) of the elements and their specific content, and I do
<br>
understand that while the content changes during development, the
<br>
structure of the elements does not.... but having said that, doesn't the
<br>
element structure (as well as the structure of the &quot;thinking&quot; and
<br>
&quot;reasoning&quot; mechanisms) have to be chosen to fit the learning
<br>
mechanisms, not the other way around?&quot;
<br>
<p>And the cognitive scientists replies that, no, there is no reason to do
<br>
that: we can easily study the knowledge representation and thinking and
<br>
reasoning mechanisms first, then later on develop appropriate learning
<br>
mechanisms that produce the content that goes inside that stuff.
<br>
<p>But now the complex systems theorist is really worried. &quot;Hang on: if you
<br>
build learning mechanisms with the kind of power you are talking about
<br>
(with all that interaction and so on), you are going to be creating the
<br>
Mother of all complex systems. And what that means is, to get your
<br>
learning systems to actually work and stably generate the right content,
<br>
you will eventually have to change the design of the elements. Why?
<br>
Because all our experience with complex systems indicates that if you
<br>
start by looking at the final adult form of a system of interacting
<br>
units like that, and then try to design a set of local mechanisms
<br>
(equivalent to your learning mechanisms in this case) which could
<br>
generate that particular adult content, you would get absolutely
<br>
nowhere. So in other words, by the time you have finished the learning
<br>
mechanisms you will have completely thrown away your initial presupposed
<br>
design for the structure and content of the adult elements. So why waste
<br>
time working on the specific format of the element-structure now? You
<br>
would be better off looking for the kinds of learning mechanisms that
<br>
might generate *anything* stable, never mind this presupposed structure
<br>
you have already set your heart on.&quot;
<br>
<p>And that's where I come in.
<br>
<p>The development environment I suggested would be a way to do things in
<br>
that (to some people) &quot;backwards&quot; way. It addresses that need, as
<br>
expressed by my hypothetical complex systems theorist, to look at what
<br>
happens when different kinds of learning mechanisms are allowed to
<br>
generate adult systems. And it would not, as some people have
<br>
insultingly claimed, be just a matter of doing some kind of random
<br>
search through the space of all possible cognitive systems ... nothing
<br>
so crude.
<br>
<p>You can dispute that the above characterization of cognitive systems is
<br>
correct. All power to you if you do: you will never get what I am trying
<br>
to say here, and there would be no point me talking about the structure
<br>
of the development environment.
<br>
<p>I rest my case.
