<p><p>I have got to speak up and say I emphatically agree with Ben here.
<br>
<p>Not only do I think that an Apollo-style project [I prefer to liken it 
<br>
to Apollo, rather than Manhattan, but we could come back to that] is by 
<br>
far the best way to go ....
<br>
<p>But I also find the repeated outbreaks of IQ discussion on this list to 
<br>
be something bordering on the ridiculous.
<br>
<p>{Let's see:  there hasn't been a great symphonist in the world since 
<br>
Dmitri Shostakovitch popped his clogs ..... so do you suppose we could 
<br>
get another set of truly historic symphonies if we put one hundred 
<br>
high-IQ folks in a composing retreat, or if we put one hundred of the 
<br>
world's best musicians in a composing retreat?   Answers on a postcard 
<br>
please, and DO NOT get distracted by red herrings, like whether g is a 
<br>
good predictor of various boring measures like income or publications or 
<br>
the ability to hold back farts).
<br>
<p>Frankly, I think that the subset of high-IQ folks who know they are 
<br>
high-IQ, and who are activist about it, have an alarming tendency to be 
<br>
deluded about the power of pure thought .... as if there is something 
<br>
inherently better about any pure thoughts that they themselves have, 
<br>
compared with the thoughts of other people.
<br>
<p>Too many of those folks, in my experience, are hell on wheels at 
<br>
crossword puzzles and/or mathematics ... while at the same time being 
<br>
closed-minded, opinionated fools who wouldn't recognize a scientific 
<br>
method if it bit their head off.
<br>
<p>So let's please drop the IQ discussions and talk about whether an Apollo 
<br>
or Manhattan Project would make sense.
<br>
<p>Any takers?

<p><p><p><p><p><p><em> &gt; But I don't suppose testing really address the main problems.  Forget
</em><br>
<em> &gt; about the test... if we
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- took 100 technically, scientifically and conceptually gifted, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sane people from the membership of lists like SL4, extropy, AGI,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wta-talk and the futurist community generally
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- put them all (er, us all ;-) in some isolated facility [Los Alamos
</em><br>
<em> &gt; is nice, but I'll advocate a Caribbean island]
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- added in our in our families as well, as desired on a case by case 
</em><br>
basis
<br>
<em> &gt; -- added in a crew of system administrators (not to imply that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sys-admins aren't highly intelligent, many would be included in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; above groups), cooks, maids, and other useful support staff, and some
</em><br>
<em> &gt; competent managers to rule them all
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- added a couple hundred million dollars of standard and experimental
</em><br>
<em> &gt; computing equipment
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- added a big annual budget to fund research in university labs, so
</em><br>
<em> &gt; as to bring other minds into the picture
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- let everyone just work on creating a positive Singularity, without
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the need to earn $$ in other ways
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; How much faster would this bring the Singularity about, and how much
</em><br>
<em> &gt; would it increase the odds of the Singularity being positive?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Gee, this is a crazy fantasy -- except this, or some approximation of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it, would easily be achievable if someone like Bill Gates or Larry
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ellison or George W Bush decided it was important
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The point is: the problem has to do with the allocation of people and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; funds, not with isolating who is good or not.  I know plenty of folks
</em><br>
<em> &gt; who are very good at Singularity-critical work, and have a passion for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it as well, but very few are focusing their time and energy
</em><br>
<em> &gt; exclusively on this (even I am not) due to the socially-imposed need
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to earn money to support families and so forth; and furthermore the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; powerful cross-pollination of thinking that would come from a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Manhattan-project type collaboration does not exist ... instead people
</em><br>
<em> &gt; are mostly working in isolation, often replicating each others'
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mistakes over and over again.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;Intelligence and humanity are too multidimensional for that.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; But the binary ability to contribute or lack of such an ability to a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; particular project is surely not multidimensional at all.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ability to contribute may be defined as binary but depends on multiple
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dimensions of attributes...
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;If we want to maximize the odds of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;positive Singularity we should create an environment in which the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;diversity of natural intelligence is generally fostered.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;(Of course, none of that really matters if I'm right about Novamente,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;and the project is properly funded and flourishes and we create a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;superhuman AGI on a time-scale much faster than any education reform
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; &gt;can plausibly happen.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Aah.  There's the rub.  I'm sure many others here feel the same way 
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; their projects.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Yes, and IMO, at this stage, all these projects (ultimately there are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; not THAT many of them) with any degree of plausibility shouldn't be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; funded well and thought about hard by a community of passionate,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dedicated, knowledgeable and intelligent people....
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Unfortunately our society is organized to promote the proliferation of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; chocolates, cookies, and weapons instead, so getting the (difficult,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; but not so hard as people think) technical problems solved is taking a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; lot longer than it really needs to....
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; But testing to find the N most Singularity-creation-able people
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wouldn't solve anything -- what would we do? pat them on the back and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; say &quot;Good!  Now go apply for funding to do some Singularity work!  Or,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; since you're so clever, please feel morally obliged to quit your job,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dump your kids in the orphanage, and move into my basement and program
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and calculate full time&quot;  ;-)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Anyway, this may not be a particularly pointful thread, and I'm going
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to abandon it shortly as I'm leaving this afternoon for a 2-week trip
