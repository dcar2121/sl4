<p>There are certainly plenty of things that can only sensibly be
<br>
required to be background knowledge if productive discussion is to be
<br>
possible. The problems only start when most of the participants have
<br>
knowledge backgrounds that, at the higher levels, don't overlap. In
<br>
fact, that might be the biggest problem with this list. The kind of
<br>
discussions that are relevant, to be done properly, would take much
<br>
more knowledge than any single list member (perhaps save two or three,
<br>
I really don't know) has. Usually this kind of discussion is taken
<br>
place using the requisite number of words and effort. It seems there
<br>
aren't any participants, or enough participants, available to put in
<br>
the requisite effort. (And I think the effort would be very
<br>
significant--on the order of six to ten hours a week for someone
<br>
actively defending an idea.) And in the meantime, things get too
<br>
easily sidetracked by low-quality ideas and miscomprehension of
<br>
high-quality ones.
<br>
<p>In other words, I think the level of discussion aspired to by the
<br>
zeitgeist here can't be achieved without much higher time investments
<br>
by at least several of the most intelligent couple dozen people.
<br>
<p>My vote on the list sniping level? Mu. I think the best option is to
<br>
have ten lists (or better, blogs,) with different moderators who
<br>
moderate to level 10, to their own tastes, and people collectively
<br>
pick which list to participate in. Forking in open source projects is
<br>
bad, and bad in communities whose goal is some sort of collective
<br>
action. Forking is very good in communities whose goal is productive
<br>
discussion, for a wide variety of subtle reasons.
