Hi,
<br>
<p>On 8/21/06, Michael Anissimov &lt;<a href="mailto:michaelanissimov@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20A%20study%20comparing%20150%20IQ%2B%20persons%20to%20180%20IQ%2B%20persons">michaelanissimov@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Abstract:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Although there are numerous studies of gifted students, there have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been no studies following up the very high IQ students into adulthood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Using the Terman files, 26 subjects with scores above 180 IQ were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared with 26 randomly selected subjects from Terman's sample.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Findings were generally that the extra IQ points made little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference and that extremely high IQ does not seem to indicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;genius&quot; in the commonly understood sense of the word.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I read the article and the findings seem a lot more equivocal than the
<br>
abstract suggests... not anywhere near definitive...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What to make of this?  I'm not entirely certain, except to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is probably a point of diminishing returns with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence in humans, after which other factors such as social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills, self-control, emotional stability, etc. begin to dominate over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effects of IQ.
</em><br>
<p>What I make of this is very simple: The IQ test is a mediocre tool for
<br>
distinguishing levels of intelligence among different smart people.
<br>
<p>I don't necessarily believe there is a point of diminishing returns
<br>
with respect to intelligence, though I do believe other factors (such
<br>
as persistence and self-understanding) are also highly important to
<br>
intellectual achievement.
<br>
<p>But I do think that the IQ test is an obviously mediocre measure.
<br>
<p>IQ measures, basically, the ability to solve moderately difficult
<br>
problems rapidly under immediate social pressure.
<br>
<p>Whereas achieving great things intellectually is more about the
<br>
ability to solve EXTREMELY hard problems, without significant time
<br>
pressure or immediate social pressure.  (Not to even mention the other
<br>
psychological aspects like persistence, self-understanding, etc.)
<br>
<p>In computer science, algorithms that solve moderately hard problems
<br>
fast are not necessarily the same as ones that solve very hard
<br>
problems best given more time.  Something similar probably holds for
<br>
individual humans' &quot;cognitive algorithms.&quot;
<br>
<p>According to this analysis, among the population of very bright
<br>
people, there is going to be a nontrivial correlation btw IQ and the
<br>
cognitive skills required for intellectual greatness -- but not a very
<br>
strong correlation.  And this seems to be what the paper you
<br>
referenced suggests, rather than a total lack of correlation.
<br>
