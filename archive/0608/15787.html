<p>
Richard,
<br>
<p>Where are the powerful and viable approaches to Friendly AI you
<br>
mentioned?  Judging from your earlier response, it seems like you are
<br>
feverishly writing these approaches up as I speak.  The main point
<br>
here is that it's silly to reference such approaches without having,
<br>
well... references.
<br>
<p>I'm not taking sides, and if Eliezer habitually vanishes when you
<br>
reply to his accusations, then he should stop that... but he was
<br>
correct that you did refuse to reply three references.  How can these
<br>
approaches be so powerful and viable if they have not been exposed to
<br>
peer review, and currently exist only in your head, waiting to be put
<br>
down on paper?
<br>
<p>The existence or non-existence of a viable approach to Friendly AI is
<br>
a matter of life-or-death for the human race.  Do you agree?
<br>
<p>In light of such large stakes, we (as in me and you, I can't speak for
<br>
anyone else) should make a pact not to get personal in these sometimes
<br>
heated discussions.
<br>
