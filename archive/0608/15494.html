<p>It's a good question, but I think the answer is relatively straighforward.
<br>
<p>Computer science folks *know* what it means to program computers, and 
<br>
they know something about the open ended potential of programmed computers.
<br>
<p>Among folks who have never written a piece of software, I think there is 
<br>
really quite a large understanding gap:  I think that, more than with 
<br>
any other science, there is widespread difficulty even understanding 
<br>
what is involved, and what is its potential.  They tend to think it is 
<br>
just voodoo.
<br>
<p>To contrast with the other examples you give:  AIDS activists can 
<br>
extrapolate from their understanding of a hideous disease;  Advocates 
<br>
for feeding the world's hungry can imagine hunger magnified to the point 
<br>
of death;  People interested in stopping global warming can imagine 
<br>
greenhouses and heat that melts glaciers, etc.;  Supporters of 
<br>
third-world debt relief can imagine what it is like to owe so much money 
<br>
that all your salary goes to repayments, and fans of space exploration 
<br>
just need to imagine romantic tales of ship exploration, extrapolated to 
<br>
space-ships.
<br>
<p>The three main differences, I think, are these:
<br>
<p>1) The problem with AI is that people can imagine computers being 
<br>
intelligent, but they have no idea how difficult or easy that might be, 
<br>
so they don't know if it will happen tomorrow or in 2106 AD.
<br>
<p>2) When asked to imagine superintelligent computers that work at 1000 
<br>
times human thought speed, their brains recoil from the shear craziness 
<br>
of the idea (not just ships extrapolated to space-ships, more like ships 
<br>
extrapolated to wormhole/timemachine/universe surfing machines .... and 
<br>
that is no longer mere extrapolation).
<br>
<p>3) When asked to imagine AI, they think of every stupid horror movie and 
<br>
horror story ever written, and since they have nothing but these 
<br>
fictional examples, they cannot imagine AI dispassionately and 
<br>
disconnect it from the raving fantasies of science fiction writers.
<br>
<p>I think computer science people are better at 1 and 2, although they do 
<br>
tend to panic about 3 as much as the rest of the population (hence this 
<br>
List, which is dominated by considerations of Friendliness that are not 
<br>
always very rational).
