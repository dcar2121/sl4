My thinking had been more philosophical -- could two literal human 
<br>
brains produce only one mind? It would be my thought that we don't have 
<br>
the science to carefully design the nature of the link, but we probably 
<br>
have (or nearly have) the science to create a physical link.
<br>
<p>Even if it was by using electrode stimulation of a skin patch from an 
<br>
electrode mesh around the scalp, some kind of channel could be formed. 
<br>
It seems to be the kind of practical test that could actually be performed.
<br>
<p>I believe that some work has already been done on both sides of the 
<br>
channel. One example is the ability to give a sense of vision to blind 
<br>
people using a camera feed to stimulate a patch of skin. Another is (and 
<br>
I forget what this is called) where people learn to control their mental 
<br>
states by using a computer game which rewards the entering of those 
<br>
mental states.
<br>
<p>Another is the example of using rat brain cells to form a neural network 
<br>
capable of flying a plane in a flight simulator.
<br>
<p>It seems like it should be possible to perform an animal experiment of 
<br>
some kind in order to test the technology.
<br>
<p>I find successful practical demonstrations more &quot;shocking&quot; that the mere 
<br>
concept of the potential for technological advance. Even though, in and 
<br>
of itself, it is less shocking that something like a Singularity (or 
<br>
other SL4), because of the weight it adds to the argument for practical 
<br>
achievement of an SL4 event, it is in a sense SL4.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
