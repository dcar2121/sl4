energy isn't being created but being derived from a previously untappable

source (zero point energy?), which would still be a discovery of serious

ramifications.
<br>
As to it's significance to the singularity, while this is highly
<br>
speculative, if something like the absurdly large zero point energy of a
<br>
vacuume could effectively be tapped, it'd mean that once a singularity based
<br>
intelegence goes about it's supposed task of turning all matter into
<br>
computers it'd have a way more to work with.
