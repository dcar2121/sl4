<p>
Manhattan took three approaches to building a bomb.  Two of them worked and 
<br>
the third was known before they started that it would not work.  I am not 
<br>
entirely sure why it was even tried.
<br>
<p>Apollo took one approach, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and that worked.  In both 
<br>
cases the physics was understood, it was mostly a project of engineering 
<br>
the hardware.
<br>
<p>The difference with an AI to Singularity project is that--as far as I 
<br>
know--nobody knows how to do it.  (Correct me if I am wrong here.)
<br>
<p>I notice that a burn rate for money is proposed, not a total to complete 
<br>
the task.
<br>
<p>The only way I feel confident would work is to duplicate the functions of a 
<br>
human brain.  At some level of fidelity you would get human level 
<br>
intelligence (along with less desirable features).  But it is not obvious 
<br>
to me how such as being would reach into itself to make improvements any 
<br>
more than we can reach into our brains and tweek them.
