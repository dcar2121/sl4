<em>&gt;&gt; Old, old, old alternative hypothesis disconfirmed a dozen ways from

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; starting with &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot; and moving on to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Heuristics and Biases&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You just attacked an argument that has nothing whatsoever to do with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that I actually made.
</em><br>
<p>Well, let's see.  For one thing, it flatly demonstrates that you're not 
<br>
familiar with the literature.  So does your statement here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So in the case of the above experiment, I had forgotten the punchline of the experiment, so I looked at it and did it on the spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey presto:  my first answer was (2)!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  Because, even though I had been primed by all the Conjunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fallacy stuff in the last week, I completely forgot to notice that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first string was shorter than the other two (perhaps because all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RRRR strings misled my eye, in the way that you may, depending on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mail client, have had your own eye misled earlier in this sentence). And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the other hand I did notice (because I had been primed by the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant information given in the instructions) that there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the three strings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was also rushing because I felt some urgency to prove to myself that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could polish it off quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well well well.  I am stupid and irrational, apparently!   And there is no other explanation for my (or the subjects') behavior:  it really cannot be anything except irrational stupidity. 
</em><br>
<p>This is, simply put, exactly the standard experimental result *and its 
<br>
standard interpretation*: subjects substitute judgment of 
<br>
representativeness for judgment of probability.
<br>
<p>You noticed differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the 
<br>
three strings?  That's called, &quot;judgment by representativeness&quot; or &quot;the 
<br>
representativeness heuristic&quot;.  In a nutshell.
<br>
<p>You could not possibly fail to recognize this if you had absorbed any 
<br>
substantial amount of literature on heuristics and biases.  It'll be in 
<br>
the first chapters of any work on the subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Specifically, there are two interpretations of their role:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) The interfering mechanisms were just dumb, maladaptive strategies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, systematic biasses and mistakes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) These other mechanisms were not just systematic biasses, but may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually have been components of very powerful, sensible, adaptive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive mechanisms that do not use logical reasoning, and without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the system as a whole could not function.  A number of people have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that are equal or closely related to this point, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interpretation (1) is the default assumption in the literature.  To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent that the literature looked at what was going on in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments, it tended to treat the situation as one of rationality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupted by mistakes.
</em><br>
<p>The standard approach is that biases can shed light on our actual 
<br>
reasoning methods, the heuristics, that are producing the mistakes.
<br>
<p>Judgment by representativeness, like judgment by availability, is a 
<br>
heuristic that can often produce useful results - some even say a fast 
<br>
and frugal heuristic - but the heuristic also produces systematic 
<br>
biases, which are what reveal to us that the heuristic exists in the 
<br>
first place, and what pin down how the heuristic must be working to 
<br>
produce those specific biases.
<br>
<p>The field that emphasizes the evolutionary rationale of heuristics would 
<br>
be the &quot;fast and frugal&quot; crowd.  (There is no sign that Loosemore is 
<br>
familiar with this paradigm, either.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [BEGIN META-COMMENT]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You say that your analysis represents the &quot;mainstream conclusions of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental science&quot;.  And you tell me that I should &quot;Go forth and read 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the literature before [I] make up [my] own interpretations&quot;.  You think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just made up my own interpretations?  I have had extensive discussions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about these and other issues with people like Mike Oaksford (he and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were at UCNW Bangor together, then at Warwick), and to a lesser extent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Nick Chater.  I have also benefitted from many discussions with Tom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ormerod, who does experimental work in the same field.  In 1987 I did an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensive analysis of Phil Johnson-Laird's work, and although I never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got to challenge him in person, I did talk to Alan Garnham, one of his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students, and got a great deal of agreement from him about my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the issues and my specific criticisms of J-L.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strangely, Oaksford and Chater disagree with your analysis, as do Evans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Over.  From my limited understanding of them, Maule and Hodgkinson 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2002), and Tetlock and Mellers (2002) would also be in sympathy with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the position I just took.  As would many others that I have talked with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the years, who do not work directly in this area.  Given all of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, it hardly sounds like you presented the mainstream conclusions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an experimental science.
</em><br>
<p>I sampled two of these names, Mike Oaksford and Phil Johnson-Laird.  I 
<br>
didn't hit any papers in the field of heuristics and biases.  I see no 
<br>
evidence that they have ever worked in the field of heuristics and 
<br>
biases.  I did see papers on the construction of mental models, which, 
<br>
if you happened to be completely unfamiliar with the field of heuristics 
<br>
and biases, could be mistaken for information relevant to interpreting 
<br>
the Linda experiment.
<br>
<p>I did, indeed, present the mainstream conclusions of an experimental 
<br>
science.  Which, it seems, Richard has never heard of.  He is not even 
<br>
aware of who works in the field and who does not; he does not know 
<br>
*which* field I am talking about.
<br>
<p>I won't say that Richard was &quot;bluffing&quot; - since he has no idea the field 
<br>
of heuristics and biases exists, he has no idea that his distantly 
<br>
related reading about other things, is not knowledge of that field.  But 
<br>
he is still rather ignorant and rather unaware of it.
<br>
<p>My original email reply to his first message still says all that needed 
<br>
to be said:  RTFM!  (To name a specific M, &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot; 
<br>
would do him some good.)
