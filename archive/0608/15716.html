Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will also point out that there is a limited supply of high IQ teachers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The average teacher has an IQ under 110.  They can probably teach kids rote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, but can they effectively teach amorphous creativity and thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities that they probably don't posess themselves?  I don't think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any standard teacher's answer cheat guides will help them in this.
</em><br>
<p>That is certainly true, but the lack of teachers possessing high
<br>
intelligence and other desirable qualities is not an inevitable fact,
<br>
but rather a consequence of the organization of the educational
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Just as is, for instance, the lack of university AI professors who
<br>
take AGI seriously ;-) ... these things all tie in together.  Given
<br>
the deep cultural opposition to radical innovation and invention and
<br>
deep individual insight, it is remarkable how much individuality and
<br>
enterprise and creation actually comes about....  It is remarkable
<br>
that the exponents on Kurzweil's graphs are still as big as they are.
<br>
In large part I suppose this is because our culture values wealth, and
<br>
even though it dislikes radical innovation, it rewards wealth which is
<br>
sometimes a consequence of radical innovation...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, it is concievable that we could create a test that will identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the group of 100 people which probably contains half of the N people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most capable in respects relevant to creating a Singularity.  Any attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so would be the implementation of  an art, not of a science, as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't norm such a test, and administering it to a large enough population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find the people who we wanted would be very costly, (maybe one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administer it to CTY graduates or people above some Math Olympiad cut-off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead?) but we don't really know how difficult this would be, as no-one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has tried.
</em><br>
<p>This seems extremely doubtful to me, due to the diversity of talents
<br>
and insights required for bringing the Singularity about.
<br>
<p>However, setting aside the &quot;best&quot; aspect, we could certainly create a
<br>
test that would successfully identify 100 or 1000 people who would be
<br>
incredibly useful for creating a positive Singularity.
<br>
<p>But I don't suppose testing really address the main problems.  Forget
<br>
about the test... if we
<br>
-- took 100 technically, scientifically and conceptually gifted, and
<br>
sane people from the membership of lists like SL4, extropy, AGI,
<br>
wta-talk and the futurist community generally
<br>
-- put them all (er, us all ;-) in some isolated facility [Los Alamos
<br>
is nice, but I'll advocate a Caribbean island]
<br>
-- added in our in our families as well, as desired on a case by case basis
<br>
-- added in a crew of system administrators (not to imply that
<br>
sys-admins aren't highly intelligent, many would be included in the
<br>
above groups), cooks, maids, and other useful support staff, and some
<br>
competent managers to rule them all
<br>
-- added a couple hundred million dollars of standard and experimental
<br>
computing equipment
<br>
-- added a big annual budget to fund research in university labs, so
<br>
as to bring other minds into the picture
<br>
-- let everyone just work on creating a positive Singularity, without
<br>
the need to earn $$ in other ways
<br>
<p>How much faster would this bring the Singularity about, and how much
<br>
would it increase the odds of the Singularity being positive?
<br>
<p>Gee, this is a crazy fantasy -- except this, or some approximation of
<br>
it, would easily be achievable if someone like Bill Gates or Larry
<br>
Ellison or George W Bush decided it was important
<br>
<p>The point is: the problem has to do with the allocation of people and
<br>
funds, not with isolating who is good or not.  I know plenty of folks
<br>
who are very good at Singularity-critical work, and have a passion for
<br>
it as well, but very few are focusing their time and energy
<br>
exclusively on this (even I am not) due to the socially-imposed need
<br>
to earn money to support families and so forth; and furthermore the
<br>
powerful cross-pollination of thinking that would come from a
<br>
Manhattan-project type collaboration does not exist ... instead people
<br>
are mostly working in isolation, often replicating each others'
<br>
mistakes over and over again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Intelligence and humanity are too multidimensional for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the binary ability to contribute or lack of such an ability to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular project is surely not multidimensional at all.
</em><br>
<p>Ability to contribute may be defined as binary but depends on multiple
<br>
dimensions of attributes...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If we want to maximize the odds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;positive Singularity we should create an environment in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;diversity of natural intelligence is generally fostered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(Of course, none of that really matters if I'm right about Novamente,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and the project is properly funded and flourishes and we create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;superhuman AGI on a time-scale much faster than any education reform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;can plausibly happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aah.  There's the rub.  I'm sure many others here feel the same way about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their projects.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and IMO, at this stage, all these projects (ultimately there are
<br>
not THAT many of them) with any degree of plausibility shouldn't be
<br>
funded well and thought about hard by a community of passionate,
<br>
dedicated, knowledgeable and intelligent people....
<br>
<p>Unfortunately our society is organized to promote the proliferation of
<br>
chocolates, cookies, and weapons instead, so getting the (difficult,
<br>
but not so hard as people think) technical problems solved is taking a
<br>
lot longer than it really needs to....
<br>
<p>But testing to find the N most Singularity-creation-able people
<br>
wouldn't solve anything -- what would we do? pat them on the back and
<br>
say &quot;Good!  Now go apply for funding to do some Singularity work!  Or,
<br>
since you're so clever, please feel morally obliged to quit your job,
<br>
dump your kids in the orphanage, and move into my basement and program
<br>
and calculate full time&quot;  ;-)
<br>
<p>Anyway, this may not be a particularly pointful thread, and I'm going
<br>
to abandon it shortly as I'm leaving this afternoon for a 2-week trip
<br>
to Europe (for a combination of Novamente-related visits, a
<br>
non-Novamente-related academic conference presentation, and hiking in
<br>
the Alps).   I suppose the reason I launched on this rant is that the
<br>
focus on testing people irritates me.  It's not the right focus.  If
<br>
we're going to think and yakk about things besides Singularity-focused
<br>
technology, IMO the stupid organization of our society is more
<br>
important and relevant and interesting than the capability or
<br>
otherwise of some particular test to assess anything interesting...
