<em>&gt;It seems people are not putting as much emphasis on finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the One True Unifying Principle to create AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think?
</em><br>
<p>And, as was probably implicit in my prior reply, I do not think any
<br>
such One True Unifying Principle exists; and I think that the search
<br>
for such a Principle is misleading, has slowed down AI in the past,
<br>
and will probably continue to slow it down in the future...
<br>
<p>A mind consists of a general-purpose pattern recognition engine
<br>
coupled with a host of appropriately-chosen special-purpose
<br>
pattern-recognition engines.  The general-purpose pattern recognition
<br>
engine must be given the capability to introspect (recognize patterns
<br>
in itself) and also to modify itself with some reasonable flexibility.
<br>
&nbsp;A knowledge representation and operational framework must be created
<br>
allowing these different pattern-recognition engines to productively
<br>
interact and contribute to the same evolving knowledge store.  There
<br>
must also be a pragmatic &quot;action execution framework&quot; so that patterns
<br>
involving which actions to carry out in which situations may be not
<br>
only learned but executed.  And, the operational framework must be
<br>
linked in with a specialized pattern-recognition engine whose goal is
<br>
to intelligently allocate resources among the various
<br>
pattern-recognition engines...
<br>
<p>In all this, there is no central magic trick.  There are plenty of
<br>
clever tricks needed to make the various components work, along with
<br>
highly competent integrative design and engineering.
<br>
<p>While I have expressed the above in my own language, I suppose that a
<br>
similar intuition underlies the work of others who are working on
<br>
&quot;integrative&quot; approaches to AGI.
<br>
<p>Phil, do you disagree with this overall intuition regarding the nature
<br>
of intelligence?  If so, could you elaborate?  What role do you think
<br>
the &quot;special magic trick&quot; at the core of intelligence, if any, plays?
<br>
Do you think it underlies both generalized and specialized pattern
<br>
recognition ability, or do you think it's a special trick for
<br>
generalized pattern recognition?  Or would you reject this language
<br>
for discussing things altogether?
<br>
