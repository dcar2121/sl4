</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion, for a wide variety of subtle reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would be an example of a community that forked to good effect?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did the membership grow or fracture with that transition? And are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there different kinds of communities that require different handling?
</em><br>
<p>First, when a community &quot;forks&quot;, it's not a real split, like a
<br>
Christian church forking would be. And it's not always explicit, or
<br>
because of explicit tensions within the group. I would say forking
<br>
happens when another community grows primarily out of the interactions
<br>
born of the first community, and the latter starts to attract members
<br>
of the former, some of whom stop participating in the former, and the
<br>
two groups develop in different directions.
<br>
<p>Hmm, examples. Don't really have any good ones. The communities I
<br>
participate in are mostly hosted on blogs, and there are so many
<br>
interrelated blogs that when something like this happens, it's a
<br>
gradual, continuous, and quiet process. Like speciation. More of a
<br>
&quot;oh, this blog has alienated/bored/annoyed me so I'll stop reading it
<br>
and continue reading the five other blogs I already read that share a
<br>
substantial intersection of the topics, readers, and commenters on the
<br>
other&quot;. (Some of this might happen between the various transhumanist
<br>
mailing lists, but I'm only a member of this one so I wouldn't know.)
<br>
But on the whole, the effect is that opinion-space is gradually filled
<br>
with different communities representing any ideology and level of
<br>
discussion with that there's a substantial demand for. I think it's
<br>
the dynamic that keeps the blogosphere happy.
<br>
<p>When a shift happens in a given community, it's not possible to call
<br>
it good or bad, except from the point of view of an individual
<br>
community member. That's an inherent property of the tensions that
<br>
cause these shifts. What seems to be universally true is that the
<br>
community becomes more specialized and homogeneous. This can either
<br>
raise or lower the level of discourse, and make the group more or less
<br>
productive, depending on who gets alienated and leaves (or gets
<br>
booted). In blogs, this sort of thing tends not to cause much strife,
<br>
since the community almost always has a clear owner who sets the tone
<br>
and has the sole moderation power. People who don't fit in with the
<br>
main voice just don't stick around, instead of making trouble. Then
<br>
interesting discussion happens between extremes within the commenters,
<br>
who all at least have some common ground with the main voice (who
<br>
ideally, is a mediator in discussions.)
<br>
<p>This list is similar, but the effect is stronger on blogs because the
<br>
owner also sets the topics, and thus the direction of discussion, more
<br>
strongly. Eliezer hardly ever writes posts directed toward fostering
<br>
discussion on the list, and those who do (recently me, Russell,
<br>
Michael A., et al.) don't have the automatic sanction of authority.
<br>
Without that, people who disagree with posts to the extent that they
<br>
can't respectually discuss them won't be driven out of the list, since
<br>
those they disagree with have no more authority than them. This leads
<br>
to turf wars.
