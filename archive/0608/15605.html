Toy companies, yes.  But they're also working towards human-services.  
<br>
This isn't really practical yet, but that's a part of the focus.  I'm 
<br>
not convinced about &quot;uncanny valley&quot;, but even considering the concept 
<br>
is a significant point of where the interest is.  Guys who make robots 
<br>
that imitate a TV star in appearance.  Think about that for a bit.  What 
<br>
does that say about where their focus is.  True it's not to the point 
<br>
yet of practicality, but it's getting closer.  And that professor who 
<br>
made himself a robot &quot;double&quot;, and had it give some of his lectures.  
<br>
Yes, it's impractical.  But what does it say about the focus.
