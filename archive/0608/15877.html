<p>
AT LAST!!!!  Some more people are beginning to want to talk about the 
<br>
actual issues.
<br>
<p>The point at issue (well, the one I raised, and I was the one who 
<br>
started this) is a fairly subtle one, and not easy to convey to amateurs 
<br>
like Eliezer:  by focussing on the human mechanism as a &quot;malfunctioning 
<br>
version of a perfect reasoner&quot; you could completely ruin your chances of 
<br>
building a viable AGI. The reason?  There are indications that what the 
<br>
human system is doing is deploying a bunch of powerful and useful 
<br>
mechanisms that are not appropriate for the task (indeed, when the 
<br>
system is on the threshold of acquiring a new skill, it always does that).
<br>
<p>What does this mean?  Well, it *could* mean that to build a powerful 
<br>
thinking system you need 99% &lt;clever mechanisms for building new 
<br>
concepts, etc.&gt; and 1% pure reasoning system.  And the 1% pure reasoning 
<br>
system is something that can only be used under some circumstances, and 
<br>
it has to be aqcuired because it IS just another heuristic.
<br>
<p>The interesting thing is that it is hard to decide between this and the 
<br>
alternative approach:  it needs science!  It needs empirical data!
<br>
<p>So far, there are plenty of indications (to people well versed enough in 
<br>
the details of cognitive science) that the suggested approach above IS 
<br>
the most likely explanation.
<br>
<p>But if you go around interpreting the heuristics and biasses results in 
<br>
the way that some people (e.g Yudkowsky) interpret them, you close off 
<br>
the door to even the *possibility* that this al;ternative might be 
<br>
correct.  And if they are wrong, but carry on dominating the research 
<br>
field in spite of that, AI research could be stuck in a quagmire for 
<br>
another fifty years.
<br>
<p>Hence:  BIG and important question if you care about whether or not AI 
<br>
researchers spend the next fifty years pissing into the wind.
<br>
<p>That is why the question was worth discussing.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, all of this is going *way* over the heads of people 
<br>
like Eliezer.  Or it would, if people like that had the reading skills 
<br>
to get more than one paragraph into a post.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please correct me if any of the following are the slightest bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) All human brains have many cognitive biases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Human brains do not use Bayesian Reasoning   (nb: 2 can be derived 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from 1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Any _really_ powerful AI needs to avoid the same cognitive-bias
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pitfalls as humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) A really-powerful-AI shall not live by Bayes alone (or, at least, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seed-AI can't)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) Any would-be-powerful-AI is going to utilise some other decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, at least in part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we're all very clear and in agreement about this, why is any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular cognitive bias excruciatingly important?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A fair understanding of human decision making processes is good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informing AI research, but I don't see the importance on getting hung
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up on any particular aspect of the human brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ANALOGY:  Plane designers should have a basic understanding of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birds fly, and the aerodynamics of birds' bodies.  However, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aeroplane designers to bicker over the effects of turbulence effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between feathers is /irrelevant/ to the task of designing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aeroplane, even a mechanical wing-flapping-aeroplane.  Birds aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly aerodynamic.  They could be improved.  They are a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of how a flying machine can work, but aren't the only one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, designing a working AI is harder than designing a plane.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is that aeronautical engineers were not bird-biologists even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the wright brothers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, fer crying out loud, don't read too much into any particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive bias.  They are significant, but I doubt that any human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent of cognitive-bias study will tell one how to build an AI.
