</em><br>
<p>You've missed something, Mark -- the example that started this
<br>
subthread of the argument (the feminist bank teller question and the
<br>
typical responses it gets) *is a canonical heuristics-and-biases
<br>
example*.  That's where this aspect of the debate began; Eliezer is
<br>
not trying to steer away from modeling, except insofar as Richard
<br>
keeps seeming to think modeling is part of the heuristics-and-biases
<br>
subfield, which it isn't.
<br>
<p>Richard posed what he thinks is a more plausible alternative
<br>
explanation the feminist bank teller experimental results.  That
<br>
alternative was one of the first, most obvious alternatives proffered
<br>
by psych folks, and it has been experimentally tested and *does not*
<br>
explain people's responses to the feminist bank teller problem.
<br>
<p>That Richard thought his alternative explanation was something novel
<br>
for us to think about demonstrates pretty clearly a lack of knowledge
<br>
of one of the most basic series of experiments in the subfield of
<br>
heuristics and biases.  This was Eliezer's point.  (The further point,
<br>
that mental models *isnt* heuristics and biases, is also sound, and
<br>
further demonstrates Richard's lack of knowledge of h&amp;b, but is
<br>
redundant given the first point, which is elementary and
<br>
straightforward.)
<br>
<p>As someone else who has read a good bit of h&amp;b literature, it really
<br>
is ridiculous how Richard, and now you, are reacting.  Richard's
<br>
alternative proposal demonstrates ignorance of *basics* in a field
<br>
he's claiming competency in.  The only thing further that Eliezer
<br>
might do in support of his point is provide direct references to
<br>
feminist bank teller articles... but, knowing that he's right on this
<br>
matter, I wouldn't really fault him for not going out of his way to do
<br>
Richard's research for him.  But it would potentially clear up the
<br>
(very odd, because so basic, IMO) dispute regarding the feminist bank
<br>
teller and h&amp;b.
