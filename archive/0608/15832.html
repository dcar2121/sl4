When the emotional level is raise, reasoned discourse declines.  
<br>
Abruptly.  To me it seemed that Richard was the one who initially raised 
<br>
the emotional level, but I wasn't paying close attention.  Certainly his 
<br>
continuations became more intensely emotional.
<br>
<p>I can't claim to expertise in either of the fields that are under 
<br>
discussion, so I didn't try to follow the details beyond the first 
<br>
couple of rounds of posting.  (I also suspect that natural systems 
<br>
aren't highly optimized..or at least that one can't count on that.  
<br>
Local optimization happens, of course, but basic designs don't tend to 
<br>
be revised, so one should EXPECT systems to be globally sub-optimal.  
<br>
(E.g., the nerves in front of the retina, the trachea where separated 
<br>
passages would be preferable, etc.)  I see no reason to expect that 
<br>
patterns of thought would be any less subject to this effect.
