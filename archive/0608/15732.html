<em>&gt; Intelligence is one of the Singularitarian Principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/sing/principles.html#intelligence">http://yudkowsky.net/sing/principles.html#intelligence</a>):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;At the heart of an appreciation of the Singularity lies an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciation of intelligence.  The Singularity places a horizon across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our understanding because we can't predict what someone smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us is going to do; if we could, we'd be that smart ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence isn't just the ability to come up with complex solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to complex problems; it's the ability to see the shortcuts, the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and obvious-in-retrospect solutions to complex problems - even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional or philosophical problems.  Intelligence isn't just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-speed thinking, perfect memories, or other party tricks;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence is also wisdom, and self-awareness, and other things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend into every aspect of mind and personality.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree that intelligence is important, but let's pause and step back: the
<br>
above quote correctly observes that an operational view of it includes a lot
<br>
of things that aren't strongly correlated with IQ.
<br>
<p>I suppose the point I'm trying to make here is (editing the subject to
<br>
match): attempting to create more accurate tests for the high end of the IQ
<br>
range, or arriving at more accurate conclusions as to how good a predictor
<br>
it is, even if successful, would not be a very useful enterprise. What
<br>
_would_ be a useful enterprise is finding ways for people who have
<br>
reasonably or very high IQs - i.e. possess the raw brainpower to potentially
<br>
do something useful - to actually put it to good use. SL4 like any mailing
<br>
list is necessarily, as was said about my Scottish ancestors, &quot;long on
<br>
tongue and short on purse&quot;, so within that framework...
<br>
<p>Eliezer's papers about rationality are a very good contribution in this
<br>
direction. I'd recommend a lot of Robin Hanson's writing as well. (In
<br>
addition to the usual reading list, of course, and seconding the idea that
<br>
evolutionary psychology is a particularly important subject to study.)
<br>
<p>What else is there?
<br>
<p>As I said recently in another thread, I think finding an emotional place to
<br>
stand is an important issue; man does not live by bread and logic alone.
<br>
There were a couple of &quot;transhuman religion&quot; mailing lists that had other
<br>
takes on that; they sort of petered out because, well let's be honest, a
<br>
group consisting mostly of geeks (yours truly of course included) isn't the
<br>
most qualified to do something like that, but they represent some ideas
<br>
nonetheless.
<br>
<p>Plain drive is another thing. A lot of intelligence is being sharpened on
<br>
video games; how much is also being buried in them? Probably less than gets
<br>
buried in television and fashion, at least in a video game you're actively
<br>
doing _something_. I'd like to have a shot at designing a video game such
<br>
that when you completed the last level, defeated the last boss... the next
<br>
level of the game is to discover a cure for cancer, or create AI, or build a
<br>
molecular assembler in the real world. But there are only 24 hours in the
<br>
day. (I will, however, add another item to the reading list: 'Skallagrigg'
<br>
by William Horwood.)
<br>
<p>Mistuned neurochemistry is a problem for some people, as has been remarked
<br>
here. Plenty of more qualified people than me are on that problem, so I
<br>
won't comment further on it here.
<br>
<p>What are the biggest reasons why people with so much brainpower don't end up
<br>
accomplishing much with it? I'm guessing the following, in no particular
<br>
order, are the most important reasons:
<br>
<p>1) Neurochemistry sometimes gets wonky when you overclock that much; see
<br>
above.
<br>
<p>2) Lack of drive/interest. Just because a man is built like an ox doesn't
<br>
necessarily mean he has a drive to enter weightlifting championships;
<br>
presumably it's sometimes that way with the mind too. If anyone like that is
<br>
reading this: there is a war being waged, not against your fellow man but
<br>
against the ultimate enemy that waits for us all, where the weapon of choice
<br>
is not the gun or missile but the mind. I do not know what to say that would
<br>
convince you - emotionally, not just intellectually - that your service is
<br>
needed; personally, something I have done from time to time is remind myself
<br>
of the stand of three hundred Spartans at Thermopylae that, it has been
<br>
coherently argued, ultimately gave us this chance; in that light I can
<br>
forgive myself only if I failed because the task was beyond my ability or
<br>
resources - not because I didn't try with everything I had. If that image
<br>
doesn't work for you, then I would ask you to look for one that does.
<br>
<p>3) When we're teenagers everything looks terrible one minute and wonderful
<br>
the next; a social encounter turned sour is occasion to weep into one's
<br>
beer, a good idea occasion to contemplate immortality. As we grow older, it
<br>
becomes more clear that the more extreme dreams were just that, nothing
<br>
worthwhile is gained without long, exhausting labor, and the future is
<br>
inherently uncertain. It's hard to make that adjustment - that goes back to
<br>
my earlier comments on an emotional place to stand.
<br>
<p>4) We get stuck in intellectual dead ends. Einstein rejecting quantum
<br>
mechanics, Hoyle with the extreme panspermia, George Lucas, Robert Jordan
<br>
and other victims of the notorious Brain Eater of the narrative arts; but
<br>
there are any number of lesser cases. There are times when one must discard
<br>
one's inventory to walk through the next veil. I don't know offhand how to
<br>
convince people of that.
<br>
<p>(I'm trying _not_ to just repeat certain things I've stated in the past that
<br>
certain members of this list find controversial. If said members find such
<br>
repeat has occurred and they need to reply thereto, go ahead and take the
<br>
last word on that; I won't argue unless I've something new to say. I'd still
<br>
be interested, separately, in your opinions on what I am trying to get
<br>
across here.)
<br>
<p>Other ideas welcome!
