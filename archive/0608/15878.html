<p>No no no:  Rik, it is really very, very *easy*.  And I would welcome 
<br>
your impartial help in carrying out the following test.
<br>
<p>Do it like this.  Take the end of the last main post I wrote on the 
<br>
Conjunction Fallacy thread, where I laid out Eliezer's utterances about 
<br>
&quot;mental models&quot; and the relationship between &quot;mental models&quot; researchers 
<br>
and &quot;heuristics and biasses&quot; people ....... all that stuff, and put it 
<br>
in front of a lecturer who teaches a basic course in cognitive 
<br>
psychology using (say) the Eysenck and Keane text, and ask that lecturer 
<br>
what they would think of a student who made the claims that Eliezer 
<br>
made.  Tell them to take a look at the rest of the correspondence, if 
<br>
you like, but warn them not to waste too much time on on it because it 
<br>
is just too depressing.
<br>
<p>Specifically, ask if a person who claimed to be an expert in the 
<br>
research on human reasoning could have the name &quot;Phil Johnson-Laird&quot; put 
<br>
in front of them, and yet have to google his name to find out who he 
<br>
was.  Ask if that same expert could be as confused as Eliezer was about 
<br>
what &quot;Mental Models&quot; signified, in the context of human reasoning.
<br>
<p>And then find another nine lecturers and do the same thing.
<br>
<p>Get a count of how many of them think that someone who writes about the 
<br>
subject the way Eleiezer does, is sane.
<br>
<p>Then come back to the list and publish the results.
<br>
