<p><em>&gt;While I am on the subject, would anyone be interested in giving me their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thoughts about *positive* examples of fictional AI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I mean is, how many times have SF writers (whether in written or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movie form) created fictional futures in which the AI was not the villain?
</em><br>
<p>I posted a draft of a story about an AI that was a nanotech clinic in a 
<br>
tiny African village right here.  Some people wrote me about it, but there 
<br>
was no discussion about it at all.  Guess it was too ordinary for this crew.
<br>
<p>If you didn't read it then, and want to, there is a considerably later 
<br>
draft available.

<p><em>&gt;And within that category, in how many of the cases was the AI portrayed as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having equal or superior intelligence (instead of turning out to be just a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glorified calculator that could be outsmarted by outmaneuvering its logic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circuits)?  I am less interested in these.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The only notable examples I can think of are Iain M. Banks Culture books, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Asimov's benign robots (who, if I recall correctly, tend to be of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less-than-human-equivalent sort).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lem's creations might count, but he is a little surreal.
