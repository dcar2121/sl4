<em>&gt; Funny.  I had absolutely no problem getting details and a highly rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workplan from Richard a while back by asking nicely.  Maybe it had something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the fact that every time he tried to get started, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully suckered him into derailing onto trivialities.
</em><br>
<p>But the thing is, Loosemore actually *did* score above 70 on the
<br>
crackpot index.  When pressured to give references for what he was
<br>
talking about, he would reply with 2-page rambling emails that
<br>
continuously dodged the main point.  Loosemore seemed perfectly
<br>
capable of derailing *himself* into trivialities even when I was being
<br>
incredibly blunt and straightforward.  Always beating around the bush,
<br>
talking about how incredibly well-educated he is, etc etc etc and
<br>
always producing ample quantities of dense bullshit.
<br>
<p>I agree with some of his Complex Systems arguments (you truly can't
<br>
always predict global behavior based on local rules!), but I've never
<br>
seen anyone drag on so long when making such a simple point.
<br>
<p>One of my favorite posters on SL4 and extropians is Eugen Leitl,
<br>
because his posts are short, accurate, and to the point.  No bullshit.
<br>
&nbsp;Loosemore is like the polar opposite of Leitl.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; His ideas had a lot of the flavor of Hofstadter and were isomorphic with a
</em><br>
<p>Hah, no.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; shortcoming is that he feels that he needs to defend his dismissal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current approaches before proposing his approach and that's how you suckered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him in.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer and Loosemore both have fairly big egos... maybe they can't
<br>
exist on the same mailing list, even in principle.  Since this is
<br>
Eliezer's mailing list, it makes sense that Loosemore should be the
<br>
one to leave.  Both of them got too personal IMO, but it was Loosemore
<br>
was the only one to make his tone blatantly mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And so, in my opinion, burns the last shreds of credibility for Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this mailing list, and the Singularity Institute -- in the fires of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's emotions.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so pursuing the Singularity is meaningless now because Eliezer
<br>
banned someone.  I didn't know that maximum utility calculations were
<br>
so unstable to low-level perturbations in human social realms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; quite clear that no one (who might be a threat) who doesn't bow down to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edicts (or, at least, pay careful homage to your greatness) will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerated.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, this list is full of dozens of people who contradict Eliezer
<br>
constantly.  Big whup.  Some people are especially excited to
<br>
contradict him because it gives them a rush of transgressing some
<br>
boundary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; NO ONE except a couple of your Singularity Institute syncophants seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to support you, and
</em><br>
<p>I support Eliezer's decision, and trust me, I'm hardly a sycophant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'ma outa here . . . .
</em><br>
<p>Bye!
