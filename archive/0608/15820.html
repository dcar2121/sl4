</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream conclusions of an experimental science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go forth and read the literature before you make up

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot; and moving on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Heuristics and Biases&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You just attacked an argument that has nothing whatsoever to do with the
<br>
claim that I actually made.
<br>
<p>The claim that I made was *not*:
<br>
<p>(1*)  Tversky and Kahneman (etc.) failed to prove their case that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human reasoning behavior is flawed, because there are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good alternative explanations that can completely account
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all of their data.
<br>
<p>In fact, I explicitly disavow this conclusion:
<br>
<p>[Yudkowsky:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In each of these experiments, human psychology fails
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to follow the rules of probability theory.
</em><br>
<p>[Loosemore:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Correct:  because in normal discourse, human psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is required to carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive processing than the mere calculation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People are not very good at doing strict probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations, because those calculations require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms that have to be trained into them rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully, in order to avoid the problem of triggering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all those other mechanisms, which in the normal course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being a thinking creature are actually a lot more useful.
</em><br>
<p>You will notice that I clearly acknowledge here that human reasoning
<br>
ability is flawed.   Since this message does not appear to be getting
<br>
across, I will take a deep breath and shout it, to drive it home:
<br>
<p>I AM NOT CHALLENGING THIS BASIC POINT AND SAYING THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL
<br>
DATA SUPPORTING IT CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY.
<br>
<p>That question (about the validity of claim 1*) was thoroughly addressed
<br>
by the literature, and what those studies tried to do was to eliminate
<br>
all the other factors that were contributing to the effects, to see if
<br>
there was any residual effect of pure irrationality.
<br>
<p>My interpretation of the particular experiments that you cite (and
<br>
remember, you were the one who chose to cite experiments where the
<br>
effect was confounded with other factors) is that *other* *cognitive*
<br>
*mechanisms* played at least some role in interfering with the subjects'
<br>
interpretation of the questions, or interfered with their ability to
<br>
execute a probability calculation.  Those weak studies were a good
<br>
illustration that other things were at work, and that is the reason why
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I used them to illustrate possible interpretations of what was going
<br>
on.  For what it is worth, you will note (if you read the literature)
<br>
that the &quot;irrationality&quot; effects are diminished when more trouble is
<br>
taken to eliminate these other things .... evidence that they were
<br>
indeed responsible for part of the original effect.
<br>
<p>Are you clear on this distinction so far?  It is not that [Other
<br>
mechanisms interfered with the reasoning, and without those other
<br>
mechanisms the reasoning would have been perfect], it is that [Other
<br>
mechanisms interfered with the reasoning and *partially* accounted for
<br>
the imperfect reasoning].
<br>
<p>If you read my post in detail, you can see that the point I was trying
<br>
to focus on was the *nature* of the mechanisms that were causing some of
<br>
the reasoning errors:  unlike the people in the literature, whose put a
<br>
lot of effort into eliminating these other effects to see what remained,
<br>
my goal was to focus on what those other mechanisms were doing and how
<br>
important they might be in the larger scheme of things.
<br>
<p>Specifically, there are two interpretations of their role:
<br>
<p>1) The interfering mechanisms were just dumb, maladaptive strategies.
<br>
Basically, systematic biasses and mistakes.
<br>
<p>2) These other mechanisms were not just systematic biasses, but may
<br>
actually have been components of very powerful, sensible, adaptive
<br>
cognitive mechanisms that do not use logical reasoning, and without
<br>
which the system as a whole could not function.
<br>
<p>Interpretation (1) is the default assumption in the literature.  To the
<br>
extent that the literature looked at what was going on in these
<br>
experiments, it tended to treat the situation as one of rationality
<br>
corrupted by mistakes.
<br>
<p>Interpretation (2) is hard to investigate.  These other mechanisms
<br>
are extremely hard to pin down, and if you know anything at all about
<br>
the nature of the experimentation/theorization cycle in the science of
<br>
cognitive psychology (something that I have a few concerns about, given
<br>
your armchair experience in the field), you will know that what is
<br>
difficult to address by experiments tends to be ignored.
<br>
<p>But just because they are ignored, that does not mean they do not exist,
<br>
and their existence would have profound implications for the position
<br>
you take vis a vis the role of rationality in human thought.
<br>
<p>*That* was the argument in my post.  Not the silly argument that Tversky
<br>
and Kahneman's results can be completely explained away.
<br>
<p>In the face of the great difficulty involved in trying to assess the
<br>
relative importance of those other mechanisms, I stuck my neck out and
<br>
offered some examples of what they might be doing, in an attempt to show
<br>
that they might not have been mistakes or dumb strategies so much as
<br>
powerful mechanisms that govern pragmatics.  I used the weakness in the
<br>
Linda studies to highlight these possibilities.
<br>
<p>So when I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (my suggested interpretation would have to be tested:  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only giving an existence proof for an alternative explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- I could do the experiment, or maybe somebody already did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do the experiment.
</em><br>
<p>I did not mean doing experiments to test whether these mechanisms could
<br>
be used to EXPLAIN AWAY the irrationality effects (along the lines of
<br>
the totally naive and uninteresting Claim 1*), I was talking about the
<br>
almost impossible kinds of experiments that might establish exactly
<br>
*what* those mechanisms might be.  People have done some work along
<br>
these lines, but it is not very theoretically deep or empirically sound,
<br>
in my opinion.
<br>
<p>And then, of course, I got to the important conclusion of my post, the
<br>
way that some people apply their theories of human irrationality to the
<br>
larger processes of cognition (in this case, judgments of future
<br>
scenarios), and come to conclusions as if the Conjunction Fallacy, and
<br>
the general lack of logical reasoning skills, were the main determinants
<br>
in those analyses.
<br>
<p>[BEGIN META-COMMENT]
<br>
<p>You say that your analysis represents the &quot;mainstream conclusions of an
<br>
experimental science&quot;.  And you tell me that I should &quot;Go forth and read
<br>
the literature before [I] make up [my] own interpretations&quot;.
<br>
<p>You think I just made up my own interpretations?
<br>
<p>I have had extensive discussions about these and other issues with
<br>
people like Mike Oaksford (he and I were at UCNW Bangor together, then
<br>
at Warwick), and to a lesser extent with Nick Chater.  I have also
<br>
benefitted from many discussions with Tom Ormerod, who does experimental
<br>
work in the same field.  In 1987 I did an extensive analysis of Phil
<br>
Johnson-Laird's work, and although I never got to challenge him in
<br>
person, I did talk to Alan Garnham, one of his students, and got a great
<br>
deal of agreement from him about my understanding of the issues and my
<br>
specific criticisms of J-L.
<br>
<p>Strangely, Oaksford and Chater disagree with your analysis, as do Evans
<br>
and Over.  From my limited understanding of them, Maule and Hodgkinson
<br>
(2002), and Tetlock and Mellers (2002) would also be in sympathy with
<br>
the position I just took.  As would many others that I have talked with
<br>
over the years, who do not work directly in this area.  Given all of
<br>
this, it hardly sounds like you presented the mainstream conclusions of
<br>
an experimental science.
