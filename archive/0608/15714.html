<em>&gt;It's not too long before &quot;Gifted&quot; becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repurposed to mean &quot;Normal&quot; and another new word needs to be invented for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what used to be called &quot;smart&quot; ;-p
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but for two reasons.  One is language inflation, but the other is 
<br>
&quot;halo effect&quot;.  Any strongly  positive or negative affect word should tend 
<br>
to degenerate over time into simply an indicator of affect.  Trust me in my 
<br>
assertion that in the financial world this has definitely happened.  People 
<br>
often call someone smart when they mean that the person is rich.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, this Program for Highly Gifted is focused on teaching kids in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way that encourages them to think and create rather than on learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by rote.  But does it really benefit us to offer this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity only to the kids who score almost-perfectly on some test?
</em><br>
<p>Strangely, it probably does.  You should probably read what Linda 
<br>
Gottfredson and Thomas Sowell have to say about this, but I will point out 
<br>
that according to the NAES data
<br>
here
<br>
<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/</a>
<br>
the average person in the &quot;Highly Gifted&quot; program has probably already 
<br>
learned, by your daughter's age, essentially the same amount of rote 
<br>
information that a graduate of average IQ will have learned.  Studies of 
<br>
expertise and creativity usually stress the need to master the rote skills 
<br>
of a domain before creativity becomes possible.  Still, introspection will 
<br>
probably tell you what you need to know here if you are careful, or rather, 
<br>
will tell you that your intuitions are useless.  Look at the sort of 
<br>
questions that were on the test your daughter took, or on any well normed 
<br>
standard IQ test for 9 year olds, or even for adults.  Try to imagine what 
<br>
sort of instructino would be best for you if you were only able to answer 
<br>
half of the questions correctly.  You will find that you are utterly unable 
<br>
to imagine being unable to answer most of the questions correctly, and thus 
<br>
that you have no real intuitions of any validity as to what would be best 
<br>
for someone who was not able to answer most of the questions correctly.
<br>
I will also point out that there is a limited supply of high IQ teachers.  
<br>
The average teacher has an IQ under 110.  They can probably teach kids rote 
<br>
knowledge, but can they effectively teach amorphous creativity and thinking 
<br>
abilities that they probably don't posess themselves?  I don't think that 
<br>
any standard teacher's answer cheat guides will help them in this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Rather than focusing on refining these tests (and this is certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not sour grapes: my family always does extremely well on such tests), I'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather see energy put into figuring out how to make the school
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system as a whole focus more on thinking and creating and less on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rote.
</em><br>
<p>There are some possible answers to this, which come either from extremely 
<br>
&quot;alternative&quot; schools like Sudbury which really aren't schools at all in the 
<br>
generally accepted class or from extremely rare and talented radical 
<br>
teachers who try to remake school entirely, but most of the populace is 
<br>
generally satisfied with school more-or-less as it exists today (I am 
<br>
certainly not, but effort towards FAI seems more directly relevant to my 
<br>
goals) and is strongly resistant to any attempts to radically reconcieve the 
<br>
endeavor from the ground up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah, better education costs money.  But obviously, properly-educated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people do a better job of pushing toward a positive Singularity...
</em><br>
<p>No-one is trying to organize society along the lines which will minimize the 
<br>
path distance towards the singularity.  If anything, anthropic selection may 
<br>
be extending the path beyond its probable length.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We're just not going to be able to make a test that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will pick the N &quot;smartest&quot; people so we can fund them to create the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity for us.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, and we shouldn't even try to do so.  &quot;Smartest&quot; in a generic sense 
<br>
is irrelevant, except in a correlational sense, to our needs.
<br>
However, it is concievable that we could create a test that will identify 
<br>
the group of 100 people which probably contains half of the N people who are 
<br>
most capable in respects relevant to creating a Singularity.  Any attempt to 
<br>
do so would be the implementation of  an art, not of a science, as we 
<br>
couldn't norm such a test, and administering it to a large enough population 
<br>
to find the people who we wanted would be very costly, (maybe one could 
<br>
administer it to CTY graduates or people above some Math Olympiad cut-off 
<br>
instead?) but we don't really know how difficult this would be, as no-one 
<br>
has tried.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Intelligence and humanity are too multidimensional for that.
</em><br>
<p>But the binary ability to contribute or lack of such an ability to a 
<br>
particular project is surely not multidimensional at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we want to maximize the odds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positive Singularity we should create an environment in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diversity of natural intelligence is generally fostered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Of course, none of that really matters if I'm right about Novamente,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the project is properly funded and flourishes and we create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superhuman AGI on a time-scale much faster than any education reform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can plausibly happen.
</em><br>
<p>Aah.  There's the rub.  I'm sure many others here feel the same way about 
<br>
their projects.
