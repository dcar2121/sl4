You're probably right that I am getting too mad.
<br>
<p>But I should say that he crossed a line yesterday.  Until that point I 
<br>
had always given him the benefit of the doubt and assumed that he knew 
<br>
the field well, but didn't know the adjacent fields quite as well, and 
<br>
then had simply boxed himself into a corner.
<br>
<p>But he finally said some stuff that was so outrageous that it gave too 
<br>
many clues, and his cover was blown.  He is clearly so ignorant of that 
<br>
corner of cognitive science/psychology that he made the original mistake 
<br>
out of ignorance, not impatience.
<br>
<p>Hence my challenge.
<br>
<p>But, yeah:  you are right.  I should not have tried to box him in any more.
