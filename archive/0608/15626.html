</em><br>
<p><p>Not so.
<br>
<p>(v.) (1) To deliberately post derogatory or inflammatory comments to a
<br>
<em>&gt; community forum, chat room, newsgroup and/or a blog in order to bait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other users into responding.
</em><br>
<p><p>Had that been my purpose, it would indeed be trolling. However:
<br>
<p>1) I was not deliberately being inflammatory; I knew it would occur as a
<br>
side effect, but I do not know any non-inflammatory way to make the points
<br>
that needed to be made. If I did, I would have used it.
<br>
<p>2) I did not post in order to bait other users into responding. I posted
<br>
because certain things needed to be said. I didn't expect it to endear me to
<br>
people who hold the belief systems I'm criticizing, but (assuming you think
<br>
I'm wrong) postulate for the sake of argument that I were right -
<br>
considering the stakes, would it not then be better to speak up than keep
<br>
silent?
<br>
<p>I therefore meet neither criterion.
<br>
<p>There are millions of groups out there and plenty of them will provide
<br>
<em>&gt; views opposing AI.
</em><br>
<p><p>I do not oppose AI - on the contrary, as I said, I think we're going to need
<br>
it. I disagree with certain propositions about AI, and with approaches
<br>
derived from those propositions.
<br>
<p>But it is not the done thing to go on a Coca-Cola
<br>
<em>&gt; group and post that Pepsi is really better.  :)
</em><br>
<p><p>It is however the done thing to - taking a real example - go on a space
<br>
group and post that an Orion drive would not reduce the cost of launching
<br>
things to orbit, and conventional rockets are really better. (To post that
<br>
spaceflight is pointless would be another thing - but I do not believe AGI
<br>
is pointless; that's why I'm here.)
