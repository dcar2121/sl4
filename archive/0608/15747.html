Richard,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I submit that with this measure you will be able to write a chart that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not differ substantially from the one you presented:
</em><br>
<p>I submit that you are completely wrong on this.  Rates of poverty,
<br>
jailings, dropouts, parentless children, income, welfare-recipiency,
<br>
etc. are not at all correlated with proximity to the post office.  But
<br>
they are tightly correlated with g.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IQ is a direct measure of intelligence-in-the-large.  (And please do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go off on a red herring about the generality of g:  those studies, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how comprehensive, are still subject to the criticism that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure what CAN be measured, and have no relevance to components that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be measured).
</em><br>
<p>So basically what you're saying is that no matter how comprehensive
<br>
the test, and how powerfully predictive the values are, any test will
<br>
tell us nothing.  Ultimately, everything about reality can be
<br>
measured.  That's the whole foundation of science.  If God exists, we
<br>
will create instruments that can distinguish His influence from other
<br>
influences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is distressing (and what illustrates my point about high-IQ people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being just as guilty of closed-mindedness as anyone else) is that you, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person of supposedly high intelligence, are not addressing the issue I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised in the above to paragraphs:  you seem to be evading it or denying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it for ideological reasons.
</em><br>
<p>You should blame stupidity or neglect before ideology.  If I missed
<br>
your point, it's probably because it was not stated succintly enough,
<br>
and I missed it.  But you are summarizing below clearly, thanks.
<br>
Person of supposedly high intelligence according to who?  All I'm
<br>
doing is pointing to the data that Linda Gottfredson, a leading
<br>
researcher on IQ, has compiled.  I'm merely being a conduit for
<br>
someone much older and more learned and expert in this area than I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) There is a difference between correlation and causation, and
</em><br>
<p>Sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) There is a difference between a partial component of intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole thing, and
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  But having a measure of a part that correlates tightly with
<br>
dozens of relevant variables is always nice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) If a thing can only be partially measured (i.e. only a component of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be measured), that fact does not give anyone the licence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretend that the measurable bit IS the entire thing.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying it's the entire thing.  I'm just saying that if some
<br>
variable has known predictive validity, we should use it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are not alone in having this attitude, by the way:  I have met
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychometricians who have seriously said that because g is such a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictor of behavior, and because there exists such a single factor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can by a good predictor, therefore g is a measure of THE mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is intelligence.  I have said it to them and I will repeat it here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   those folks are allowing their obsession with statistics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics to trump science.  They are not scientists.
</em><br>
<p>G is a very interesting value which has been defined as what IQ tests
<br>
are supposed to measure.  The term &quot;intelligence&quot; is somewhat
<br>
ill-defined, and as Michael Vassar mentioned, sometimes when you call
<br>
somewhat &quot;smart&quot; you actually mean &quot;rich&quot;, so there is a lot of
<br>
ambiguity in these things.  IQ, however, is much more precisely
<br>
defined.  It doesn't really matter is g is &quot;THE&quot; mechanism of
<br>
intelligence or not, a strong predictor of behavior is a strong
<br>
predictor of behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; thing to pin down, we know that it would be stupid to take high IQ to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only measure of their potential ability.
</em><br>
<p>I never said that IQ is the only measure we should consider for hiring
<br>
people for working towards the Singularity.  You pulled that one out
<br>
of thin air.  My initial post was on the difference between people of
<br>
IQ ~150 and IQ ~180, then it led to a discussion of the validity of g
<br>
and IQ tests in general.  I've only been talking about the facts, not
<br>
what we should do because of them.  The is, not the ought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And as for the idea that IQ per se (rather than intelligence in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large) is relevant to AGI:  sure, it is as relevant as POQ.  I suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that after we build a candidate AGI we send it out into the world to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a job, and find a place to live, see where it ends up, and then measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its POQ.  And, yes, that is a little facetious, but you get my point:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrating on POQ or IQ now is putting the cart before the horse.
</em><br>
<p>But your POQ idea is false.  There is a reason why IQ is used by
<br>
thousands of organizations and POQ is not.  The US army does not let
<br>
you join if your IQ is less than 80, for example.  IQ is a very valid
<br>
concept, but here you seem to be saying that it's useless.  It is
<br>
clearly very morally and politically charged, judging from all the
<br>
responses I got to calling it a valuable metric.  This sociomoral
<br>
baggage around IQ impedes scientific study concerning it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *Intelligence* (and finding out what intelligence actually is, and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it works) is what we need to be concentrating on.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Intelligence&quot; is a subjective measure.  IQ is objective and therefore
<br>
gives us more scientific substance to work with.  I mainly think of
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; in terms of sequence prediction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Lastly, an aside:  I did not accuse you personally of being obsessed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ because yours is (presumably) high, I simply pointed out an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation I had made of a majority of the people who adulate high IQ].
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this observation, but as I argued before, I excuse myself
<br>
from all fault with respect to it.  :-)
