</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially by those who claim to know the answer. It's a single most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question in AI, still, after 50 years from the birth of the field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is intelligence, exactly? What functions are necessary and sufficient for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of a thought? What is a mechanism of thought?
</em><br>
<p>I'll have a brief shot at the first question. The second two I shall
<br>
leave well alone for the while. At its most basic an intelligence is
<br>
something that transforms its input channels into an output and also
<br>
extracts information from the input about how to change its state to
<br>
better transform the I to the O and extract information to change the
<br>
state. The better-ness implies some form of goal or purpose. It is a
<br>
problematic concept, but not too vital for seeing what intelligent
<br>
system actually does. Better can mean anything from less processing
<br>
power or energy used for the transformation, to creating a more
<br>
accurate transformation or just a quicker one.
<br>
<p>There are many ways to extract information from the input stream from
<br>
collecting statistics, to parsing the input linguistically. All depend
<br>
upon making some assumptions about the world. The latter is the
<br>
fastest way of  getting bits of information, assuming a friendly
<br>
communicator, as you can saturate your input stream with information
<br>
about how to change your state.
<br>
<p>Of course my definition is over broad for human type intelligences. To
<br>
get anything like thinking or thought, the assumption about how to
<br>
extract information from the environment would need to be something
<br>
like: a, potentially unfriendly, source of linguistic information
<br>
about how to change your state. In that case you have check new
<br>
linguistic information against previous information gained from other
<br>
sources, internal consistency of the new information and whether the
<br>
state changes suggested will actually help your goals.
<br>
<p>Also necessary would be other means of extracting information, to
<br>
cross check against the linguistic and also to fill in the holes where
<br>
the linguistic information is not available. For example the
<br>
linguistic information in how to create an AI, is not available yet ;)
