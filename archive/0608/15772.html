</em><br>

<em>&gt; I agree with Rogers.  Either you know what you're doing or you don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't know what you or Rogers are talking about here, but it certainly 
<br>
isn't what I started talking about..... so when the two of you come back 
<br>
from your private sidetrack :-), could you maybe explain what this has 
<br>
got to do with community-based projects like Linux or Mozilla or Open 
<br>
Office, to which I was making an (obvious) reference?
<br>
<p>What have those kinds of projects got that attracted your stinging 
<br>
diatribes about large groups of people with no clue, your introduction 
<br>
of the Fifth Generation project (the antithesis of a community 
<br>
project!!), idiots who think $10M is a lot of money and the 
<br>
heartwarmingness of the word &quot;community&quot;?
