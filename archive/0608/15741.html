<em>&gt; Daniel Dennett has said that morality (or ethics or whatever you want

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Daniel Dennett has also contributed extensively to clarifying that
<br>
consciousness, self, and free-will exist -- but they are definitely
<br>
*not* as popularly conceived.  He has also been quite clear that these
<br>
characteristics are of evolutionary origin, rather than existing in
<br>
some platonic sense.
<br>
<p>It may be useful to point out that we can and do increasingly agree on
<br>
some actions working better than others,leading to results that we
<br>
increasingly agree are &quot;good&quot;, but this is not at all the same as
<br>
saying that there is an objective &quot;good&quot;.  In fact, given an objective
<br>
viwpoint (possible only within some limited well-defined context) ther
<br>
is no room at all for &quot;good&quot;, but only &quot;is&quot;.
