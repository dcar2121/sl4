Google's search seems to me to be hardly better than it was years ago, and
<br>
there are still many subtleties for which I cannot search. I seen no
<br>
evidence of new AI (in any sense) in their online systems.
<br>
<p>They are doing a great job of bolting together gorgeous web applications,
<br>
and seem to be content with doing that and then selling the advertising
<br>
revenue.
<br>
<p>I get the feeling that the strength of their search algorithm is its
<br>
simplicity, not its subtlety.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
