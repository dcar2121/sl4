</em><br>
<em>&gt; the One True Unifying Principle to create AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Firstly, the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; metaphor is obviously insulting and inaccurate.
<br>
<p>The Webmind architecture I created in the late 90's was a bit of a
<br>
&quot;kitchen sink&quot; approach, and Stan Franklin's LIDA approach (which I do
<br>
respect a lot) has a bit of that flavor as well...
<br>
<p>However, Novamente for instance consists of a very carefully chosen
<br>
set of components all interoperating using a standardized
<br>
probabilistic semantics... it is not at all &quot;kitchen sink&quot;-ish once
<br>
you really understand it.
<br>
<p>But, let's replace &quot;kitchen sink&quot; with &quot;integrative&quot;, thus removing
<br>
the insulting tone and encompassing architectures like Novamente that
<br>
contain somewhat heterogenous components carefully architected to
<br>
operate effectively together via common representations and dynamics.
<br>
<p>Then the question is: is there a big bias toward integrative AGI
<br>
architectures these days?
<br>
<p>I actually think that hypothesis is an overgeneralization based on the
<br>
AGIRI workshop, whose participants were largely chosen by me based on
<br>
my own taste (which does run toward integrative approaches)
<br>
<p>As an example, both Robert Hecht-Nielsen and Jeff Hawkins are
<br>
contemporary AI theorists who are selling AGI solutions based on &quot;one
<br>
special trick&quot; which they feel they've discovered....  I tend not to
<br>
like such approaches that much hence the AGIRI workshop which I
<br>
organized did not focus on them ... but they certainly exist and are
<br>
being championed by famous people with more financial backing than
<br>
anyone who presented at the AGIRI workshop...
