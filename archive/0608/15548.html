<em>&gt;What is the purpose of discussing this concept?  Is the idea to better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defend against any of the proposed attacks?  Is there some way friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could think of every target before we do and direct resources to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it?  I suggest that unlike the blog, that attack plans here might include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plausible preventative countermeasures - else why bother?

<p><p>I think this is an awesome blog post (as usual). I think this kind of 
<br>
discussion is becoming increasingly important... war is all around us. While 
<br>
I believe it is unlikely war will significantly affect the arrival of the 
<br>
Singularity, I also think it's extremely important to avoid another 
<br>
Holocaust (or worse) before the Singularity. Radical Islam is an incredibly 
<br>
dangerous meme that is undergoing explosive growth right now. The extremists 
<br>
are like HIV and Earth is showing the early symptoms of AIDS.
<br>
<p>And you know we have no technology capable of countering such a powerful 
<br>
virus right now, only a radiation treatment that involves a lot of 
<br>
collateral damage.
<br>
<p>But that is all a political digression... such problems would be most safely 
<br>
and effectively solved with Friendly AGI. Of course that subsumes you don't 
<br>
do much, much worse when you build the AGI (if you have a technology capable 
<br>
of solving problems of that magnitude, you have a technology capable of 
<br>
causing problems of a much, much greater magnitude. Than nuclear war.).
