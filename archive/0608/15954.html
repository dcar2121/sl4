<p>Loosemore was truly terrible at discussion. Incredibly defensive,
<br>
evasive, and gradiloquent. Incapable of charity, incapable of being
<br>
succinct, and incapable of directly addressing others' points. Eliezer
<br>
was not charitable at all, but that's about the only negative I can
<br>
see, and I hesitate to call it a fault or mistake, as charity can be a
<br>
waste of time when used to aid cranks. Someone that terrible at
<br>
discussion isn't worth having around, no matter what the quality of
<br>
their ideas. (I gather Eliezer disagrees, as he only banned Loosemore
<br>
when he judged Loosemore to be deliberately or delusionally deceptive,
<br>
and he didn't engage Loosemore only because his ideas were poor, not
<br>
because his style was obnoxious.)
