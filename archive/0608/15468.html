<p>
I don't remember exactly where I saw this (as it was some months ago,
<br>
possibly on an internet pod cast from some conference) but I remember
<br>
Norvig being asked if he thought significant advances in AI were around
<br>
the corner and whether Google was working on more advanced things
<br>
than computational linguistics etc.  His answer was that he didn't expect
<br>
to see advanced AI any time soon, and that there were a few very small
<br>
projects in the company where people were playing around with more
<br>
ambitious AI technologies, but that it certainly wasn't a focus for the
<br>
company.  At the time I took that to mean that some people were playing
<br>
around with some cool AI ideas during their 20% free time to work on
<br>
their own projects.
