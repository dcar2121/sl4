I have some specific, and quite serious answers to the issues you raise.

<em>&gt;&gt; Alas I think that the $10M/year would not be enough for an Apollo

</em><br>
<p>We could go into this in more detail, but I once costed the operations 
<br>
of a combination software/hardware startup similar to the one that would 
<br>
be involved here.  There were about 40 engineering people, and some of 
<br>
them were doing work that was robotics related.  Remember:  there would 
<br>
be an absolute need to get peripherals involved (robot manipulators, 
<br>
vision systems, auditory systems, etc), and that involves both buying 
<br>
and playing with expensive hardware.
<br>
<p>The burn rate for year one was projected between $16M and $22M.
<br>
<p>Don't forget:  I am not talking about some kind of shoestring internet 
<br>
startup.  I am addressing the issue of really building an AGI.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; THE interesting question for me, however, is this:  could a community 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; based project get its act together to do what NASA did for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spaceflight, but without government backing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, because there are no usable metrics for incremental success.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Effective communities do not materialize out of thin air.  Even in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rarified atmosphere of this mailing list there is little agreement where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it matters with regard to getting things done, and compared to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community at large we would appear to almost be in lockstep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Community-based AI research is the idea that having a clue is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergent property of having enough people without a clue in one room.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I use &quot;emerge&quot; in the &quot;magic happens&quot; sense here.  I would make the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation that most productive AI research seems to be done by people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have shown little interest in community-based AI research, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would suggest that the &quot;community&quot; aspect is quite irrelevant to their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress.  It is not as though there are not plenty of community-based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI research projects in existence.
</em><br>
<p>When I said &quot;could a community based project [succeed]&quot; I really meant 
<br>
precisely, could it overcome the limitations of community based projects 
<br>
at their worst (which is what you point to).
<br>
<p>I have in mind a community that is able to act in a coordinated way, 
<br>
with central direction, and in which the central directorate was more 
<br>
than just some geek with an idea she got from AI 101, who gets a bunch 
<br>
of dudes together to, like, hack an AI.
<br>
<p>There are ways to get results that do not involve making gross 
<br>
assumptions at the outset which cripple the project later on.  While it 
<br>
would not be possible to be completely agnostic about the approach, it 
<br>
is quite feasible to be less ideologically committed and more receptive 
<br>
to what the system data tell you to do.
<br>
<p>As I say:  could a community of people get together and do pieces of the 
<br>
work under control of a central directorate that knew what the whole was 
<br>
supposed to be, and which would have more than just a hack-and-fix 
<br>
mentality.
<br>
<p>These distinctions between ways of proceeding are subtle!  They all look 
<br>
the same to an outside observer.  The magic is in the exact details.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;   We would not want governmet backing if we could help it, because the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conditions today are not the same as they were in the 1960s, and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; believe that the project would be pork-barrelized today where it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; only partially true back then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This statement seems a bit baseless and arbitrary.  It might be true, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is not obvious.
</em><br>
<p>Let's not get into politics.  It is stupidly obvious to some who do a 
<br>
lot of reading and who have a lot of experience.  Let's just leave it at 
<br>
that.  Not an important issue.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I'd be prepared to initiate such a project right now if the startup 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; funds were available, because I believe it could actually work.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in case I am not being clear, I don't mean just another advocacy group 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or think tank, I mean a project to get concrete things done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Starting a concrete project requires having a concrete and thorough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development plan at the outset or it will be a dead letter.  This sounds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like forming a committee that will select the advisory committee to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project planning committee that will decide what the project actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be doing.  In other words, several steps too early to really expect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else to be interested or involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you need a community to tell you exactly what you should be doing, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might as well give up.  And if you know exactly what it is you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be doing, what is the critical value of the community exactly?
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I am guilty of making what seemed like an offhand comment.
<br>
<p>You could not be more wrong about the &quot;forming a committee that will 
<br>
select the advisory committee&quot;, etc etc. ;-).
<br>
<p>I made the comment because I have enough specific goals and detailed 
<br>
designs to put a gang of programmers to work within days.  I don't need 
<br>
a community to tell me exactly what I should be doing, I need a 
<br>
community to DO exactly what I tell them to do, and no messing.
<br>
<p>Okay, that sounds a little dictatorial.  I speak half in jest, because 
<br>
your comment made me laugh.  I don't think I have given the impression 
<br>
on this list that I like waiting for committees to tell me what to think 
<br>
or do.
<br>
<p>The critical value of the community would be to (a) do some hard work, 
<br>
and (b) do some serious research about fine details.  Heck, just the 
<br>
usual mix you would get in a company of 40-odd people.
<br>
<p>The problems would be:  (a) you would need some kind of central 
<br>
organization because the hardware would be serious, and could not be 
<br>
completely distributed, and (b) the personal attitudes in the community 
<br>
would be critical, and perhaps not appropriate for the work to be done: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they couldn't be a collection of mavericks who hated the idea of being 
<br>
given chunks of work to do.
<br>
<p>Anyhow, we are debating whether this is possible almost as if we were 
<br>
talking in a vacuum:  any minute now Ben is going to check in from his 
<br>
vacation hideawy and point out that what I am describing IS what 
<br>
Novamente is already doing.  Novamente is partly community based, but 
<br>
has a strong central design plan.  What I have in mind is (with all due 
<br>
respect to Ben) just something on a larger scale, and with a more (how 
<br>
can I put it?) neutral and empirical aspect.  My focus is on building a 
<br>
specific set of tools first, then using those to take measurements that 
<br>
would solve some (carefully delineated) design features.
<br>
<p>The problem is that the specific design I have in mind would follow a 
<br>
path that is hard for me to describe without dumping an 80,000 word 
<br>
thesis into this message.  That design path is, in some senses, quite 
<br>
ecumenical (i.e. it accommodates quite a variety of different ideas 
<br>
about AGI), but in other senses it could be taken as (or misunderstood 
<br>
as) quite radical and non-mainstream.  It stands in the weird and 
<br>
difficult position of being an approach to AGI that, before it was 
<br>
built, would irritate the heck out of the mainstream folks (because it 
<br>
challenges some deep assumptions that they are emotionally committed to, 
<br>
and which they really find difficult to comprehend or talk about), but 
<br>
which, *after* it was built, would probably be said to be quite 
<br>
conservative and cautious and obvious.
<br>
<p>I am not going to start talking about that design, because I am no 
<br>
longer interested in wasting my time fighting battles across paradigm 
<br>
boundaries (any more than I want to waste my time herding cats or trying 
<br>
to get talkative 7-year-olds to bed on time).
<br>
<p>On balance, I think a community approach probably would not work.  I 
<br>
think it would need a company, and real funding.
