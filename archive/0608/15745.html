</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apollo took one approach, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and that worked.  In

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The difference with an AI to Singularity project is that--as far as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know--nobody knows how to do it.  (Correct me if I am wrong here.)

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I notice that a burn rate for money is proposed, not a total to complete

<em>&gt; The only way I feel confident would work is to duplicate the functions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a human brain.  At some level of fidelity you would get human level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (along with less desirable features).  But it is not

<p>I think that some people do have some clear ideas about how to do it.
<br>
<p>With some exceptions, they have no serious funding.
<br>
<p>None of them (with the possible exception of Hugo de Garis) believe that 
<br>
the way to do it is to emulate a brain.
<br>
<p>Please bear in mind that many aspects of how to do it are not discussed 
<br>
on this list.  Whatever the purpose of SL4 might be, any attempt to talk 
<br>
about real technical issues gets immediately swamped by low-quality 
<br>
noise and vitriol...... as a result of this you might think that there 
<br>
is no serious technical work in existence (about the specific problem of 
<br>
building a coordinated, complete AGI, including all the 
<br>
motivational/moral/ethical aspects, and including considerations of 
<br>
safety and friendliness).
<br>
<p>This impression would be a mistake.  To take just the issue of 
<br>
friendliness, for example:  there are approaches to this problem that 
<br>
are powerful and viable, but because the list core does not agree with 
<br>
them, you might think that they are not feasible, or outright dangerous 
<br>
and irresponsible.  This impression is a result of skewed opinions here, 
<br>
not necessarily a reflection of the actual status of those approaches.
