See the following:
<br>
<p>Spin State and Spin Control - Chris Moriarty
<br>
<p>Accelerando - Charles Stross (I'm still reading this one so I don't know
<br>
exactly how the AI will turn out).
<br>
<p>You may want to check out Singularity Sky and Iron Sunrise (also by Stross)
<br>
in which the AI is so far beyond our understanding that it is hard to
<br>
ascribe a good or evil label to it.
<br>
<p>Blind Lake by Robert Charles Wilson - Also has an AI component but again, it
<br>
is so far beyond us that its motives aren't clear.
<br>
<p>A common theme seems to be that the AI de jour leaves us alone as long as we
<br>
don't appear to be a threat.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we had a reliable way to label our toys good and bad, it would be easy
<br>
to regulate technology wisely. But we can rarely see far enough ahead to
<br>
know which road leads to damnation. Whoever concerns himself with big
<br>
technology, either to push it forward or to stop it, is gambling in human
<br>
lives.&quot;

Subject: Question: Movies and books about positive AI
<br>
<p><p>While I am on the subject, would anyone be interested in giving me their 
<br>
thoughts about *positive* examples of fictional AI?
<br>
<p>What I mean is, how many times have SF writers (whether in written or 
<br>
movie form) created fictional futures in which the AI was not the villain?
<br>
<p>And within that category, in how many of the cases was the AI portrayed 
<br>
as having equal or superior intelligence (instead of turning out to be 
<br>
just a glorified calculator that could be outsmarted by outmaneuvering 
<br>
its logic circuits)?  I am less interested in these.
<br>
<p>The only notable examples I can think of are Iain M. Banks Culture 
<br>
books, and Asimov's benign robots (who, if I recall correctly, tend to 
<br>
be of the less-than-human-equivalent sort).
<br>
<p>Lem's creations might count, but he is a little surreal.
