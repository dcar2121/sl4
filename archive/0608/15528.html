Hi,
<br>
<p>About the &quot;problem&quot; of a lack of wide Singularity understanding...
<br>
<p>Ricardo said that:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First of all, I think it's not even a problem of people being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the singularity. Right now, I would say the problem is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental - people don't even hear about it. I'd say that even most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer programmers don't know about it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, even in the cases that people have heard about it and don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it, I don't think it's a matter of understanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution on computer speed and capacity. I'd say it has more to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the fact that many educated people have a very rough idea of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our brain works, and an even rougher idea of what things a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do and how it does those things. Those two things combined cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people not to understand how a computer could simulate/emulate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, I have talked to a lot of folks about the Singularity, and I
<br>
don't think either of these are the main problem.
<br>
<p>Most educated, open-minded, non-religious people I talk to are willing
<br>
to believe that
<br>
<p>* something like a Singularity could happen eventually
<br>
* eventually AI's will probably supersede human intelligence
<br>
* ultimately brain scanning will allow us to map out the workings of
<br>
the brain, allowing us to replicate these in some kind of engineered
<br>
machinery
<br>
<p>What most people seem to have a really hard time believing are the
<br>
timing estimates being put forth by Kurzweil, myself and the like ---
<br>
or even the order of magnitude of these estimates.
<br>
<p>The appeal to exponential growth is understood by any educated person
<br>
... but so is the appeal to failed predictions from the past (such as,
<br>
to take a single amusing example, Jetsons-style commuter spacecraft,
<br>
which were projected by many enthusiastic futurists for the early 21st
<br>
century, and yet are not apparent anywhere around us today...)
<br>
<p>In other words, it's a lot easier to convince educated, open-minded,
<br>
non-religious people that
<br>
<p>&quot;The Singularity is Coming ... Eventually ... If Humanity Doesn't
<br>
Destroy Itself First&quot;
<br>
<p>than that
<br>
<p>&quot;The Singularity is Near&quot;
<br>
<p>And while these two propositions are not that far off in terms of
<br>
intellectual content, they are pretty far off in terms of pragmatic
<br>
consequences...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
