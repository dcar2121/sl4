<p><p>Actually that reminds me, Justin, that I DID reply to this post ..... 
<br>
the message went out, according to my email log, here, on 6/28/2006 at 
<br>
11:40 PM.  It contained some 20,000 words, and it was the result of a 
<br>
lot of time spent culling and editing and annotating the relevant 
<br>
messages that I had previously sent, which you (in a nutshell) accused 
<br>
me of never posting.
<br>
<p>But the message disappeared.
<br>
<p>I don't know why, but it never showed up on the list.  Was it bounced 
<br>
because it was too long?  I have no idea.
<br>
<p>But after a few days, I thought &quot;Shall I ask what happened to it?&quot; and I 
<br>
decided that I just didn't give a damn.  I just couldn't be bothered to 
<br>
reply to the petty stupidity any more, so I let it drop.
<br>
<p>If Eliezer can clarify why that message (entitled &quot;The AGI Artist's 
<br>
Reply to Unjust Criticism&quot;) went missing, I'd be happy to hear about it.
<br>
<p>Do you want me to resend it?
<br>
<p>Happy to do so, if you insist.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
<br>
<p><p><p>P.S.  Come to think of it, I'll send it again anyway, in case you 
<br>
immediately accuse me of faking it, or something.  People can hardly say 
<br>
that I faked it on ten minutes' notice.
<br>
<p>Cheers.
