<em>&gt; We know AI is possible because natural intelligence exists.  So what are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features of natural intelligence you would need to extract and what can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced with something nature could not (or did not) evolved like a rotating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keith Henson
</em><br>
<p>I'm always disappointed when questions like this are being ignored,
<br>
especially by those who claim to know the answer. It's a single most important
<br>
question in AI, still, after 50 years from the birth of the field.
<br>
<p>What is intelligence, exactly? What functions are necessary and sufficient for
<br>
creation of a thought? What is a mechanism of thought?
<br>
<p>Let me offer a car-human analogy which will hopefully make clear what kind of
<br>
answers others and I are probably seeking here.
<br>
<p>The purpose of a car is to transport people to their desired destinations. If we
<br>
strip down the car to its necessary and sufficient elements that serve its purpose
<br>
we'll end up with the engine, all the machinery that transfers motion to wheels,
<br>
and the single structure that houses all that plus the passengers. (A car stereo is
<br>
not necessary nor sufficient to transport people so it must be left out :)).
<br>
<p>We could generalize the analogy and think about this in terms of means of
<br>
transport, with a car, a bike, a motorcycle being just different implementations of
<br>
the same idea, namely, that in order to change locations one needs &quot;the engine&quot;, a
<br>
mechanism that transfers motion to other parts of the machine and a structure that
<br>
houses all the these parts and the passengers.
<br>
<p>Humans, like a car as an example of *a* thing that transports people, are just one
<br>
of many possible implementation of intelligence. If someone wanted to build a
<br>
machine whose purpose would be to have intelligence, what would its &quot;engine&quot;, &quot;the
<br>
mechanism for transferring motion&quot;, and the &quot;structure that houses all the parts of
<br>
machine&quot; be?
<br>
<p>Having established that, we could then apply this process down to each individual
<br>
part of the machine in order to implement &quot;the engine&quot; of intelligence by focusing
<br>
on its necessary and sufficient functions that serve its purpose.
<br>
<p>If anyone is capable of answering these questions with a necessarily high degree of
<br>
confidence, please do offer your insight.
<br>
<p>H.
