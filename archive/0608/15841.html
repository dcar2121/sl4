</em><br>
<p>I agree. I have been impressed by the fairness and rigor with which this
<br>
list has been moderated; there have probably been one or two moderation
<br>
decisions with which I disagreed, but as far as I can recall, none that were
<br>
unreasonable.
<br>
<p>At the same time, while I think what you took Richard's words to mean
<br>
constituted a misdeed, I think what he meant by them did not; as I said, I
<br>
think you've just been talking past each other, and while it would be
<br>
reasonable to killthread the argument (it's produced pretty much all heat
<br>
and no light, after all), but not to ban Richard from the list.
