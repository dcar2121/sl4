</em><br>
<p>Correct.  I am not particularly interested in arguing with you on this 
<br>
topic until you actually read something about the field, just as I am 
<br>
not interested in arguing with the inventor of a perpetual motion 
<br>
machine.  Do you understand?  You are ignorant of an established 
<br>
experimental field.  I did you the courtesy of informing you that you 
<br>
were ignorant, because human knowledge is vast, and even competent 
<br>
people cannot always be expected to know when they stumble into 
<br>
territory that has already been thoroughly explored.
<br>
<p>Of course, when someone ignores this advice and insists that they 
<br>
already know all about it, meanwhile thoroughly demonstrating complete 
<br>
ignorance, and dropping the names of personal-acquaintance scientists 
<br>
who turn out not to work in the field, then the offense stops being 
<br>
innocent.  Either it is a deliberate bluff followed by the attempt to 
<br>
cover it up when caught, or it is the arrogant smart guy's trap of 
<br>
thinking that their infinitesimal fraction of all human knowledge 
<br>
constitutes the whole.  Either way it is not particularly forgiveable.
<br>
<p>It is, in fact, a serious enough offense against scientific ethics, 
<br>
whether committed intentionally or unintentionally, that I am wondering 
<br>
whether to ban you from SL4 for it.  There are many people on this 
<br>
mailing list who are not experts in some particular field such as 
<br>
Bayesian probability or parallel programming, and who need to rely on 
<br>
the notion that sane-sounding people on SL4 who claim expertise in a 
<br>
field are probably actually experts.  Now here you are, someone who 
<br>
manages to sound very stuffy and formal like you actually know 
<br>
something, but who nonetheless claims expertise where no expertise 
<br>
exists.  That is a misleading cue that could deceive even competent 
<br>
readers, and it threatens the integrity of this mailing list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Huhh!!?  8-|  These people (Chater and Oaksford, at least) know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything there is to know about the entire field of human reasoning, 
</em><br>
<p>An absurd claim.  No one knows everything there is to know about the 
<br>
entire field of human reasoning; the existing science (as of 2006) is 
<br>
too much for a human to learn in a hundred human lifetimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; including the subfield that Yudkowsky refers to as &quot;heuristics and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biasses&quot;.   The above paragraph is entirely upside down and backwards: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only someone who had a chronically deficient understanding of cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology would not know the connection between Mental Models and all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the various human reasoning studies.
</em><br>
<p>The people who write research papers about mental models, are not in 
<br>
general the same people who write research papers about heuristics and 
<br>
biases, although they do talk to each other and read the other field's 
<br>
classic papers.  Still, someone who doesn't work professionally in the 
<br>
field of mental models, yet does know something about the theory of 
<br>
mental models, may not know anything about the theory of heuristics and 
<br>
biases.  And I am informing you, flatly, that you don't.
<br>
<p>Any audience members can either trust me on this, or google &quot;Mental 
<br>
models&quot; followed by &quot;Heuristics and biases&quot;.  There's obvious relevance 
<br>
of one field to the other, but they are very different fields in 
<br>
practice - even as to the kind of daily work carried out by the 
<br>
practitioners - and cursory reading in both fields will confirm this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reader may want to contrast Yudkowsky's bizarre remarks, above, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Johnson-Laird and Oaksford, with the following excerpts from an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elementary textbook of Cognitive Psychology:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the chapter on &quot;Reasoning and Deduction&quot; there is an entire section 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devoted to Mental Models, which starts with the words:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;One of the most influential approaches to deductive reasoning is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental model theory of Johnson-Laird (e.g. 1983, 1999).&quot;  (p. 516)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the following two recommendations in the Further Reading section at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end of the same chapter, on page 532, where the book's authors only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose seven publications, two of which are by Chater and Oaksford:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chater, N., &amp; Oaksford, M. (2001).  Human Rationality and the psychology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasoning:  Where do we go from here?  British Journal of Psychology, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 92, 193-216.  &quot;The authors give a very useful overview of theory and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research on reasoning.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oaksford, M., &amp; Chater, N. (2001).  The probabilistic approach to human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning.  Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, 349-357.  &quot;This article 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides a succinct account of the main assumptions of the authors' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilistic approach.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Excerpts from Eysenck and Keane &quot;Cognitive Psychology:  A Student 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Handbook&quot;  5th Edition. 2005).
</em><br>
<p>Anyone familiar with the field of heuristics and biases will recognize 
<br>
these papers as, while being of course legitimate cognitive science, not 
<br>
within the particular cognitive science known as heuristics and biases.
<br>
<p>Browsing Wikipedia's entry on &quot;cognitive biases&quot; and checking some of 
<br>
the paper titles should be sufficient to make it clear that the above 
<br>
papers don't belong in the same category; one of these things is unlike 
<br>
the other, one of these things doesn't belong.
<br>
<p>For benefit of the audience, I remark that this is sufficient to 
<br>
thoroughly demonstrate Loosemore's ignorance of heuristics and biases to 
<br>
anyone actually familiar with heuristics and biases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nick Chater won the Spearman Medal, Britain's highest honor to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive psychologist, so Yudkowsky's implication that these guys 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably don't have much insight into the particular part of the field 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he labels &quot;heuristics and biasses&quot; is laughable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oaksford and Chater could eat Yudkowsky for breakfast and still have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough room to wash him down with a few cups of VSOP Darjeeling.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Nick Chater is quite familiar with heuristics 
<br>
and biases, but you, Richard Loosemore, are quite ignorant of it.  Nor 
<br>
may you claim Chater's accomplishments in support of your own expertise.
<br>
<p>At this point you're matching one of the classic crank patterns, of 
<br>
someone who becomes acquainted with a tiny fraction of scientific 
<br>
knowledge, and who then decides that this science is so amazingly 
<br>
wonderful that it must be relevant to everything.  I recall a fellow who 
<br>
emailed me *insisting* that I was failing to take sufficiently into 
<br>
account The Periodic Table of Elements, which he felt was highly 
<br>
relevant to AI theory.
<br>
<p>So I give you three choices, the next time anyone on SL4 informs you 
<br>
that you are not an expert in an existing science:
<br>
<p>1)  Read the actual literature of that field.
<br>
<p>2)  Stop claiming expertise.  I don't mean that you have to admit you 
<br>
were wrong and apologize or anything like that.  Just be aware that, by 
<br>
the law of the list laid down by me, you are unjustly and tyrannically 
<br>
prohibited from again claiming expertise in that field, either 
<br>
explicitly or by implication.
<br>
<p>3)  Leave the SL4 mailing list.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky,
<br>
SL4 List Owner.
