<em>&gt;&gt;you don't mind my sharing this article with you:

<em>&gt;&gt;It does talk about singularity, shocks, etc, so hope it is on-topic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's a genuine problem, and your proposed solution (and various analogs of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it) are worthy.  I don't oppose your proposal.  But that's not where my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interests lay in this decade.  (Two and three decades ago I would have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in total agreement.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The problem is the cost factor.  Because of the cost factor, it looks like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something that's going to require government sponsorship.  And I trust the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current US government so little that if they said the sky was bluish gray 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd go outside to check.  OTOH, Japan may be serious about their moonbase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;project.  Once you're there you can build a catapult and a (lunar) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beanstalk and you're well on your way.  (And that might be an EXCELLENT 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment for an AI to evolve.  I'm not sure that it would be exactly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendly, but it should, as part of it's original function, be protective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;towards humans...though not protective at all costs.  That's a good start.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm in a bit of a minority here in that I expect an AI to &quot;evolve&quot; out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the applications that people use to do things:  Google, hospital 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;administration, etc.  Managing a terrestrial-ish environment in inimical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances seems another good place.  People seem to add more bells and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whistles with each iteration of the program, and expect it to do more and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more.  Voice response is clearly something people will want as soon as it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes more feasible.  (&quot;Turn out the light in the kitchen!&quot;)  Expanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from recognizing a few simple commands to a larger and more flexible subset 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of native language to, eventually, full recognition of natural speech...but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that in and of itself requires a lot of what is required by an AGI, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially when it includes being able to respond sensibly to those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commands/requests.  And even more when it decides which commands to accept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and which to ignore...and how to respond while ignoring them.  Doing that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requires that it rank various goals in importance and detect conflicts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between them, and the functions that it has been designed to perform will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;set it's initial goals (supergoals?) and rank them in importance.  (First 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of all, protect the AIR!  If that means leaving someone to die, you still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protect the community air supply.  Second is water...water is just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important, but less urgent.   So you can think about other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;priorities...like saving people's lives.  etc.  Possibly I've got the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;priorities wrong...but I don't think so.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, an AGI may come sooner, and via some more purposeful route.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not sure that's the route of maximal probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Any application on this level is generally the result of a long term project 
<br>
with a very specific goal. In other words, you can't just abstract the 
<br>
meaning of &quot;evolve&quot; you quote up there and then add in your own unspecified 
<br>
speculation about what that's going to look like. Eventually some project is 
<br>
going to have the specific goal of &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot;. Even 
<br>
if the project relies on Google (why would it, exactly?), it's going to be a 
<br>
direct and specific effort by a group of people working on a specific 
<br>
project, not to be confused with any vague reference to an application just 
<br>
&quot;evolving&quot; out of the population.
<br>
<p>In fact, it all comes down to the math. And the state of math is advanced by 
<br>
specific individuals doing specific research projects in specific directions 
<br>
(whether in academia, business, etc). Once the math is there, the 
<br>
application (and the Singularity) will follow shortly- I guarentee you that.
<br>
<p>It's not about increasing the number of eggs or baskets in the population, 
<br>
it's about finding the right &quot;One Basket&quot; to funnel those eggs in to (i.e. 
<br>
the project that is going to produce a successful and Friendly AGI, and 
<br>
before anyone else).
