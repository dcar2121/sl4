</em><br>
<p>Thank you, Eliezer for using exactly that argument.  It enabled me to put my 
<br>
finger on what's been bothering me about this list recently . . . .
<br>
<p>People, unavoidably, always argue with their own mental perceptions of what 
<br>
the other person's argument was.  Unfortunately, however, it seems as if, 
<br>
recently, people are getting *a lot* worse at correctly modeling other 
<br>
people's arguments and are a lot more prone to knee-jerk reactions.
<br>
<p>You have apparently modeled Richard's argument as simplistic and lacking 
<br>
your deep understanding of the field.  Unfortunately, the evidence that I 
<br>
have seen indicates that he has understood and answered 100% of your 
<br>
arguments whereas you have clearly refused to address his arguments once 
<br>
they reach the point of (successully) answering your initial knee-jerk 
<br>
responses.  I see no evidence of your having any more understanding of the 
<br>
field than he does and indeed actually note that you seem to need to be 
<br>
constantly trying to steer the conversation from the field that Richard 
<br>
initially brought up (mental modeling) to one that you are more comfortable 
<br>
with (heuristics and biases) -- despite the fact that the relevance of this 
<br>
change is obviously disputable.
<br>
<p>And then, clearly obnoxious insults and threats follow . . . . to whit:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you understand?  You are ignorant of an established experimental field.
</em><br>
<p>In your biased, knee-jerk model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I did you the courtesy of informing you that you were ignorant
</em><br>
<p>No.  You *told* him that he was ignorant.  *Informing* him would have done 
<br>
it in such a way that it was believable (at least, to a relatively impartial 
<br>
observer).  You didn't successfully &quot;inform&quot; *me* that Richard was ignorant. 
<br>
You did successfully inform me that *you* have some huge (dare I say it, 
<br>
unscientifically irrational) blinders.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, when someone ignores this advice  . . . . Either it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberate bluff followed by the attempt to cover it up when caught, or it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the arrogant smart guy's trap of thinking that their infinitesimal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of all human knowledge constitutes the whole.  Either way it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not particularly forgiveable.
</em><br>
<p>Damn!  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is, in fact, a serious enough offense against scientific ethics, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether committed intentionally or unintentionally, that I am wondering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether to ban you from SL4 for it.
</em><br>
<p>Before you do that, I would request that you do the scientifically ethical 
<br>
thing and rebut Richard's arguments in a scientific fashion -- not refuse to 
<br>
discuss them because you have a perception (that Richard is ignorant) that 
<br>
has *absolutely nothing to do with the validity of his arguments*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I give you three choices, the next time anyone on SL4 informs you that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are not an expert in an existing science:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Read the actual literature of that field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Stop claiming expertise.  I don't mean that you have to admit you were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong and apologize or anything like that.  Just be aware that, by the law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the list laid down by me, you are unjustly and tyrannically prohibited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from again claiming expertise in that field, either explicitly or by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Leave the SL4 mailing list.
</em><br>
<p>So . . . . what if I say to you (Eliezer) that you appear not to be an 
<br>
expert in the field of mental modeling -- enough so that you don't 
<br>
understand the scientific basis, relevance, and standing of Richard's 
<br>
arguments.  I believe that you don't agree with him because you are 
<br>
incorrectly casting his arguments into your knowledge of another field 
<br>
(heuristics and biases) and that you are showing the &quot;bluff or arrogance&quot; 
<br>
that you are accusing Richard of.  I think that, in this case, maybe you 
<br>
need to
<br>
1)  Read the actual literature of that field.
<br>
2)  Stop claiming expertise.  I don't mean that you have to admit you
<br>
&nbsp;were wrong and apologize or anything like that.  Just be aware that, by
<br>
&nbsp;the law of the list laid down by &lt;you&gt;, you are unjustly and tyrannically
<br>
&nbsp;prohibited from again claiming expertise in that field, either
<br>
&nbsp;explicitly or by implication.
<br>
3)  Leave the SL4 mailing list.
<br>
<p>I will claim (and posit that many others on this list should claim) 
<br>
expertise in the scientific method.  I doubt that many will claim that, in 
<br>
this case, you are showing it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark
<br>
<p>P.S.  As for the relevance of the &quot;inventor of a perpetual motion 
<br>
machine&quot; -- The topic that was immediately labeled as such made no such 
<br>
claims.  The most casual perusal of their information revealed to me any 
<br>
number of ways in which their claims might be true without violating any 
<br>
laws of physics.  Yet, because of a knee-jerk reaction by someone who 
<br>
refused to even have the scientific integrity to even *start* to investigate 
<br>
the subject before squelching it, the subject was sniped.
<br>
<p>P.P.S.  Yes, it's your list.  You can boot anyone off of it for any reason 
<br>
you desire.  I'm asking that you stop, perform some self-investigation, and 
<br>
show some integrity.
<br>
<p>P.P.P.S.  What do you think about &quot;cold fusion&quot;?  Now, go do some research. 
<br>
Now, what do you think?
