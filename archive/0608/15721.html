<p>
I concur with Ben and Richard's postings about IQ testing: This is the
<br>
wrong focus.
<br>
<p>Might I point out the possibility  of one of those good ol' cognitive
<br>
bias here: Many SL4 members have scored high on IQ and similar tests,
<br>
and are proud of that, and so may place an unresaonable focus on
<br>
testing.
<br>
<p>Responding to Michael A.:
<br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is about smartness, not technology, and the second you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build something smarter than you, everything we know flies out the window.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly. But how is the measurement of IQ by tests relevant to the
<br>
development of artificially enhanced intelligence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And by the way, discussions of IQ are most definitely SL4.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Conversations about intelligence and comparisons between intraspecies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and interspecies intelligence differentials make up the core of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument ...
</em><br>
<p>IQ tests are not relevant to interspecies differentials until some
<br>
non-human can take them too, and I have not seen that IQ-test-taking
<br>
is even an intermediate goal of any of the AGI efforts.
<br>
<p>As for intraspecies (intra-humanity) differentials, humans vary only
<br>
slightly on the  continuum of intelligence. And even if we could
<br>
accurately measure the difference between people in the 50th,  90th,
<br>
and 99th percentile of intelligence, how would that make a difference
<br>
to the AGI effort? Achieving a 100 IQ AGI is hard enough; I'd guess
<br>
that going beyond that to 160 IQ is relatively trivial.
<br>
<p>I will grant that _if_ IQ-tests can differentiate what are ultimately
<br>
minor gradations and differences of human intelligence, and _if_ these
<br>
minor differences give researchers valuable hints for analyzing human
<br>
intelligence with the goal of reproducing General Intelligence, then
<br>
IQ tests are relevant.
<br>
<p>However,  the discussion in this thread  has not been about that
<br>
angle, but rather about how to best measure the differences between
<br>
humans in a way that correlates with real intelligence, and this seems
<br>
only secondarily relevant to SL4.
<br>
<p>Joshua
