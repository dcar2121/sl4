I'm young and I was thinking the same thing just the other day. This decade has
<br>
been one of rampant conservatism and mediocrity, not just in the sciences as
<br>
you point out, but in the creative arts as well (politics is so obvious its not
<br>
worth more than a parenthesis). Film, music and games have had fringe indie
<br>
activity that is semi-interesting, but there haven't really been any major
<br>
innovations. I've got a lot of hope for the tail of this decade as reversing
<br>
the trend, as there seems to be a lot of burgeoning AGI effort that might show
<br>
fruit, and interesting threads in interactive entertainment that could converge
<br>
in interesting ways. So far, however, this decade is truly deserving of being
<br>
called &quot;the Nils&quot;.

<p>Quoting Philip Goetz &lt;<a href="mailto:philgoetz@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20What's%20going%20on%20this%20decade?">philgoetz@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm archiving a bunch of articles from the 1990s, and remembering how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exciting that decade was.  We had a lot of new ideas about AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architectures, such as situated activity, hybrid architectures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamical-systems architectures; not to mention the continuing fallout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the 1980s over connectionism and reactive behavior.  We had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforcement learning, latent semantic analysis, statistical natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language processing, wavelets, and hidden Markov models for the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decent speech recognition.  We had people trying to deal with action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection and attention in cognitive archtectures for the first time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We had functional MRI, brain function localization, and the decoding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of population representations, temporal spike train coding, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chaotic basins of attraction in the brain.  We had decent compression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the first time - gzip and MPEG.  We had genetic algorithms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic programming, nonlinear science, self-organizing systems, &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edge of chaos&quot;, artificial life, virtual reality, the World Wide Web,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linux and open-source, developed the theory of quantum computers, had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first nanocomputer designs, solved the first tough problems with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biocomputers.  We also developed most of the transhumanist ideas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're still playing with today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could list a lot of things from the 1980s, also.  But I can't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of much that was kicked off in this decade that's as exciting as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the things I just mentioned from the 1990s.  Support vector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines?  Blogs?  Web services?  Greasemonkey?  Micropayments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outsourcing?  That's all I can think of at the moment.  Am I getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old?  Am I out of the loop?  What's going on out there?  I can't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of any new movements in science fiction from the 2000s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are some exciting things in other fields - genome sequencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (developed in the 1990s), RNA interference, gene therapy (largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1990s also), microarray protein expression analysis - but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of much in AI/comp sci/math that excites me lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this is because I left the university in 1997 and went to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in industry - but, I never found out about any of those exciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things from my university classes anyway, so that explanation doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy me.
</em><br>
