<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the list of examples you cited, I'm pretty sure some of them were

from the 1980s or earlier. Or at least they were concieved/invented before
<br>
the 1990s but only came into popularity then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I could list a lot of things from the 1980s, also.  But I can't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of much that was kicked off in this decade that's as exciting as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the things I just mentioned from the 1990s.  Support vector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines?  Blogs?  Web services?  Greasemonkey?  Micropayments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outsourcing?  That's all I can think of at the moment.  Am I getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old?  Am I out of the loop?  What's going on out there?  I can't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of any new movements in science fiction from the 2000s.
</em><br>
<p>As little as buzzwords mean, &quot;Web 2.0&quot; is the big new thing, along with AJAX.
<br>
Community-based sites and linking services between web applications etc.
<br>
<p>Firefox 1.0 was released in 2004.
<br>
<p>Local Telecommunications companies in NZ are going to using one connection for
<br>
net/tv/phone before 2010. Don't know about overseas (you guys probably already
<br>
have it).
<br>
<p>Admittedly these are not particular special events. Just gradual
<br>
ho-hum advancement.
<br>
<p>(BTW Support vector machines were 1990s)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are some exciting things in other fields - genome sequencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (developed in the 1990s), RNA interference, gene therapy (largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1990s also), microarray protein expression analysis - but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of much in AI/comp sci/math that excites me lately.
</em><br>
<p>Privatised space field has had some interesting events:
<br>
SpaceShipOne wins X-prize 2004
<br>
Virgin Intergalactic was founded 2004
<br>
4Frontiers Corporation was founded 2005
