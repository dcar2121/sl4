Hi,

<em>&gt; &gt; It is my guess that when a Singularity is launched, US-based

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Phil, I agree that, if
<br>
<p>* the trend of US gov't restricting research
<br>
* the trend of Asian gov't sucking away US and European researchers
<br>
<p>accelerate and expand dramatically during the next couple decades,
<br>
then the US will
<br>
lose its current  R&amp;D leadership position (which currently exists by a
<br>
pretty wide margin)
<br>
<p>But neither of these hypotheses strikes me as a &quot;given.&quot;
<br>
<p>Regarding nano:
<br>
US may not be funding Drexlerian nanotech, but neither is anyone else.
<br>
&nbsp;And we are funding more of the near-term type of nano than anyone
<br>
else, by a long shot.
<br>
<p>Regarding bio:
<br>
W is placing annoying restrictions, but at present these are nowhere
<br>
near significantly denting our leadership position.  [IMO, the US bio
<br>
community is not focused enough on pragmatic systems biology, but
<br>
neither is anywhere else -- the biggest visionaries in this domain are
<br>
in Seattle.]
<br>
<p>Regarding AI:
<br>
The US AI community is, on the whole, disappointingly narrow-minded
<br>
and anti-AGI in focus.  But unfortunately, everywhere else is even
<br>
worse.
<br>
<p>And regarding China:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/01/china.dogs.ap/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/01/china.dogs.ap/index.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-08-04-china-dogs_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-08-04-china-dogs_x.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Let's face it, that country has problems.  I don't think China is
<br>
ready yet to attract a huge mass of US and European scientists and
<br>
researchers.  (And for sure, none of them who do go will bring their
<br>
pets!).  Hugo de Garis has relocated to China
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.iss.whu.edu.cn/degaris/">http://www.iss.whu.edu.cn/degaris/</a>
<br>
<p>so there is an argument that a &quot;brain drain&quot; to the East is starting.
<br>
But he also went to Japan in the 90's, and then returned to the
<br>
Occident after it didn't fulfill his dreams.  I think China has a
<br>
realllly long way to go to catch up.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't want to idealize the US R&amp;D scene.  I find it terribly
<br>
narrow-minded, short-sighted and conformist.  But you haven't pointed
<br>
out to me anywhere that's better in any significant sense.  You've
<br>
only pointed out some trends that, IF they continue and accelerate to
<br>
a long time, could end up moving the center of R&amp;D innovation
<br>
elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Really, I am not speaking out of any kind of patriotic feeling, I'm
<br>
just trying to look at things objectively.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm stuck here in the US for another 8 years or so, due to
<br>
a shared child-custody arrangement with my ex (my youngest offspring
<br>
is 9 yrs old).  After that I'll be happy to stay in the US or leave it
<br>
depending on where is most opportune for AGI development.  Or maybe by
<br>
that point Novamente will have been completed and advanced far enough
<br>
toward Singularity to render national borders irrelevant ;-)
