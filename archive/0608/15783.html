that his comments above are, in fact, false - a bluff, to put it 
<br>
bluntly.  If Yudkowsky was interested in responding constructively, I 
<br>
myself asked him politely 59 days ago, and Yudkowsky could have chosen 
<br>
to respond to that.]
<br>
<p><p><p>Sigh!
<br>
<p>I really don't know what to say, Yudkowsky old buddy:  you don't seem to 
<br>
be able to conduct a discussion with me without making a slew of 
<br>
accusations of the &quot;when did you stop beating your wife?&quot; sort.  (I'll 
<br>
explain, below, why this is true in the present case).
<br>
<p>You do this, and then, anticipating that I am going to express some 
<br>
frustration at the treatment, you add that &quot;I fully expect that Richard 
<br>
Loosemore's response will complain about how dreadfully unfair and 
<br>
unprofessional it is of me to dare say that he has a systematic problem 
<br>
about anything, and what an awful place the SL4 mailing list is.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ouch!  Not only do you want to know when I stopped beating my wife, but 
<br>
you anticipate that I am going to try to weasle out of answering the 
<br>
question!  What a cad I must be!
<br>
<p>In the recent past you have *twice* thrown out insulting challenges in 
<br>
response to something I have written, and each time you then disappeared 
<br>
when I got back to you:
<br>
<p>On the first occasion:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your message:   <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reply:       <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14773.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14773.html</a>
<br>
<p>you implied that I was completely ignorant of the literature, that I was 
<br>
just making things up, and that I should go and read some baby-level 
<br>
references.  I gave a thorough response, including detailed references 
<br>
that showed my knowledge of the literature to be at least as good as 
<br>
your own, countered everything you said and backed up the claim that I 
<br>
originally made.  Hey, what more could I have done?
<br>
<p>But what did you do?  You ignored my reply completely.  Nada; nothing; 
<br>
total silence.
<br>
<p>On the second occasion:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your message:   <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15321.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15321.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reply:       <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15328.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0606/15328.html</a>
<br>
<p>I again made an immediate reply, in which I pointed out that a proper 
<br>
response to your request could go one of two ways, and I invited you to 
<br>
choose which direction you preferred it to go (I wanted to give you the 
<br>
option of not wasting time on what I thought we would both agree was the 
<br>
less interesting line of attack).
<br>
<p>So what did you do?  Again, you ignored the message completely.  That 
<br>
was 59 days ago.  Fifty-nine days and counting.
<br>
<p>Strange, don't you think?  You issue challenges and accusations at the 
<br>
drop of a hat, but when I take the trouble to respond, you disappear.
<br>
<p>Can you explain this behavior of yours?
<br>
<p><p>*******************************
<br>
<p>As to the substance of your request itself, if I gave you the 
<br>
impression, in my comment quoted above, that there was a large body of 
<br>
published literature out there, that was an impression that you conjured 
<br>
up out of nothing, unwarranted by what I actually said:  I said &quot;there 
<br>
are approaches to this problem that are powerful and viable&quot; because 
<br>
there are indeed *approaches* that I consider powerful and viable, and 
<br>
which I have attempted to start a discussion about here:  but these 
<br>
discussions were met with so much vitriol and sidetracking that I 
<br>
stopped bothering.  It would have been great to get some thoughtful 
<br>
feedback about these ideas, before they end up in my thesis, but with 
<br>
the best will in the world, I could not even get to first base before 
<br>
being shouted down.
<br>
<p>For future reference:  if I say that &quot;there are ways of doing [x]...&quot; it 
<br>
probably means that I can think of ways to do [x], and I would welcome a 
<br>
chance to discuss them with anyone who wants.  It probably also means &quot;I 
<br>
have tried to discuss this on SL4 or elsewhere, but it was such hard 
<br>
work to get people to understand what I was trying to say, that I gave 
<br>
up, and will have to wait until I get the time to publish it in full.&quot;
<br>
<p>*******************************
<br>
<p>But more generally, do I have a habit of implying that there are 
<br>
references that, in fact, do not exist?
<br>
<p>If I repeatedly say &quot;there is a published literature that demonstrates 
<br>
[x]...&quot; and then fail to produce any references to that published 
<br>
literature when you request them, you are perfectly entitled to come 
<br>
back and say &quot;It seems to me that you have a systematic problem with 
<br>
airy references to literature that exists somewhere only you can see it&quot;.
<br>
<p>If, on the other hand, I say &quot;there are approaches to [x]...&quot; you are 
<br>
perfectly entitled to ask for clarification:  Am I talking about 
<br>
something that has been published yet?  Something that is discussed 
<br>
widely within a community that you have little contact with?  What did I 
<br>
mean by that?  etc. etc.  What you are *not* entitled to do is put words 
<br>
into my mouth and then make accusations based on those words.
<br>
<p>The only situations that I can recall when you did anything remotely 
<br>
like make a request for references, was long ago when you asked for 
<br>
references to the most basic, simpleminded facts about complex systems: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly gave you a basic, simpleminded reference.  I pointed out 
<br>
that the claim I made was so general that it was in the 'baby stuff' 
<br>
category:  found all over the place, but best articulated in simple 
<br>
minded introductory books.  Not good enough for you?  Sorry: I am not 
<br>
going to hand-hold you through the baby stuff.
<br>
<p>Can you find other examples of situations where I explicitly claimed a 
<br>
literature reference but failed (in your opinion) to produce it?  You 
<br>
have just made a sweeping allegation that I make a habit of 
<br>
systematically doing this:  please cite examples of all those many 
<br>
situations where I claimed such references and then did not follow through.
<br>
<p>And when you make your list, I ask that you specifically exclude 
<br>
situations where someone demanded references to OTHER facts or data that 
<br>
seemed important to them, but which had no relevance to the claims that 
<br>
I was making.  I am not going to produce references to other people's 
<br>
fantasies about what they think I should have been talking about!  I 
<br>
seem to recall that there have been some of those.
<br>
<p>I am willing to apologize, without reservation, for any specific 
<br>
mistakes I might have made, in not responding to a reasonable request. 
<br>
But you have to demonstrate a pattern of abuse, not a couple of 
<br>
mistakes, and you have to balance it with examples where I did indeed 
<br>
cite references on request, and of course you have to exclude cases 
<br>
where someone asked me about my own ideas, rather than something that I 
<br>
*claimed* was published elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Finally:  please justify the other accusation you made above:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I fully expect that Richard Loosemore's response will complain
</em><br>
<em> &gt; about how dreadfully unfair and unprofessional it is of me to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dare say that he has a systematic problem about anything, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; what an awful place the SL4 mailing list is...
</em><br>
<p>References please?
<br>
<p>And once again, I'd prefer them to be references to the specific problem 
<br>
cited, not to complaints of mine that, on inspection, were perfectly 
<br>
justified (like e.g. being accused of saying something that I did not in 
<br>
fact say).
<br>
<p><p>Respectfully yours, but sad that this distraction has already taken so 
<br>
much time,
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore
