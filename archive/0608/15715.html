</em><br>
<p>This is a very important statement.  What Michael is saying is that we
<br>
are living in a timeline where many many humans are born before they
<br>
destroy themselves with UFAI or move into another reference class.
<br>
(If I'm translating the idea correctly.)
<br>
<p>Given that our probability of being born into any given being in our
<br>
reference class is roughly equivalent, it is likely that we will find
<br>
ourselves in the universe where many us-beings exist.  That is, where
<br>
they make babies the most before dying or transcending.
<br>
<p>A tremendous number of persons are being born today.  Every year
<br>
increment that time extends before the Singularity occurs, that number
<br>
increases exponentially.  So there is an anthropic selection effect
<br>
favoring our finding ourselves in worlds where time is maximally
<br>
prolonged before the Singularity occurs, while still preserving
<br>
physical laws.
<br>
<p>This may be why the education system is so amazingly poor.  I often
<br>
found myself in elementary, middle, and high school thinking &quot;why is
<br>
this so amazingly awful?&quot;  In fact I printed out and read most of
<br>
KurzweilAI.net while ignoring my teachers in high school classes.
<br>
<p>For this reason, as Michael says, the time from now until the
<br>
Singularity will likely be measured in terms of its maximum probable
<br>
length.  This could be anywhere between a few months and thirty years,
<br>
we don't know.
<br>
<p>That's the funny thing about anthropic inference.  It seems like
<br>
&quot;cheating&quot;, but when you think about it, it doesn't actually give us
<br>
theories with much more predictive validity than we already had to
<br>
begin with.
