<em>&gt; So you think goodness and evil are inherent, objective, context-free

</em><br>
<p>Not really... but this is beside the point for the purposes of what I
<br>
was responding to.  Yyou're reading too far into my example.  The
<br>
point was simply that it will eventually be possible to 'manufacture'
<br>
kindness without having to struggle through any sort of complex
<br>
synergistic process, as Jef Allbright seemed to imply with the
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>&quot;Note that this approach is inherently evolutionary.  There is no
<br>
static solution to the moral problem within a coevolutionary scenario.
<br>
But there are increasingly effective principles of what works to
<br>
maximize the growth of what we increasingly see as increasingly good.&quot;
<br>
<p>The point is also that, eventually, everything reduces to engineering.
<br>
<p>As another example, imagine a social pact where one person's moral
<br>
model is automatically updated based on silent requests from people
<br>
around them, sent to their brain over a wireless network.  This would
<br>
be &quot;augmented morality&quot;, and it would subtly contradict the implicit
<br>
message Jef was putting across when he said,&quot;It's time for humanity to
<br>
grow up and begin taking full responsibility for ourselves and our way
<br>
forward.&quot;  It's not &quot;taking full responsibility&quot; per se when you are
<br>
using machines to update your morality automatically.
<br>
<p>A society full of such individuals may be able to dispense with
<br>
discussing things face to face, or holding votes, or engaging in all
<br>
the other moral/political activity that humans engage in today.
<br>
<p>Jef also said, &quot;We are conditioned to expect that a greater entity
<br>
(our parents?, our god?) will know what is best and act in our
<br>
interests.&quot;  The fact of the matter is, a greater and more intelligent
<br>
entity might indeed know what is best for us and act in our interests
<br>
in ways far deeper, elegant, and long-lasting than we would be able to
<br>
act for ourselves.  The fear of this outcome stems from so many
<br>
powerful humans who say they want the best for us but then abuse their
<br>
power.  But to deny its possibility is blatant anthropocentrism.
