<p>
Here's my view of recent events, down for the record.
<br>
<p>At the end of August, i.e., at the end of tomorrow, this topic is 
<br>
officially dead and killthreaded, so if you've got something you 
<br>
absolutely need to get off your chest, get it off your chest before then.
<br>
<p>May the Wise kindly take note:
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel is a nice fellow - so nice that he found nice things to say 
<br>
about Mentifex, for God's sake.  Saying of Mentifex:  &quot;In my view, 
<br>
although Arthur sometimes *presents* his ideas in a somewhat kooky 
<br>
way... the ideas themselves are significantly better than most of what 
<br>
passes for cognitive science and AI.&quot;  Goertzel later mostly retracted 
<br>
this, then rephrased it and said it again (see the Mentifex FAQ).  The 
<br>
point is: if Ben wasn't willing to call Mentifex a crackpot, then I'm 
<br>
sorry, Ben, but I'm going to take any nice things you say about 
<br>
Loosemore with a rather large grain of salt.
<br>
<p>At first I too thought that Loosemore was a polymath.  However, there is 
<br>
such a thing as updating past opinions in response to new evidence.
<br>
<p>There are such things as crackpots, in this world.  If you are not 
<br>
unfortunate enough to be a very minor public figure, you probably do not 
<br>
get emails from lunatics who want to talk to you about their perpetual 
<br>
motion machine.  I get those emails.  I don't reply to them, but still - 
<br>
bizarre as it may seem - even I am enough of a celebrity that I have to 
<br>
deal with crackpots.  How Ray Kurzweil ever gets to his legitimate 
<br>
email, I don't know; I expect he has someone sort it for him.
<br>
<p>Most crackpots cannot spell.  A few crackpots are articulate and can be 
<br>
mistaken for technical people.  Since there are more technical people 
<br>
than articulate crackpots, the prior probability is low, but it is not 
<br>
zero, and one runs into them from time to time.
<br>
<p>Crackpots share certain characteristics in common, which is why John 
<br>
Baez's Crackpot Index is funny.  It's more funny if you've had to 
<br>
actually deal with crackpots.  I don't get physics crackpots so much, 
<br>
though I do get some; but that list is very, very true.
<br>
<p>Is Loosemore a crackpot?
<br>
<p>At first I thought Loosemore was a polymath, familiar with many fields, 
<br>
as he claimed (it is not so implausible).
<br>
<p>Then I thought Loosemore was a polymath who had been seduced by the 
<br>
sucking black hole of Emergence Mysticism in the guise of Complex 
<br>
Systems Theory.  This is sad, but not a crime, and who knew but when 
<br>
some subject would come up that might benefit from his expertise?
<br>
<p>Then Loosemore declared forcefully that falsifiable predictions were not 
<br>
the issue, and that any discussion must be conducted on the paradigm 
<br>
level.  And this was flagrantly stupid, but still not a crime, and still 
<br>
not something that would prevent Loosemore from contributing to a 
<br>
technical discussion that infringed on one of his polymath subjects.  At 
<br>
this time I still thought he was a polymath - rather unskilled in the 
<br>
Art, but still a polymath who had just fallen into some very unfortunate 
<br>
memetic attractors.  I thought of the 50-point item on Baez's list, but 
<br>
I did not think &quot;crackpot&quot;.
<br>
<p>So when did I undergo the figure-ground inversion?  When did the vase 
<br>
become two faces, the young lady become the old crone?
<br>
<p>When Loosemore started to claim that he was already an expert 
<br>
specifically in heuristics and biases, which I knew damn well he was 
<br>
not, and which anyone in the audience can verify by reading up on the 
<br>
subject; also you have Jeff Medina's word for it, and even Ben Goertzel 
<br>
agrees on this.
<br>
<p>If Loosemore would exaggerate his expertise in one field, why not another?
<br>
<p>Suddenly his open rejection of falsifiable predictions took on a whole 
<br>
different light.
<br>
<p>And his evasiveness, and frequent changes of subject.
<br>
<p>And the fact that he had never actually demonstrated any of the 
<br>
technical knowledge he claimed.
<br>
<p>And his swiftness to take insult when questioned.
<br>
<p>If I needed any possible further confirmation, I had it when Loosemore 
<br>
tried to pull rank and get everyone to stop questioning him - by 
<br>
invoking, for God's sake, a Master's degree in psychology.  *That* was 
<br>
classic crackpot.  (I am still willing to believe that Loosemore has a 
<br>
Master's degree in psychology, though I wouldn't bet money on it.  The 
<br>
tale about the psychology department inventing a special distinction for 
<br>
just his degree, seems rather less probable.)
<br>
<p>And then, Loosemore told an outright untruth.  He said that he had 
<br>
known, at the time he wrote his first take on the Conjunction Fallacy, 
<br>
of the research that refuted his suggestions.
<br>
<p>When I say that the eye of the Wise is blinded to the gapingly obvious, 
<br>
I am referring, specifically, to anyone who can look at Loosemore's 
<br>
original post on the Conjunction Fallacy; read the paper I referenced by 
<br>
Osherson; read Loosemore's later claim to have known about all that 
<br>
research already and had it in mind at the time of writing his reply; 
<br>
and still believe that Loosemore is telling the truth.
<br>
<p>Now, of course, I could be wrong about all this; that is the hazard of 
<br>
being mortal.  Even more likely is that I am wrong about at least one 
<br>
aspect of it; that is the hazard of telling a detailed tale in which 
<br>
each detail is another chance to be wrong.
<br>
<p>If I were more reluctant to change my beliefs; or if, desiring to appear 
<br>
Wise, I felt more obligated to give people the benefit of the doubt and 
<br>
believe them virtuous, even when a pure rationalist might deem it 
<br>
improbable; then I might have invented a different tale.  Then I might 
<br>
have made yet another incremental modification to my beliefs about 
<br>
Loosemore.  So that I could keep to my old belief, rather than 
<br>
abandoning it entirely, and so never admit that I had been fooled from 
<br>
the beginning...
<br>
<p>In this tale, Loosemore is a true and knowledgeable polymath...
<br>
<p>...who got stuck in the black hole of emergence mysticism...
<br>
<p>...who made the severe (but honest) mistake of believing that 
<br>
falsifiable predictions were not important...
<br>
<p>...who sometimes changes the subject a little, but so do we all...
<br>
<p>...who, steeped in the halls of academia, is accustomed to a high degree 
<br>
of courtesy from others, and swift to point out any departure from that 
<br>
standard...
<br>
<p>...who didn't recall any of the research on the Conjunction Fallacy when 
<br>
he first encountered the example, but who did genuinely read Judgment 
<br>
Under Uncertainty as part of a psychology course in 1987, and just 
<br>
didn't remember it...
<br>
<p>...who, later, after a quick online refresher course in heuristics and 
<br>
biases, made an honest error of recollection as to how much he had 
<br>
originally known, and what he had had originally in mind; for those who 
<br>
study such matters will know that memories are oft all too pliable, 
<br>
changing each time we recall them to mind; and perhaps his mismemory was 
<br>
exaggerated a bit more by the heat of discussion, his desire to prove 
<br>
himself wholly right from the beginning...
<br>
<p>...who, when angry, made intemperate remarks about his degree, but this 
<br>
was only in the heat of anger...
<br>
<p>Yes, I can see this alternative hypothesis.  Of course I see it.  Even 
<br>
if I did not invent it for myself, I would have seen the elements of 
<br>
this picture in others' minds.
<br>
<p>Yes, I assign this alternative hypothesis a nonzero probability - though 
<br>
it is too detailed to be wholly true in all its parts.  It is more 
<br>
likely that Loosemore is a genuine polymath for whatever reason, than 
<br>
that the entire explanation is exactly true.  Perhaps the truth is some 
<br>
third way entirely.  In my experience so far, when it seems hard to 
<br>
decide which of two hypotheses is true, there often is a third 
<br>
hypothesis that is much simpler which I am just overlooking.
<br>
<p>But in the end I must judge and act.
<br>
<p>My guess was that Loosemore was a crackpot, or, even if not a crackpot, 
<br>
someone who was rather unlikely to contribute usefully to SL4.  I acted 
<br>
accordingly.
