<p><p>&quot;Summary - A radically new form of neural network based artificial 
<br>
intelligence has been conceived that in contrast to preceding forms of AI, 
<br>
builds itself and then enters into an intellectual bootstrapping process 
<br>
wherein it learns from its own mistakes and successes to create useful ideas 
<br>
and strategies. Not only is this technology capable of autonomously 
<br>
inventing and discovering new products, services, and procedures, as it has 
<br>
for numerous international corporations and government agencies, it has also 
<br>
devised several revolutionary neural network paradigms. For these reasons 
<br>
and more, AI visionaries and futurists, such as Dr. Dennis Bushnell, NASA 
<br>
Langley's chief scientist and visionary, have called this technology, known 
<br>
as the &quot;Creativity Machine,&quot; AI's best bet at creating human to trans-human 
<br>
level intelligence in machines. ...This technology is produced and delivered 
<br>
exclusively by Imagination Engines, Incorporated as either customer tailored 
<br>
or mass produced products. &quot;
<br>
<p>I've never even heard of this company before just now. I don't know how 
<br>
technically laughable or not so laughable this approach is to AGI, but they 
<br>
are obviously doing something pretty effectively given their customers, 
<br>
while at the same time making some pretty extraordinary claims.
<br>
<p>What do you guys think?
