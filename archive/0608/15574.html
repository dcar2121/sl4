<em>&gt; Oh sigh. It's very U.S.-centric to consider it the top dog in its class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what standards you want to use, but I wouldn't consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. the &quot;best&quot; country in any sense. I don't know that I ever have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ditto the so-called growth of so-called fundamentalist religion. What do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you use to justify this claim, and against what other periods of history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are you comparing, and why are your samples reasonable?
</em><br>
<p>Well, &quot;best&quot; sounds like a value judgment, which is inherently
<br>
qualitative, until some criteria are specified, of course...
<br>
<p>But the post-WWII USA seems to me to have been the most intense and
<br>
productive nexus of technological and scientific progress in human
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>The US is also of course &quot;top dog&quot; in purely economic terms; I believe
<br>
it's GNP is about 1/4 that of the global all together...
<br>
<p>It is my guess that when a Singularity is launched, US-based
<br>
researchers and engineers are likely to have a lot to do with it.
<br>
<p>There is more AI, nanotech and biotech going on here in the US than
<br>
anywhere else....  These are in my view (and that of Kurzweil and
<br>
others) the most important Singularity technologies.  (Japan is
<br>
kicking our ass in robotics and consumer electronics, admittedly, but
<br>
I find these domains less Singularity-central....)
<br>
<p>And I say this as a person who despises our current US President, who
<br>
personally preferred living in Australia and New Zealand to the US,
<br>
and who runs a company with nearly all its employees in Brazil ...
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is not an SL4-relevant thread though.  I think I'll snipe
<br>
myself, having said my patriotic little bit ;-)
<br>
