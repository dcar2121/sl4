Hi Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oftimes it is greatly convenient, to pretend to be Wise.  When any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict breaks out, you can sternly chide both sides, saying:  &quot;You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally at fault; you must learn to see each other's viewpoints.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older and more mature, and I say to you: stop this pointless bickering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, for you begin to annoy me.  Ponder well the wisdom of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone get along!&quot;  You do not need to examine the dispute, nor wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if perhaps one side does have more merit than the other.  You need not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judge between two sides, and risk having your judgment turn out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embarassingly wrong, or risk having your judgment questioned as though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were only another ordinary mortal.  Indeed you must not ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, you must not judge; for if you take sides, you will at once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose your reputation for being Wise, which requires that you stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever above the fray.
</em><br>
<p>Presumably this amusing poetic email is an attack on my post chiding
<br>
both you and Loosemore for being so confrontational...
<br>
<p>Introspecting honestly, I really don't find that when I wrote that
<br>
email I was in a psychological state of attempting to adopt some fake
<br>
attitude of &quot;wisdom&quot;
<br>
<p>Rather, I really do think that, even though Richard made some
<br>
mis-statements and overstatements regarding various things (including
<br>
the current state of knowledge about heuristics and biases), he has
<br>
some insights about the relation of complex systems science and
<br>
intelligence which you would benefit to better understand.
<br>
<p>And I also think that, even though you seem to err tactically by
<br>
having too little interest in understanding the H&amp;B work in the larger
<br>
context of cognitive science, and (more critically) seem to err
<br>
strategically by not understanding the relevance of complexity and
<br>
self-organization ... even so, you have some deep insights into the
<br>
nature of cognition that Richard should have paid more attention to.
<br>
<p>He should have written more carefully and formulated his thoughts more
<br>
carefully before writing.  You should have been less obnoxious and
<br>
made more of a genuine attempt to understand his statements and ideas.
<br>
<p>The reason I didn't comment in detail on the topic at hand is mostly
<br>
that I'm on vacation and using email for only 30 minutes per day in
<br>
internet cafe's...
<br>
<p>So, all in all, I stand by my prior post, and I reject the insinuation
<br>
that I was putting on some fake mantle or tone of wisdom...
<br>
<p>Now ... farewell to email, and off to the Matterhorn!!!  Many lesser
<br>
men have tried and failed the ascent!  Me: I will have the sense to
<br>
not even try, but merely hike up to the base camp and look around :-)
<br>
... Now that's what I call wisdom ;-D
<br>
<p>Ben
