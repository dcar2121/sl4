Daniel Dennett has said that morality (or ethics or whatever you want
<br>
to call it) is discovered in the same sense that algebra was
<br>
discovered by humans, but it was there all along. This is also what I
<br>
think. It also seems to me that many of the arguments made against an
<br>
objective morality could equally well be applied to mathematics
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I doubt if this is really an SL4 topic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but try:

</em><br>
<p>While it may not have the same kind of shock value as some other
<br>
topics, it seems to me that it is a topic for all times and all
<br>
places. It also would have a pretty clear value for building an AI
<br>
that has an anything but perfect sense of empathy with humans.
