Hi Richard,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just do not think that lots of little, random projects are going to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  I see the need, for example, of sophisticated software tools that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would transform the field:  and if I am right about that, then it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never happen because nobody is going to be disciplined enough to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  Too big;  too structured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lone hackers we have plenty of.  People with a smattering of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a passion for coding, we have plenty of.  Don't know that that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we should be encouraging things along.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Government does not only fund big outfits with lots of constraints. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also give money to little ones with few constraints.  But they have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceive a direct *need* for the product.  AGI has no purpose except to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take over the world, so   they   wouldn't    really   , uh, be, uh...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested....  8-;
</em><br>
<p>This is just a quick message from an Internet cafe' near the
<br>
campground I am currently staying in (on Texel, an island off the cost
<br>
of Holland which is very peaceful and also features a sanctuary for
<br>
injured seals...)
<br>
<p>I will reply to this from two perspectives...
<br>
<p>First of all, given what I know about Novamente, my own view is that
<br>
the Novamente project can get to AGI within a reasonably brief period
<br>
of time (well before Kurzweil's 2029 for human-level AGI), if
<br>
reasonably funded (something I'm working hard on).
<br>
<p>Next, what would I say on this topic if I were *not* in possession of
<br>
what I believe to be a viable design for an AGI (and an in-progress
<br>
code base being created by a too-small but excellent and appropriate
<br>
team)??
<br>
<p>I would say that an optimal use of resources would be to fund **both**
<br>
<p>1) a collection of small teams focused on mostly-independently
<br>
pursuing their own creative and idiosyncratic approaches to AGI
<br>
<p>2) a collection of teams focused on building tools to support the
<br>
creation of AGI, including programming languages, operating systems,
<br>
visualization tools, novel hardware, novel mathematical analysis and
<br>
code formalization techniques, etc.
<br>
<p>Feedback between the two sets of teams would be strongly encouraged.
<br>
<p>Further, I venture that a funding initiative like this WILL exist at
<br>
some point, if Novamente or some other group does not initiate a hard
<br>
takeoff before the governments of the world get around to it....
<br>
<p>An AI renaissance will almost surely occur, spurred partly by the
<br>
realization that AI is achievable in a matter of decades and that the
<br>
potential positive economic and social implications of this are
<br>
tremendous.  But whether the renaissance will occur via a maverick
<br>
group creating a hard takeoff, or via a systematic funding effort such
<br>
as the one described above, is less certain.  I'm betting on my own
<br>
maverick group, but I've sought here to give a broader opinion
<br>
independent of my own thoughts regarding the potential of my own
<br>
project.
<br>
<p>ok ... back to the beach and the seals (and some interesting thoughts
<br>
about the theory of language learning, which I may share with yáll
<br>
when I return from this vacation ;-)
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
