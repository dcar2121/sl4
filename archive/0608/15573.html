<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Ben

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think we're looking at something completely different... the 90s 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; were given by tremendous intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; vitality, and tremendous amounts of money and energy being invested 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in moving the race dramatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; forward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The millenium has been marked by tremendous backlash; the explosive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; growth of fundamentalist religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; especially in the first world nations, a virtual collapse of support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for science and engineering as the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and perhaps only answer to human sustainability, and an overwhelming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; struggle for those in power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wealth to hold on to that power and wealth at any cost (up to and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; including killing the very goose that lays
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the golden eggs.) We seem to be caught up in the lethargy caused by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; profound cynicism and resignation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Worse, a lot of really brilliant people are living in/on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hope/denial... and we really need to get back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; business of growing the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think it's imperative that we begin at the societal level, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; begin teaching our children that they are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; future, and that blazing the way to a bright and powerful tomorrow is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; way cooler that playing &quot;Gangsta&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or commiting acts of virtual mayhem on portable game stations (not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the two a necessarily mutually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exclusive.) Done properly we might begin stemming the tidal wave of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; highschool drop outs and college
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; failures marking the latest generation of Americans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A failure to do such, bodes poorly for the vision we all so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; passionately embrace, and has us looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; squarely in the face of a slow and hot spiral into oblivion for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humanity, and the vast majority of higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; life forms currently enjoying the planet.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to see where this happened before, and more seriously, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at the period around 1000 AD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, another thing that's happening is the the US &quot;defeated&quot; all it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rivals and became the unchallenged top dog in it's class.  After which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no place to go but down.  (And all great thanks to the USSR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for allowing us to live through that process.)  As a result the entire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US appears to be facing a &quot;failure of vision&quot;.  See some of Charles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stross commentary on that.  Or look at the lists of Hugo winners.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is going to mean that a lot of the development is moving to other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries.  Other reasons are always given as to why, but I suspect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those reasons of being derivative rather than primary.  So what's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening now is that the current top dog is trying to freeze the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future into a mirror of the present...and destroying the present in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the process.  May we live through this.
</em><br>
Oh sigh. It's very U.S.-centric to consider it the top dog in its class. 
<br>
I don't know what standards you want to use, but I wouldn't consider the 
<br>
U.S. the &quot;best&quot; country in any sense. I don't know that I ever have. 
<br>
Ditto the so-called growth of so-called fundamentalist religion. What do 
<br>
you use to justify this claim, and against what other periods of history 
<br>
are you comparing, and why are your samples reasonable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know how I feel about the possibility of living in a universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I die as well as live whenever I cross the street...but then I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure how I feel about living in a simulation either, or being a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool for the Escaton.
</em><br>
Huh -- you probably live in one already.
