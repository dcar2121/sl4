</em><br>
<em>&gt; I submit that you are completely wrong on this.  Rates of poverty,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are tightly correlated with g.
</em><br>
<p>Ah:  the idea underlying my point was missed, I think:  the POQ measure 
<br>
is designed to capture the zones of economic depression that exist close 
<br>
to downtowns and far from cities.  We already *know* that this measure 
<br>
will work, because we know that economic wellbeing correlates quite well 
<br>
with IQ.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt; IQ is a direct measure of intelligence-in-the-large.  (And please do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; go off on a red herring about the generality of g:  those studies, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; matter how comprehensive, are still subject to the criticism that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; measure what CAN be measured, and have no relevance to components that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot be measured).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So basically what you're saying is that no matter how comprehensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the test, and how powerfully predictive the values are, any test will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell us nothing.  Ultimately, everything about reality can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured.  That's the whole foundation of science.  If God exists, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will create instruments that can distinguish His influence from other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influences.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, again, a misunderstanding:  there is no reason why intelligence in 
<br>
the large may not be measured one day ... we simply cannot do it now. 
<br>
And when it is measurable, it will not have to be one thing.  It could 
<br>
be a ragbag of fifty mechanisms, none of which we would want to say was 
<br>
THE mechanism.
<br>
<p><p><p>I won't do a line by line on the rest of what you say (although I should 
<br>
say that I probably misunderstood something because I thought you were 
<br>
advocating that high IQ was the best way of all possible ways to find a 
<br>
singularity team and get the singularity to happen:  apologies if I got 
<br>
that wrong), but I do want to try to clarify the core point with one quote:
<br>
<p><em> &gt;            It doesn't really matter if g is &quot;THE&quot; mechanism of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intelligence or not, a strong predictor of behavior is a strong
</em><br>
<em> &gt; predictor of behavior.
</em><br>
<p>This still falls foul of the core point, no?  G could indeed be a very 
<br>
strong predictor of many, many things that are easy to measure (income, 
<br>
delinquency rates, etc), but that would then make g a strong predictor 
<br>
of *some* aspects of behavior.  My argument is that the aspects of 
<br>
behavior that might really matter in some situations (like, e.g., me 
<br>
talking to a candidate and finding her mind to be exquisitely sharp when 
<br>
a variety of issues came up) might be just hopelessly impossible to 
<br>
measure in an objective way.  But in spite of that, I could assess 
<br>
someone accurately.
<br>
<p>My point, in complaining about the people who interpret g as THE 
<br>
mechanism of intelligence, is not so much about its value as a predictor 
<br>
of some aspects of behavior (conceded), but about the unwarranted 
<br>
generalization from [statistical measure of what can be measured] to 
<br>
[the whole mechanism of intelligence is what g measures].
<br>
<p>My grouse, of course, runs deep:  this happens in other, related areas.
<br>
