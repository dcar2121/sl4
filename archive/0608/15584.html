</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your statement within its intended context, but it misses
<br>
my point about the presumption of such a (dominant) superintelligence
<br>
as essential to *the* solution to the problem at hand. Presently such
<br>
a superintelligence does not exist nor is there any tangible plan or
<br>
timeframe for one. There seems to be a general lack of appreciation
<br>
for the element of time needed to extract regularities from the
<br>
environment, and a lack of appreciation for just how much of perceived
<br>
local intelligence is actually a product of eons of synergetic
<br>
development.
<br>
<p>You have not responded to various questions as to the expected limits
<br>
to growth of an intelligence effectively isolated from the world.  You
<br>
have been talking for many years about how a self-improving AI can be
<br>
expected to go FOOM in a matter of minutes to hours, effectively
<br>
isolated from dynamically learning from the larger world due to
<br>
incompatible time-scales.  If you still hold this view, that the first
<br>
such AI will immediately become the dominant AI, then how do you hope
<br>
to influence its moral direction (apart from the obvious strategy of
<br>
going to work for the likely creater), given that it will likely be
<br>
created by a military organization, if not big business due to their
<br>
vastly larger resources?  Mightn't it be reasonable in such a scenario
<br>
to exert influence by beginning as early as possible to promote the
<br>
amplification of human morality?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if you expect proliferation of a diverse range of
<br>
AI and IA technology leading up to the big FOOM, then again, mightn't
<br>
it be reasonable to exploit this growth of intelligence toward
<br>
development of a framework for increasingly moral social
<br>
decision-making?
<br>
<p>Have you seriously considered that the answer to the hard problem&quot; of
<br>
Friendly AI may be the same as the answer to the so-called &quot;hard
<br>
problem&quot; of consciousness?  Mu.
