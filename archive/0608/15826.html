<p><em>&gt;So what you've got is the unsurprising situation that some people agree

<p>*IF* there is general agreement that human brains are the seat of something 
<br>
called intelligence, then a functional copy of one should exhibit intelligence.
<br>
<p>Since we don't know nearly enough detail about how brains work (yet!) 
<br>
that's an approach for the future, but there is a high probability it will 
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>I have long expressed my misgivings about such a project from both the 
<br>
hardware requirements and the potential dangers from a mass of 
<br>
psychological traits evolved in the stone age, especially in an uploaded 
<br>
mind had considerable real world power.
<br>
<p>Analogy is always suspect, but Marvin Minsky thinks well of it.  Consider 
<br>
the Wrights.  They knew darn well that heavier than air flight was possible 
<br>
since birds can fly.  Some people in those days tried to emulate birds with 
<br>
flapping machines.  The Wrights succeeded because they extracted the wing 
<br>
idea from (gliding) birds and used props to supply the motive power.
<br>
<p>We know AI is possible because natural intelligence exists.  So what are 
<br>
the features of natural intelligence you would need to extract and what can 
<br>
be replaced with something nature could not (or did not) evolved like a 
<br>
rotating prop?
