Jef,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On 8/10/06, Michael Anissimov &lt;<a href="mailto:michaelanissimov@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Maximize%20the%20renormalized%20human%20utility%20function!">michaelanissimov@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; &gt; This list is called &quot;SL4&quot;, so you should expect people here to hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; SL4 views.  It's okay if you're SL3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LOL.
</em><br>
<p>Are you not..?  I'm not in the know.  Are you laughing at the very
<br>
idea that I would classify people based on future shock level, or
<br>
what?  I'm not descriminating or anything, if that's what you're
<br>
inferring.  It just seems that you don't think the world will change
<br>
significantly in the next few decades, whereas SL4s certainly do, and
<br>
plan their lives accordingly...
<br>
<p>You have to give me a bit more content, as this is an online
<br>
communication environment, and I cannot infer the aim of your laughter
<br>
from your body language or tone of voice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; With regards to your remarks on morality being the product of billions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of years of synergetic evolution, there's an interesting experiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for me to bring up.  If I had an atomic-level scanner and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sophisticated nanotechnology, I could simply pick the most benevolent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person (probably a girl) that I know, and press a button to copy them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repeatedly.  I would be making the world a better place, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understanding an iota about the billions of years of synergetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolution underlying morality.  Small wonder!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh??
</em><br>
<p>You wrote, &quot;There seems to be a general lack of appreciation
<br>
for the element of time needed to extract regularities from the
<br>
environment, and a lack of appreciation for just how much of perceived
<br>
local intelligence is actually a product of eons of synergetic
<br>
development.&quot;
<br>
<p>If I copy a nice person again and again, I can miraculously produce
<br>
increases in local intelligence and compassion without any
<br>
appreciation for the eons of synergetic development.  That was my
<br>
point.  With sufficiently high levels of technology, we can have our
<br>
cake and eat it too.  This is a point that many, many people do not
<br>
get.
<br>
<p>With advanced nanotechnology, I can pour megatons of toxic waste into
<br>
the environment, then instruct utility fog to pick it up and restore
<br>
prior conditions.  This scenario would make many environmentalists
<br>
cringe, but one day it could be possible.  This ties in with what I am
<br>
talking about.
