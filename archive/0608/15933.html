<p><p>Of course I can tell the difference between you. He has said little that is

either true or false. You have said much that is true and much that is

false. That's why my words to you have been strongly &quot;you've had some good

ideas, but for God's sake get out of the rut you're in!&quot; and my words to him
<br>
have been &quot;okay, well let's see what you've got.&quot;
<br>
<p>(And no, if you're wondering, I don't take talk about &quot;complex systems&quot; any

more seriously than I take talk about &quot;it's going to rain tomorrow&quot;.)

...I was accusing people of spinning words against themselves probably about
<br>
the time when you were figuring out &quot;The cat sat on the mat&quot;. Granted I
<br>
don't think I knew the phrase &quot;Intelligence+Charisma roll&quot; back then, that
<br>
would have been around the late 80s, maybe 90, you'd probably graduated to
<br>
'PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;' at that stage? ;)
<br>
<p>(Sorry, you know I don't normally do that, but really, some kicks just beg
<br>
to be countered rather than merely blocked :))
