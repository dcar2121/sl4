</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben
</em><br>
<p>I am just a little stunned at the two comments above (Eliezer's sarcasm,
<br>
and then your partial agreement that this cannot be explained except by
<br>
pure inferential stupidity).
<br>
<p>Stunned, because I am amazed at the inferential(?) stupidity that allows
<br>
two AGI researchers to look at this experiment and not be able to see
<br>
any factors that could have been involved. [NOTE: I use the word
<br>
&quot;stupidity,&quot; of course, not to get personal :-) , but just as a
<br>
rhetorical invitation for you to contrast and compare, if you will, your
<br>
own response to the experiment to the subjects' responses].
<br>
<p>So here goes.
<br>
<p>First, when subjects turn up to do experiments in psychologists' labs,
<br>
all kinds of junk is going through their heads. One of the main things
<br>
is that, as you know, the general population has some pretty weird ideas
<br>
about what psychology actually is, and what the researchers are up to. A
<br>
lot of the time, I think, they view the experiment as some kind of test
<br>
or competition between them and the experimenter, and they have to
<br>
'prove' themselves smart in the experimenter's eyes. This, if nothing
<br>
else, lends an element of stress in even the most relaxed of settings.
<br>
<p>Second, the experimenter cannot answer questions (often), so if the
<br>
subject reads the instructions and cannot understand them, they are
<br>
supposed to do their best to interpret them. I don't know if
<br>
clarification questions were allowed in the above experiment. Do you? I
<br>
suspect they were not.
<br>
<p>Third, subjects are often hunting for &quot;the&quot; way to solve the problem set
<br>
to them. For whatever reason, they assume that it would somehow be
<br>
tricky or deceitful if the experimenter set them problems that require
<br>
them to deploy more than one strategy. So if they find one obvious
<br>
strategy, they go with that.
<br>
<p>Fourth, when they are given instructions by the experimenter (like
<br>
&quot;Relax and take your time, because it does not matter&quot;), they sometimes
<br>
(and perhaps frequently) appear to disregard some of the instructions
<br>
(so they hear the experimenter tell them to take their time, but they
<br>
believe that the experimenter is secretly measuring the time it takes
<br>
them, anyway).
<br>
<p>Fifth, when the wording contains any element of ambiguity whatsoever
<br>
(and sometimes ambiguity can be forced by the time constraints of the
<br>
experiment, and not be at all obvious when we, at our leisure, read the
<br>
instructions afterwards), they try to construct a model of what the
<br>
experimenter is probably trying to get them to do, to help them resolve
<br>
their confusion.
<br>
<p>Sixth, the experimental materials can easily contain confusing features
<br>
that nobody ever discovers. (Such damaging features are discovered so
<br>
often in the years after an experiment is published, without ever being
<br>
noticed by the original experimenters, that it makes you wonder just how
<br>
much effort anyone ever takes to analyze possible problems with a design
<br>
before they go ahead and do it).
<br>
<p>You're beginning to get the picture, I'm sure.
<br>
<p>So in the case of the above experiment, I had forgotten the punchline of
<br>
the experiment, so I looked at it and did it on the spot.
<br>
<p>Hey presto: my first answer was (2)!
<br>
<p>Why? Because, even though I had been primed by all the Conjunction
<br>
Fallacy stuff in the last week, I completely forgot to notice that the
<br>
the first string was shorter than the other two (perhaps because all the
<br>
RRRR strings misled my eye, in the way that you may, depending on your
<br>
mail client, have had your own eye misled earlier in this sentence). And
<br>
on the other hand I did notice (because I had been primed by the only
<br>
relevant information given in the instructions) that there were
<br>
differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the three strings. I
<br>
was also rushing because I felt some urgency to prove to myself that I
<br>
could polish it off quickly.
<br>
<p>Well well well. I am stupid and irrational, apparently! And there is no
<br>
other explanation for my (or the subjects') behavior: it really cannot
<br>
be anything except irrational stupidity.
<br>
<p><p><p>Some of the troubling little factors I catalogued above are matters of
<br>
good experimental design, but some of them are just so embarrassing to
<br>
the entire psychological community that they are ignored. I mean, if
<br>
*all* subjects come to your lab trying to second guess your intentions,
<br>
no matter what you say to them, what the hell do you do? Give up being
<br>
an experimental psychologist? Of course not: you agree with all the
<br>
other psychologists to overlook the problems (at least, if your name is
<br>
not Gibson), and say that it will all come out in the wash.
<br>
<p>These are some of the reasons why the conclusions derived from
<br>
experiments like these (and the other several hundred in the literature)
<br>
don't merit the kind of most-humans-are-irrational triumphalism that I
<br>
see around this list all too often. To say nothing of the kind of silly
<br>
sarcasm that only seems to demonstrate a complete ignorance of both the
<br>
complexity of experimental design and the implications that that has for
<br>
the robustness of conclusions derived from experiments.
<br>
<p>[And YES YES YES, if you could somehow do the impossible and eliminate
<br>
all the factors I just mentioned (you would have to at least draw the
<br>
subject's attention to the fact that the first string is shorter than
<br>
the others (*)), I know that we are still going to get an interesting
<br>
(but reduced) percentage of people who simply cannot relate the length
<br>
of the string to the probability of getting the string to come up. But
<br>
in that case see my parallel arguments in the other post, which still
<br>
apply.]
<br>
<p>If either of you were actually speaking to a more robust version of the
<br>
above experimental design, when you assessed the implications in your
<br>
comments above, then let me know. If you were, that would have been a
<br>
little sneaky, no?, because that really was not the experimental
<br>
protocol that was quoted, and I, poor fool, have referenced that
<br>
particular protocol in my example and not wasted a day chasing through
<br>
the literature looking for other, more sophisticated versions of the
<br>
design that eliminated ALL of the above issues (never learn, do I? :-)).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Loosemore.
<br>
<p>(*) Make the subject take part in an example session in which a bunch of
<br>
pseudo subjects take different positions (some of them betting on the
<br>
short sequences), and give the subject the opportunity to observe a few
<br>
cases where someone else goes for a short sequence that is identical to
<br>
their own sequence up to that point, but in which the subject doesn't
<br>
get the $25 payout (while of course the other person does) and instead
<br>
have to wait for one more roll of the dice to see if they win. Watch
<br>
their face after that situation comes up (just for fun), and then later
<br>
give them the real test. I bet $25 that after that, the number of
<br>
stupid-irrationals goes down by a factor of two, at least. Maybe even
<br>
eliminate the effect. Doesn't prove a lot, except the sensitivity of the
<br>
experiment to factors other than inherent stupidity - which latter ought
<br>
to be constant, no?
