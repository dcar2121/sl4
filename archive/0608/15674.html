Hi,
<br>
<p>Novamente and LIDA, for instance, are integrative AI architectures
<br>
that were NOT created with any particular application in mind...
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I wouldn't want to emphasize the &quot;hybrid&quot; aspect of
<br>
Novamente too strongly.  The hybrid nature is just a matter of
<br>
convenience.  The design was arrived at by starting top-down and
<br>
figuring out what the requirements are for components of an AGI
<br>
system.  Then, when some existing computer science technology seemed
<br>
like it could be modified and extended to fulfill the requirements for
<br>
one of the components, it was used in this capacity.   OTOH some
<br>
components were not matched by any existing computer science
<br>
technology and needed to be designed from scratch.  So, the hybrid
<br>
nature is just a matter of convenience -- it's not as though we
<br>
started out by saying &quot;hey, let's glue together some current
<br>
technologies&quot;...
<br>
<p>I know that LIDA became a hybrid system via the same approach.  The
<br>
high-level breakdown into components was done first, and then existing
<br>
tech was used to fill out the components where possible.  But LIDA
<br>
really just re-uses existing tech, whereas the components of NM are
<br>
filled-in with our own original tech that was often created by varying
<br>
and significantly improving on existing tech...
<br>
<p>As for &quot;agents&quot;, I find that word to have been used so broadly that I
<br>
never know what it really means anymore ;-)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm generalizing largely on the basis of the architectures I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saw at the AGIRI conference... but would it be fair to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the 2000s the decade of the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; AI?  Up through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the 1990s, you could look at an AI architecture, and say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;It's rule-based/behavior-based/reactive&quot;, or else it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be composed of 2 or 3 cleanly-separated layers, each being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one of those well-known, identifiable architectural genres.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now I find architectures harder to classify.  It seems people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not putting as much emphasis on finding the One True
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unifying Principle to create AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What do you think?
