<p>(Fictional Scenario Follows)
<br>
<p>It's 1965, and a primatologist in Kenya is
<br>
worried. Examining blood samples from chimps,
<br>
he's found a weird virus that seems capable of
<br>
attacking the immune system of infected primates,
<br>
and he has a notion that it could jump to humans
<br>
and cause a devastating epidemic characterized by
<br>
an inability to overcome the most trivial
<br>
infections, leading to a sure death. Nobody but
<br>
half a dozen of his drinking buddies take him
<br>
seriously. A germ, jump species? A germ, attack
<br>
the immune system itself? Everybody knows medical
<br>
science is well on the way to eradicating
<br>
infectious disease. Look at how we wiped out
<br>
smallpox!
<br>
<p>(End Fictional Scenario)
<br>
<p>It wouldn't be very wide of the mark to say that
<br>
Singularitarians, and especially those interested
<br>
in Friendliness, are in the position of an
<br>
anachronistic AIDS researcher in 1965. It's
<br>
believed the virus jumped to humans perhaps a
<br>
decade before that, but it was another decade
<br>
before anyone really noticed; it took a few years
<br>
for AIDS to kill a victim, and it took a few
<br>
years for the number of victims of this
<br>
mysterious malady to become noticeable outside
<br>
Central Africa. I recall the disbelief I felt
<br>
when, around 1981, an ex-nurse I knew angrily
<br>
commented on my friend Zak, a young, promiscuous
<br>
gay. &quot;He's only eighteen!&quot; she said. &quot;That's too
<br>
young to know if you're gay.&quot; (I wasn't sure I
<br>
agreed, but whatever; and in 1981, I doubt you
<br>
would have found an unpromiscuous gay anywhere;
<br>
but I digress.) &quot;And I think he has a deadly
<br>
disease. Those red spots on his face are a
<br>
telltale symptom. If it's what I think it is,
<br>
he's as good as dead. Nobody ever survives!&quot;
<br>
<p>The average person, even the average
<br>
computer-literate person, probably thinks of the
<br>
Singularity just as I did about AIDS in 1981,
<br>
when AIDS didn't even really have a name, and you
<br>
almost had to work in a hospital to have heard of
<br>
it. I didn't say it out loud, but I thought
<br>
&quot;Surely you're exaggerating!&quot; Even then, though,
<br>
I knew enough to file such things away in my
<br>
mind, and watch and wait until I understood. What
<br>
became of Zak? I don't know, I lost touch with
<br>
most of that crowd; but I'd bet he didn't live to
<br>
see 1990.
<br>
<p>For a completely different metaphor, I'm reminded
<br>
of the early, disbelieved tales of mountain men
<br>
describing Yellowstone to people who'd never seen
<br>
a geyser:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.yellowstone.net/history/prepark.htm">http://www.yellowstone.net/history/prepark.htm</a>
<br>
<p>If you're a Singularitarian today, you're one of
<br>
the trailblazers. The crowds aren't here yet.
<br>
There still aren't that many people who have
<br>
really heard of the Singularity, unless they're
<br>
in software or science fiction authors; until a
<br>
few years ago it didn't even really have a name;
<br>
and most lay persons, even now, would think:
<br>
&quot;Surely you're exaggerating!&quot;
