Folks,
<br>
<p>This is definitely descending to the level of &quot;not SL4 worthy&quot;.  More  
<br>
like exi-chat and similar, and possibly not even that.
<br>
<p>Robots are so 1950s and pretty much irrelevant.  If you have genuine  
<br>
AI, you will be able to strap it to any machinery you wish, from a  
<br>
dishwasher to a bad Japanese anime super-robot.  It does not really  
<br>
matter, because that will be the least of our concerns.  But then you  
<br>
knew this -- you *are* on the SL4 list.  Keep it interesting, keep it  
<br>
relevant.
<br>
<p>Trigger happily yours,
<br>
<p>J. Andrew Rogers, SL4 Auxiliary List Sniper
