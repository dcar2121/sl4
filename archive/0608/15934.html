On attempting to reply to this, I hit &quot;Report Spam&quot;.

<p>May I cite the fact that I passed primary school as evidence of my

non-illiteracy and be forgiven my momentary mistake in thinking that

all words starting with &quot;re&quot; mean &quot;reply&quot;?

</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, I've always worried about your apparent eagerness to apply
<br>
dichotomies.  The world is not as Boolean as some people seem to
<br>
imagine.
<br>
<p>Crazy people come up with good ideas.  Often.
<br>
<p>Although reasonably-smart people tend to have fewer personality flaws
<br>
etc than the average, more extreme mental abilities _often_ involve
<br>
increasing divergences from normal, sanish behaviour.  I'm not going
<br>
to try to make a statistical case going this way, I'll work from the
<br>
other side.
<br>
<p>I've been familiar with a lot of inventor-types.  They seem to have a
<br>
characteristic set of behaviours...
<br>
<p>BEGIN STORY
<br>
<p>Great with tinkering.  Love to take things apart and put them back
<br>
together again.  Fabulous with a lot of mechanical issues.  Invariably
<br>
male.
<br>
<p>Generally, these people /aren't/ great with academia, and don't get
<br>
into engineering degrees, thus excluding them from utilising their
<br>
skills appropriately.  Their research abilities often suck.
<br>
<p>Each of them will, at some stage, have a stab at a number of classic
<br>
crackpot problems - like trying to build a perpetual motion machine.
<br>
If they're lucky, they will have enough engineering knowledge to
<br>
realise what they're doing and stop.  If not, they will keep trying
<br>
and trying - obsessing.
<br>
<p>Often after pouring huge amounts of effort into a project, they will
<br>
lie to protect it.
<br>
<p>Now, having worked in Automotive technology for a bit, I am familiar
<br>
with the ideas that get sent to them... there are a huge number of
<br>
ideas for (1) fuel-saving and (2) power-increasing gadgets/engine
<br>
designs...
<br>
<p>Many of these are based on alternative engine designs (Scotch Yoke,
<br>
radial, rotary) or different fuel mixes.
<br>
<p>It is typical for a radically different engine design to be
<br>
demonstrably better than the best known endeavours into the field by
<br>
Qualified Engineers, although because Qualified Engineers gave up on
<br>
that approach 50+ years ago, their prototype is still nowhere near as
<br>
good as a conventional engine.
<br>
<p>Now, another thing about inventors is that they are worried about IP
<br>
protection, and they can't afford patents.  So they will ALWAYS try to
<br>
describe their system as &quot;The problem with the other approach is that
<br>
it doesn't...&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, with an inventor, they have the option of creating a working
<br>
prototype.  This distinguishes the talented crackpots from the
<br>
incompetent ones.  But, due to the problems mentioned above, this is
<br>
generally only a &quot;proof of concept&quot;, and generally doesn't deliver
<br>
tangible benefits over the conventional models.
<br>
<p>At this stage, if they're lucky, an inventor might get someone else to
<br>
listen to them, and they might be able to build a /real/ prototype.
<br>
And here comes a tragedy of success:  After a long period of failing,
<br>
they finally have some real success.  There's proof in others'
<br>
beliefs: the invention works!  The orthodoxy was mistaken!   And so
<br>
begins their ego growth (UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES LET AN INVENTOR AT
<br>
THIS STAGE BE IN CHARGE OF ANY MONEY!!!)  And so the inventor brings
<br>
out their other ideas - their old perpetual motion machine, the other
<br>
inventions, and tries to foist them onto their new benefactor.
<br>
<p>If the benefactor has any sense, they'll say: Shut Up, get back to the
<br>
thing I was interested in.  If not, the operation collapses.
<br>
<p>If this goes well, then comes the real testing etc.  In Automotive,
<br>
this is very expensive.
<br>
<p>...But the conventional engine has been very extensively refined, and
<br>
a lot of things are fine-tuned to work with each other.  Even a good
<br>
new concept will only make a very small improvement... So the inventor
<br>
may claim that the testing is unfair to the product, and may have
<br>
legitimate reasons for why the device doesn't show up as well as it
<br>
&quot;should&quot;
<br>
<p>Furthermore, a lot of the testing relies on statistical
<br>
interpretations, and as a rule, inventors do not understand statistics
<br>
at all... so the inventor may recklessly misinterpret the data
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the established manufacturing companies care a hell of a
<br>
lot more about reliability and durability than performance under
<br>
specific conditions.
<br>
<p>To any of these, the inventor may try to go their own way, get
<br>
paranoid - and given their inflated-by-success ego, it can get very
<br>
ugly.  The path from idea to incorporation in mass production is long,
<br>
expensive, and arduous.  There has to be a shortcut!
<br>
<p>So even with a genuinely, demonstrably beneficial product, there is a
<br>
strong motivation for the inventor to &quot;protect&quot; their investment by
<br>
lying or misleading, which can damage even the best ideas.
<br>
<p>I can think of several decent inventions that got to the stage of
<br>
aftermarket release, only to have the crackpot inventor collapse and
<br>
bankrupt the company - often through misleading with the test data.
<br>
<p>However - and this is the key bit - just because the company collapses
<br>
doesn't mean the idea was a dud.  With any luck, the idea can be
<br>
picked up and developed by Real Engineers, not crackpot Inventors.
<br>
<p><p>END STORY
<br>
<p>Even if someone /is/ a crackpot, their crackpot theories might still
<br>
have something to them.
<br>
<p>Yes, I know that some of us don't have the time to sort through the
<br>
shit for the gold-ore.  (Note the &quot;ore&quot;).
<br>
<p>With Automotive inventors, we can say &quot;build a prototype&quot;, which sorts
<br>
the talented crackpots from the untalented ones.  Unfortunately, with
<br>
AI, there's no easy mechanism.  Readability at least makes some
<br>
crackpots more bearable than others (I quickly stopped bothering with
<br>
Marc's posts not because of content, but because they are too damn
<br>
awkward to read)
<br>
<p>But, seriously, didn't anyone else think about Loosemore: &quot;This guy's
<br>
a nutbag&quot; when he started talking about PARAPSYCHOLOGY?
<br>
<p>Yeah, he might have legit reasons for thinking that the
<br>
school-of-thought is unjustly denigrated.  Give a fuck.  He supported
<br>
something that the establishment lumps together with the toothfairy.
<br>
<p>Why not ban him then?  Because we're so incredibly smart and wise that
<br>
we know that smart people get stupid ideas.  But when Loosemore *shock
<br>
horror* does other crackpot things, he gets banninated.
<br>
<p>Quite frankly, I don't care about any of the other things.  If he, or
<br>
any other crackpot, can put together reasonable, coherent and
<br>
_readable_ theories, that can generally meet the standard criteria for
<br>
scientificness*, then all their crackpottiness does is put my bullshit
<br>
detector on high alert.
<br>
<p>*Falsifiability is a good starting point, but not always necessary (eg: Maths)
<br>
<p>CONCLUSION
<br>
<p>I damn well expect Loosemore to meet the challenge to give literature
<br>
references (even if he has to write them) to this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This impression would be a mistake.  To take just the issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendliness, for example:  there are approaches to this problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that are powerful and viable, but because the list core does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree with them, you might think that they are not feasible, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outright dangerous and irresponsible.  This impression is a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of skewed opinions here, not necessarily a reflection of the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status of those approaches.
</em><br>
<p>I also expect him to elaborate on WHAT tools are required for his approach.
<br>
<p>When (if) he does so, I will forgive him any beliefs he might have in
<br>
the toothfairy or perpetual motion.
<br>
<p>If others interested in AI can't do the same, I think that's a pity.
<br>
