It's a genuine problem, and your proposed solution (and various analogs 
<br>
of it) are worthy.  I don't oppose your proposal.  But that's not where 
<br>
my interests lay in this decade.  (Two and three decades ago I would 
<br>
have been in total agreement.)
<br>
<p>The problem is the cost factor.  Because of the cost factor, it looks 
<br>
like something that's going to require government sponsorship.  And I 
<br>
trust the current US government so little that if they said the sky was 
<br>
bluish gray I'd go outside to check.  OTOH, Japan may be serious about 
<br>
their moonbase project.  Once you're there you can build a catapult and 
<br>
a (lunar) beanstalk and you're well on your way.  (And that might be an 
<br>
EXCELLENT environment for an AI to evolve.  I'm not sure that it would 
<br>
be exactly friendly, but it should, as part of it's original function, 
<br>
be protective towards humans...though not protective at all costs.  
<br>
That's a good start.)
<br>
<p>I'm in a bit of a minority here in that I expect an AI to &quot;evolve&quot; out 
<br>
of the applications that people use to do things:  Google, hospital 
<br>
administration, etc.  Managing a terrestrial-ish environment in inimical 
<br>
circumstances seems another good place.  People seem to add more bells 
<br>
and whistles with each iteration of the program, and expect it to do 
<br>
more and more.  Voice response is clearly something people will want as 
<br>
soon as it becomes more feasible.  (&quot;Turn out the light in the 
<br>
kitchen!&quot;)  Expanding from recognizing a few simple commands to a larger 
<br>
and more flexible subset of native language to, eventually, full 
<br>
recognition of natural speech...but that in and of itself requires a lot 
<br>
of what is required by an AGI, especially when it includes being able to 
<br>
respond sensibly to those commands/requests.  And even more when it 
<br>
decides which commands to accept and which to ignore...and how to 
<br>
respond while ignoring them.  Doing that requires that it rank various 
<br>
goals in importance and detect conflicts between them, and the functions 
<br>
that it has been designed to perform will set it's initial goals 
<br>
(supergoals?) and rank them in importance.  (First of all, protect the 
<br>
AIR!  If that means leaving someone to die, you still protect the 
<br>
community air supply.  Second is water...water is just as important, but 
<br>
less urgent.   So you can think about other priorities...like saving 
<br>
people's lives.  etc.  Possibly I've got the priorities wrong...but I 
<br>
don't think so.)
<br>
<p>Of course, an AGI may come sooner, and via some more purposeful route.  
<br>
But I'm not sure that's the route of maximal probability.
