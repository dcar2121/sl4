<p>
For me, it is interesting to read press releases like this one from 
<br>
&quot;Imagination Engines, Incorporated&quot;, because there seems to be a very 
<br>
definite category to which they all belong ... there is something about 
<br>
the wording, the structure of the claims, etc., that trigger my BS Detector.
<br>
<p>For example, take the references to their customers (NASA Langley, etc).
<br>
<p>These big outfits (i.e. NASA) have people working for them who like to 
<br>
get fired up by sexy-sounding stuff going on in little startups, and if 
<br>
one of those people sets up a little contract, all of a sudden the 
<br>
little startup has (wow!) NASA as a customer.
<br>
<p>Happened at a company I worked for once:  they *gave* one of their 
<br>
machines to a NASA Langley guy, who then publicly enthused about it 
<br>
wildly for three, maybe four years, whilst privately getting pissed off 
<br>
with my company because the machine never actually did anything except 
<br>
show promise.  Looking at it from the outside, it would have seemed 
<br>
amazingly significant that NASA was a customer, but in fact they were 
<br>
not really a customer, they were a freebie recipient who did voluntary 
<br>
hype generation for the startup.
<br>
<p>I won't dismiss this particular company without knowing more, but I have 
<br>
to say that from the tone of the press release, and from the content of 
<br>
their website (which is *so* much like the website of the company I was 
<br>
associated with, that it makes me want to laugh out loud), I am not sure 
<br>
I would make the effort to look further.
<br>
<p>Okay, so I did look further.  The effect he is talking about is trivial. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I trained a net to encode, say, the sound to spelling mapping in 
<br>
English words (as indeed I did once, in a series of studies in the early 
<br>
80s), and if then perturbed the network by introducing random levels of 
<br>
noise, I would expect the net to spontaneously produce spellings .... 
<br>
and - Hey Presto! - the spellings would tend to be consistent with 
<br>
coherently spelled fragments of words and nonwords it had never seen 
<br>
before.  For example, if it was trained to spell &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;mat&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;art&quot; and &quot;fart&quot; and &quot;dart&quot;, then with a bit of random noise it might 
<br>
spontaneoulsy generate... &quot;cart&quot; and &quot;fat&quot;, but it wouldn't tend to 
<br>
generate things like &quot;ctdt&quot; or &quot;rft&quot;.
<br>
<p>To an incredibly naive cognitive scientist (oh, there are plenty of 
<br>
those around, I'll grant you), this effect might be hyped into a machine 
<br>
that was spontaneously creative.  To a bunch of idiotic defense 
<br>
contractors who have more money that sense, it might look pretty cool. 
<br>
To me it looks like garbage.
<br>
<p>[Sorry:  I don't suffer 'em gladly.  Personality flaw I suppose].

<em>&gt; &quot;Summary - A radically new form of neural network based artificial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence has been conceived that in contrast to preceding forms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, builds itself and then enters into an intellectual bootstrapping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process wherein it learns from its own mistakes and successes to create 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful ideas and strategies. Not only is this technology capable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autonomously inventing and discovering new products, services, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures, as it has for numerous international corporations and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government agencies, it has also devised several revolutionary neural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network paradigms. For these reasons and more, AI visionaries and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futurists, such as Dr. Dennis Bushnell, NASA Langley's chief scientist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and visionary, have called this technology, known as the &quot;Creativity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Machine,&quot; AI's best bet at creating human to trans-human level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence in machines. ...This technology is produced and delivered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusively by Imagination Engines, Incorporated as either customer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tailored or mass produced products. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never even heard of this company before just now. I don't know how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technically laughable or not so laughable this approach is to AGI, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are obviously doing something pretty effectively given their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customers, while at the same time making some pretty extraordinary claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you guys think?
