<em>&gt; We could go into this in more detail, but I once costed the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations of a combination software/hardware startup similar to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one that would be involved here.  There were about 40  
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; robotics related.  Remember:  there would be an absolute need to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get peripherals involved (robot manipulators, vision systems,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auditory systems, etc), and that involves both buying and playing  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with expensive hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The burn rate for year one was projected between $16M and $22M.
</em><br>
<p><p>That still seems excessive any way I can figure it, and I've built  
<br>
successful hardware-centric startups before that did far more with  
<br>
far less.  For starters, the requirements for vision, auditory, and  
<br>
similar peripherals falls below the noise floor cost-wise.  There is  
<br>
no justification for anything exotic here.  And the interfacing work  
<br>
for such hardware has already been done.  The part you would actually  
<br>
have to do yourself is the AI part and an entirely trivial amount of  
<br>
glue.
<br>
<p>One of the basic rules of successful startups is that you don't buy  
<br>
anything (hardware, software, people) until there is an immediate,  
<br>
direct, and unavoidable need.  And even then, you buy the minimum you  
<br>
need at the last possible moment because the discount rate is steep.   
<br>
The scenario you outlined above is a *classic* failure pattern for  
<br>
startup organizations, creating resources without well-defined or  
<br>
reasonable purpose.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Don't forget:  I am not talking about some kind of shoestring  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet startup.  I am addressing the issue of really building an  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI.
</em><br>
<p><p>It sounds a bit more like you are addressing the issue of building a  
<br>
nice research lab, which is only indirectly related to the issue of  
<br>
really building an AGI.  A fancy research lab would be *nice*, but  
<br>
not remotely necessary and possibly detrimental to your goal.  Such a  
<br>
well-structured organization will tend to find a lot of resource  
<br>
being spent perpetuating itself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are ways to get results that do not involve making gross  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions at the outset which cripple the project later on.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While it would not be possible to be completely agnostic about the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach, it is quite feasible to be less ideologically committed  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more receptive to what the system data tell you to do.
</em><br>
<p><p>The problem with blue sky research is that everyone can do it (not  
<br>
really, but to the people who actually have money to spend for such  
<br>
things it will seem that way).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; This statement seems a bit baseless and arbitrary.  It might be  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; true, but it is not obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's not get into politics.  It is stupidly obvious to some who do  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of reading and who have a lot of experience.  Let's just  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave it at that.
</em><br>
<p><p>It was not about politics, though thinking that it might be certainly  
<br>
gives some explanation of your assertion.  Granted my experience does  
<br>
not go all the way back to the 1960s, but I have not noticed a  
<br>
substantive change since, say, the early 1990s.  It is a little  
<br>
leaner now I think, but in a *good* way; I saw more pork barrel in  
<br>
the '90s.  It is not in evidence for any projects I am currently  
<br>
involved in, which is why I still doubt your assertion.  But maybe I  
<br>
am in the rarified company of the non-pork R&amp;D projects.  Most of the  
<br>
government people I work with are pleasantly clueful.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I made the comment because I have enough specific goals and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed designs to put a gang of programmers to work within days.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't need a community to tell me exactly what I should be doing,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need a community to DO exactly what I tell them to do, and no  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messing.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; The problems would be:  (a) you would need some kind of central  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization because the hardware would be serious, and could not  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be completely distributed, and (b) the personal attitudes in the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community would be critical, and perhaps not appropriate for the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work to be done:  they couldn't be a collection of mavericks who  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hated the idea of being given chunks of work to do.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; On balance, I think a community approach probably would not work.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it would need a company, and real funding.
</em><br>
<p><p>In other words, an AI startup but with blackjack and hookers.  You  
<br>
could have just said that. :-)
