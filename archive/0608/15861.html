<p>That's absolutely not the idea.  I'd rather have Eliezer spend
<br>
time doing development, not explain the same idea over and over
<br>
again :)
<br>
<p>The main reason I started kernelnewbies was that too many people
<br>
asked me the same questions over and over again.  Putting them
<br>
together in one place and having them help each other made the
<br>
process more educational and more scalable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you seriously suggest that I know less than Eliezer about cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science?
</em><br>
<p>That would be incredibly hard to judge for anyone, since nobody
<br>
appears to have created an artificial general intelligence yet.
<br>
<p>If this were any other science (except perhaps string theory :)),
<br>
people would probably demand an experiment they can reproduce in
<br>
their own lab as support for a theory.  This is a problem when
<br>
one lab has humans for psychology experiments, while the other
<br>
lab only has computers...
<br>
<p>In this case we have cognitive science on one hand, with a lot
<br>
of valid experiments, many of which apply to humans.  On the other
<br>
hand there are AI programmers, who wonder whether the cognitive
<br>
science experiments are relevant to their side of the field.
<br>
<p>Worse still, even once the first AGI has been created, there's
<br>
no easy way to rule out whether there could be other approaches
<br>
to create intelligence.
<br>
<p>Once we have a few AGI instances out there, and we can understand
<br>
how they work, maybe then I could find an objective answer to your 
<br>
question.  To be honest, it wouldn't surprise me if all our current
<br>
ideas about AGI were wrong, otherwise we might have one already.
