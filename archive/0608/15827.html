<p>
Thanks for your response Keith. I'll have to check out one of your books as
<br>
this is a subject that greatly interests me.
<br>
Please allow me to clarify my thinking on this as it appears to differ
<br>
somewhat from yours. You said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's a bit hard to figure out how far back language came into play, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetic clocks on the area of the critical genes might give us a rough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;date.  But certainly written language came too late to have had a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influence on hunter gatherer selected &quot;morality&quot; mechanism genes.  Possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even spoken language came too late.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly you are correct that written language came too late to have any
<br>
significant effect on  the pressures of genetic natural selection which
<br>
formed the human neurological/cognitive architecture. However, as you also
<br>
noted, this architecture is quite plastic.
<br>
My basic supposition is that within the plastic confines of human
<br>
neuro/cognitive architecture societies organize themselves according to
<br>
their needs for production and out of this organization arises a cultural
<br>
ethos that informs the specifics of that culture's morality (usually in the
<br>
form of religion). The variations in social organization account for the
<br>
variations in morality among different human societies and cultures
<br>
throughout the history of human civilization.
<br>
So what I'm trying to say is that since the invention of written language
<br>
man's ability to replicate and transmit memes has been growing
<br>
exponentially. This process of meme transmission and replication with
<br>
variation is identical to technological evolution. The result of all
<br>
technological evolution results in a greater and greater ability for man to
<br>
alter his environment. In the past this has varied greatly from culture to
<br>
culture. This leads me to the conclusion that because there exists
<br>
anthropogenic environmental differences as a result of the differences in
<br>
technological evolution there necessarily also exists different natural
<br>
pressures affecting genetic natural selection (albeit the genetic change
<br>
caused by these environmental differences is no doubt minuscule due to the
<br>
short time frame in question but still probably more significant than most
<br>
are willing to admit).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I wish you would provide some examples where this happened.  I just can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get a grip on what you are saying without examples.  Perhaps from &quot;Guns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Germs and Steel&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>What I'm trying to describe is merely a theory of human history based on the
<br>
interrelationship of memetic and genetic natural selection. As such all of
<br>
human history becomes an example. The gist of what I'm saying is that
<br>
morality and religion are functions of a society's culture. I define a
<br>
society as any group of people independently organized for the purpose of
<br>
economic production, and culture as the conglomeration of memes which allow
<br>
for this coordination of activity. From this perspective it is most
<br>
appropriate (in my estimation) to view societies and their cultures as the
<br>
primary carrier's of memes. Hence the primary actors involved in memetic
<br>
natural selection are societies and it is societies that are more or less
<br>
memetically fit.
<br>
Usually the most memetically fit societies (having the most efficient system
<br>
of economic coordination) begin to expand empires and either subsume or
<br>
eradicate other society's cultures/memes - and sometimes their genes too.
<br>
The most common example of this might be the Spanish conquest of mesoamerica
<br>
but any example of imperial; expansion throughout history will do.
<br>
In sum one might say that before written language human evolution was in a
<br>
system state of divergence but that since then human evolution (both memetic
<br>
and genetic) has been heading for convergence - resulting in globalization
<br>
and eventually technological singularity.
<br>
I think the mental mechanisms that underlie our (flexible) sense of what is
<br>
moral are the result of stone age selection and are not going to be changed
<br>
rapidly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The flexible part comes from environmental conditions.  It is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered moral to steal or murder, but as we saw about a year ago, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only takes a few days before people get hungry enough to steal and not much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more before murder would become common.
</em><br>
<p>This is part of what I'm trying to say. Because morality is a function of
<br>
social organization when social order breaks down many people tend to revert
<br>
to stone age ethics, i.e. do whatever it takes to survive.
<br>
You say that it is not considered moral to steal or murder. I disagree. It
<br>
is only considered immoral to steal or murder within the confines of certain
<br>
circumstances dictated by a given culture. For instance many nomadic tribes
<br>
have organized their respective societies around theft from agricultural
<br>
societies. This form of theft becomes sanctioned by that culture and hence
<br>
it becomes moral for that culture. The ancient Greeks had very strict rules
<br>
about conduct amongst themselves but treated &quot;barbarians&quot; in a manner that
<br>
our culture would find morally reprehensible (such as the practice of
<br>
killing all children and raping all woman when a barbarian village was
<br>
conquered). A modern example might be between the secular west and Islam. It
<br>
goes without saying that much of what passes as moral  in Islam would be
<br>
unthinkable in a secular state (such as the treatment of woman).
<br>
This is why I see morality as primarily a very plastic memetic epiphenomenon
<br>
emerging from the interaction of our inherited neurological architecture
<br>
with various environments. Also, for all of these reasons, i believe that
<br>
human morality has the potential to change rapidly as society rapidly
<br>
evolves - but perhaps this is too optimistic.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The homo-sapien cognitive architecture substrate results from the genetic

<em>&gt; &gt;natural selection comes into play and dominates the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;replication process with the arrival of language (especially written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;language).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a bit hard to figure out how far back language came into play, though

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;However memes cannot remain successful replicators if they do not aid in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the survival of the host's genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True.  Consider Shakers and Mormons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;For this reason memetic fitness is mostly a function of societies and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;persons. A memetically fit cultural ethos is an ethos that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;organize a society so that it can successfully compete against other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;societies for resources. With out a memetically fit ethos (morality) a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;society/culture degenerates and sufferers form being either absorbed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more memetically fit culture or that society/culture will suffer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;memo/genocide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish you would provide some examples where this happened.  I just can't
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In the past more monolithic cultures would label any behaviour that does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not conform to that cultures ethos as &quot;immoral&quot;. And in many cases such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;persons would be put to death for their crimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of our evolution took place before agriculture when &quot;culture&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circulated in the hunger gather band or at most a bunch of related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bands.  If the few remaining examples of hunter gatherer life can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolated to the bulk of human evolution, then while violent death was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common, putting a band member to death for &quot;crime&quot; was rare.  I would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very concept of crime comes way too late to have had much influence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;These facts might lead one to the conclusion that morality both arises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from, and acts upon, genetic evolution. Additionally one might conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that &quot;morality&quot; is in a state of  evolution -constantly changing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;certain memes become more or less fit according to the pressures of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;natural selection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you used the term &quot;political correctness&quot; instead of &quot;morality&quot; I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more likely to agree with you.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the mental mechanisms that underlie our (flexible) sense of what
