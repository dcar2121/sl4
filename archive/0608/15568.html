Phil,
<br>
<p>True innovation is not visible as it is happening -- for example, a
<br>
few years before the date that we now identify as the invention of
<br>
airplanes, telephones, etc., no one would have said that these were
<br>
the recent innovations, even if multiple inventors were competing to
<br>
achieve the same thing; a few decades earlier these were just ideas; a
<br>
few years after the invention these would be considered
<br>
scarcely-functional toys for tinkerers or the wealthy; and only a
<br>
decade or two later could one truly identify the important
<br>
innovations.
<br>
<p>Most great inventions actually take decades to come to fruition, so
<br>
even if you were able to track innivation as it occured, you'd have a
<br>
hard time pinning down one date as the moment of invention.
<br>
<p>With technological acceleration, we can now identify innovation
<br>
faster, but on the other hand there is so much going on that it is
<br>
harder to put a finger on the important ones.
<br>
<p>Joshua
