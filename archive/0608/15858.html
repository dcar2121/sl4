Rik,
<br>
<p>It's Eliezer's list:  you can hardly throw him into a kernelnewbies 
<br>
corner of his own list.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you missed something that I pointed out earlier:  I was awarded 
<br>
a postgraduate degree in cognitive science 19 years ago.  As part of 
<br>
that degree I had to pass exams and write essays on various subjects, 
<br>
including work that covered the field that has been under dispute.  I 
<br>
wrote substantial AI programs and was awarded the first ever Distinction 
<br>
given for that degree, and I read Tversky and Kahneman's &quot;Judgment Under 
<br>
Uncertainty&quot; at a time when Eliezer was probably still in hoping to get 
<br>
into kindergarten.  I subsequently pursued cognitive science as a 
<br>
career, and have publications in that field.
<br>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but did Eliezer take a postgraduate degree in 
<br>
cognitive science at any time?  An undergraduate degree?  Any kind of 
<br>
qualification in that field?
<br>
<p>Do you seriously suggest that I know less than Eliezer about cognitive 
<br>
science?
<br>
<p>Are you, perhaps, a qualified cognitive scientist yourself, that you 
<br>
judged the recent discussion and came to your conclusion below?  If you 
<br>
are, I would welcome your thoughts about some of the issues involved.
<br>
<p>You might want to take off that brown hat first, though.
