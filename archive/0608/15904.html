Heh....
<br>
<p>I'm presently traveling thru Europe, meeting with some interesting
<br>
researchers and doing some deep thinking on how to potentially
<br>
simplify the Novamente design (a topic on which I've had some quite
<br>
useful insights in the last couple days,  I think).
<br>
<p>Meanwhile I log onto the Internet for a quick email check and find
<br>
this rather excessive, sad, and hilarious thread.
<br>
<p>What is somewhat disturbing to me about this thread is that evidently,
<br>
according to my best impression,
<br>
<p>1) Eliezer knows a bunch more about the &quot;heuristics and biases&quot;
<br>
subfield of cognitive psychology than Richard Loosemore does, and (as
<br>
evidenced in some of his writings) he has thought deeply and
<br>
insightfully about the topic
<br>
<p>2) Richard Loosemore knows a bunch more about other aspects of
<br>
cognitive science and cog psych than Eliezer does, for instance mental
<br>
modeling.  This is not so strongly evidenced by Richard's recent posts
<br>
but is clear to me via other emails from Richard and brief in-person
<br>
conversations with Richard
<br>
<p>3) Both of these two humans have a strong interest in AGI and the Singularity
<br>
<p>There is some potential here for people to learn from each other in
<br>
spite of their different theories and different styles of
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p>But, because of the nature of human egos and human emotions, such
<br>
collaborative learning did not happen, instead we had a rather silly
<br>
and overheated discussion, from which hardly anyone learned hardly
<br>
anything, but by which hopefully some onlookers were at least amused
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>I could say some things about the substantive issues that were
<br>
(occasionally) under discussion during this thread, as I have my own
<br>
views that are different than Richard's or Eli's.  But I think I'll
<br>
continue with my travels and cogitations and leave y'all to it :-)
<br>
apparently the thread is over anyway...
