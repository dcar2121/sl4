<em>&gt; I can't say I agree with your position.
</em><br>
<p><p>I can. I think Charles's suggestion looks like the right way to do it.
<br>
<p>I just do not think that lots of little, random projects are going to do
<br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p><p>Bear in mind that he didn't _just_ say support lots of little random
<br>
projects, but also some larger, carefully selected ones. How much would it
<br>
take to fully fund Novamente, for example? Not much. While I don't think it
<br>
has enough depth to be a potential AGI, I do think it's heading in at least
<br>
the right compass direction, and maybe Novamente 3 or 4 somewhere down the
<br>
line might become an AGI.
<br>
<p>I see the need, for example, of sophisticated software tools that
<br>
<em>&gt; would transform the field:  and if I am right about that, then it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never happen because nobody is going to be disciplined enough to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  Too big;  too structured.
</em><br>
<p><p>Existing tools, qua tools, strike me as sufficiently adequate to not be a
<br>
major limiting factor (or perhaps it's more that there isn't much I think
<br>
tools could do here in the first place, compared to what you think they
<br>
could do)... I vaguely think I asked you once before just what you'd want
<br>
said tools to do and you said something like a full reply would take more
<br>
time than you had to spare, which is fair enough - correct me if I'm wrong
<br>
there; but if you do have any particular ideas on that and time to write
<br>
them up, I'd be interested in them.
<br>
<p>Lone hackers we have plenty of.  People with a smattering of knowledge
<br>
<em>&gt; and a passion for coding, we have plenty of.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well we also have a few people with a lot of knowledge, intelligence and
<br>
bright ideas - and sod all money.
<br>
<p>Government does not only fund big outfits with lots of constraints. They
<br>
<em>&gt; also give money to little ones with few constraints.  But they have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceive a direct *need* for the product.  AGI has no purpose except to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take over the world, so   they   wouldn't    really   , uh, be, uh...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested....  8-;
</em><br>
<p><p>This is one of the reasons I think we should move on from the fantasy of AGI
<br>
conquering the world :P Seriously, AGI has a great many purposes - look at
<br>
all the things computers are used for. Now imagine _smart_ computers. That's
<br>
why the American government _did_ fund AGI, back in the 1980s. The reason
<br>
they're not doing it anymore is because they no longer regard it as feasible
<br>
on a reasonable timescale. Changing that opinion will require proof, proof
<br>
will require running code, code will require a lot of work, work will
<br>
require money to live on in the meantime. Solutions to this problem, I alas
<br>
do not have up my sleeve.
