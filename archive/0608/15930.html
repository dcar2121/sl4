<p>
Over the last few days, I was busy preparing for a talk I have just 
<br>
given this afternoon, and so I was not able to attend to events with as 
<br>
much care as I might have wished.  I had to write 8,000 words in three 
<br>
days and that left little eloquence remaining to be used in quieting ruckus.
<br>
<p>If you're a new subscriber, please rest assured that recent events on 
<br>
SL4 are not typical.  I think that this, these events of August 2006, is 
<br>
the worst I can ever recall seeing it.  I hope it does not happen again.
<br>
<p>I suspect that SL4's policies need to be clarified.  In particular, I 
<br>
think that the front page needs to make clear that SL4 is a moderated 
<br>
list, that the moderation is autocratic rather than democratic, that 
<br>
some baby may get thrown out occasionally with the bathwater and this is 
<br>
the cost we all pay, that moderation policies may be criticized all you 
<br>
like but we will go on doing it anyway, that this is the foundation and 
<br>
the price of SL4's existence, and if you don't like it there are plenty 
<br>
of other mailing lists.
<br>
<p>I am also thinking of prominently displaying, under the title of &quot;Whim 
<br>
Death&quot;, a policy notice to the effect that while List Snipers will 
<br>
usually act only for some kind of cause (not that this means that 
<br>
Snipers have to justify themselves, or anything), the List Owner himself 
<br>
reserves the right to ban anyone, at any time, without even giving a 
<br>
reason.  Moreover, the List Owner confesses in advance that all thus 
<br>
banned are blameless, guiltless and virtuous; and the List Owner 
<br>
himself, a fool and a knave; and those thus banned should not feel 
<br>
shamed, but rather, proud of their own thus-demonstrated superiority to 
<br>
the List Owner.  But nonetheless the List Owner reserves the right of 
<br>
Whim Death, and has exercised it in the past, and will exercise it as 
<br>
whim takes him, possibly on you; and this is part of the foundation of 
<br>
SL4, which no one is required to agree with or approve of, but which 
<br>
they should nonetheless be warned of.
<br>
<p>My hope is that if people understand from the beginning that the policy 
<br>
of Whim Death exists, then it will not generate so much acrimony on SL4 
<br>
when I make the decision to ban someone, and not everyone would have 
<br>
made the same decision themselves, if it were their own mailing list.
<br>
<p>Please remember:  No one died.  No one has even been expelled from the 
<br>
entire Internet.  There are other mailing lists.
<br>
<p>This list is, in the end, a party held in my living room.  I surely 
<br>
don't ask you to be grateful for that, or respect me for it, and Heaven 
<br>
forbid that I should ask you to bow before me; but from time to time, I 
<br>
might kick someone out of my living room.  That's life.  (Not death.)
<br>
<p>I am now (a) exhausted and (b) need to get back to studying nonclassical 
<br>
logic.  So say what you like tomorrow, but at midnight, California time, 
<br>
12AM on September 1st, this thread and all related threads cease to exist.
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
Eliezer.
