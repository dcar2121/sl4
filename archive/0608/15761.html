<p><em>&gt; Whoah, hang on there.  You're admitting that &quot;What IQ tests are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _supposed_ to measure&quot; and &quot;The mechanism of intelligence&quot; are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical?
</em><br>
<p>They aren't.  As I said before, the word &quot;intelligence&quot; is ambigious,
<br>
and can mean almost whatever you want it to.  Christians would
<br>
consider us unintelligent because we haven't accepted Jesus and are
<br>
therefore going to Hell.  A driver might consider someone
<br>
unintelligent just because they were cut off by that person on the
<br>
freeway.  Unless you define precisely what you mean by intelligence,
<br>
there's no way we can create a test to measure it.
<br>
<p>IQ measures some useful problem-solving capacity that is a large
<br>
component of &quot;intelligence&quot;, but presumably not the whole thing,
<br>
because as I said, &quot;intelligence&quot; means whatever you want it to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it surprising that problem-solving tests are a good indicator of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job performance where problem-solving is a job component?  Would it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising that ability-to-speak tests were a good indicator of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance in jobs where verbal interaction was necessary?
</em><br>
<p>Not just narrow &quot;problem-solving&quot;.  Ability to follow instructions,
<br>
learn quickly, fill in the pattern from a few cues, see the big
<br>
picture, understand subtleties in social communication, be confident
<br>
in handling complexity, etc.  IQ measurements approximate g
<br>
measurements, which approximates intelligence, which also encompasses
<br>
&quot;wisdom, and self-awareness, and other things that extend into every
<br>
aspect of mind and personality&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be possible to take a set of tests derived from job-specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills, run them through a progressive matrix, and you'd get a test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that looked in some ways similar to an IQ test.
</em><br>
<p>But job skills encompass almost every human ability.  You're acting
<br>
like jobs are some narrow task that the Man made up just to make us
<br>
miserable.  In fact, they're a dynamically evolving superset of human
<br>
activity that includes almost anything productive or personally
<br>
challenging.  It makes sense that there exist jobs that exploit
<br>
practically every human ability.
