</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongest areas?
</em><br>
<p><p>Eurisko: I don't know what's available online, back when I studied it, it
<br>
was when paper was where it was at. But it did things like winning the
<br>
&quot;Traveller Trillion Credit Squadron&quot; war game tournament against human
<br>
experts and producing some interesting results in 3D circuit design. It
<br>
wouldn't have become Skynet anytime soon, but at least it _did_ things.
<br>
<p>Cyc: well it doesn't do anything. Doesn't necessarily mean it's worthless,
<br>
it might be useful as a corpus to some project at some stage, but by itself
<br>
it doesn't do anything much even in the area of giving declarative answers
<br>
to declarative questions.
<br>
<p>Google: well it rocks hard. Real life intelligence amplification. Seriously,
<br>
I've been able to reclaim neurons that used to be devoted to storing facts.
<br>
This wins. Imagine how we'd feel if an AGI project did something like that.
<br>
<p>The task of creating AI does seem very hard, but the task of
<br>
<em>&gt; uploading human intelligence seems doable within a foreseeable time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frame, even if that is at least a few decades away.    Why isn't four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to eight decades soon enough?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Maybe it is. I think that'll be harder than it looks, but like I said, I
<br>
haven't studied that end of things as intensively; I don't feel ready to
<br>
defend a claim that it won't work out in whatever time window is available.
<br>
Let he who thinks it will, by all means prove me wrong!
