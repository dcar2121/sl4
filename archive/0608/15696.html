<br>
The Energy Project
<br>
<p>In 2003 Steorn undertook a project to develop more efficient micro
<br>
generators. Early into this project the company developed certain
<br>
generator configurations that appeared to be over 100% efficient.
<br>
Further investigation and development has led to the company’s current
<br>
technology, a technology that produces free energy. The technology is
<br>
patent pending.
<br>
<p><p><p>Our Technology and the Laws of Physics
<br>
<p>Steorn’s technology produces free, clean and constant energy. This
<br>
provides a significant range of benefits, from the convenience of never
<br>
having to refuel your car or recharge your mobile phone, to a genuine
<br>
solution to the need for zero emission energy production. It also
<br>
provides a secure supply of energy, since the components of the
<br>
technology are readily available.
<br>
<p>The technology is in a constant state of development. The company has
<br>
focused for the past three years on increasing power output and the
<br>
development of test systems that allow detailed analysis to be
<br>
performed.
<br>
<p>Steorn’s technology appears to violate the ‘Principle of the
<br>
Conservation of Energy’, considered by many to be the most fundamental
<br>
principle in our current understanding of the universe. This principle
<br>
is stated simply as ‘energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can
<br>
only change form’.
<br>
<p>Steorn is making three claims for its technology:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The technology has a coefficient of performance greater than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100%.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The operation of the technology (i.e. the creation of energy) is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not derived from the degradation of its component parts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. There is no identifiable environmental source of the energy (as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be witnessed by a cooling of ambient air temperature).
<br>
<p>The sum of these claims is that our technology creates free energy.
<br>
<p>This represents a significant challenge to our current understanding of
<br>
the universe and clearly such claims require independent validation from
<br>
credible third parties. During 2005 Steorn embarked on a process of
<br>
independent validation and approached a wide selection of academic
<br>
institutions. The vast majority of these institutions refused to even
<br>
look at the technology, however several did. Those who were prepared to
<br>
complete testing have all confirmed our claims; however none will
<br>
publicly go on record.
<br>
<p>In early 2006 Steorn decided to seek validation from the scientific
<br>
community in a more public forum, and as a result have published the
<br>
challenge in The Economist. The company is seeking a jury of twelve
<br>
qualified experimental physicists to define the tests required, the test
<br>
centres to be used, monitor the analysis and then publish the results.
<br>
<p>Steorn has decided to publish its challenge in The Economist because of
<br>
the breadth of its readership. &quot;We chose it over a purely scientific
<br>
magazine simply because we want to make the general public aware that
<br>
this process is about to commence and to generate public support,
<br>
awareness, interest etc for what we are doing.&quot;
