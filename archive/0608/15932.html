<em>&gt;     To pretend to be Wise, you must always pretend that both sides have

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     side or another, why then, you would no longer be one of the aloof Wise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     but merely another partisan, on a level with all the other mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     bickerers.  As one of the Wise, you are omnipotent on the condition that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     you never exercise your power.  Otherwise people would start thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     that you were no better than they; and they would no longer hold you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     in awe. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think _I_ fit that stereotype? Or would you agree that even a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cursory glance at my posts confirms that whatever my faults, that does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even reside in their solar system?
</em><br>
<p>My dear sir, all of us pretend, from time to time, and in our own ways,
<br>
to be Wise.  If you look at my elaborate poetic email, I can hardly
<br>
claim to have not been pretending to be Wise.  Truly none of us are
<br>
greater sinners than any other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was obvious to me that the whole flame war was about you and Richard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking past each other, not about either of you trying to put forward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false statements.
</em><br>
<p>It disturbs me that people who do not strike me as obviously stupid,
<br>
cannot tell the difference between myself and Loosemore.  Has Loosemore
<br>
given you the hundredth part of the substance which I have given you, by
<br>
which to judge us and our theories?  Are people *that* susceptible to a
<br>
line of plausible patter about Complex Systems?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the meantime though, my advice for what it's worth is this: I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stunned by the eloquence expended in your post for worse than useless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose. If there's one habit you need to get out of, it's that of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making Intelligence+Charisma rolls _against yourself_.
</em><br>
<p>I should never have told you about the sophisticated arguer effect; it
<br>
transformed you into a sophisticated arguer.
<br>
<p>&quot;You have just made an Intelligence+Charisma roll against yourself&quot; or
<br>
&quot;You have used your intelligence to defeat itself&quot; is a fully generic
<br>
accusation, that can be leveled against anyone, at any time, without
<br>
supporting detail; its sole function is to let you refute those and only
<br>
those ideas which you dislike.
<br>
<p>Please note, for example, the fashion in which I specify how you have
<br>
made yourself a sophisticated arguer, rather than, say, my making a
<br>
generic accusation &quot;Why look, you're Pretending to be Wise&quot;.  Which I 
<br>
actually would consider this a case of, in a different style; that of 
<br>
shaking your head sadly, in a generic way, over how someone has misused 
<br>
their intelligence.  Bearing in mind that speaking poetically is also a 
<br>
form of Pretending to be Wise - the idiom takes more than one form.
