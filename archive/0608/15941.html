<em>&gt; Eliezer, I've always worried about your apparent eagerness to apply
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crazy people come up with good ideas.  Often.
</em><br>
<p>I admit that I'm skeptical of this assertion.  If crazy people - not 
<br>
fun-crazy but unstable-crazy - are needed to come up with good ideas, 
<br>
then the so-called &quot;sane&quot; people are doing something wrong and probably 
<br>
have latched on to a mistaken idea of what sanity is all about, the way 
<br>
many people think that Mr. Spock is a rationality archetype.  For myself 
<br>
I have oft seen gold mistaken for copper, and read of such cases in many 
<br>
books; but I have yet to see a flower grow from genuine gravel.
<br>
<p>If Richard Loosemore ever goes on to produce anything useful, I will 
<br>
stand disproven on one point or another (either crazy people can do 
<br>
useful things, or more likely, I was wrong about him being crazy to 
<br>
begin with).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, seriously, didn't anyone else think about Loosemore: &quot;This guy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nutbag&quot; when he started talking about PARAPSYCHOLOGY? 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Why not ban him then?  Because we're so incredibly smart and wise that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know that smart people get stupid ideas.  But when Loosemore *shock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horror* does other crackpot things, he gets banninated. 
</em><br>
<p>What actually triggered Loosemore's bannination, please note, was when 
<br>
he started claiming expertise in the field of heuristics and biases. 
<br>
Maybe I'm just the victim of an overly rigid Boolean moral dichotomy, 
<br>
but in my book, there's a whole world of difference between the error of 
<br>
assigning an overly high probability to parapsychology (I can think of 
<br>
another prominent SL4 poster who makes the same mistake and I never 
<br>
thought of banning *him*), and the error of claiming to be an expert 
<br>
scientist thoroughly familiar with the experimental and theoretical 
<br>
results of a field that you obviously don't know.
<br>
<p>There are innocent and uninnocent errors.  There are excusable and 
<br>
inexcusable errors.  And maybe, from your own different experiences with 
<br>
the uses of crackpots, it all seems like a continuum of the crazy people 
<br>
who occasionally produce useful devices for automobiles.  Maybe it *is* 
<br>
just part of the continuum of crazy guys who sometimes produce useful 
<br>
things.  Maybe you've just got to put up with occasional lies.  But for 
<br>
myself, I draw a line, nay, a flaming wall of fire, between honest 
<br>
mistakes and dishonesty.
<br>
<p>Likewise if the self-deception and memory-distortion is so great as to 
<br>
amount to the same thing; if Loosemore can convince *himself* that he's 
<br>
always been an experienced expert on heuristics and biases, so that when 
<br>
he says it he honestly believes it, then it's not exactly the same sin 
<br>
but it is close enough.  Nor is this analogous to deceiving yourself 
<br>
about parapsychology, because the &quot;mistake&quot; is directly self-serving and 
<br>
self-inflating, rather than a mistake about an external matter of fact - 
<br>
if you see the distinction I am drawing.
