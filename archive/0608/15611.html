<p><p>Not that the phenomenon is new of course, but the study of it...
<br>
<p>Probably not a very politically correct or easy subject to delve into, yet
<br>
<em>&gt; this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presidents here in the USA who seem to privately believe &quot;A coming

</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unavoidable part of future reality, and not a bad thing because some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Heaven.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>...that's far enough off topic for this list that we're probably going to
<br>
get killthreaded if I answer here, so while I don't have a problem
<br>
discussing it, please reask either on some other forum such as extropy-chat
<br>
or private email if you'd like me to answer.
<br>
<p>I worry that subconscious factors involved with faith-based
<br>
<em>&gt; reality-view belief systems could affect important decision making if one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not superhumanly vigilant in remaining unbiased. Even if it shifts your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priorities by a few percentage points, it might be important. Maybe you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put in those extra 15 minutes a day on your work
</em><br>
<p><p>And thereby have that little margin of time to get sane, get your head out
<br>
of the rut (see Brooks 'The Mythical Man-Month' and McConnell 'Rapid
<br>
Development'), and realize how you were headed in completely the wrong
<br>
direction, and pull back and go in the right direction, and accomplish
<br>
something.
<br>
<p>Point: These things don't necessarily go in the direction intuition says
<br>
they ought to go in, even for writing Excel, let alone AGI.
<br>
<p>The key problem I see with your particular belief system is that rather than
<br>
<em>&gt; providing you with access to important new realizations through acceptance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high likelihood of local failure, it could instead lead you astray by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the end what looks like yet another form of as you say &quot;a need to deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of failure&quot;. Except rather than outright denying it up front,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just moving things around slightly and saying failure in this and many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; localities is ok as long as not everywhere fails - you still apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need in the end to deny to yourself that total failure could occur. So are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really the ultimate pessimist, or are you slyly giving yourself a crutch?
</em><br>
<p><p>Neither: I'm _openly_ explaining how I accidentally came by a useful crutch
<br>
and what the result was. Consider that (real, not metaphorical) crutches
<br>
were invented by some bright spark long enough ago that we don't remember
<br>
it. Did said inventor go &quot;well, obviously it's a good idea for people to
<br>
hobble around awkwardly on their arms so their leg muscles will atrophy&quot;?
<br>
Obviously not: he went, &quot;well there are circumstances in which people's legs
<br>
just won't carry them, here's something to help&quot;. Do you think the human
<br>
mind is just plain capable of being perfectly rational in any and all
<br>
circumstances whatsoever, like the way Superman can swim through lava? If
<br>
so, please point me to a single example among all Earth's six billion.
<br>
<p>The _ultimate_ pessimists are here: <a href="http://www.vhemt.org/">http://www.vhemt.org/</a>
<br>
<p>I'm a pragmatic pessimist. I'm a man with a job to do.
<br>
<p>The possibilities you raise would be issues indeed, if they materialized.
<br>
But look around you, use the empirical method. Who in these parts is
<br>
advocating collective suicide for Earth-descended life, by slowing down the
<br>
research that could save us? Not me.
