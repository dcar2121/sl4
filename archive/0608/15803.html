SUMMARY:  If nothing else, Yudkowsky's hasty reply, below, will serve as 
<br>
an amazing (and often comical) example of how not to demolish an 
<br>
opponent in academic discourse.  This is National Enquirer science. 
<br>
This is the most ugly kind of Tabloid smear, with no actual factual 
<br>
content.  Don't take my word for it:  dip in and enjoy the show!
<br>
<p>I have tried to make my response entertaining, here and there, but the 
<br>
basic story is going to be that Yudkowsky's reply is filled with ad 
<br>
hominem accusations, none of which are supported by evidence.
<br>
<p>Worst of all:  there is no discussion of the actual topic!  All of what 
<br>
Yudkowsky has to say is what he thinks I have or have not read 8-|.  He 
<br>
implies, over and over again, that Loosemore has not read this or that 
<br>
.... but it seems like Loosemore's argument goes straight over 
<br>
Yudkowsky's head, because he doesn't mention it and doesn't refute it. 
<br>
Asonishingly, the argument simply never comes up at all.
<br>
<p>But let's look inside at some of the comic details:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Tuesday.  I was very quickly summarizing an extensive literature with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands of papers.  These are not my ideas, these are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; mainstream conclusions of an experimental science.  Go forth and read 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the literature before you make up your own interpretations.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest starting with &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot; and moving on to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Heuristics and Biases&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You just attacked an argument that has nothing whatsoever to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the claim that I actually made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, let's see.  For one thing, it flatly demonstrates that you're not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar with the literature.  So does your statement here:
</em><br>
<p>Notice that Loosemore's innocuous opening remark  -  &quot;You just attacked 
<br>
an argument that has nothing whatsoever to do with the claim that I 
<br>
actually made.&quot;  -  is met with the comment that this somehow 
<br>
demonstrates that Loosemore has not read the literature.
<br>
<p>Eh?  How can this be so?  How does it follow?  What exactly did 
<br>
Loosemore say in this sentence that demonstrated unfamiliarity with the 
<br>
literature?  Puzzling, to say the least.
<br>
<p>This looks like UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATION NUMBER 1.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Oh, well, let's move on.
<br>
<p>The next passage looks like it comes from Loosemore's main post, but in 
<br>
fact it was taken from a previous post.
<br>
<p>Strangely, Yudkwosky fails to say anything whatsoever about a large 
<br>
chunk of Loosemore's main post (the post he is ostensibly replying to), 
<br>
and the chunk that went missing contained the central argument that 
<br>
Loosemore was trying to make, spelled out in meticulous detail.  For 
<br>
some reason, Yudkowsky has nothing to say about that.  He does not 
<br>
appear to be interested in the topic, only in trying to gather evidence 
<br>
that might be twisted to imply Loosemore's ignorance.
<br>
<p>(WAIT:  Has anyone except me noticed that the only thing that Yudkowsky 
<br>
ever seems to do is try claim that someone has not done enough reading?).
<br>
<p>But anyhow, let's see what Yudkowsky's has to say about that extract 
<br>
from the previous Loosemore post:
<br>
<p>[Loosemore writes:]
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So in the case of the above experiment, I had forgotten the punchline 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the experiment, so I looked at it and did it on the spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hey presto:  my first answer was (2)!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why?  Because, even though I had been primed by all the Conjunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Fallacy stuff in the last week, I completely forgot to notice that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the first string was shorter than the other two (perhaps because all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; RRRR strings misled my eye, in the way that you may, depending on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mail client, have had your own eye misled earlier in this sentence). And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on the other hand I did notice (because I had been primed by the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; relevant information given in the instructions) that there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the three strings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I was also rushing because I felt some urgency to prove to myself that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could polish it off quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Well well well.  I am stupid and irrational, apparently!   And there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is no other explanation for my (or the subjects') behavior:  it really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot be anything except irrational stupidity. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is, simply put, exactly the standard experimental result *and its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard interpretation*: subjects substitute judgment of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representativeness for judgment of probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You noticed differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three strings?  That's called, &quot;judgment by representativeness&quot; or &quot;the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representativeness heuristic&quot;.  In a nutshell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could not possibly fail to recognize this if you had absorbed any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantial amount of literature on heuristics and biases.  It'll be in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first chapters of any work on the subject.
</em><br>
<p>Loosemore's goal, in this part of his previous post, was to introduce an 
<br>
example of one of the heuristics and biasses, as a way to illustrate his 
<br>
central point (which central point, by the way, Yudkowsky still shows no 
<br>
sign of understanding:  he hasn't yet mentioned it).
<br>
<p>But somehow, this example was taken, by Yudkowsy, to be evidence that 
<br>
Loosemore does not know the names of some of the heuristics (in this 
<br>
case, the Representativeness Heuristic).
<br>
<p>The (obvious) reason why Loosemore did not mention things like the 
<br>
heuristic names was that this is all easy stuff, and just not relevant 
<br>
to his point:   too trivial to spell out in what was supposed to be a 
<br>
discussion between two people who are analyzing a technical topic that 
<br>
they both know a good deal about.
<br>
<p>But instead of attending to the topic itself, Yudkowsky seizes on 
<br>
Loosemore's failure to say that this one heuristic is called the 
<br>
&quot;Representativeness Heuristic&quot;, and parades this as conclusive evidence 
<br>
that Loosemore (a) does not know the name of it, and (b) has not read 
<br>
any of the literature.
<br>
<p>How does this follow?  It clearly does not.  Look at the use to which 
<br>
the example was put.  Look at the detailed analysis that Yudkowsky 
<br>
edited out.
<br>
<p>This looks like UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATION NUMBER 2.
<br>
<p>But, hey, the audience is still cool.   All this is just another piece 
<br>
of ad hominem silliness.
<br>
<p>Yudkowsky shows no sign of understanding that Loosemore has been talking 
<br>
very clearly about the difference between [explaining away irrationality 
<br>
as entirely due to heuristics] and [trying to understand whether there 
<br>
might be mechanisms that underlie the observed heuristics].  THAT is the 
<br>
topic, and we are STILL waiting for it to be addressed.
<br>
<p>It begins to look as though this latter point is too subtle for 
<br>
Yudkowsky, even though Loosemore hammers away at it again and again.
<br>
<p>But wait:  here is a good example of Loosemore trying to explain it, in 
<br>
the next segment that Yudkowsky quotes:
<br>
<p>[Loosemore writes:]
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Specifically, there are two interpretations of their role:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1) The interfering mechanisms were just dumb, maladaptive strategies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Basically, systematic biasses and mistakes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2) These other mechanisms were not just systematic biasses, but may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; actually have been components of very powerful, sensible, adaptive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cognitive mechanisms that do not use logical reasoning, and without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which the system as a whole could not function.  A number of people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have arguments that are equal or closely related to this point, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Interpretation (1) is the default assumption in the literature.  To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extent that the literature looked at what was going on in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experiments, it tended to treat the situation as one of rationality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; corrupted by mistakes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The standard approach is that biases can shed light on our actual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning methods, the heuristics, that are producing the mistakes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Judgment by representativeness, like judgment by availability, is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristic that can often produce useful results - some even say a fast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and frugal heuristic - but the heuristic also produces systematic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases, which are what reveal to us that the heuristic exists in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place, and what pin down how the heuristic must be working to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce those specific biases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Loosemore only has minor quibbles with this comment.  But the most 
<br>
important thing here is that THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CLAIM THAT 
<br>
LOOSEMORE HAS BEEN MAKING.  Yudkowsky is just throwing out a few general 
<br>
remarks, not related to anything in particular.... and then, out of the 
<br>
blue, he follows up with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The field that emphasizes the evolutionary rationale of heuristics would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the &quot;fast and frugal&quot; crowd.  (There is no sign that Loosemore is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar with this paradigm, either.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Eh??!
<br>
<p>All of a sudden, he mentions the Fast and Frugal heuristic (which, 
<br>
incidentally, Loosemore is perfectly familiar with, along with all the 
<br>
other heuristics), and WHAM! he decides that because he has not seen 
<br>
Loosemore mention the words &quot;fast and frugal&quot;, he is entitled to deliver 
<br>
the accusation &quot;There is no sign that Loosemore is familiar with this 
<br>
paradigm, either.&quot;
<br>
<p>So Loosemore did not mention the name of something that is not relevant 
<br>
to the claim he made...... and we are supposed to conclude... what??
<br>
<p>This looks like UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATION NUMBER 3.
<br>
<p>And still we wait for some discussion of the actual argument made by 
<br>
Loosemore, in his carefully crafted, detailed post.
<br>
<p>So far, nothing!   The crowd is getting restive ;-)  Will it ever happen?
<br>
<p>Only one big section to go, so maybe the really substantive discussion 
<br>
is going to make a big showing at the last minute ........

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You say that your analysis represents the &quot;mainstream conclusions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an experimental science&quot;.  And you tell me that I should &quot;Go forth and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; read the literature before [I] make up [my] own interpretations&quot;.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think I just made up my own interpretations?  I have had extensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussions about these and other issues with people like Mike 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Oaksford (he and I were at UCNW Bangor together, then at Warwick), and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to a lesser extent with Nick Chater.  I have also benefitted from many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussions with Tom Ormerod, who does experimental work in the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; field.  In 1987 I did an extensive analysis of Phil Johnson-Laird's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; work, and although I never got to challenge him in person, I did talk 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to Alan Garnham, one of his students, and got a great deal of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agreement from him about my understanding of the issues and my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specific criticisms of J-L.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Strangely, Oaksford and Chater disagree with your analysis, as do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Evans and Over.  From my limited understanding of them, Maule and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hodgkinson (2002), and Tetlock and Mellers (2002) would also be in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sympathy with the position I just took.  As would many others that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have talked with over the years, who do not work directly in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; area.  Given all of this, it hardly sounds like you presented the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mainstream conclusions of an experimental science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I sampled two of these names, Mike Oaksford and Phil Johnson-Laird.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't hit any papers in the field of heuristics and biases.  I see no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that they have ever worked in the field of heuristics and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases.  I did see papers on the construction of mental models, which, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you happened to be completely unfamiliar with the field of heuristics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and biases, could be mistaken for information relevant to interpreting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Linda experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Huhh!!?  8-|  These people (Chater and Oaksford, at least) know 
<br>
everything there is to know about the entire field of human reasoning, 
<br>
including the subfield that Yudkowsky refers to as &quot;heuristics and 
<br>
biasses&quot;.   The above paragraph is entirely upside down and backwards: 
<br>
only someone who had a chronically deficient understanding of cognitive 
<br>
psychology would not know the connection between Mental Models and all 
<br>
the various human reasoning studies.
<br>
<p>The reader may want to contrast Yudkowsky's bizarre remarks, above, 
<br>
about Johnson-Laird and Oaksford, with the following excerpts from an 
<br>
elementary textbook of Cognitive Psychology:
<br>
<p>In the chapter on &quot;Reasoning and Deduction&quot; there is an entire section 
<br>
devoted to Mental Models, which starts with the words:
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the most influential approaches to deductive reasoning is the 
<br>
mental model theory of Johnson-Laird (e.g. 1983, 1999).&quot;  (p. 516)
<br>
<p>And the following two recommendations in the Further Reading section at 
<br>
the end of the same chapter, on page 532, where the book's authors only 
<br>
choose seven publications, two of which are by Chater and Oaksford:
<br>
<p>Chater, N., &amp; Oaksford, M. (2001).  Human Rationality and the psychology 
<br>
of reasoning:  Where do we go from here?  British Journal of Psychology, 
<br>
92, 193-216.  &quot;The authors give a very useful overview of theory and 
<br>
research on reasoning.&quot;
<br>
<p>Oaksford, M., &amp; Chater, N. (2001).  The probabilistic approach to human 
<br>
reasoning.  Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, 349-357.  &quot;This article 
<br>
provides a succinct account of the main assumptions of the authors' 
<br>
probabilistic approach.&quot;
<br>
<p>(Excerpts from Eysenck and Keane &quot;Cognitive Psychology:  A Student 
<br>
Handbook&quot;  5th Edition. 2005).
<br>
<p>Nick Chater won the Spearman Medal, Britain's highest honor to a 
<br>
cognitive psychologist, so Yudkowsky's implication that these guys 
<br>
probably don't have much insight into the particular part of the field 
<br>
that he labels &quot;heuristics and biasses&quot; is laughable.
<br>
<p>Oaksford and Chater could eat Yudkowsky for breakfast and still have 
<br>
enough room to wash him down with a few cups of VSOP Darjeeling.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I did, indeed, present the mainstream conclusions of an experimental

2) Loosemore is &quot;not aware of who works in the field and who does not&quot;

3) Loosemore &quot;does not know *which* field I am talking about&quot;.
