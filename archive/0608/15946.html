<p>There were a lot of messages flying back and forth; possibly you missed
<br>
this part, or didn't attribute to it the same significance I did,
<br>
causing it to be fixed in memory.

<em>&gt; This is important, because I *knew* this perfectly well when I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I wrote:  I knew it because I am a cognitive scientist steeped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the experimental and theoretical results of this field, and I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known it for a long time.  When I wrote my words in that first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message, I was generous enough to give Eliezer credit for also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing the field, and so I did not hand-hold him through all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tedious details, assuming that he was smart enough to know them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already.
</em><br>
<p>Now, there have been a *lot* of messages flying back and forth.  And 
<br>
maybe people have lost track.  I doubt that my own mind is tracking 
<br>
everything successfully.  And maybe it feels tempting to stand above the 
<br>
fray and decide that both sides are at fault.  But this particular 
<br>
statement above stands as a definite, verifiable, major untruth; whether 
<br>
arrived at through actual dishonesty, or through extreme self-deception. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this may be publicly verified by anyone who has read e.g. 
<br>
&quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot;, and who reads the above statement of 
<br>
Loosemore alongside his original post &quot;The Conjunction Fallacy Fallacy&quot;.
