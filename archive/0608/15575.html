Sorry, but I was speaking of the viewpoint taken by political leaders.  
<br>
That doesn't totally mean &quot;traditional military&quot;, but it sure has a 
<br>
large component of that.  We can hope that the next turn of the wheel 
<br>
takes place along a different axis, as I don't think we could survive 
<br>
too many military standoffs like the last 50 years  (well, 40 of the 
<br>
last 50 years).  If you want a look at that thinking, look at who in the 
<br>
US is funding robots.  Now look at who in Japan.  See the difference?
