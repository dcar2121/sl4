<em>&gt;Both memetic and genetic natural selection are inextricably interrelated.
</em><br>
<p>You're talking to the guy who was writing about this since the mid 1980s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The homo-sapien cognitive architecture substrate results from the genetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural selection of all human ancestry. This architecture defined the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original social organization (mortality) of our primate forbears. Memetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural selection comes into play and dominates the evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replication process with the arrival of language (especially written 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language).
</em><br>
<p>It's a bit hard to figure out how far back language came into play, though 
<br>
genetic clocks on the area of the critical genes might give us a rough 
<br>
date.  But certainly written language came too late to have had a lot of 
<br>
influence on hunter gatherer selected &quot;morality&quot; mechanism genes.  Possibly 
<br>
even spoken language came too late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However memes cannot remain successful replicators if they do not aid in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the survival of the host's genes.
</em><br>
<p>True.  Consider Shakers and Mormons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For this reason memetic fitness is mostly a function of societies and not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persons. A memetically fit cultural ethos is an ethos that can efficiently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organize a society so that it can successfully compete against other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies for resources. With out a memetically fit ethos (morality) a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society/culture degenerates and sufferers form being either absorbed by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more memetically fit culture or that society/culture will suffer from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memo/genocide.
</em><br>
<p>I wish you would provide some examples where this happened.  I just can't 
<br>
get a grip on what you are saying without examples.  Perhaps from &quot;Guns, 
<br>
Germs and Steel&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the past more monolithic cultures would label any behaviour that does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not conform to that cultures ethos as &quot;immoral&quot;. And in many cases such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persons would be put to death for their crimes.
</em><br>
<p>Most of our evolution took place before agriculture when &quot;culture&quot; 
<br>
circulated in the hunger gather band or at most a bunch of related 
<br>
bands.  If the few remaining examples of hunter gatherer life can be 
<br>
extrapolated to the bulk of human evolution, then while violent death was 
<br>
common, putting a band member to death for &quot;crime&quot; was rare.  I would say 
<br>
the very concept of crime comes way too late to have had much influence on 
<br>
human evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These facts might lead one to the conclusion that morality both arises 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from, and acts upon, genetic evolution. Additionally one might conclude 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that &quot;morality&quot; is in a state of  evolution -constantly changing as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain memes become more or less fit according to the pressures of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>If you used the term &quot;political correctness&quot; instead of &quot;morality&quot; I would 
<br>
be more likely to agree with you.
<br>
<p>I think the mental mechanisms that underlie our (flexible) sense of what is 
<br>
moral are the result of stone age selection and are not going to be changed 
<br>
rapidly.
<br>
<p>The flexible part comes from environmental conditions.  It is not 
<br>
considered moral to steal or murder, but as we saw about a year ago, it 
<br>
only takes a few days before people get hungry enough to steal and not much 
<br>
more before murder would become common.
