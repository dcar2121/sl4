<em>&gt;150 is a very, very high threshold, just beyond the third sigma,
</em><br>
<p>Well, sort of.  Empirically an IQ of 150+ does NOT enable most people to 
<br>
understand SL4 issues *at all* even when instructed.  It's a high threshold 
<br>
by some standards but not by others.  Unfortunately, we don't have any well 
<br>
defined technique for identifying people at a level beyond this, but as I 
<br>
explained on this list a year ago in this post
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0511/12877.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0511/12877.html</a>
<br>
and this one
<br>
<a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0511/12810.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0511/12810.html</a>
<br>
we actually have repeatable methodologies for detecting &quot;propensity for 
<br>
important intellectual accomplishment&quot; at a level higher than that 
<br>
measurable by IQ tests, specifically whatever methodology Cal Tech uses in 
<br>
selecting its student body, a methodology which gives them an IQ 140+ 
<br>
student body without using IQ tests but gives a three times higher incidence 
<br>
of high level intellectual accomplishments than would be predicted from any 
<br>
IQ score.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;only corresponds to 1/1000 of the population.  The difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IQ 150 and IQ 140 is huge, and the difference between IQ 140 and IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;130 is huge.
</em><br>
<p>The articles I linked to in my earlier posts document a roughly 60% increase 
<br>
in probability of high level intellectual accomplishments between an IQ of 
<br>
140 and an IQ of 155, e.g. the 99th and 99.99th percentile.  I would hardly 
<br>
call that huge.  It implies that the vast majority of important intellectual 
<br>
accomplishments will by by people with tested IQ scores below 155.  By 
<br>
contrast, the difference in probability of major intellectual achievement 
<br>
between an IQ of 120 and 130 is so huge that one would be hard pressed to 
<br>
thing of any person with outstanding mental achievements in any field 
<br>
without an IQ of 120, and also so huge that pretty much everyone in the 130+ 
<br>
IQ range is in stark denial of what the mental abilities of most of the 
<br>
population are, to a point which I believe severely impairs their efficacy 
<br>
in many tasks.  The difference between an IQ of 110 and 120 is that between 
<br>
a person who essentiall can and one who essentially cannot learn the 
<br>
scientific world view, math beyond arithmatic, and literacy sufficient to 
<br>
read the higher grade of newspaper or any sort of literature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This is why Eliezer writes about prospective seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programmers, &quot;If we were to try quantifying the level of brainpower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary, our guess is that it's around the 10,000:1 or 100,000:1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level.&quot;  The difference between 160 and 150 could also be huge,
</em><br>
<p>I agree that there are people who show far more mental ability than is 
<br>
predicted by an IQ of 150, but the set of people who show such ability seems 
<br>
empirically to have little overlap with the set of people with IQ scores far 
<br>
above 150.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The idea that IQ doesn't matter &quot;all that much&quot; is among the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frequently repeated myths with the greatest amount of available
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence to demolish it.  The whole &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; thing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pop-psychological nonsense, considered fringe thinking by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mainstream psych community.  IQ matters for social skills.  IQ matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for real-life achievement.  IQ matters for common sense.
</em><br>
<p>For a counter-argument based on actual empirical evidence, see 
<br>
<a href="http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/07/index.html">http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/07/index.html</a>
<br>
The author is using a 10 question vocabulary test as a proxy for IQ, but he 
<br>
is correct in the belief that such a test probably has a g-loading large 
<br>
enough to generalize its results to IQ, though not to transfer its results 
<br>
to IQ.
<br>
I had previously encountered very mixed data on IQ and social skills, 
<br>
including empirical data by g realists who claimed that IQ predicted 
<br>
physical skills better than social skills.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;IQ matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for which people will be able to wrap their brains around what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguing in this post and for which people it will go in one ear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the other.
</em><br>
<p>That's terribly close to ab-hominum.  Also, as I mentioned, untrue.  Lots of 
<br>
people on this list have IQs at the highest levels and can't wrap their 
<br>
brains around the most rudimentary and obvious SL4 conclusions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And by the way, discussions of IQ are most definitely SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Conversations about intelligence and comparisons between intraspecies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and interspecies intelligence differentials make up the core of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument that most people on this list *still* don't understand: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity is about smartness, not technology, and the second you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;build something smarter than you, everything we know flies out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;window.
</em><br>
<p>Well yes, but the sorts of advantage that an AI, even one that was not a 
<br>
superintelligence, would likely have relative to a human don't necessarily 
<br>
closely resemble those a smarter human would have unless the AI is an 
<br>
upload, or at most a neuromorphic AI.  IQ metaphors can be mis-leading.  
<br>
After all, much less intelligent parents routinely manage to keep control 
<br>
over their more intelligent children by virtue of superior knowledge, 
<br>
physical power, social support, etc, for quite a while, a situation entirely 
<br>
unlike that with a UFAI.
