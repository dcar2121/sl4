<em>&gt; To pretend to be Wise, you must always pretend that both sides have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merit, and solemnly refuse to judge between them.  For if you took one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side or another, why then, you would no longer be one of the aloof Wise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but merely another partisan, on a level with all the other mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bickerers.  As one of the Wise, you are omnipotent on the condition that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you never exercise your power.  Otherwise people would start thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you were no better than they; and they would no longer hold you in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awe.
</em><br>
<p><p>Do you think _I_ fit that stereotype? Or would you agree that even a cursory
<br>
glance at my posts confirms that whatever my faults, that does not even
<br>
reside in their solar system?
<br>
<p>It was obvious to me that the whole flame war was about you and Richard
<br>
talking past each other, not about either of you trying to put forward false
<br>
statements. Should I have kept to my style of not looking like a
<br>
fence-sitter by choosing one side and cursing the other? And if so, which
<br>
side? I do not criticize those who saw the merits of one side and therefore
<br>
cursed the other; we necessarily interpret only part of what we see, given
<br>
that our brains are smaller than the universe. But when I did see the whole
<br>
of it, what should I have said?
<br>
<p>One time when we disagreed about a certain fine point of the philosophy of
<br>
Friendliness, I later came back and said, you were right and I was wrong.
<br>
You said, go thou and post a public admission of that on SL4, because apart
<br>
from anything else, being able to make such public admissions is an
<br>
essential mental health exercise for any AGI researcher; it stops you
<br>
attaching your ego too tightly to your current beliefs. Since this statement
<br>
was true, I did so.
<br>
<p>Right now you're obviously not in gear for admitting error even to yourself
<br>
- so it goes; we are mortal men, I've been that way myself. So I won't argue
<br>
further on this topic at this time. SL4's record of fair moderation has been
<br>
broken; I hope sometime you might see your way to fixing it.
<br>
<p>In the meantime though, my advice for what it's worth is this: I was stunned
<br>
by the eloquence expended in your post for worse than useless purpose. If
<br>
there's one habit you need to get out of, it's that of making
<br>
Intelligence+Charisma rolls _against yourself_.
