<p>The few singularitans I've gotten to know in more than just an
<br>
intellectual capacity are not by any means the typical computer
<br>
programmer. They've had a wide diversity of academic and cultural
<br>
interests and seem to seek knowledge in any field just for the thrill
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p>Unusually, I've also discovered a greater percentage of vegans in
<br>
singularitarians than the general populace. Perhaps this is
<br>
heartening, since we understand that if we expect and are going to
<br>
design a superintelligent being to treat us nice (and not eat/exploit
<br>
us) then we should consider what we are doing to animals. Which
<br>
although comparitively stupid are likely to have some degree of
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>(Admittedly I've only had a small sample of individuals to draw these
<br>
conclusions from so take them with a grain of salt, also don't want to
<br>
start a debate on meat eating on list - it was just an observation.
<br>
Feel free to email me if you want to discuss).
