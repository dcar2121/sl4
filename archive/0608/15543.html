I think it's hardly surprising. (a) we're not done yet, and (b) it's not 
<br>
very sensible to presume everything will follow a smooth upward graph.
<br>
<p>I think there is a lot going on behind the scenes with computing 
<br>
infiltrating society to an ever-increasing extent. Even if innovation 
<br>
isn't obvious, I think penetration is unparalleled in this decade.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

<em>&gt;&gt; I'm archiving a bunch of articles from the 1990s, and remembering how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exciting that decade was.  We had a lot of new ideas about AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; architectures, such as situated activity, hybrid architectures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dynamical-systems architectures; not to mention the continuing fallout
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from the 1980s over connectionism and reactive behavior.  We had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reinforcement learning, latent semantic analysis, statistical natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; language processing, wavelets, and hidden Markov models for the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; decent speech recognition.  We had people trying to deal with action
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; selection and attention in cognitive archtectures for the first time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We had functional MRI, brain function localization, and the decoding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of population representations, temporal spike train coding, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chaotic basins of attraction in the brain.  We had decent compression
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for the first time - gzip and MPEG.  We had genetic algorithms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; genetic programming, nonlinear science, self-organizing systems, &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; edge of chaos&quot;, artificial life, virtual reality, the World Wide Web,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Linux and open-source, developed the theory of quantum computers, had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the first nanocomputer designs, solved the first tough problems with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; biocomputers.  We also developed most of the transhumanist ideas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we're still playing with today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I could list a lot of things from the 1980s, also.  But I can't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of much that was kicked off in this decade that's as exciting as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the things I just mentioned from the 1990s.  Support vector
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; machines?  Blogs?  Web services?  Greasemonkey?  Micropayments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Outsourcing?  That's all I can think of at the moment.  Am I getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; old?  Am I out of the loop?  What's going on out there?  I can't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think of any new movements in science fiction from the 2000s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There are some exciting things in other fields - genome sequencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (developed in the 1990s), RNA interference, gene therapy (largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1990s also), microarray protein expression analysis - but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think of much in AI/comp sci/math that excites me lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Perhaps this is because I left the university in 1997 and went to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in industry - but, I never found out about any of those exciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; things from my university classes anyway, so that explanation doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; satisfy me.
