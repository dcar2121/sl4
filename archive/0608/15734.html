<p><p>Only if a company does not know what they are doing.  AI is not

generally considered foundry work.  $10M is a hell of a lot of money  
<br>
for a well-run software startup.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; THE interesting question for me, however, is this:  could a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community based project get its act together to do what NASA did  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for spaceflight, but without government backing?
</em><br>
<p><p>No, because there are no usable metrics for incremental success.   
<br>
Effective communities do not materialize out of thin air.  Even in  
<br>
the rarified atmosphere of this mailing list there is little  
<br>
agreement where it matters with regard to getting things done, and  
<br>
compared to the community at large we would appear to almost be in  
<br>
lockstep.
<br>
<p><p>Community-based AI research is the idea that having a clue is an  
<br>
emergent property of having enough people without a clue in one  
<br>
room.  And I use &quot;emerge&quot; in the &quot;magic happens&quot; sense here.  I would  
<br>
make the observation that most productive AI research seems to be  
<br>
done by people who have shown little interest in community-based AI  
<br>
research, which would suggest that the &quot;community&quot; aspect is quite  
<br>
irrelevant to their progress.  It is not as though there are not  
<br>
plenty of community-based AI research projects in existence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   We would not want governmet backing if we could help it, because  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conditions today are not the same as they were in the 1960s,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I believe that the project would be pork-barrelized today where  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was only partially true back then.
</em><br>
<p><p>This statement seems a bit baseless and arbitrary.  It might be true,  
<br>
but it is not obvious.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'd be prepared to initiate such a project right now if the startup  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds were available, because I believe it could actually work.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And in case I am not being clear, I don't mean just another  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocacy group or think tank, I mean a project to get concrete  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things done.
</em><br>
<p><p>Starting a concrete project requires having a concrete and thorough  
<br>
development plan at the outset or it will be a dead letter.  This  
<br>
sounds like forming a committee that will select the advisory  
<br>
committee to the project planning committee that will decide what the  
<br>
project actually will be doing.  In other words, several steps too  
<br>
early to really expect anyone else to be interested or involved.
<br>
<p>If you need a community to tell you exactly what you should be doing,  
<br>
you might as well give up.  And if you know exactly what it is you  
<br>
should be doing, what is the critical value of the community exactly?
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
