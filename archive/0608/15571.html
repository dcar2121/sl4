<em>&gt; I think we're looking at something completely different... the 90s 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were given by tremendous intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vitality, and tremendous amounts of money and energy being invested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving the race dramatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The millenium has been marked by tremendous backlash; the explosive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth of fundamentalist religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially in the first world nations, a virtual collapse of support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for science and engineering as the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and perhaps only answer to human sustainability, and an overwhelming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggle for those in power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth to hold on to that power and wealth at any cost (up to and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including killing the very goose that lays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the golden eggs.) We seem to be caught up in the lethargy caused by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profound cynicism and resignation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Worse, a lot of really brilliant people are living in/on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope/denial... and we really need to get back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business of growing the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's imperative that we begin at the societal level, and begin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching our children that they are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, and that blazing the way to a bright and powerful tomorrow is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way cooler that playing &quot;Gangsta&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or commiting acts of virtual mayhem on portable game stations (not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the two a necessarily mutually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusive.) Done properly we might begin stemming the tidal wave of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highschool drop outs and college
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failures marking the latest generation of Americans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A failure to do such, bodes poorly for the vision we all so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passionately embrace, and has us looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squarely in the face of a slow and hot spiral into oblivion for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity, and the vast majority of higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life forms currently enjoying the planet.

If you want to see where this happened before, and more seriously, look 
<br>
at the period around 1000 AD.
<br>
<p>OTOH, another thing that's happening is the the US &quot;defeated&quot; all it's 
<br>
rivals and became the unchallenged top dog in it's class.  After which 
<br>
there's no place to go but down.  (And all great thanks to the USSR for 
<br>
allowing us to live through that process.)  As a result the entire US 
<br>
appears to be facing a &quot;failure of vision&quot;.  See some of Charles Stross 
<br>
commentary on that.  Or look at the lists of Hugo winners.  This is 
<br>
going to mean that a lot of the development is moving to other 
<br>
countries.  Other reasons are always given as to why, but I suspect 
<br>
those reasons of being derivative rather than primary.  So what's 
<br>
happening now is that the current top dog is trying to freeze the future 
<br>
into a mirror of the present...and destroying the present in the 
<br>
process.  May we live through this.
<br>
<p>One reason that I think the Singularity, for all it's dangers, may be a 
<br>
good thing is that governments appear to be suicidal.  The promise the 
<br>
ruler infinite power, and then when he gets on top the only possible 
<br>
change in his status is downwards.  Some people are driven crazy by such 
<br>
an event.  Others appear to have been crazy before assuming office. And 
<br>
the &quot;infinite power&quot; is a cheat and an illusion...that they've &quot;sold 
<br>
their soul&quot; for.  Atomic bombs are too dangerous to have in a world run 
<br>
by humans...and humans are still the best we've got.  And atomic bombs 
<br>
aren't the only mega-danger.
<br>
<p>We have with unreasonable fortune escaped the dangers of a truly 
<br>
horrendous cataclysm.  (Look at the Athens vs. Sparta war for a trivial 
<br>
pre-creation...and realize just how lucky we were.)  It's enough to make 
<br>
one believe in the multi-verse.  Our survival past our own follies is so 
<br>
unreasonable.  And like the prisoner's dilemma, there doesn't seem to be 
<br>
a decent answer... yet we are here.  In simulation?  In one branch of 
<br>
the multiverse?  At the whim of the Escaton?  It's folly to postjudge 
<br>
probabilities...but ... at these odds chance seems *such* an improbable 
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>What's going on in the decade is that we are building more and more 
<br>
parallel computers.  We are building faster computers.  We are 
<br>
increasing our disk storage capacity.  Every one of those is becoming 
<br>
cheaper.  We are spreading Free Software based operating systems...which 
<br>
means that at some later date people and others will be able to 
<br>
customize them.  We are improving nano-engineering.  We are starting to 
<br>
build stupid nano-materials.  We are mapping genomes.  We have started 
<br>
mapping proteomes and we are at a beginning of an understanding of 
<br>
epigenetics...which would have been called Lamarkism a decade ago.  I'm 
<br>
sure that there's lots more, but those are off the top of my head.  And 
<br>
if post-judged probabilities are any guide (they aren't...but it sure 
<br>
feels that way) we've got a godhead of some sort ensuring that we'll 
<br>
survive.  At least until *some* goal is reached.
<br>
<p>I don't know how I feel about the possibility of living in a universe 
<br>
where I die as well as live whenever I cross the street...but then I'm 
<br>
not sure how I feel about living in a simulation either, or being a tool 
<br>
for the Escaton.
