About the supposed lameness of the present decade...
<br>
<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p>Well, the early 2000's is when I first created a truly viable design
<br>
for an Artificial General Intelligence ;-)
<br>
<p>Also, among many other things...
<br>
<p>Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, fusing probability theory and
<br>
evolutionary programming, became prominent and practical [spurred by
<br>
Pelikan's PhD thesis]
<br>
<p>Viable automated NL translation via statistical methods became
<br>
possible (due to Google...)
<br>
<p>Real quantum computers have been constructed -- we're up to 12 qubits now
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060508164700.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060508164700.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Evolutionary quantum computers have been designed and simulated (see
<br>
some nice papers by Hugo de Garis; and a book by Lee Spector; and I
<br>
gave a talk on this at a MITRE workshop earlier this year)
<br>
<p>The use of machine learning methods to discover biomarkers became
<br>
viable, and very common (based on SNP data, microarray data, etc.)
<br>
<p>BitTorrent !!!
<br>
<p>I could go on and on but I won't.... There has been plenty of nice
<br>
stuff in the 2000's....  Yes, much of it had its roots in the 90's;
<br>
but much of the stuff you attribute to the 90's had its roots in the
<br>
80's too...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; decent speech recognition.  We had people trying to deal with action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection and attention in cognitive archtectures for the first time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We had functional MRI, brain function localization, and the decoding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of population representations, temporal spike train coding, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chaotic basins of attraction in the brain.  We had decent compression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the first time - gzip and MPEG.  We had genetic algorithms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic programming, nonlinear science, self-organizing systems, &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edge of chaos&quot;, artificial life, virtual reality, the World Wide Web,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linux and open-source, developed the theory of quantum computers, had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first nanocomputer designs, solved the first tough problems with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biocomputers.  We also developed most of the transhumanist ideas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're still playing with today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could list a lot of things from the 1980s, also.  But I can't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of much that was kicked off in this decade that's as exciting as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the things I just mentioned from the 1990s.  Support vector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines?  Blogs?  Web services?  Greasemonkey?  Micropayments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outsourcing?  That's all I can think of at the moment.  Am I getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old?  Am I out of the loop?  What's going on out there?  I can't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of any new movements in science fiction from the 2000s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are some exciting things in other fields - genome sequencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (developed in the 1990s), RNA interference, gene therapy (largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1990s also), microarray protein expression analysis - but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of much in AI/comp sci/math that excites me lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this is because I left the university in 1997 and went to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in industry - but, I never found out about any of those exciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things from my university classes anyway, so that explanation doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy me.
