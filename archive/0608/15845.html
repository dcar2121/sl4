<p>
All,
<br>
<p>My last words in this argument follow.
<br>
<p>This discussion has now become so convoluted and distorted that some of 
<br>
the distortions are developing a life of their own, and the central 
<br>
points are getting lost.
<br>
<p>I want to try to simplify it by looking at only two points:  I am not 
<br>
doing this because I cannot defend anything else, but only, as I say, 
<br>
for the sake of clarity.
<br>
<p>*** NOTE:  Anyone who is bored can just read this prelude:
<br>
<p>I really, really hate to pull rank this, but to Eliezer and to Jeff 
<br>
Medina I ask this question:  do you, either of you, have a postgraduate 
<br>
degree in cognitive science?
<br>
<p>And when you got your postgraduate degree in cognitive science, did the 
<br>
Psychology Department where you got the degree decide that, for the 
<br>
first time in their history, they would have to create a new 
<br>
&quot;Distinction&quot; class, specifically to attach it to your degree?
<br>
<p>No?
<br>
<p>Well goes who did?
<br>
<p>Back in 1987.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>*******************************************************
<br>
Point #1:  Explaining away [sic] the Linda results.
<br>
*******************************************************
<br>
<p>Eliezer has repeatedly said (and Jeff Medina has now echoed this, 
<br>
unfortunately) that what I have done is to make a certain claim, namely 
<br>
that the Linda results can be completely explained by the fact that the 
<br>
subjects in that experiment were simply misunderstanding the 
<br>
instructions.  Here is an example of him saying this:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The referenced paper by Chart does not support Richard's explicit
</em><br>
<em> &gt; assertion that the conjunction fallacy arose from a particular
</em><br>
<em> &gt; misunderstanding by the research subjects (a possibility that was long
</em><br>
<em> &gt; since refuted a million ways from Sunday, see the paper referenced
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in my reply to Medina)........
</em><br>
<p>He has hammered away at this point again and again, and he always 
<br>
follows it with the conclusion that such an idiotic mistake on my part 
<br>
can only mean that I am totally ignorant of the literature.  And he 
<br>
never goes further than this, claiming only that my ignorance is so 
<br>
obvious and so egregious that he does not need to listen to anything 
<br>
else I have to say.
<br>
<p>But the bizarre thing is that from the very first words I wrote in reply 
<br>
to this allegation, I explained that this was NOT what I had claimed, 
<br>
and I then immediately gave a detailed explanation of exactly how my 
<br>
REAL claim differed from the one Eliezer imputed to me (and I also 
<br>
showed that I had been clear about this in my original argument, so if 
<br>
Eliezer had read that argument thoroughly, he should never have 
<br>
misunderstood).
<br>
<p>Let me demonstrate, by citing this part of my first response to 
<br>
Eliezer's attack.  This quotation includes within it some of the text 
<br>
from my original post, where I first made the comments that Eliezer took 
<br>
exception to:
<br>
<p>[Loosemore writes:]
<br>
<em> &gt; You just attacked an argument that has nothing whatsoever to do
</em><br>
<em> &gt; with the claim that I actually made.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The claim that I made was *not*:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (1*)  Tversky and Kahneman (etc.) failed to prove their case that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;       human reasoning behavior is flawed, because there are
</em><br>
<em> &gt;       good alternative explanations that can completely account
</em><br>
<em> &gt;       for all of their data.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In fact, I explicitly disavow this conclusion:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; [Yudkowsky:]
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; In each of these experiments, human psychology fails to follow the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; rules of probability theory.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; [Loosemore:]
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Correct:  because in normal discourse, human psychology is
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; required to carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum cognitive
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; processing than the mere calculation of probabilities.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; People are not very good at doing strict probability calculations,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; because those calculations require mechanisms that have to be trained
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; into them rather carefully, in order to avoid the problem of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; triggering all those other mechanisms, which in the normal course of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; being a thinking creature are actually a lot more useful.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; You will notice that I clearly acknowledge here that human reasoning
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ability is flawed.  I am not challenging this basic point and saying
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that the experimental data supporting it can be explained away.  That
</em><br>
<em> &gt; question (about the validity of claim 1*) was thoroughly addressed by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the literature, and what those studies tried to do was to eliminate
</em><br>
<em> &gt; all the other factors that were contributing to the effects, to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; see if there was any residual effect of pure irrationality.
</em><br>
<p>I hope everyone notices the thing that I marked (in the original) as 
<br>
&quot;claim (1*)&quot; (note that I used the standard asterisk notation for a 
<br>
claim whose validity is repudiated)...... this is the claim that 
<br>
Eliezer, and now Jeff, have imputed to me, and yet there it is, sitting 
<br>
in my post, followed by the words &quot;In fact, I explicitly disavow this 
<br>
conclusion&quot;.
<br>
<p>How much plainer could I have been?  Well, actually, I did try to be 
<br>
even plainer, because I hammered it home again with the words &quot;You will 
<br>
notice that I clearly acknowledge here that human reasoning ability is 
<br>
flawed.  I am not challenging this basic point and saying that the 
<br>
experimental data supporting it can be explained away.&quot;
<br>
<p>I took immense pains, in my text, to say that I was making a far, far 
<br>
more subtle and more interesting point than the trivial one in (1*).
<br>
<p>And in the posts that I have made since then, I have again tried to 
<br>
bring the discussion back to this point and repeat that Eliezer should 
<br>
be addressing the actual argument I made, not the trivial and false one 
<br>
that he claims that I made  -  but to no avail.  He remains completely 
<br>
fixated on this false interpretation, using it to say nothing else 
<br>
except, in effect, &quot;I know you are stupid so I don't have to listen to 
<br>
your arguments.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am especially disappointed that Jeff Medina has now weighed in and 
<br>
repeated the allegation, even though he could see my repeated denials of 
<br>
it.  Jeff:  one of your biggest concerns is with the irresponsibility of 
<br>
people who spout their opinions without bothering to read the relevant 
<br>
evidence, so how could you have missed the fact that I so explicitly 
<br>
rejected this claim you impute to me, back there in the original post. 
<br>
Did *you* read it thoroughly?  And what did you make of it?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>*******************************************************************
<br>
Point #2:  The relationship between &quot;Mental Models&quot; and &quot;Heuristics
<br>
and Biasses&quot;, and what this has to say about Eliezer's competence.
<br>
*******************************************************************
<br>
<p>Something strange happened in the last day or so, and it is a perfect 
<br>
illustration of the fact that Eliezer simply does not understand 
<br>
cognitive science, but only one portion of it.
<br>
<p>I am choosing my words very carefully here, because of course this 
<br>
sounds very much like what he has been saying about me all along. 
<br>
Notice that I have just demonstrated, above, that he based his 
<br>
conclusion about my ignorance solely on a single, oft-repeated 
<br>
allegation that is manifestly false.  What I am going to do now is to 
<br>
show, in a more or less conclusive way, that he really is guilty of 
<br>
being ignorant of what part of cognitive science is what.
<br>
<p>What just happened, in the last day or so, was that Mark Waser used the 
<br>
phrase &quot;mental modeling&quot; and implied that what I was talking about was 
<br>
*that* approach to explaining human reasoning.
<br>
<p>His use of this phrase was ambiguous, but if it was interpreted to mean 
<br>
&quot;cognitive modelling&quot; then it was certainly not completely inaccurate. 
<br>
But it had nuances that I would not necessarily want to buy into.  By 
<br>
itself, not a big deal.
<br>
<p>However, the very similar phrase &quot;Mental Models&quot; had come up in the 
<br>
discussion earlier, in something that was actually a complete sidetrack, 
<br>
so what then happened was that Eliezer (and to some extent Jeff Medina) 
<br>
started to pick up on this and began to make accusations that (a) *I* 
<br>
had claimed that my argument was about &quot;Mental Models&quot;, and that (b) 
<br>
this was clearly another demonstration of my stupidity, because I 
<br>
claimed that Mental Models was a subfield of the Heuristics and Biasses 
<br>
field.
<br>
<p>Here are the relevant quotes:
<br>
<p>[Yudkowsky writes:]
<br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; except insofar as Richard keeps seeming to think modeling is part
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; of the heuristics-and-biases subfield, which it isn't.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
[Mark Waser writes:]
<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Could you give an example of where Richard does this?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Actually, Richard's error is much worse; he thinks
</em><br>
<em> &gt; heuristics-and-biases is a subfield of mental models.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; E.g. Loosemore:  'These people (Chater and Oaksford, at least) know
</em><br>
<em> &gt; everything there is to know about the entire field of human reasoning,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; including the subfield that Yudkowsky refers to as &quot;heuristics and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; biases&quot;.'
</em><br>
<p>[Amazing:  even the quote that he cites does not say that!!]
<br>
<p>and again:
<br>
<p>[Yudkowsky writes:]
<br>
<em> &gt; ... nor Richard's rather huge implicit mistake in thinking
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that heuristics-and-biases is a subset of the field of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mental models ...
</em><br>
<p>and, from Jeff Medina:
<br>
<p>[Jeff Medina writes:]
<br>
<em> &gt;           That's where this aspect of the debate began; Eliezer is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; not trying to steer away from modeling, except insofar as Richard
</em><br>
<em> &gt; keeps seeming to think modeling is part of the heuristics-and-biases
</em><br>
<em> &gt; subfield, which it isn't.
</em><br>
<p>The interested reader can track down the bit where the phrase &quot;mental 
<br>
models came up in the discussion.  I won't elaborate it because it was 
<br>
tedious and trivial, but the basic story is that Eliezer came across the 
<br>
phrase when searching on &quot;Phil Johnson-Laird&quot; and spontaneously made an 
<br>
unprovoked (implicit) allegation about my ignorance:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I sampled two of these names, Mike Oaksford and Phil Johnson-Laird.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I didn't hit any papers in the field of heuristics and biases.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I see no evidence that they have ever worked in the field of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; heuristics and biases.  I did see papers on the construction
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of mental models, which, if you happened to be completely
</em><br>
<em> &gt; unfamiliar with the field of heuristics and biases, could be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mistaken for information relevant to interpreting the Linda
</em><br>
<em> &gt; experiment.
</em><br>
<p>So, did I make actually say that &quot;heuristics and biasses&quot; is a subfield 
<br>
of &quot;mental models&quot;?
<br>
<p>The only thing I ever said about mental models was this, in direct 
<br>
response to Eliezer's out-of-the-blue mention of the phrase, above:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; only someone who had a chronically deficient understanding of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cognitive psychology would not know the connection between
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Mental Models and all the various human reasoning studies.
</em><br>
<p>I then added that MM was a substantial component of the field of human 
<br>
reasoning, and that Phil Johnson-Laird's name was not one to be 
<br>
dismissed casually, the way Eliezer had tried to do.
<br>
<p>My conclusion from this stuff about MM?
<br>
<p>The first conclusion is just the same boring old story:  I did not, as 
<br>
you can see, make the claims that are now being repeated in an attempt 
<br>
to convict me of ignorance.  Not even slightly.
<br>
<p>The second conclusion is far, far more interesting.  Eliezer has now 
<br>
also made a direct statement about the term &quot;mental models&quot; that shows 
<br>
that his understanding of how this relates to human reasoning was gotten 
<br>
from a quick Google search, not from actual understanding of cognitive 
<br>
psychology:
<br>
<p>[Yudkowsky writes:]
<br>
<em> &gt; The people who write research papers about mental models, are not in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; general the same people who write research papers about heuristics and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; biases, although they do talk to each other and read the other field's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; classic papers.  Still, someone who doesn't work professionally in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; field of mental models, yet does know something about the theory of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mental models, may not know anything about the theory of heuristics
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and biases.  And I am informing you, flatly, that you don't.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Any audience members can either trust me on this, or google &quot;Mental
</em><br>
<em> &gt; models&quot; followed by &quot;Heuristics and biases&quot;.  There's obvious
</em><br>
<em> &gt; relevance of one field to the other, but they are very different
</em><br>
<em> &gt; fields in practice - even as to the kind of daily work carried out by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the practitioners - and cursory reading in both fields will
</em><br>
<em> &gt; confirm this.
</em><br>
<p>Let me spell it out in nice, simple language:  the general term &quot;mental 
<br>
models&quot; will come up all over the place if you google it, and to an 
<br>
outside observer like Eliezer, it might seem that there is little 
<br>
overlap between this and &quot;heuristics and biasses&quot;.
<br>
<p>But the specific term &quot;Mental Models&quot; would mean something more to a 
<br>
person who did research in human reasoning:  such a person would say 
<br>
&quot;Oh, you mean Phil Johnson-Laird's book called &quot;Mental Models&quot;?  Yeah, 
<br>
that was one of the big, influential attempts to explain human reasoning 
<br>
by something other than a pure formal-logic reasoning system.  What he 
<br>
tried to do was argue that people solved reasoning problems by a 
<br>
something that might be called a heuristic:  by constructing a mental 
<br>
model and manipulating it.&quot;
<br>
<p>That person might be inclined to say a whole lot more about that book 
<br>
(and I MYSELF DID, WHEN I WROTE A CRITICAL ESSAY ABOUT IT IN 1987), but 
<br>
you might interrupt them and say &quot;So is it possible that a person who 
<br>
knew something about Johnson-Laird's Mental Models may not know 
<br>
*anything* about the theory of heuristics and biases.&quot;
<br>
<p>To which their reply would be:  &quot;Not unless they wanted to flunk their 
<br>
Cognitive Psychology 101 course!&quot;.  Nobody but a complete fool could 
<br>
claim to have a student-level understanding of Mental Models, and Human 
<br>
Reasoning, without also knowing about Heuristics and Biasses.  They are 
<br>
all three taught in the same course.  They are in the same chapter of 
<br>
the basic text in Cognitive Psychology.
<br>
<p>So could someone say that &quot;There's obvious relevance of one field to the 
<br>
other, but they are very different fields in practice&quot;?
<br>
<p>Well, no, they are just different parts of the general topic of human 
<br>
reasoning studies.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, if you had to actually look up Phil Johnson-Laird's name to 
<br>
find out who he was, and if, when you did that, you came across the 
<br>
phrase &quot;Mental Models&quot; for the first time, then how the hell can you 
<br>
claim to know anything about cognitive science?
<br>
<p>And how dare you make these kinds of accusations:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; At this point you're matching one of the classic crank patterns, of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; someone who becomes acquainted with a tiny fraction of scientific
</em><br>
<em> &gt; knowledge, and who then decides that this science is so amazingly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wonderful that it must be relevant to everything.
</em><br>
<p>... in the face of your own manifest commission of exactly this pattern?
