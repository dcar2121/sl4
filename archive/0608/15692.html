<em>&gt; Please, please, please at least skim this paper:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea that IQ doesn't matter &quot;all that much&quot; is among the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequently repeated myths with the greatest amount of available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence to demolish it.
</em><br>
<p>What this paper argues, regarding high IQ, is that having an IQ over
<br>
120-125 is good because it allows one to qualify for any job one
<br>
desires no matter how complex....
<br>
<p>It does seem to argue fairly convincingly that IQ is useful for
<br>
generally categorizing people into &quot;smart vs. average vs. dumb&quot; in a
<br>
way that is relevant to pragmatic performance in careers in our
<br>
society.
<br>
<p>But this does not address the question at hand, which is whether IQ is
<br>
any use for distinguishing among folks with IQs way above 125, in a
<br>
way that is relevant to pragmatic performance on very difficult
<br>
intellectual tasks.
<br>
<p>Anecdotally, it seems to me that folks with very high IQs (160+, 180+,
<br>
whatever) have a particular capability for rapid logical
<br>
problem-solving which is certainly very useful for solving very
<br>
difficult intellectual tasks --- but is far from the only capability
<br>
that is useful for solving very difficult intellectual tasks.
<br>
Someone with 120+ IQ but a relatively weak ability for rapid logical
<br>
problem-solving, may not score 160+ on the IQ test, but may excel
<br>
intellectually via a combination of quick, broad-minded creativity
<br>
plus a strong ability for SLOW logical problem-solving (something that
<br>
does not show up on an IQ test).  There is a lot of diversity among
<br>
peoples' cognitive mechanisms.
<br>
<p>I have a very high IQ (based on childhood, psychologist-administered
<br>
tests) and went to a couple meetings of a high-IQ society once, many
<br>
years ago.  That experience was enough to convince me that high IQ is
<br>
not any kind of guarantee of having really powerfully useful cognitive
<br>
habits and abilities.  Being clever at solving logic puzzles fast does
<br>
NOT mean you have the right cognitive machinery for solving really
<br>
hard intellectual problems.
<br>
