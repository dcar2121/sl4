<em>&gt; But now the question is WHY is what you say true? One reason certainly is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; think there is a deeper reason. I would find it mind boggling astounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, the most complex thing in the universe, could be described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a simple scalar. At the very least I think you'd need a vector, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a tensor of somewhat less than trivial intricacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>At a guess, it might be a case of the general version of Amdahl's law: If X
<br>
was 20% of the limiting factor in the first place, then an infinite
<br>
improvement in X only gets you 20% overall improvement.
<br>
<p>Suppose for a given task there's a list of requirements to get it done, and
<br>
raw brainpower is one of them, and IQ is a good measure of brainpower. Then:
<br>
<p>If you were low on IQ in the first place, more makes a big difference to
<br>
your chances.
<br>
Once you have a decent amount, it becomes more probable that other items on
<br>
the list are the limiting factor, therefore less probable that a further IQ
<br>
boost will make the difference.
<br>
<p>Candidates for other factors:
<br>
Mathematics: being comfortable with very long towers of abstraction, far
<br>
removed from usual intuition. (Guesswork; I'm suggesting a possible reason
<br>
why I personally am not a great mathematician :))
<br>
Programming: Desire to learn. If you would be a great programmer, learn at
<br>
least ten different programming languages. If that strikes you as long toil
<br>
with no gain, programming mightn't appeal to you.
<br>
AI: Be able to build intricate towers of reasoning; then be willing to tear
<br>
everything you believed down to bedrock and start over. And over, and over,
<br>
and over, accepting that each time you pay that price, you converge only a
<br>
little on the truth. So it won't be the last time.
<br>
Writing: Have an intuition for what works, a feeling for language and the
<br>
human mind. Be willing to learn what you don't know to write about. Write a
<br>
million words to throw away. Dodge the Brain Eater.
<br>
Business: Be able to make correct decisions fast, and stick by them - and
<br>
then backtrack and say &quot;crap, nevermind that, this way instead&quot; when you're
<br>
heading for a rock.
<br>
Politics: Charisma... well duh :) Apart from that, I can't say.
<br>
Pilot: Situational awareness. That's a very distinct talent by itself.
<br>
<p>...other examples welcome.
