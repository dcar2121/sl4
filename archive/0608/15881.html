A very powerful AI isn't the definition of the Singularity, but it's one 
<br>
route to it.  Probably the most likely.
<br>
The Singularity doesn't imply a continuously increasing rate of change 
<br>
for all time.  It does imply the the rate of change increases to a very 
<br>
high level (relative to today) at some point.  Probably 1,000 times the 
<br>
current rate of change would be effectively a singularity as far as 
<br>
humans were concerned.  Nobody can really predict what things are like 
<br>
on the other side of the &quot;Schwartschild radius&quot; analog, so no firm 
<br>
beliefs are reasonable.  Perhaps we all revert to the stone age and 
<br>
start over.  You just can't say.  That's not how we normally predict, 
<br>
but the very definition of &quot;The Singularity&quot; implies that we can't make 
<br>
reasonable predictions&quot;
<br>
<p>What we CAN do is attempt to establish what we hope will be favorable 
<br>
initial conditions.  We don't know whether it's chaotic or not, so there 
<br>
are lots of different approaches.  Friendliness is one reasonable 
<br>
approach.  I personally believe that attempts should be made with 
<br>
several slightly differing definitions of Friendliness in the hope of 
<br>
creating attractors if the process should turn out to be chaotic.
<br>
<p>I also believe the entire process is extremely dangerous.  Just not as 
<br>
dangerous as leaving the world in the charge of maniacs who think that 
<br>
being a bully with an H-bomb and an army is a great idea.  (Also I don't 
<br>
see any feasible way of avoiding the singularity, so the best we can do 
<br>
is try for the best outcome.  Many others are more optimistic.)
