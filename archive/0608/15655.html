<em>&gt; I've done some thinking about this.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first conclusion I came to is that the morality of an action has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the amount that it changes the integral of some Value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function over all space at t=infinity. If you give me any moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, I can give you a Value function like this that would describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>I can appreciate what you're intuiting here, but have you considered
<br>
the importance of context?  Real moral decisions are always made under
<br>
conditions of relative uncertainty.  As the context of awareness of
<br>
the extended consequences increases, so will there be increasing
<br>
agreement as to the morality (goodness) of an action, until with
<br>
complete objectivity (unattainable) there would be no moral issue at
<br>
all since the most effective choice of action would be obvious.  Also
<br>
have you considered that real moral decisions must increasingly
<br>
discount the future due to increasing uncertainty and thus decreasing
<br>
control over extended consequences?
<br>
<p>This also leads to why effective moral decision-making must be based
<br>
on best-known principles of what works, rather than directly on
<br>
desired outcomes.
<br>
<p>BTW, it's often useful to consider trends that approach infinity, but
<br>
useless to talk about conditions &quot;at infinity&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The second thing is that for morality to be objective (and I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is; the idea that morality is just up in the air seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like people just aren't trying hard enough) the Value function must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a physically measurable quantity.
</em><br>
<p>Consider that outcomes can certainly be measured against expectations
<br>
but that ultimately the question of perceived goodness is assessed by
<br>
agents within a limited (subjective) context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Next there is the idea that the Value of an object is in tow parts:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the intrinsic Value, and the derived Value. The intrinsic value is is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the Value of the matter in the object existing and being in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular configuration.
</em><br>
<p>What is the value of a gram of gold to an investor, a jeweler, a
<br>
lonely dying man?
<br>
What was the value of the physical object called the Declaration of
<br>
Independence to the American colonies, to the British?
<br>
Again, value is always dependent on context (subjective.)
