<br>
<p>BEGIN BLABBER HERE
<br>
<p>OK, firstly, I'm not talking about &quot;need&quot; in any of the weird economic
<br>
senses, or in the sense on penury.  I'm talking about the usual sense
<br>
of &quot;I need X&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm also not talking about the abuse of the term, as in when a kid
<br>
realises that by substituting &quot;need&quot; for &quot;want&quot; they get a higher
<br>
success rate with their demands. I do not assert that &quot;wants&quot; must be
<br>
transitive, although I /suspect/ they must be.
<br>
<p>I'd define &quot;need&quot; the verb simply as &quot;to require or to be necessary&quot;
<br>
and I assert that the is sometimes suppressed clause effectively
<br>
tacked on to the end: &quot;to be or to do something&quot;.  Similarly, the noun
<br>
is &quot;a requirement for something&quot;, and i assert that the requirement
<br>
for that something indicates that the something is required /for/ a
<br>
purpose.
<br>
<p>OK, so &quot;need&quot; is similar to &quot;necessary&quot;.  There's a strict, /logical/
<br>
use of the term &quot;necessary&quot;, when discussing &quot;necessary and sufficient
<br>
conditions&quot;.   Neccesary conditions must be necessary for something -
<br>
you can't have an antecedent without a consequent.  Can't and must...
<br>
Grarh!
<br>
<p>Now, one might notice that when one starts to talk about necessity and
<br>
necessary things, it immediately starts to look like one of those
<br>
poorly dressed up ontological-arguments-for-the-existence-of-god.  If
<br>
you've ever read, say, Bertrand Russell's debating with his religious
<br>
contemporaries about necessary and contingent beings, you'd understand
<br>
the intense desire to scream that such quibbling can bring.  Anyway...
<br>
<p>Such definitions as I provided, although possibly accurate, are
<br>
clearly not particularly helpful, in the same way that defining &quot;the&quot;
<br>
to be &quot;the definite article&quot; doesn't really help anyone understand the
<br>
meaning of &quot;the&quot;.
<br>
<p>Let's sidestep this by discussing the real ways people use the term:
<br>
<p>1) &quot;I need X &quot;; &quot;I need Money&quot;
<br>
2) &quot;I need to call my sister for her birthday&quot;
<br>
3) &quot;I need to go&quot; &quot;I need to pay my taxes&quot; &quot;I need to drink&quot;
<br>
4) &quot;I have need of a new coat&quot;
<br>
5) &quot;Need for vengeance&quot;
<br>
6) &quot;No need to be frightened&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm not talking about any of the following:
<br>
2 is really saying that one feels a moral obligation - or else a
<br>
requirement to do something in order to avoid an unwanted consequence.
<br>
4 is about a noticeable lack of something - but this is about an
<br>
unfulfilled desire
<br>
6 is a funny one.  In the negative, it indicates that the current
<br>
situation is only one of many possible situations, and doesn't seem to
<br>
mean the same thing at all in the positive.
<br>
<p>The others are about the perception of necessity for an item, an
<br>
entity, or an action.  And my contention is that any such &quot;need&quot; is
<br>
really a &quot;need... in order to...&quot;.  How can I make such a
<br>
generalisation?  Well...
<br>
<p>&quot;Humans need the following: food, air, water, shelter from the
<br>
elements&quot; is really shorthand for &quot;Humans need food etc _in order to
<br>
live_&quot;
<br>
<p>Maslow's hierarchy of needs are a list of things needed _for_ self
<br>
actualisation.  Self actualisation was considered by Maslow to be an
<br>
intrinsic drive to be the best one could be.  This is like saying that
<br>
self-actualisation is a native supergoal.  Is the need for
<br>
self-actualisation a logically necessary part of being a human?  I
<br>
think it far more accurate to say that humans, by default, want to
<br>
self-actualise.
<br>
<p>As for the need for money, the need for yummy food - these are all
<br>
means to an end; the end being pleasure.
<br>
<p>(It's amazing how quickly philosobabble can sink into bullshit sometimes... )
<br>
<p>END BLABBER
<br>
<p>No, I can't adequately define &quot;need&quot; in order to demonstrate my
<br>
assertion.  Can you please provide a single counterexample?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
