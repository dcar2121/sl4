I think that IQ tests do a fairly good job in identifying which decile of 
<br>
the population a person fits into.  The better tests are essentially never 
<br>
going to put a person into any decile that is not appropriate, althought 
<br>
they will not identify highly capable people with learning disabilities 
<br>
(Neils Bohr, for instance) or with fairly narrow forms of genius 
<br>
(surprisingly few of these.  According to Howard Gardner, primary advocate 
<br>
of &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; the population in the top decile of IQ basically 
<br>
includes almost everyone with prominant talent in any of his 
<br>
&quot;intelligences&quot;.  Mohommed Ali probably counts though, not just as a boxer 
<br>
but as a source of pithy sayings, but he may have thrown his IQ test).  Even 
<br>
George W Bush tested in the top decile 
<br>

<br>
(the link also highlights limitations of IQ tests in distinguishing within 
<br>
the top decile)
<br>
<p>I think that IQ tests distinguish meaningfully, though not highly 
<br>
accurately, up to about the 98th percentile.  The Terman study placed both 
<br>
Nobelists in the cohort in the 98th percentile.
<br>
<p>Your sense that it is impossible to loose points primarily reflects your 
<br>
failure to accurately model the abilities of ordinary people.
<br>
<p>It is, however, a shame that we don't seem to have any better metrics for 
<br>
predicting very important mental achievements.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I recently took an IQ test - unfortunately, it was to help someone in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;training, and so they couldn't tell me what my score was - but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were hundreds of questions, and maybe 3 of them required thought, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the only part of the test on which it seemed possible to lose points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a speed-test in copying figures which seemed to have nothing to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with intelligence.  There were some obvious problems and cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biases with the questions, despite the fact that the test has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refined over many years by many psychologists.  (I think it was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WAIS.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) IQ tests are designed for placing people into one of 3 categories:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;below average, average, or above average.  They are neither designed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nor able, to distinguish between 2 sigma and 3 sigma above average.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) If a person whose IQ &quot;should&quot; be 180 takes one of these tests, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gives an answer different from the one that is considered correct, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trust the answer of the 180-IQ test-taker more than that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;test-makers.  The presence of any ambiguous questions containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subtleties that the test designers were not aware of, means that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most-intelligence test-takers will not have the highest scores.
</em><br>
