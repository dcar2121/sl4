<p>Whoah, hang on there.  You're admitting that &quot;What IQ tests are
<br>
_supposed_ to measure&quot; and &quot;The mechanism of intelligence&quot; are not
<br>
identical?
<br>
<p>In other words - the &quot;general intelligence factor&quot; in humans is not
<br>
necessarily the same as the &quot;thingamy&quot; (mechanism) that is
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>So, you've pretty much admitted that IQ tests aren't necessarily
<br>
supposed to measure general-intelligence.
<br>
<p>(From other arguments not raised, it's unambiguous that IQ tests don't
<br>
directly measure general-intelligence, they just measure things that
<br>
correspond to particular intelligence-related skills, and therefore 1.
<br>
indicate nothing about whether there is a &quot;general intelligence&quot; in
<br>
humans (&quot;Reification&quot;), and 2. if there is &quot;general-intelligence&quot; in
<br>
humans, they only measure it indirectly.)
<br>
<p>Now, L Gottfredson, Sandberg and others are claiming that the
<br>
coefficient* of a number of different tests correlate, and are a good
<br>
indicator of, job performance in most jobs, and the likelihood of a
<br>
human to &quot;do well&quot; in society by a number of criteria.  (Note that
<br>
some of the criteria are heavily culturally biased - I'd personally
<br>
view {children born in wedlock} as as much of a failing as {children
<br>
born out of wedlock}, as to me, wedlock is usually a symbol of the
<br>
triumph of hope over reason.)
<br>
<p>*coefficient is not quite the right word, but nor is quotient.
<br>
<p>Gottfredson admits that although &quot;g&quot; - by which I /presume/ she means
<br>
&quot;IQ test scores&quot; - has a strong correlation with job performance, that
<br>
other metrics are better indicators of job-specific job performance
<br>
(eg: manual dexterity in certain manual jobs).
<br>
<p>Is it surprising that problem-solving tests are a good indicator of
<br>
job performance where problem-solving is a job component?  Would it be
<br>
surprising that ability-to-speak tests were a good indicator of
<br>
performance in jobs where verbal interaction was necessary?
<br>
<p>Even abilities that aren't directly used in a job will have certain
<br>
correspondence with job-performance metrics.  Ability to juggle will
<br>
generally indicate lack of brain damage, completeness of the hands,
<br>
good eyesight etc.  Consequently, I would expect a positive-yet-weak
<br>
correspondence between chemistry-lab-tech performance and juggling
<br>
ability.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>It would be possible to take a set of tests derived from job-specific
<br>
skills, run them through a progressive matrix, and you'd get a test
<br>
that looked in some ways similar to an IQ test.
<br>
<p>I'd bet good money that this &quot;Job-Quotient&quot; test would have a much
<br>
stronger correlation to job performance than an IQ test.  Furthermore,
<br>
with this &quot;JQ&quot; test, you wouldn't have people complaining about
<br>
cultural bias etc, because any bias would only reflect the biases of
<br>
the world of employment.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Anyway, as I've said before (perhaps not here): There may be such a
<br>
thing as general-intelligence, but IQ-tests as they stand are only
<br>
loosely correlated with it.
<br>
<p>General-Intelligence does not require symbol-use.
<br>
General-Intelligence does not require language use.  A high level of
<br>
General-Intelligence does not imply knowing which spoon one uses for
<br>
dessert, and which for soup.
<br>
<p>Although General-Intelligence can be used to figure out spatial
<br>
problems, a complex problem like chucking a stick at a moving target
<br>
in an environment of obstacles would require a fair chunk of GI to
<br>
tackle successfully.  Humans DON'T use General-Intelligence for such
<br>
tasks, we use specialised visual modules to deal with them.
<br>
<p>Now, the functionality of one &quot;brain module&quot; is going to be correlated
<br>
with the functionality of another.  Malnutrition will damage auditory
<br>
function as it damages visual function.  Brain health is also
<br>
vicarious.
<br>
<p><pre>

IQ tests are &quot;a Load of Crap&quot; not because they are inconsistent (they
aren't), not because they don't measure something (they do), not
because they are unimportant (they are important), not because they
are useless (they are useful).
IQ tests are a Load of Crap because they don't measure what they claim to.
