<em>&gt; I am going to be extremely careful, and by being that careful I am going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to show that you are making THE MOST INCREDIBLE MISTAKE in what you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below. [capitalization added]
</em><br>
<p>This is a good example of the sort of grandiose, sloppy language you often use,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Weak Claim:  The Linda results can be explained away (i.e. they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanish completely) if subjects were not misled or confused by the nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the question.  In other words, the weak claim is that the Linda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result is purely a consequence of asking the question in such a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject was tricked into a misunderstanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you with me so far?  This claim is an attempt to say that, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect, the experimental result was an artifact of a bad design.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better design would ask the question in such a way that the subjects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not misled, and then (the weak claim would say), we would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effect to disappear.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  And this is just what your words indicated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   might give them the impression that all I was doing was writing out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpleminded restatement of that Weak Claim.
</em><br>
<p>I never said you were *only* writing that out.  I explicitly
<br>
distinguished between this claim and your main claim in my earlier
<br>
email.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, now:  what happened to that Weak Claim.  Well, guess what?  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproved, as Eliezer put it, every whcih way from Sunday.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  And if you'd recognized that this was what Eliezer was saying
<br>
and clearly stated the above, this whole back and forth would have
<br>
been avoided.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; people were not simply misunderstanding an ambiguous question,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were doing something wrong inside their heads.  The Weak Claim was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not supported, at the end of the day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But now I want to point something out to you.  In my message I make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very precise statement:  I say that the &quot;the [Linda] question would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite likely be interpreted as...&quot; and I give the alternative that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first proposed as a misreading of the experimental question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the crucial point:  you (and Eliezer before you) jump on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement and *immediately* say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; This is a pretty straightforward claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; It has been disconfirmed in the h&amp;b lit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jeff:  do you *know* that the effect was much weaker when the confusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was eliminated?  Do you *know* that when the protocol was tightened up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exclude that alternative explanation, the effect diminished?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you understand what that means?  It means that the alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation quite likely *did* play a role in the initially observed effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And so this means that, whatever was happening, the alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanations offered DID turn out to be something that was going on in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the minds of the subjects.
</em><br>
<p>That sure is an awful lot of writing to claim something false, Richie.
<br>
&nbsp;If you had said that the alternative you offered *played a role*,
<br>
that would have been fine.  But you didn't.  Your wording implied you
<br>
were asserting &quot;the Weak Claim&quot;.  Re-read what you wrote.  There is no
<br>
text to play the semantic role of
<br>
partiality/role-playing/one-aspect-of-the-problem/etc.
<br>
<p>So perhaps you *meant* something else.  You didn't express it (I'd say
<br>
&quot;didn't express it well&quot;, but you really didn't express it at all).
<br>
We all write with less than perfect clarity.  I know I do.  No shame
<br>
in it.  But it's a pity you couldn't have just responded to Eliezer's
<br>
initial reply with the same level of clarificatory effort that you're
<br>
providing now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did I say (as the people who advocated the weak claim tried to do) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this alternative could EXPLAIN AWAY ALL OF THE RESULT?  I most certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not:  that is the Weak Claim itself, and I took it for granted that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody except an outsider who did not know the field would attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend it.  I wouldn't have dreamed of trying to do that.  I'm no dummy.
</em><br>
<p>Then you should have been more careful in stating it.  Your wording
<br>
pretty strongly implicated support of the Weak Claim, and hence led
<br>
Eliezer to believe you were &quot;an outsider who did not know the field&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what that means is, that when you, in your words above, quote my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement and then say &quot;This is a pretty straightforward claim.&quot;  and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then &quot;It has been disconfirmed in the h&amp;b lit.&quot; you are guilty of not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at the precise words that I used, and perhaps guilty of not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing the literature:
</em><br>
<p>Alas, we must continue to disagree on this point.  Your wording, after
<br>
multiple readings, has the implication I and others took it to have.
<br>
&quot;Would quite likely be interpreted as&quot; &lt;-- Because no quantifiers were
<br>
used (&quot;by most of&quot;, &quot;some of&quot;, &quot;one aspect of&quot;), the straightforward
<br>
reading is quantification over all subjects and their results; that
<br>
there is no effect once this is taken into account.
<br>
<p>Yes, if folks placed enough confidence in your CogSci abilities, they
<br>
would have assumed this to be what you meant.  And I'm sure in your
<br>
own head it was clear enough.  The wording was not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you distorted its meaning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bit as heinous a way as the tabloid journalist who selectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edits a quote to turn the meaning on its head.
</em><br>
<p>Tangent: You've mentioned in the past that you don't understand why
<br>
people think you're so often histrionic.  It's grandiose BS like the
<br>
above that makes you seem that way.  Just FYI.
