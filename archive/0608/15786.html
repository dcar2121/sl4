</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; plenty of community-based AI research projects in existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The Japanese Fifth Generation project was exactly this sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; project, only better funded.  I wonder what went wrong.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Japanese PR claim was that it was that sort of project.  Actually it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was an attempt to bootstrap the Japanese computer industry and support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their mainframe builders.  Nothing went wrong.  You can argue that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't get their money's worth, but it was a pork-barrel project, so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's not an arguement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, they were starting too soon to achieve the kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthrough they were announcing they were trying for...and it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still be too soon.  At this stage what should be funded are lots of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively small projects...say 8 college kids &amp; their parent's garage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size.  Aim for &quot;just graduated&quot; and &quot;dissertation work&quot; to stretch your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money.  DON'T pay top dollar, aim to build skill sets.  Require that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government (or other investors) get 50% of all profits &amp; of all IP (all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three kinds).  Provide a &quot;business services&quot; unit to oversee compliance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with relevant laws.  (Presume that EVERYONE hired under this program is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a developer...so all overhead is born by the investors, and that means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business licenses and tax law compliance as well as everything else.)  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After a year, demand a proposal for a &quot;demonstration&quot; that they think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they'll be able to do in a year, then allow them two years to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  If they fail, all of their work becomes Open Source (BSD or GPL?) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and funding is cut in half.  And they get a year extension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That kind of thing.  This shouldn't be expected to yield any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthroughs, but LOTS of skill development and SOME technical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress.  And a few modest successes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can see also funding around 1/3 as many projects at 3 times the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding, but these would need to be more carefully selected, and would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to show something before starting.  And possibly 1/9th as many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects at 9 times the funding.  etc.  At each step the criteria for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection would need to be more than proportionally stronger.  The idea 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here is not to create a monopoly, but a strong base.  Monopolies are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WRONG direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, would anyone here really want to merge their project into one that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was run by the government?  Defense contractors end up spending a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time lobbying Congress for support, and the government places insane 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions on their businesses.  And they tend to favor a very few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large companies that they can, essentially, totally control.  (I'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant that the original transformation of the defense contractors was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow, but new ones are expected to fit into the existing framework 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FWIW, and frustrating as it is, I suspect that underfunded and free is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better state for technical and philosophically correct development.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also expect that the government is already funding lots of AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects...and that it's those that need to be beaten if one desires FAI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as opposed to UFAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I can't say I agree with your position.
<br>
<p>I just do not think that lots of little, random projects are going to do 
<br>
it.  I see the need, for example, of sophisticated software tools that 
<br>
would transform the field:  and if I am right about that, then it will 
<br>
never happen because nobody is going to be disciplined enough to do 
<br>
that.  Too big;  too structured.
<br>
<p>Lone hackers we have plenty of.  People with a smattering of knowledge 
<br>
and a passion for coding, we have plenty of.  Don't know that that is 
<br>
where we should be encouraging things along.
<br>
<p>Government does not only fund big outfits with lots of constraints. They 
<br>
also give money to little ones with few constraints.  But they have to 
<br>
perceive a direct *need* for the product.  AGI has no purpose except to 
<br>
take over the world, so   they   wouldn't    really   , uh, be, uh... 
<br>
interested....  8-;
<br>
<p>Hmmmm.
