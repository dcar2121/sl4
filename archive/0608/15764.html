4.
<br>
<p>The list seems to boot off kooks in fairly short order, without overly
<br>
succumbing to the Boy's Club tendencies such lists can be prone to
<br>
(and what I think an 8+ might end up being).
<br>
<p>I think it's fairly Singulatarian to expect more openness of access to
<br>
the community of thought. I think it's important that ideas are kept
<br>
healthy via rigorous (informed) challenge and insightful comment.
<br>
<p>I think it's Singulatarian to ask our thought leaders to impart wisdom
<br>
with a little more engagement than from the Oracle-on-High.  I think
<br>
it's Singulatarian to foster a community where curiosity can be
<br>
assuaged for all comers even if their enthusiasm outweighs their
<br>
intelligence (or ability to trudge through the archives :-), as long
<br>
as they remember their manners and are adding forward momentum to the
<br>
collective understanding.
<br>
<p>Personally I'd love to see less mental-acuity and moral-highground
<br>
pissing contests and more ramp-up threads where latercomers'n'lurkers
<br>
on the list can be treated to content+tutorial meta-posts that can
<br>
provide the less proximate and/or educated with How-To guides on
<br>
understanding, say, Cognitive Science, Meta-Thought (Bias
<br>
Identification/Bypass), Critical Thinking/Scepticism, AGI-Theory,
<br>
Nano-Engineering, Neurochemistry, Quantum Physics, etc.
<br>
<p>Essentially all the Math &amp; Science a Post-Human is going to know by
<br>
heart, I'd like to start disseminating as much as possible *now*.
<br>
<p>Posts with insightful expert comment, links and excerpts, elucidating
<br>
examples; so the interested can get a taste of the subject matter
<br>
-.enough to whet the appetite without having to read three rows off
<br>
the bookshelf. And yes everyone *should* do their reading and mental
<br>
calisthenics; but much in the way we should all eat well and do our
<br>
physical calisthenics it's just not the human way. Some of you
<br>
Jupiter-Heads have a great way of informing us plebs and I hope I
<br>
speak for at least the lurkers when I say 'thank you, good sir; may I
<br>
please have some more?'.
