Look Russell, we KNOW that there are superficial similarities between 
<br>
hard-takeoff singularity and the Judeo-Christian world-view (though NOT, I 
<br>
would add, that of many other religions).  Sadly, your supposed negative 
<br>
sympathetic magic (a-la Television would be like magic, thus Television is 
<br>
impossible) doesn't actually work, so we have to keep believing in things 
<br>
that our physical causual model tells us to.  You don't have to, and are 
<br>
free to leave.  Really, if you dismiss hard take-off (which is, as stated 
<br>
earlier, very close to the definition of SL4 belief a context which is 
<br>
theoretically mandatory for posting here whether you accept it or not) as 
<br>
&quot;in the same ballpark as the belief that you can summon demons by chanting 
<br>
phrases in Latin&quot; you should leave, as it is grossly irrational of you to 
<br>
try to debate with people who believe something in that ballpark.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;To expand a little on this: you remind me of a remark I think Eliezer made

<em>&gt;awhile back to the effect that religious belief puts an upper bound on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationality. I'm not sure the reverse isn't the case. It is true of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that some people hold irrational beliefs for religious reasons, the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notorious example in modern times being the creationism versus evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debate. On the other hand it may be for some people that having a place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stand, so to speak, outside our world, may free them to look more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objectively at empirical propositions within this world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm reminded of the remark, related to the popularity of New Age memes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;when people stop believing in God, it's not that they believe nothing -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's that they'll believe anything&quot;. That is, in the absence of religion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people may find they have to choose a place to stand within this world:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their _empirical_ beliefs may have to be modified away from the function of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reflecting reality in order to serve this second purpose. This can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significantly negative effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Consider for example hard takeoff. Stepping back and taking a cold look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it, the belief that such power can be obtained by shuffling bits in a RAM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chip is in the same ballpark as the belief that you can summon demons by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chanting phrases in Latin: it's something whose source is very clearly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;internal workings of the human mind rather than external reality. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without applying domain-specific knowledge, it's not something an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observer would ever have ended up with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So why did we, such smart rational people, ever take something like that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seriously? Because in the absence of traditional religion we needed a place
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to stand; and my purpose here is to offer an alternative.
