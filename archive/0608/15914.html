Hi Michael,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Humans, like a car as an example of *a* thing that transports people, are just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of many possible implementation of intelligence. If someone wanted to build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; machine whose purpose would be to have intelligence, what would its &quot;engine&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mechanism for transferring motion&quot;, and the &quot;structure that houses all the parts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; machine&quot; be?
</em><br>
<p>Michael:
<br>
<em>&gt; Mainly, sequence prediction:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22sequence+prediction%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22sequence+prediction%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search</a></em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coupled with a utility function, perceptual apparatus, and a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristics for preference ordering.
</em><br>
<p>And, as Tennessee Leeuwenburg points out, memory is also a necessary requirement. 
<br>
While I may agree that these things are associated with intelligence, unfortunately 
<br>
they don't really explain how intelligence works.
<br>
<p>In the internal combustion engine, when the compressed gases inside combustion 
<br>
chambers are ignited, the expanding gas pushes the pistons down while the 
<br>
crankshaft transfers that motion to the rest of the system which transfers the 
<br>
motion further to the car's wheels. By far, this is the most important mechanism 
<br>
that causes cars to serve their purpose. Without it, and without motion, a car is 
<br>
just a weird outdoor furniture.
<br>
<p>What would be an analogous explanation for how the &quot;engine&quot; of intelligence works? 
<br>
Obviously, I'm aware of the likely possibility that intelligence doesn't reduce to 
<br>
a single equation. The explanation might be far more complicated than the 
<br>
explanation for how the mechanical engines produce force. The point is, I would 
<br>
like to see one if one is available.
<br>
<p>It's often the case that when people explain intelligence they tend to explain it 
<br>
in terms of what it does, not in term of what it is. Unfortunately, intelligence 
<br>
cannot be understood and built based only on what it does. You have to know exactly 
<br>
what it is and how it works. So, I would classify sequence prediction as something 
<br>
that intelligence does, not what it is. What I'm interested in is an explanation of 
<br>
how intelligence achieves things like sequence prediction.
<br>
<p>A human-level intelligence is able to read this message and understand it. We, as 
<br>
intelligent beings, instantly know what that means, but what does &quot;understand&quot; mean 
<br>
exactly? How does it work? What is the step-by-step process that intelligence uses 
<br>
from the moment it perceives characters on the screen to the point when it 
<br>
understands the meaning of the text?
<br>
<p>Michael:
<br>
<em>&gt; If you want the intelligence to be capable of self-modification, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also need a reflective decision theory.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course. A need for a reflective decision theory is a problem in the field 
<br>
of FAI, not AI, just like car safety is not a problem in the field of engine 
<br>
design, correct?
<br>
<p>S.
