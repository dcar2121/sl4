<p>My impression is that Singapore is among those at the forefront in
<br>
terms of technology awareness for their security and social needs.
<br>
Last month I participated in a meeting with directors of their Risk
<br>
Assessment and Horizon Scanning Group, Defence Science and Technology
<br>
Agency, and Centre of Excellence for National Security.  The
<br>
discussion ran over by about three hours as we exchanged insights on
<br>
methods and techniques for discovery, extraction, management and
<br>
prediction of technological and sociological trends of interest.  I
<br>
was particularly impressed with their active interest in developments
<br>
outside the customary military-industrial domain.  It was clear that
<br>
Singapore, at risk on many fronts but unequipped to impose military
<br>
force, has made a comittment to increasing awareness for increasingly
<br>
effective decision-making.
