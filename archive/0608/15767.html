<p><em>&gt; Humans have a sense of what is moral.  Like all such psychological traits it

</em><br>
<em>&gt; On that basis, one can predict that what we consider moral is that which is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good for the survival of our genes or a side effect of evolution in hunter

</em><br>
<p>With humans you have to look beyond genes. While many animals have some
<br>
degree of learning from others, humans have taken this to an extreme. Most
<br>
react with more horror to the burning of the library of Alexandria than to
<br>
any given war in history. Our knowledge and its transmission is now much 
<br>
more important than individual genetic variation. A genetically &quot;unfit&quot;
<br>
individual with the right knowledge is much more fit than a genetically
<br>
&quot;perfect&quot; individual who is ignorant.
<br>
<p>We are rapidly heading toward making our genes completely irrelevant, even
<br>
now gene therapy is available. We are no longer a species that depends on
<br>
the genes of ancestors.
<br>
<p>The disgust with the burning of the library of Alexandria gives a good
<br>
hint of the current basis of morality. Its not just about passing on
<br>
genes, few even know or care if Einstein or Plato had children, but
<br>
rather about insuring the continued existance of human knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is good for the survival of genes is environmentally influenced if not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined.  So what we consider moral should be flexible to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could provide and analyze lots of supporting examples.  But can anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of a counter example where this is not true?
</em><br>
<p>I tend to agree if you replace &quot;gene&quot; with information. Of course
<br>
morality depends on the situation. In general killing is a very bad
<br>
thing, but if someone was about to take a torch to the last known
<br>
repository of human knowledge I'd kill them and/or sacrifice myself to
<br>
save it with the absolutely certainty that I'd done the right thing.
<br>
<p><p>P.S. A possible discussion for SL4. Should things fall apart instead of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rising to some trascendant state, we should make sure knowledge is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserved, books buried in desert conditions known to have preserved
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ancient works in the past. Also possible gold etched with digitally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encoded knowledge. However due to the value of gold this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has less chance of survival upon discovery. But if deposited in many
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sights would be likely to have atleast some records survive.
