<p>I'm sorry you feel that way, Damien.  I don't feel that you are stupid, 
<br>
or ignorant - although possibly just a *little* ignorant of what the 
<br>
Linda business is really all about, but then we can't all be experts in 
<br>
everything.  Ignorance is not a crime; faking expertise is.  It seems 
<br>
you are not willing to take my word that Loosemore has demonstrated 
<br>
total ignorance; but I would ask, Damien, that you read a serious book 
<br>
on heuristics and biases - not a magazine article, or a summary paper, 
<br>
but something that clearly sets forth and conveys the basic principles 
<br>
and standard interpretation of the field - before you judge Loosemore 
<br>
wise, or myself a fool for wishing to cast him out.  Because what 
<br>
Loosemore said was frankly pretty damn stupid, if you happen to be 
<br>
acquainted with the field.  Not that that's a crime, but dropping the 
<br>
names of famous scientists with whom you are personally acquainted, 
<br>
*is*.  Whether or not it's a lie, it's a crime in my book.  It doesn't 
<br>
matter to me whether these people have ever even heard of Loosemore, or 
<br>
not; what matters is the imposture of pretending to be an expert.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of people on SL4 who disagree with me, and whose 
<br>
methods of arguing I sometimes don't like, such as Russell Wallace for 
<br>
example.  The difference between Russell and Loosemore seems pretty 
<br>
clear to me, though.  And on this list are also men and women who 
<br>
sometimes agree with me, and who don't deserve to be called &quot;fanboys&quot; 
<br>
for that crime, regardless of your opinion of me personally.
<br>
<p>I am furthermore skeptical that the list is &quot;drifting&quot; in such a 
<br>
direction.  I don't see any trend of increasing agreement from 2000 to 
<br>
now.  The *notion* that this list is intolerant of disagreement could do 
<br>
some harm, though, which is why I am emphasizing that I do not, 
<br>
pragmatically, see any hint that this is the case.  Did everyone rally 
<br>
round to denounce Loosemore, once it became clear that he was persona 
<br>
non grata with the great Eliezer?  No.  This list is as tolerant as ever 
<br>
of disagreement - but there are some misdeeds I won't tolerate, *even 
<br>
if* they're committed by someone who also happens to violently disagree 
<br>
with me.  My desire to keep the list clean takes precedence over my wish 
<br>
to look wise and tolerant.
