<p>
Jeff,
<br>
<p>I can't help being devil's advocate here for a moment.
<br>
<p>What if Ethics were like Religion in this important respect, with no 
<br>
baseline, accepted, &quot;real&quot; facts from which the rest was derived?
<br>
<p>What I mean is, what if it is not like physics (where there is a 
<br>
consensus baseline, then a hierarchy of theoretical/empirical knowledge 
<br>
built on that)?  Yes, you have to read a lot of the prior work if you 
<br>
want to talk sensibly about physics.
<br>
<p>But if someone were to stop me, a few words into some comments I wanted 
<br>
to make about religious belief, and said &quot;Hey, have you read all the 
<br>
standard tests on the Philosophy of Religion?  Have you acquainted 
<br>
yourself with all the sacred texts of all the world's main religions? 
<br>
Because if you have not, you don't have the right to open your mouth&quot;, I 
<br>
would be affronted.
<br>
<p>I am wondering if it is fair to compare the Philosophy of Ethics to the 
<br>
science of Physics.
<br>
<p>One of the reasons I ask, is that although I have not delved into that 
<br>
area, I have gone deeply into Philosophy of Mind and Epistemology, and 
<br>
there are vast realms of both of those subjects that are based on pure 
<br>
assumptions that the authors do not know that they are making, and 
<br>
which, for me (when I do not accept those assumptions) mean that entire 
<br>
bodies of thought are just a complete and utter waste of time.
<br>
<p>Physics, on the other hand, is just not like that (with a few notable 
<br>
exceptions like N-waves and phlogiston).
<br>
<p>I speak cautiously because I do not know the Ethics literature, but I do 
<br>
have worries because I (and others) doubt the existence of a baseline 
<br>
that can (even in principle) be independent of the observer's preferences.
