<p><em>&gt; The *notion* that this list is intolerant of disagreement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could do some harm, though, which is why I am emphasizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I do not, pragmatically, see any hint that  this is the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...] This list is as tolerant as ever of disagreement
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, I haven't been following your debate with Loosemore in any detail
<br>
and don't wish to get involved in it, but I did read your above statement.
<br>
Eliezer you are one smart fellow and I respect the hell out of you, but as a
<br>
friend let me tell you that the statement that I quote you of saying above
<br>
is pure unadulterated bullshit.
<br>
<p>On June 8 of this year I was told that a issue I had brought up, something
<br>
that is at the very heart of the entire &quot;friendly AI&quot; concept must never be
<br>
discussed on this list again. I won't say what it was because as I said at
<br>
the time I believe in private property and it's your list not mine. Perhaps
<br>
you banned the topic because you thought the idea was just stupid, and I
<br>
grant you someone can be absolutely positively 100% certain of something and
<br>
still be dead wrong; but Eliezer, I am CERTAIN I was not stupid. Every fiber
<br>
of my being screams that this is the single most important fact about the
<br>
singularity dwarfing all others. I am told this list is dedicated to
<br>
discussing the Singularity, but I can't discus the most important fact about
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>You have a right to do whatever you like with your private property, but
<br>
please don't say this list is tolerant of intelligent disagreement. And I
<br>
tend to think if you really want to discover the truth about the universe
<br>
this is a profound impediment to fulfilling your goal.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;John K Clark
