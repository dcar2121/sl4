Perhaps I'm overly skeptical, but I seriously doubt that your 20 year
old self could have modeled the world at anything even remotely
resembling the complexity that your 35-year-old self does.  And
multiplying that by several billion humans living longer than they would
in a primal state leads to the conclusion that the world is vastly,
subjectively different today than at any time in history.

Indeed.  But arguing that *another* transcension is imminent in no way
detracts from the position that we, as a species, have already
transcended our historical notion of humanity at least once.  Moving
from nomadic groups of 30-50 individuals to a globally networked
civilization with members who regularly interact with thousands of
others is a change of such magnitude that it is hard to appreciate,
especially from our privileged perch within the process, the true scope
of the alterations.
