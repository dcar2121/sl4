I consider that implausible, because I believe that by the time there is 
<br>
enough computer power to run simultaneous multiple mini-universe 
<br>
simulations (Earth would probably be enough.  No reason to simulate the 
<br>
rest of the galaxy.  Just fake the perceptions of it that would be 
<br>
observable.) then either an FAI or a non-FAI will be created.
<br>
<p>However, given the scenario...
<br>
That does seem like a good reason to run the simulations, but you are 
<br>
assuming that the person in charge is a good guy who can be trusted with 
<br>
that kind of power, in which case why not use him as your first upload?  
<br>
Given human political organization the only things that keep the 
<br>
power-hungry psychopaths from scrambling to be an upload are:
<br>
1)  They wouldn't see the upload as themself, and neither would the 
<br>
upload see itself as them.
<br>
2)  They don't believe it's possible anyway.
<br>
3)  They don't understand the amount of power that a computer running 
<br>
the country (under nominal external direction) would have.
<br>
<p>If such a thing happens, and we're very lucky, the first upload will be 
<br>
someone like Craig Ventner.  He's an egomaniac, but not a psychopath.
<br>
<p>Simulations as you propose would be a good rational solution.  I just 
<br>
don't see them as the kind of thing our political systems are good at 
<br>
achieving.
