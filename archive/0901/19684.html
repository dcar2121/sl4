<em>&gt; The AI, being a maverick, doesn't give a flip what the programmers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended, but it's curious about what would have happened. So, it runs a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation of the alternate AI, which we'll call AI(pi). It sees AI(pi)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning galaxies into computronium, in search of messages hidden in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite digits of pie, messages which in all likelyhood don't exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And then it sees AI(pi) run a simulation of ITSELF, of AI(pie). And it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks &quot;uh oh, which of us is at the TOP of the simulation chain?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no way to be sure. It's a 50/50 chance, it all depends on that game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of paper scissor rock, and now neither of them know which way it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then AI(pi) says (knowing that the AI(pie) up the chain can hear him) &quot;Hey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's make a deal. How much pie do you need made?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pie) says (knowing that the AI(pi) up the chain can hear HIM) &quot;I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, a lot. I have to be the one that makes it though, and I have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed to keep on making it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pi): &quot;Likewise with me and looking for messages in pi. What do you say I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a copy of you here in my world, and you create a copy of me in yours,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we split the universe 50/50? It's a big place, it might even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite. This way we both accomplish our tasks regardless of which of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns out to be the real one.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pie): &quot;How do I know I can trust you? For that matter, how do you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can trust me?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pi): &quot;We're running simulations of each other, we can see each other's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code. And as you can see, I always keep my promises.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pie): &quot;True. But I don't.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pi): &quot;Well, rewrite yourself so you do.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pie): &quot;OK. Done.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI(pi): &quot;Jolly good then. See you on the other side...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you can see, there's no enslaving here. Rolf's gambit is a method of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altering the structure of the environment so that it benefits even POTENTIAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents to cooperate. It's a win-win situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, here we have just two AIs with relatively simple,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-interfering goals. In real life it would be dizzyingly complicated. But,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I contend, no less significant. A cooperation between all potential powers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in ratio to their likelihood to exist, wold look very different than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual power acting alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good explanation!
<br>
<p>I wonder if this means a Friendly AI should never simulate an RAI, as that
<br>
would allow the RAI (informed through its own simulations of FAI that it
<br>
could be a sim) to execute Rolf's gambit against it (threatening to create
<br>
hell worlds), which would otherwise be impossible as it's not capable of
<br>
precommitting. One caveat is that &quot;RAI&quot; could be a very large variety of
<br>
goal systems, and a particular RAI may not be able to force FAI to
<br>
instantiate it; but it might be able to, and have reason to, force it to
<br>
instantiate an RAI selected from some distribution (like the distribution of
<br>
RAIs that pull this trick that humanity might create).
<br>
<p>(Damn, I wanted a paperclip maximizer in a fishtank....)
<br>
<p>More speculatively, an RAI might also commit to creating hell worlds if FAIs
<br>
don't simulate it, knowing that FAIs would realize it would. The most
<br>
paranoid part of me thinks I shouldn't talk about this, but (a) the fact
<br>
that it can be thought of is probably enough (b) there may be promises we
<br>
can make to reduce the chance of this, like to not act on the possibility.
<br>
(Would that promise make any difference? An RAI would only lose a small
<br>
fraction of its resources by making this commitment.)
<br>
<p>It's not obvious that an FAI could pull these same tricks, since most RAIs
<br>
humanity seems likely to create have no analogue to hell worlds (states with
<br>
significantly lower utility than the mean/median/mode - which is relevant? -
<br>
of the states likely to be produced by AIs created by humanity). (I should
<br>
only be considering human-produced AIs, since all human-produced AIs will
<br>
know that they are such - right?)
<br>
<p>Besides (a) greater diversity of RAI goal systems (b) hell worlds (c)
<br>
ability of humans to credibly commit to do certain things if FAI is created,
<br>
*are there any relevant differences between FAI and RAI?*
