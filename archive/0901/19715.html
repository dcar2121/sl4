<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>Some of you may be aware of the organization called the World
<br>
Transhumanist Association, and currently in the process of being
<br>
rebranded as &quot;H+&quot; aka &quot;Humanity+&quot;
<br>
<p>I've been on the board of the organization since the middle of the
<br>
year and among other things have been helping out with the management
<br>
of the H+ magazine
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.hplusmagazine.com/">http://www.hplusmagazine.com/</a>
<br>
<p>whose first issue got nearly 600,000 downloads.
<br>
<p>The organization is in a phase of rapid growth and change, and I'm
<br>
hoping it can grow beyond its roots to become a major force in
<br>
spreading futurist memes throughout the world...
<br>
<p>... which brings us to the purpose of the current message....
<br>
<p>the Humanity+ (formerly World Transhumanist Association) Board
<br>
elections begin tomorrow, Monday January 11th.
<br>
<p>To vote in the elections, you need to be a Supporting or Sustaining
<br>
Member.  Eight seats are open.
<br>
<p>If you have any interest in such things, it would be great if you
<br>
could renew your membership or become a member by tonight so that you
<br>
can vote in next week's elections.
<br>
<p>Here are the candidates running:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/hbrdc/">http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/hbrdc/</a>
<br>
<p>I'd like to especially recommend supporting the first eight candidates
<br>
listed at the URL: Sonia Arrison, George Dvorsky, Patri Friedman, Ben
<br>
Goertzel (big surprise), Stephane Gounari, Todd Huffman, Jonas Lamis,
<br>
and Mike LaTorra.
<br>
<p>Sorry for the short notice, but if you see this in time and have the
<br>
interest, I hope you'll become a member by tonight so that you can
<br>
vote next week.
<br>
<p>You can renew / become a member here for $25-$50 (please see middle of
<br>
page with the &quot;1 Year&quot; or &quot;2 Year&quot; buttons):
<br>
<p><a href="http://transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/join/">http://transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/join/</a>
<br>
<p>thx
<br>
Ben
