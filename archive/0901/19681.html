<em>&gt; &gt; thread: <a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0708/16600.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0708/16600.html</a>)

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (if you haven't read that thread, you really should, it's probably the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interesting thing to ever come out of this list)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was thinking today about a puzzle. Let's say you're a friendly AI, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you're going to enact rolf's gambit. But before you do that, you take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few solar systems, and you discover obvious proof that your world is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation. For the sake of argument, let's say it's an indestructible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tuba
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the third moon of saturn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The question is this: assuming you continue with rolf's gambit, do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; include the tuba in your subsimulations? Why or why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, there is no such thing as indisputable proof.
</em><br>
<p><p>No one said &quot;indisputable&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There is only belief.
</em><br>
<p><p>Oh boy, down the well of pedanticness we go. Apparently matt would like to
<br>
point out that we only BELIEVE 2+2=4, we only BELIEVE sonic the hedgehog is
<br>
blue, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>Touche, my friend, touche! This certainly punches a huge hole in my
<br>
argument, and indeed every argument about everything, ever. My hat is off to
<br>
you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If an AI believes the universe is real or simulated, it is because it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed that way (on purpose or by accident).
</em><br>
<p><p>Only to the extent that if it believes anything, it's &quot;only because it was
<br>
programmed to&quot;. 2+2, sky is blue, etc. If one day everything turns into
<br>
wireframe models and the moon is replaced with a big square that says BFRAME
<br>
DECODER LAG, that doesn't PROVE you're in a simulation, but it certainly
<br>
INCREASES THE ODDS.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If the two cases are indistinguishable, then belief one way or the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should have no effect on rational behavior because it does not affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected utility. In particular, there is no difference from the viewpoint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of either AI or humanity between a real world AI wiping out real world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity and a simulated AI wiping out simulated humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it makes a difference to me. And although I don't take pride in it, I
<br>
consider myself part of humanity.
<br>
<p>Maybe you mean it SHOULDN'T make a difference? Why not? Even if you feel
<br>
simulated people are 100% sentient concious creatures who should be allowed
<br>
to vote and drive, why does that mean it doesn't make a difference? Saying
<br>
YOU don't care about context is one thing, saying no rational agent is
<br>
allowed to is something else.
<br>
<p>But let's say for the sake of argument that it does matter.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An AI running in a simulation cannot know anything about the AI that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulating it.
</em><br>
<p><p>False, except in the sense that no one can &quot;know&quot; anything about anything.
<br>
If the simulation contains cheese, we know the AI running the simulation
<br>
doesn't have a problem with simulating cheese. If it manifests itself and
<br>
says &quot;Hi, i'm jupiter brain Xarblox and I'm simulating you because I thought
<br>
it would be a laff, my favorite color is green and I'm 77 million years
<br>
old&quot;, then we don't KNOW any of that is true, but if we just plug our ears
<br>
and go &quot;la la la, there's no way we can know anything about the AI that's
<br>
simulating us&quot;, we'd be being a bit retarded.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Any Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine. The simulated AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might believe otherwise, but only because the simulating AI biased it toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;it could be anything therefore we ignore it&quot; argument applies equally
<br>
well (that is to say, badly) to anything and everything. Someone rings your
<br>
doorbell! Who is it? Well, it COULD be ANYONE, or ANYTHING, best to pretend
<br>
it never rang. I'm reminded of a fake dialog box style popup ad I saw once
<br>
that said &quot;Warning! Your computer is currently downloading INFORMATION!
<br>
Information is potentially dangerous and could DESTROY YOU!&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, it COULD. But chances are it won't. EVERYTHING is ultimately
<br>
Unknowable, from the color of the pee in your bladder to the square root of
<br>
49. But we can still assign things probabilities. There's an infinite number
<br>
of turing machines that could have written Harry Potter, but I'd bet my
<br>
money that it was J. K. Rowling. Guessing the author of our own world is a
<br>
lot harder, but IT IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE. Probability still applies.
<br>
<p>If an RAI needs to wipe out humanity to complete its goal of computing C,
<br>
<em>&gt; then it will do so. In order for Rolf's gambit to work, the RAI would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to biased to believe in the possibility of an FAI simulating it and biased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to guess the motivations of the FAI, i.e. biased to believe in the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a humanity that does not want to be exterminated in the simulating world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just like in the simulated world, except that the simulating humanity could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively control the FAI*. It would be simpler (or at worst, equivalently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult) just to bias the RAI to not want to wipe out humanity. But if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could do that, we wouldn't need to worry about the FAI problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *This is logically inconsistent, because it implies that humanity would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have greater intelligence than the FAI. The RAI (also having superhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence) would know that the friendliness problem is ill defined. Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman AI could be made to appear friendly while doing whatever it wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by reprogramming our brains' definition of friendliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If humanity's whims aren't the source of the FAI's motivations, where does
<br>
it get them? It sounds like you're taking issue with the possibility of
<br>
friendly AI, which is a whole different argument.
