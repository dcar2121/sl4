Dear Colleagues,
<br>
<p>Please find below info about 2 new phd studentships. Please feel welcome to
<br>
circulate this information. Also, note the very title deadline: 12 Jan,
<br>
2009.
<br>

<br>
<p>Finally, here are the project titles:
<br>
<p>Prospects of immortality: public engagement with Biogerontology and
<br>
life/health span expansion (Ref.PHDMLM004)
<br>
<p>Due to its broad application to a number of other sciences, biogerontology
<br>
is one of the most relevant fields of inquiry today. It speaks to the
<br>
convergence of the NBIC sciences and to the redefinition of health care that
<br>
arises by describing ageing as a disease to be cured, rather than a natural
<br>
process to accept. Biogerontology engages us with the prospect of extending
<br>
health or life span to an unknown degree and, as such, it is a controversial
<br>
discipline. Over the last ten years, work in this area has shifted from
<br>
scientific impossibility to becoming a core part of scientific endeavour. A
<br>
range of media coverage, from aspersion to fascination, has accompanied this
<br>
shift. In the literature on public understanding of science, there is no
<br>
research yet attending to this distinct, but profound area of scientific
<br>
inquiry. As such, this PhD studentship aims to explore the following
<br>
questions:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How has biogerontology been articulated though the media?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What issues surround the political economy of research into
<br>
life-extension?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How do different research communities orientate themselves around the
<br>
various media narratives on life-extension?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How do journalists report research on biogerontology?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What can be learned from this subject area to broadly inform work into
<br>
science communication?
<br>
<p>Candidates should have a higher degree in science communication and
<br>
qualitative research methods in media sociology.

<br>
<p>The ethics of human enhancement in film (Ref.PHDMLM005)
<br>
<p>Studies in the ethics of human enhancement have advanced considerably in the
<br>
last five years through the emergence of new communities of scholarly
<br>
inquiry. A number of scientific disciplines have been brought under the
<br>
spotlight due to their likely use for lifestyle, non-therapeutic purposes.
<br>
The connections between filmic narratives and bioethics are made manifest in
<br>
recent cultural studies and can be linked to broader, literary origins. Yet,
<br>
there is very little research that investigates the range of narratives that
<br>
emerge on the ethics of human enhancement within film. This absence affects
<br>
the degree of complexity that is brought to how such debates are played out
<br>
in the media and in policy. This PhD explores the contribution of film to
<br>
such imaginations and aims to add complexity to our understanding of how
<br>
film conveys such alterations. It should also help us understand how film
<br>
functions as a posthuman device of expressing humanly experiences, such as
<br>
process of remembering, perceiving and the possible disruption of sensory
<br>
encounters. It also aims to explore the limitations of cultural reference
<br>
points within scientific policy making on the ethics of human enhancements,
<br>
exploring the range of metaphors, analogies and stories that contribute to
<br>
shaping the public understanding of science.
<br>
<p>Candidates should have a higher degree and particular expertise in film
<br>
theory and technological fiction.
