<em>&gt; The premise is that a groups of FAI researchers has a chance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeed, depending on happenstance and ability to work for long enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. Simulation is a way to improve the chances for success, compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a setting where researchers continue to work in the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, simulation speeds things up, which lowers the risk of running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the external end of the world. Second, using selected individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to research in the simulation should allow to make the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating unFriendly AI originating from the simulation lower than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same risk in the outside world. Peer review should allow to lower the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk of unFriendly AI further, even as the number of simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers increases. Different combinations of researchers increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity, which may enable to find the solution faster where one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination won't be successful. And finally, nested simulations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned only in the context of starting to implement the AI, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which point they can serve as intelligent firewalls that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat mitigate the risk of AI unexpectedly developing not according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to plan, so that upper-level simulation FAI programmers would be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to terminate simulations on the lower levels. Each measure doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give a solution to FAI, only contributes to increasing the chances of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success (and of course, this whole scenario should be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflectively reorganize itself, if simulated researchers agree it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>1. The researchers ARE AIs themselves, how do we know their definition of
<br>
friendly is the same as ours?
<br>
2. Do the researchers know they are simulated? If not, then I dont see how
<br>
this eliminates my scenario of silly recursion. -- we can consider ourselves
<br>
to be researchers now, and we are proposing making a set of simulated
<br>
researchers to solve this problem--- I dont think that our simulated
<br>
researchers can have an idea that is not hard-wired of how clock cycles
<br>
affect their own cognition, and I can conceive of situations where they
<br>
create simulated researchers that run for 1000 ticks for every tick they
<br>
run-- to us this is inefficient, but its subjectively sped up for our
<br>
researchers since they have no concept of time outside the simulation.
<br>
<p>3. what if they decide to recursively improve themselves in order to speed
<br>
up making the FAI?
<br>
4. Since its subjectively sped up, if the &quot;intelligent firewall&quot; gets
<br>
compromised, its still over before we can do anything about it.
