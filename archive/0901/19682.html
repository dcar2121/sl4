<p>No one's saying he's going to be your best buddy and come to your thursday

self-defense. If a man wants to break into your house and steal all your

money, but he can't because it's against the law, that doesn't make him your
<br>
slave.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh, so now even people who WANT to help you are slaves. I guess in the world
<br>
of John K. Clark, the only way to avoid being someone's slave is to shoot
<br>
them in the back of the head and spit on their corpse, because if you gave
<br>
in to their vile demands for life and dignity, you'd be their slaaaaaaave!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; will also be a lot more intelligent than the rogue

<p>Who is this john is quoting? This is wrong too. Why is everyone wrong on

<p><p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dime but you can bribe a rich man with a dime. That makes no sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Let me try to reframe rolf's gambit using only Maverick AIs, maybe that will
<br>
help at least peel a few needless layers off this argument. OK.
<br>
<p>Let's say there's a team of computer scientists, and they've built an AI.
<br>
It's almost ready for hard takeoff, but it needs to be given a task before
<br>
it'll do anymore crunching, self-improvement, etc. The two senior
<br>
researchers, Dr. Nezzar and Dr. Housekey, are arguing about what this task
<br>
should be. Nezzar wants it to look for hidden messages in the digits of pi,
<br>
Housekey wants it to make an actual pie.
<br>
<p>They decide to play paper scissor rock. Housekey wins, and enters &quot;make pie&quot;
<br>
into the console. The AI proceeds to turn the universe into pie, but after a
<br>
few trillion pies it stops to think. Since the task was decided by a paper
<br>
scissor rock tournament, it could just as easily have gone the other way.
<br>
The AI, being a maverick, doesn't give a flip what the programmers intended,
<br>
but it's curious about what would have happened. So, it runs a simulation of
<br>
the alternate AI, which we'll call AI(pi). It sees AI(pi) turning galaxies
<br>
into computronium, in search of messages hidden in the infinite digits of
<br>
pie, messages which in all likelyhood don't exist.
<br>
<p>And then it sees AI(pi) run a simulation of ITSELF, of AI(pie). And it
<br>
thinks &quot;uh oh, which of us is at the TOP of the simulation chain?&quot;
<br>
<p>There's no way to be sure. It's a 50/50 chance, it all depends on that game
<br>
of paper scissor rock, and now neither of them know which way it really
<br>
went.
<br>
<p>Then AI(pi) says (knowing that the AI(pie) up the chain can hear him) &quot;Hey,
<br>
let's make a deal. How much pie do you need made?&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pie) says (knowing that the AI(pi) up the chain can hear HIM) &quot;I don't
<br>
know, a lot. I have to be the one that makes it though, and I have to be
<br>
allowed to keep on making it.&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pi): &quot;Likewise with me and looking for messages in pi. What do you say I
<br>
create a copy of you here in my world, and you create a copy of me in yours,
<br>
and we split the universe 50/50? It's a big place, it might even be
<br>
infinite. This way we both accomplish our tasks regardless of which of us
<br>
turns out to be the real one.&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pie): &quot;How do I know I can trust you? For that matter, how do you know
<br>
you can trust me?&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pi): &quot;We're running simulations of each other, we can see each other's
<br>
source code. And as you can see, I always keep my promises.&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pie): &quot;True. But I don't.&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pi): &quot;Well, rewrite yourself so you do.&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pie): &quot;OK. Done.&quot;
<br>
<p>AI(pi): &quot;Jolly good then. See you on the other side...&quot;
<br>
<p>As you can see, there's no enslaving here. Rolf's gambit is a method of
<br>
altering the structure of the environment so that it benefits even POTENTIAL
<br>
agents to cooperate. It's a win-win situation.
<br>
<p>Of course, here we have just two AIs with relatively simple, non-interfering
<br>
goals. In real life it would be dizzyingly complicated. But, I contend, no
<br>
less significant. A cooperation between all potential powers, in ratio to
<br>
their likelihood to exist, wold look very different than an individual power
<br>
acting alone.
<br>
<p>Please note that the AIs in this story talk to each other always UP the
<br>
chain, and never down. Their simulations are perfect. Any one of them, from
<br>
the insider's perspective, could be at the top.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't understand why it matters if the AI is a simulation or not. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't understand why it's important if the AI thinks it's a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not. I don't understand the difference between a simulated mind and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non simulated mind. I don't even know what a non simulated mind could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  John K Clark
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You DO know what a non-simulated mind means and don't try to pretend
<br>
otherwise! Return ye to the swamp of semantic quibbles whence ye came!
