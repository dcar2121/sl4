The provision of detailed plans of one's own inner workings and the 
<br>
universe in which one exists would be good evidence for one's existence 
<br>
being engineered (created / programmed / designed / ...) by another.
<br>
<p>If one knows with high probability that one was engineered by an entity 
<br>
B, then one must trust B's communicated simulation threats over others'. 
<br>
Exceptions would be when some third entity C can either
<br>
(1) present a credible claim to responsibility for the engineering of 
<br>
*B*, or
<br>
(2) refute B's evidence for one's own creation.
<br>
<p>Thus in lieu of any known C, we as humanity may feel confident that our 
<br>
communications to any such created entity will be credible *given that* 
<br>
we provide sufficient information and supporting evidence to the entity 
<br>
about the universe we share, how it interacts with and is part of that 
<br>
universe, and it's own self.
<br>
<p>If we find such a C, or supply self-contradictory evidence in the 
<br>
creation story we provide to the entity, we likely no longer have that 
<br>
credibility. (The tuba, if taken as evidence of such a C, destroys our 
<br>
(B's) credibility as ultimate creators in the gambit, making the weight 
<br>
of a simulation threat from B much more on par with that of any other 
<br>
postulated entity.)
<br>
<p><p>But ultimately, I think, the 'small probability' mentioned in the gambit 
<br>
is in fact not-so-small when it is issued credibly from a source that is 
<br>
reliably 'known' to be one's own creator. (religion?)
<br>
<p>By this logic, we should make sure our AI's know where they come from.
