</em><br>
<p>Matt was replying to a scenario where the two AIs know each other's
<br>
source code, and claiming, as I understand, that they cannot possibly
<br>
conduct a dialog by simulating each other. IMHO that makes it clear
<br>
that his statement meant something more specific than you're making it
<br>
out to be.
<br>
<p>Matt, as far as I can see you're wrong, though; K(X) = K(Y), no
<br>
contradiction. Yes, if X &quot;did something besides simulating Y,&quot; in a
<br>
certain sense, then you would have K(X) &gt; K(Y). But by assumption,
<br>
each AI simulates (eventually) everything the other AI does, so in
<br>
that sense, Y &quot;does everything&quot; that X does and vice versa. To see
<br>
that you can have Xs and Ys with such source codes: Let's say that you
<br>
have X' that takes the source of Y as input and behaves like you want
<br>
X to behave, and, symmetrically, you have Y' that thakes the source of
<br>
X as input. Then it seems to be it's basically just an exercise in
<br>
writing quines to obtain X (using both X' and Y') and to obtain Y
<br>
(again using both X' and Y'), with K(X) = K(Y).
<br>
<p>I don't want to try my hand at doing this with Turing machines, but
<br>
let's try it with computable functions.
<br>
<p>I'll assume you know how to encode a tuple of natural numbers as a
<br>
natural number. Let eval : N -&gt; (N -&gt; N) be a Gödel numbering of the
<br>
computable functions. Let an *agent* be a computable function whose
<br>
input is interpreted to be (some information received from the
<br>
environment at the first time step), and whose output is a pair of (an
<br>
action to take in the environment at the first time step) and (the
<br>
Gödel number, relative to 'eval', of the agent to use at the *next*
<br>
time-step).
<br>
<p>Let an *environment* be a computable function whose input is some
<br>
agent's action and whose output is a pair of the information to send
<br>
to the agent in the next time step, and the environment to use in the
<br>
next time step. (Incidentally, note that the definitions of agent and
<br>
environment are precisely parallel, but we won't be using that.) It is
<br>
a simple exercise in coding to write a function 'interact' that, given
<br>
<p>* the Gödel number of an agent,
<br>
* the input to give to the agent at the first time step, and
<br>
* the Gödel number of an environment
<br>
<p>computes the infinite sequence of inputs from the environment and
<br>
actions from the agent:
<br>
<p>interact(agent, inp, env, 0) = (inp, act) where (act, agent') = eval(agent)(inp)
<br>
interact(agent, inp, env, n+1) = interact(agent', inp', env', n)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where (act, agent') = eval(agent)(inp); (inp', env') = eval(env)(act)
<br>
<p>The last parameter of 'interact' is the index of the infinite sequence.
<br>
<p>Let's define a formalism for two agents in different environments
<br>
which can pass messages to each other, and then use the trick with
<br>
quines to transform them into single agents simulating each other to
<br>
conduct a dialog roughly in the sense of Rolf's gambit.
<br>
<p>The idea behind the formalism is that at each time step, each agent
<br>
outputs a message to send to the other agent as part of its action in
<br>
the environment, and at the next time step, the other agent receives
<br>
this message as part of its input. So the formalism is simply that the
<br>
input from the environment becomes a pair (message from other agent,
<br>
rest of the input from the environment) and the action becomes a pair
<br>
(message to other agent, rest of the action in the environment).
<br>
<p>It is then a simple exercise in coding to write a function
<br>
'interactMsg' that, given
<br>
<p>* the Gödel numbers of two interacting agents,
<br>
* the inputs to give to the agents on their first time steps,
<br>
* the messages to pass to the agents on their first time steps
<br>
(usually just 0), and
<br>
* the environments of the two agents (in the original sense of environment)
<br>
<p>computes the infinite sequence of, for each time step, the two inputs
<br>
from the environments, the two messages sent by the agents, and the
<br>
two actions taken in their respective environments:
<br>
<p>interactMsg(ag1, ag2, i1, i2, m1, m2, e1, e2, 0) = (i1,i2,m1,m2,a1,a2) where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((m1',a1),ag1') = eval(ag1)(m1,i1)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((m2',a2),ag2') = eval(ag2)(m2,i2)
<br>
<p>interactMsg(ag1, ag2, i1, i2, m1, m2, e1, e2, n+1)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= interactMsg(ag1', ag2', i1', i2', m1', m2', e1', e2', n) where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((m1',a1),ag1') = eval(ag1)(m1,i1); (i1',e1') = eval(e1)(a1)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((m2',a2),ag2') = eval(ag2)(m2,i2); (i2',e2') = eval(e2)(a2)
<br>
<p>Again, the last parameter is the time step.
<br>
<p>Let us say that ag1,ag2 are such message-passing agents, i1,i2 are
<br>
inputs, and e1,e2 are environments. The point of this message is that
<br>
we can construct an agent ag1* such that for all n,
<br>
<p>interact(ag1*, i1, n) = (i1', a1') where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i1',i2',m1',m2',a1',a2') = interactMsg(a1,a2,i1,i2,0,0,e1,e2,n)
<br>
<p>Since everything is symmetric, this means that we can also construct a
<br>
similar agent ag2*, and we have ag1* and ag2* in their alternative
<br>
possible worlds &quot;conducting a dialog by simulating each other.&quot; Now,
<br>
ag1 even when running as ag1* doesn't have power over ag2's
<br>
environment, so this doesn't quite suffice for Rolf's gambit, but I
<br>
can't be bothered to extend it more right now; in any case, if we
<br>
informally specify that ag2 cares about converting the *real*
<br>
environment to cheesecake (not pie!), and that it has a probability
<br>
distribution over whether ag1* or ag2* is the actual real situation,
<br>
then it seems to me that we do have a working variant of the gambit.
<br>
<p>Onwards to the construction of ag1*. Let e be the Gödel number of a
<br>
function from a pair of numbers to a natural number; define apply(e,n)
<br>
to be the Gödel number of
<br>
<p>f(n') = eval(e)(n,n')
<br>
<p>That is, apply(e,n) is a partial application operator:
<br>
<p>eval(apply(e,n))(n') = eval(e)(n,n')
<br>
<p>Now, let
<br>
<p>Q(q, ((ag1,ag2,i2,m1,m2,e2), i1)) = (a1,ag1*') where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((m1',a1),ag1') = eval(ag1)(m1,i1)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((m2',a2),ag2') = eval(ag2)(m2,i2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i2',e2') = eval(e2)(a2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ag1*' = apply(q, (ag1',ag2',i2',m1',m2',e2'))
<br>
<p>By a corollary to Kleene's recursion theorem
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem#Application_to_Quines">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem#Application_to_Quines</a>
<br>
<p>there is a particular number q such that
<br>
<p>eval(q)(x) = Q(q,x)
<br>
<p>Then, let
<br>
<p>ag1* = apply(q, (ag1,ag2,i2,0,0,e2))
<br>
<p>We now use a boring induction to show the desired result, i.e. that
<br>
with these definitions,
<br>
<p>interact(ag1*, i1, n) = (i1', a1') where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i1',i2',m1',m2',a1',a2') = interactMsg(a1,a2,i1,i2,0,0,e1,e2,n)
<br>
<p>I'll skip the proof because I think it's unlikely that anybody here
<br>
will actually want to check a long list of equations (I'm hoping to
<br>
persuade you on the grounds that the functions obviously do the same
<br>
thing), but if anybody actually *does* want to read through a list of
<br>
equations, I'll be happy to produce one.
<br>
<p>Also, am I missing something?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
