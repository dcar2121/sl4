<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p>I'm not sure whether you're saying
<br>
<p>a) that writing down and publishing thoughts on the philosophy of mind is
<br>
intrinsically embarrassing
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>b) that YOUR particular thoughts about philosophy of mind were such that it
<br>
would have been embarrassing for you to write them down and publish them
<br>
<p>;-)
<br>
<p>If it's a, then I disagree.  I think that when a science is at a
<br>
foundational phase, philosophy has a lot to offer it.  Philosophy and
<br>
physics were more intertwined when modern physics was just starting out --
<br>
e.g. Ernst Mach, Niels Bohr did some serious philosophical writing in
<br>
parallel with their scientific work, and there wasn't always a rigid
<br>
boundary between the two.  Going back to Leibniz this is even more clear.
<br>
The more mature a science is, the less need it has for philosophy, it would
<br>
seem.  Philosophy, among other purposes, helps to point the way for
<br>
science -- but a mature science already knows which way it's going.  I don't
<br>
think cognitive science or AI are all that mature yet.
<br>
<p>If it's b, then I guess you'd know better than me...
<br>
