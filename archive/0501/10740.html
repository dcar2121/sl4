<em>&gt;Calvin's proposed mechanism bewilders me in that

<em>&gt;Calvin is a very smart man who knows a lot about

</em><br>
<p>With respect to speech, there is a lot of evidence in the kind of mistakes 
<br>
we make that sentences are &quot;evolved up&quot; through a number of cycles from noise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and no adherents to it except Calvin
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;very smart person).
</em><br>
<p>I was at a conference last year at Waterloo where Calvin spoke.  A 
<br>
substantial fraction of the people there understood Calvin's thoughts on 
<br>
the subject.  They were not particularly vocal supporters, but they sure 
<br>
didn't have better proposals.  For sure Calvin has a unique take on what 
<br>
brains evolved for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, the notion that cerebral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cloning is a GENERAL mechanism, used throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cortex, would mean that our cortex would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be several hundred times larger than the size
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needed to carry out pre-programmed activities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because the competing programs in his neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;darwinism would probably need a population of several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundred, each of which was complex enough to actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perform the action or perception or whatever itself.
</em><br>
<p>You completely lose me in this argument.  Or cortex is at least several 
<br>
hundred times that of animals that carry out only pre-programmed activities.
