</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I understanding you correctly?  If we can agree

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Jef
</em><br>
<p>There is a school of thought that would argue this,
<br>
notably Thomas Kuhn (/The Structure of Scientific
<br>
Revolutions, 1966 or so).  But I agree with you
<br>
that human society tends toward more objective
<br>
understanding of the world around them with time,
<br>
altho with occasional setbacks.
<br>
<p>Where you are losing me is in connecting that
<br>
with morality.  I can imagine some examples in which
<br>
a better understanding can lead to more objective
<br>
morality:
<br>
<p>- If we understand how charging interest for loans
<br>
develops an economy, we will not call charging
<br>
interest immoral.
<br>
<p>- If it turns out that homosexuality is largely
<br>
genetically or environmentally determined, rather
<br>
than a free choice, people may accept it more.
<br>
<p>But I don't know that this always plays out so neatly.
<br>
The more we understand about human behavior,
<br>
the more we can trace it to causes, and the less
<br>
responsible people seem to be for their behavior.
<br>
Complete understanding may simply explode even
<br>
the notion of morality.  For example
<br>
<p>- Child molesters were in most cases molested
<br>
or abused themselves as children.
<br>
<p>- Stepparents are more likely to abuse stepchildren
<br>
than natural parents are to abuse natural children.
<br>
But this makes genetic sense for them.
<br>
<p>- It makes more evolutionary sense for men than for
<br>
women to be promiscuous; at the same time, it makes
<br>
more sense for men than for women not to tolerate
<br>
promiscuity in their mate.
<br>
<p>Does understanding the cause of &quot;immoral&quot; behavior
<br>
make it more acceptable?  More moral?  Or does it
<br>
just leave us unable to figure out what &quot;moral&quot; means?
<br>
<p>Also, post-singularity, the human species may
<br>
rapidly diverge into a large number of species
<br>
such that it is no longer feasible to maintain
<br>
moral relations between them.  So increasing
<br>
knowledge may make the subjectivity of morality
<br>
more obvious.
<br>
<p>Just thinking aloud.
<br>
