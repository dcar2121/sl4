<p>The brain's construction of chained memories and actions is probably 
<br>
another tree, though a more functional metaphor might be the 
<br>
candelabra-shaped railroad marshaling yard, with words for cars: imagine 
<br>
that many trains are randomly constructed on the parallel tracks. but only 
<br>
the best is selected to be let loose on the 'main track' of consciousness 
<br>
and speech. Best is determined by memories of the fate of somewhat similar 
<br>
sequences in the past, and one presumes a series of selection steps2 that 
<br>
shape up candidates into increasingly more realistic sequences. This 
<br>
selection among stochastic sequences is more analogous to the ways of 
<br>
darwinian evolutionary biology than to the 'von Neumann machine' serial 
<br>
computer. One might call it a Darwin Machine3 instead: it shapes up 
<br>
thoughts in milliseconds rather than millennia, and uses innocuous 
<br>
remembered environments rather than the noxious real-life ones.
<br>
<p>Calvin, W. H. (1987).  The brain as a Darwin machine.  Nature 330:33-34 (5 
<br>
November).  Available at  WilliamCalvin.com/1980s/1987Nature.pdf

<br>
<p>The darwinian competition of ideas, which the nineteenth century identified 
<br>
as a basis of thought, suggests that we might gain some insight about 
<br>
thinking from a study of evolutionary mechanisms that usually operate on 
<br>
long time scales. But in ideas, we are always dealing with a string of 
<br>
words or more elaborate concepts. How do we compare strings? How do masses 
<br>
of nerve cells interact to shape up new concepts from random noise? How do 
<br>
a group of nerve cells get together to initiate a movement?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's actually not too different from how fancy tools can be shaped 
<br>
up by random bashing about. And how we devise &quot;logical&quot; shortcuts when we 
<br>
want to repeat a success.
<br>

<br>
<p>And I still have not found exactly what I was looking for.  Somewhere I 
<br>
have read an analysis of grammar errors which made the case that most were 
<br>
the result of  sentences coming out of the mental serial sequencer before 
<br>
the sentence had been run through enough selection cycles to be completely 
<br>
grammar corrected.
<br>
<p>It might have been in an article that also looked at &quot;bit stuffing,&quot; using 
<br>
fillers such as &quot;you know&quot; in an attempt to keep the communication channel 
<br>
from being turned around.  Of course putting in filler words partly jams up 
<br>
the circuits and slows down the production of real information.  Which is 
<br>
why speaking slower is a good idea instead of stuffing your speech with aha 
<br>
and ands.   :-)
<br>
<p>Will try again this evening,
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
