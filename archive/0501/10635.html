<em>&gt; &gt; clue exactly what it will take to make a human level AI, let alone an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capable of doing serious harm to the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your two statements of certainty are in direct conflict with each other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I don't see how you can hold both at the same time.
</em><br>
<p>I fail to see the conflict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If on one hand you claim there is an absolutely zero chance, then you
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it takes for &quot;take off&quot; then how can you claim a zero chance.
</em><br>
<p>If a person *absolutely* doesn't know how to do something, why wouldn't that
<br>
give them zero chance of accomplishing the goal?  Are you saying that I
<br>
might just luck out and stumble upon the answer and therefore can't be 100%
<br>
certain of failure?  Your logic escapes me.  Can you imagine accidentally
<br>
making a car?  A car is far more likely to be created by accident than an AI
<br>
would be.  I might agree on the possibility of an accidental take off if
<br>
*any* AI project was even close to a human level, but sadly that is
<br>
definitely not the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course the answer is that no one should be claiming a zero chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the other answer is that we need to continue gaining more knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But because of the unknowns, gaining that knowledge should be done in as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe a manner as possible.
</em><br>
<p>Safety is something you will *absolutely* get if you never write any code.
<br>
I couldn't agree more with the need for more knowledge.  I am only
<br>
disagreeing with the method for getting it.  The only way I have ever found
<br>
to really know a software algorithm is to make a successful program of it.
<br>
I have been surprised many times by thinking a technique would work or be
<br>
fast enough, only to find out just how wrong I was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For some reason this reminds me of the worries at the time of the a-bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many of the physicists had about whether it would accidentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignite the entire atmosphere. They didn't know at first what would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen, and most of them would not have told you that the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was &quot;absolutely zero&quot;. In fact even after they ran some numbers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper, they still weren't absolutely certain. But they did by that point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have enough odds in their favor to proceed. But even at the end when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was tested they were still heard betting with each other on the outcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was never absolute certainty.
</em><br>
<p>How is it any comparison.  The people working on the A-bomb didn't just send
<br>
the first bomb over Hiroshima without any successful tests.  They had many
<br>
years of very expensive and extensive tests that lead up to the ignition of
<br>
the first A-bomb.  How does that compare with the effort at SIAI?  I am not
<br>
putting down the effort made so far by the SIAI but please don't make
<br>
comparisons with the development of the A-bomb.  Your group isn't close to
<br>
that development group by many orders of magnitude.  Who knows what you
<br>
might be if the government of the USA spent the same amount of money through
<br>
the SIAI as was spent in developing the A-bomb?
