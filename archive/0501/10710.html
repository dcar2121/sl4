<p>Of course it could. But if I understood Marc correctly, he does not try to 
<br>
argue that FAI and going toward omega point is equivalent. He is saying 
<br>
that he has a hunch that they are equivalent and that he is trying to see, 
<br>
what it leads to. 
<br>
<p>Anyways, I think that we should divide the problem into certain categories 
<br>
to make it more understandable. 
<br>
<p>First we can make proposals as potential FAI designs. These may be in the 
<br>
form of required component, or something that must not be in the FAI. 
<br>
<p>Then we can create methods for analyzing where each of these designs will 
<br>
lead to. 
<br>
<p>And finally we can create better methods for analyzing both parts of the 
<br>
problem. 
<br>
<p><p>What is important at this stage, is not necessarily to create the one true 
<br>
FAI design (IMO). The more important thing is to develop the necessary 
<br>
tools to do all the required analysis. 
<br>
<p>I'll just end with a note that unfortunately I haven't had the time to 
<br>
read Eliezer's current work (since my own PhD research eats my time pretty 
<br>
well and is not quite close enough to the subject at hand). This means I 
<br>
do not know if he's already working on the problem from this angle.
<br>
<p><p>This problem of FAI is such that it does require - it deserves - such 
<br>
attention that proper methods and tools are created for scientific enquiry 
<br>
concerning it.
