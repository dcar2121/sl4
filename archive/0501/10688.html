</em><br>
<p>&quot;Obvious&quot; simply DOES NOT COUNT on the scientific frontier.  *Any* 
<br>
scientific frontier, not just those on which lives depend.  Nature has this 
<br>
disconcerting habit of coming back and saying &quot;So what?&quot;
<br>
<p>And no, this is not the Ineluctable Hazard of Reason which applies equally 
<br>
to all thoughts and may therefore be ignored.  Nature says &quot;So what?&quot; 
<br>
significantly less often to some kinds of thinking than others, and if you 
<br>
look closely enough at scientific history, you start to see a pattern. 
<br>
Nature sometimes but very rarely says &quot;So what?&quot; to quantitative 
<br>
calculations based on a confirmed model of a specific phenomenon.  On the 
<br>
other hand, when it comes to passionate verbal argument about the 
<br>
entanglement of morality with some poorly understood outcome, Nature says 
<br>
&quot;So what?&quot; so often you'd think She wasn't even listening.  &quot;Obvious&quot; in a 
<br>
case where you have no clue how to perform a quantitative calculation falls 
<br>
somewhere between those two cases.  If it's a yes-or-no question on a 
<br>
poorly understood scientific frontier, the obvious answer is probably 
<br>
correct, oh, say, no more than 2 times out of 3.  If it's not a yes-or-no 
<br>
question, forget it, you're screwed without a technical model.
<br>
<p>I cannot calculate how much hardware, quantitatively, it takes to run an 
<br>
intelligence which is effectively transhuman in the sense of being able to 
<br>
beat up humanity and take away our lunch money.  I guess that the answer to 
<br>
the yes-or-no question, &quot;More or less hardware than a modern personal 
<br>
computer?&quot; is &quot;Less.&quot;  I cannot calculate how much cumulative optimization 
<br>
pressure it takes to produce something dangerous.  I guess that the answer 
<br>
to the yes-or-no question, &quot;More or less cumulative optimization pressure 
<br>
than modern GA-based systems with a few design improvements running for a 
<br>
year on expensive hardware?&quot; is &quot;More&quot;.  But I am not ABSOLUTELY SURE of 
<br>
either answer.  That is not just dutiful uncertainty to impress others with 
<br>
my rationality; I anticipate that the outcome might really go either way, 
<br>
and I do my best to plan for both cases.
