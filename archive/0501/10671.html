<em>&gt; Actually, this is incorrect.  Bio-safety protocols start out strongest

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I was thinking that at first when I wrote my post above, but then I 
<br>
remembered all sorts of shows I've seen on PBS, etc. where you have 
<br>
scientists roaming about in caves and other places looking for new forms 
<br>
of life. And then they invariably seem to bring their samples back for 
<br>
examination to some dinky looking lab which looks nothing like what I 
<br>
imagine a high safety lab would look like. So there is some disconnect 
<br>
here, or I'm missing something.
