Here are some thoughts along similar lines.
<br>
<p>The basic principle, which appears to be a physical characteristic of 
<br>
the universe, is one of synergy, or non-zero sumness, that operates at 
<br>
every level of complexity.  There's significant research ongoing in the 
<br>
area of self-organizing systems, and this is recognized by some to 
<br>
represent a not yet declared fourth law of thermodynamics, to precisely 
<br>
characterize the dynamics of such systems.
<br>
<p>While the principle appears to apply at the subatomic level, through the 
<br>
dynamics of chemical interactions, through the formation of life and 
<br>
biological complexity, and beyond, my key immediate interest is at the 
<br>
level of human social organization.
<br>
<p>I see this understanding as important because humanity is behaving 
<br>
according to mostly obsolete evolved mechanisms while already at the 
<br>
cusp of a transition beyond which they hardly apply.  I would like to 
<br>
help reduce the pain of this transition, and the nature of our selves 
<br>
and effective interactions seems to be an important part of the way forward.
<br>
<p>At the level of human interactions, there appear to be some abstract 
<br>
principles (related to synergy, non-zero sum game theory, and 
<br>
cooperation theory) that apply and can guide our moral decision-making 
<br>
in the absence of complete information. Now at the risk of sounding 
<br>
mystical and losing my audience:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* There is always Self and Other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self refers to the subjective viewpoint from which all moral 
<br>
decisions are made.  Other refers to the &quot;adjacent possible&quot; with which 
<br>
the Self must interact.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that Self means the system with which one identifies, it is 
<br>
not limited to one's physical self.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The basic good is growth of Self
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where evolutionary theory refers to survival, a deeper 
<br>
understanding would refer to growth.  There is no static survival in a 
<br>
meaningful sense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good&quot; within any subjective context, means &quot;that which works&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Randian/Objectivists will easily agree, true morality (what 
<br>
works) follows from enlightened self-interest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Effective growth of Self requires effective interaction with Other.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth is always a process of the Self system expanding through 
<br>
interaction with the Other system.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not diminish the Other, as the tendency is for non-zero 
<br>
sum benefits to accrue and complexity to increase within the larger system.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Effective growth derives from cooperation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation requires both common goals and diversity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in a given sub-context generally looks like 
<br>
cooperation in a broader context.
<br>
<p>Some examples in moral rules context:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Thou shalt not kill (because God says so)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self defense is always right, in fact, morally required, because 
<br>
the basic good is growth of Self.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing is wrong because it diminishes diversity and effective 
<br>
interaction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Treat others as you would wish to be treated (Golden Rule)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because effective growth of Self derives from effective 
<br>
cooperation with Other.
<br>
<p><p>There's enough in the above to give a strong hint of how to apply these 
<br>
principles in the domain of human social interaction and morality.  I'm 
<br>
quite aware that it sounds a bit &quot;White-Lighterish&quot; and the description 
<br>
lacks technical rigor, but I offer it with the hope and expectation that 
<br>
it may promote useful thinking among others. Thoughtful feedback is 
<br>
welcomed.
