<p>For shame!  Or...something. :)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a clear role it must play in a successful colony.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that solitary creatures seem very
<br>
alien.  Cats are almost as popular as dogs, and
<br>
are far less social, generally.
<br>
<p>In any case:  It is clear that &quot;oughts&quot; stem from
<br>
a goal; you can't have an &quot;ought&quot; without a goal
<br>
to strive toward.  An individual can have a goal,
<br>
and therefore can have actions which he ought to
<br>
perform.  It is not at all clear to me that a
<br>
collection of individuals can be said to have a
<br>
goal, except by verifying that all individuals
<br>
within the collection have that goal.  Ants, as
<br>
Phil Goetz has remarked, are not really individuals,
<br>
mostly (there may be some species of ant which does
<br>
not follow the queen/worker model for all I know).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; If either side consistently cheats or resorts to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil war. The hive is rent asunder because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ants could not restrain themselves.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree very much with your equation of ant
<br>
colonies and political systems, but SL4 is probably
<br>
not the right venue for that discussion. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cause and effect might be regarded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective, but that is not really the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'objective morality.'
</em><br>
[snip scientist/objective observer]
<br>
<em>&gt; You see, the idea that there is an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality IMHO depends on an outside observer who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judges. William Blake used to call him Old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobodaddy.
</em><br>
<p>Right now, my position is that while I can't argue
<br>
conclusively for an objective morality, there is
<br>
non-conclusive evidence that such a thing may exist
<br>
(game theory, for example).  If it does, there will
<br>
be some ultimate goal which it concerns.  Where I
<br>
part with Geddes in this is that I think it's a
<br>
mistake to prematurely guess at what that goal might
<br>
be, if it exists.  But since reaching a goal depends
<br>
on one's existence, I believe that there would be
<br>
provisionally moral actions to be taken (at least
<br>
survival and growth) even for the sole individual in
<br>
existence or in a large area.  This whole house of
<br>
cards depends strongly on the idea that some later,
<br>
presumably more intelligent being will find out what
<br>
the objective ultimate goal is.
