<em>&gt; I think what Eliezer just posted fits here too:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;But I do not know how to calculate the space of AGI programs that go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FOOM.  (It's an odd inability, I know, since so many others seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blessed with this knowledge.)  I don't know Novamente's source code, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't calculate its probability of going FOOM even if I had it.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just know the first rule of gun safety, which is that a gun is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loaded.
</em><br>
<p>IMO, this is foolish.
<br>
<p>It is obvious that a GP-based optimizer running on less than a million PC's
<br>
(to be conservative) is not gonna take-off, transcend, become self-aware,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>It's obvious that Cyc, SOAR and EURISKO are not going to do so.
<br>
<p>True, we can't prove this rigorously -- but we also can't prove rigorously
<br>
that any given virus in a bio lab isn't going to mutate into a horrible
<br>
disease that's going to kill us all next week.  On these, and many other
<br>
matters, we rely on scientific intuition bolstered by our much relevant
<br>
knowledge.
