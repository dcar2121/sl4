I said I wouldn't say more but I will just add this clarification.

Subject: Re: When does it pay to play (lottery)?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Disregarding issues I still have with your analogies, I think you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sidestepping the original statement from David, which was regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *any* AGI implementations in the *near future*. I interpret that to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include things like Novamente within the remainder of this decade, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps that's not what he meant?
</em><br>
<p>Near future to me is 2-3 years not 10.  I also believe that advanced if not
<br>
super-human intelligence is doable within the next 15-20 years.  I would be
<br>
very surprised if Ben's project isn't eventually sucessful but I don't think
<br>
it will look like what is he has today.  Just a guess, I certainly could be
<br>
wrong.  The reason I made such a statement is that noone can claim that they
<br>
are close to human level intelligence or that any like that is imminent.
<br>
That would mean to me that no *take off* could occur for at least the next
<br>
few years.  Looking further into the future is only quess work and isn't
<br>
based on what exists today.
<br>
<p>Some people believe that coming close to human level intelligence and that
<br>
AI going super intelligent will occur within a short time frame (1-2 years).
<br>
Even if we are capable of creating something like human intelligence, I
<br>
think our limited brain capabilities will limit how fast the AI goes super
<br>
intelligent *unless* it does that by itself.  I have great skeptisism about
<br>
any programs ability to recursively enhance it's intelligence or
<br>
computational efficiency past a small percentage like 30%.  Humans certainly
<br>
have no ability to increase their intelligence or efficiency for that matter
<br>
without the help of other humans.  If you have evidence that shows that this
<br>
recursive brain boosting can occur please reference it so I can study it.  I
<br>
am aware of a company that says it's optimizing compiler can optimize some
<br>
brands of programs but I think you will see that the increased speed is *one
<br>
time only* and the % increase only significant on the worst coded programs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's the quote again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The chance that *any* implementation of AI will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *take off* in the near future is absolutely zero.  We haven't the foggiest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clue exactly what it will take to make a human level AI, let alone an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of doing serious harm to the human race.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That combined with his casual &quot;Oh and even if it does take off it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be constrained by current day hardware&quot; kind of set me off. These aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the kinds of attitudes that you would expect or hope to hear from people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing this kind of work.
</em><br>
<p>Your condescending attitude definitely *set me off*.  If you have all this
<br>
proof and evidence that AI is so scary or so imminent please share your
<br>
sources.
<br>
