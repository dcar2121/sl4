I agree with Ben's position on friendliness even though I don't agree with
<br>
his agent approach to AGI.  The chance that *any* implementation of AI will
<br>
*take off* in the near future is absolutely zero.  We haven't the foggiest
<br>
clue exactly what it will take to make a human level AI, let alone an AI
<br>
capable of doing serious harm to the human race.  What we need is some
<br>
&quot;hands on&quot; working prototypes so that we can see were success lies and where
<br>
it doesn't.  In the worst case scenario, our current limited hardware will
<br>
constrain the AI to a much less than human intelligence in any case.
<br>
Writing software is like writing a book, at some point you just have to
<br>
start writing.  Worrying about the game 10 steps out in front is fine but in
<br>
real world software, it is not very useful.  Most of the time, to program
<br>
step 2, you have to have the detail information from step 1 etc.  Worrying
<br>
about whatif's 20 steps down the road won't move the goal of AGI forward.
<br>
We just don't know enough about what it takes to make intelligence using
<br>
conventional computers.  All the study of human brains and how we think is
<br>
fine, but will that help us to program a *real* AI in the *real* world?  If
<br>
it does, show me the prototype.  If you have a great idea for a working AI
<br>
then just show me.  Talk is cheap.  Kudos for Ben for at least having some
<br>
working code.
<br>
<p><p><p>I thought the points made by Harvey Newstrom about taking an engineering
<br>
approach was very good, however, engineering works best when you know your
<br>
tools and your requirements.  How do you use an engineering approach when
<br>
you don't know what tools to use, what exactly the problem really is, or
<br>
even what approach to take to solve the problem?  With an AGI, *everything*
<br>
is an unknown.  Engineering works with things that are known.
<br>
<p><p><p>I don't mean to sound so harsh to Eliezer's philosophical approach but
<br>
designs and philosophy are admirable goals but if we are talking about a
<br>
software system that works in the real world, then what you see is what
<br>
matters.  Even if most of the plan was on paper but *something* was in
<br>
software, my complaint would be retracted.  I also haven't started to
<br>
actually write my AI code so this same criticism also applies to me.
<br>
<p><p><p>Even though I don't think Marc's rantings are worth responding to, I was
<br>
*very* impressed by the logical critique by Harvey Newstrom.  If only the
<br>
world could reason so clearly.
