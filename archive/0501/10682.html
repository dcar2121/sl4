<p>
Heh...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not what I meant at all!  I am speculating that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal of driving the universe towards the Omega Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with optimum efficiently would actually, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence, lead to everything we would desire in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly A.I (like altruism towards humans etc).
</em><br>
<p>Well, one can construct an argument that if the Omega Point as Tipler
<br>
conceives it really exists, then the ethically optimal thing to do is to
<br>
MAXIMIZE THE ODDS of (everyone) getting to the Omega Point.
<br>
<p>I.e.: If heaven-for-all is plausibly achievable, then the most important
<br>
thing is to maximize the odds of achieving it, and milking the most out of
<br>
the pre-heaven interval isn't too important.
<br>
<p>However, there are a couple problems here:
<br>
<p>1) Though Friendly AI seems a difficult goal, I'm not quite ready to assume
<br>
it's as difficult as the Omega Point.  I.e., I consider it reasonably
<br>
plausible that the Omega Point of heaven-via-physics doesn't exist and yet
<br>
Friendly AI is achievable by some simpler means...
<br>
<p>2) It seems very unlikely that being nice to anyone is critical for getting
<br>
to the Omega Point, at least according to Tipler's conception of it.  A la
<br>
Tipler, getting there should involve reshaping matter across the universe in
<br>
such a way as to cause the right sort of (geometric) singularity at the Big
<br>
Crunch.  This has little to do with nice-ness except in the sense that the
<br>
end goal is supposed to be very nice.
<br>
<p>So, it seems that you're extending Tipler's conception of the Omega Point in
<br>
a big way, by hypothesizing some kind of subtle connection between *the laws
<br>
of physics* and your posited *laws of universal morality*.  Is that right?
<br>
<p>IMO the only &quot;laws of morality&quot; we find embedded in the laws of physics are
<br>
simple and generic things like &quot;increase growth and diversity&quot; or
<br>
something....
<br>
<p>But evidently you think that &quot;don't cause pain to highly conscious beings&quot;
<br>
is going to be tied up with &quot;move maximally fast toward the Omega point&quot;
<br>
inside the as-yet-unknown future laws of physics.
<br>
<p>But why do you think that?  Is it just an intuition from out of nowhere, or
<br>
is there some detailed philosophical justification?
<br>
