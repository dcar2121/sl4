<p>
The following will not make sense unless you've read &quot;A Technical 
<br>
Explanation of Technical Explanation&quot;.
<br>
<p>In TechExp, I suggested that a &quot;technical&quot; model is a model which makes 
<br>
*sharp* predictions, that is, concentrates its probability mass into a tiny 
<br>
volume in the space of possible outcomes.
<br>
<p>What we want for assurance of Friendliness is an accurate (calibrated and 
<br>
confirmed) technical model of the FAI, a model which sends essentially 
<br>
*all* of its probability mass into the Friendly space of outcomes.  That 
<br>
is, we would have a legitimate, technical assurance of continued 
<br>
Friendliness, given the starting data, starting code, and chips that 
<br>
behaved like the designer said they did.  (Actually, we would want to 
<br>
encode some probability of error in both the transistors and the chip 
<br>
specification, test for that outcome, and require that a single bitflip not 
<br>
destroy the system.  All of this can be handled quantitatively and 
<br>
technically, just as in _Nanosystems_ Drexler carefully stacks together 
<br>
probabilistic carbon atoms to produce a rod logic unit with a failure 
<br>
probability of 10^-64.)
<br>
<p>How would we achieve this assurance?  By explicitly encoding the technical 
<br>
model and asking the FAI to verify its own code.
<br>
<p>Then what is a *technical* definition of Friendliness?  A technical 
<br>
definition of &quot;Friendliness&quot; would be an invariant which you can prove a 
<br>
recursively self-improving optimizer obeys.
<br>
<p>This doesn't address the issue of choosing the right invariant, or being 
<br>
able to design an invariant that specifies what you think it specifies, or 
<br>
even having a framework for invariants that won't *automatically* kill you. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be possible to design a physically realizable, recursively 
<br>
self-improving version of AIXI such that it would stably maintain the 
<br>
invariant of &quot;maximize reward channel&quot;.  But the AI might alter the &quot;reward 
<br>
channel&quot; to refer to an internal, easily incremented counter, instead of 
<br>
the big green button attached to the AI; and your formal definition of 
<br>
&quot;reward channel&quot; would still match the result.  The result would obey the 
<br>
theorem, but you would have proved something unhelpful.  Or even if 
<br>
everything worked exactly as Hutter specified in his paper, AIXI would 
<br>
rewrite its future light cone to maximize the probability of keeping the 
<br>
reward channel maximized, with absolutely no other considerations (like 
<br>
human lives) taken into account.
<br>
<p>Once you specify an invariant and set it into motion, how do you guarantee 
<br>
that what happens will match the pleasant mental imagery inside your head 
<br>
that led you to specify that invariant?  The binding between human 
<br>
intention and human design is weak, untechnical, and unverifiable, because 
<br>
human intelligence itself is weak, untechnical, and unverifiable.  So I 
<br>
want to ask the AI itself to re-verify the binding between human intentions 
<br>
and human designs that gave rise to my attempt to specify an invariant. 
<br>
That's something I'm still trying to figure out.
<br>
<p>I want to describe a stronger way of binding together an invariant and a 
<br>
programmer's intention than the programmer just writing down something that 
<br>
he hopes will fit his mental imagery.  I don't want to set an invariant in 
<br>
motion blindly, like a stone rolling down a hill, based on an uncomputed 
<br>
hope that my keystrokes match my dreams.  I want a framework that describes 
<br>
the programmers' fallible intelligence as a part of the causal process that 
<br>
gives rise to the AI.  I want to verify the invariant against the 
<br>
programmers, and not just the AI code against the invariant.  I want this 
<br>
framework to be a formal part of the theory and be formally verifiable by 
<br>
the AI, maybe not at near-certain probability like the dynamics at 
<br>
transistors, but still with, say, 90% probability.  And I want to use the 
<br>
verification framework to describe the verification framework itself, to 
<br>
confirm that the verifier matches what humans intended from the 
<br>
&quot;verification protocol&quot;.
<br>
<p>I want to take the complete causal process leading up to the creation of an 
<br>
AI, and have the AI scrutinize the entire process to detect and report 
<br>
anything that a human being would call a mistake.  We could do that 
<br>
ourselves.  Should an AI do less?
<br>
<p>This breaks down FAI into four problems:
<br>
<p>1)  Devise a technical specification of a class of invariants, such that it 
<br>
is possible to prove a recursively self-improving optimizer stays within 
<br>
that invariant.
<br>
2)  Given an invariant, devise an RSIO such that it proves itself to follow 
<br>
the invariant.  (The RSIO's proof may be, e.g., a proof that the RSIO is 
<br>
stable if Peano Arithmetic is consistent.)
<br>
3)  Devise a framework and a formal verification protocol for translating a 
<br>
human intention (e.g. &quot;implement the collective volition of humankind&quot;) 
<br>
into an invariant.  This requirement interacts strongly with (1) because 
<br>
the permitted class of invariants has to be able to represent the output of 
<br>
the protocol.
<br>
4)  Intend something good.
