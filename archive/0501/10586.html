Hi Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how the subjective experience of qualia is connected to the neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlates of qualia. ........but the tricky question is how a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system (the brain) can &quot;generate&quot; subjective, phenomenal experiences. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh dear....having jumped in I feel like I'm in over my head already!  :)  
<br>
<p>What follows is just intuition, with no research or deep reading foundation at 
<br>
all.......  
<br>
<p>Let's say I look at something and I see/feel &quot;red&quot; colour.  First my brain lumps 
<br>
lots of different frequencies under a limited pallete of colours that have a 
<br>
network in the brain.  So pure frequencies and mixtures of light frequencies 
<br>
are all routed to the same colour network.  Also my brain corrects for light 
<br>
intensity and context  etc. So many different external light stimuli trigger a 
<br>
certain 'redness' network in the brain.  This colour network has evolved since 
<br>
colour vision exisited and also has a particular evolutionary history leading to 
<br>
humans - so chances are most humans know they are seeing the 'same' red 
<br>
because the recognition system has, through evolution, created much the 
<br>
same response structure in most human brains (exceptions for colour 
<br>
blindness phenomena, also cultural and training experience will modify the 
<br>
response).  My guess is that the pallete of colours (smells, tastes, tactile, all 
<br>
other sense feelings) we see is a bit like a hard-wired language - especially 
<br>
important in social beings that need to intuitively understand each other (ie. 
<br>
the system evolved a long time before word-based language) and relates to 
<br>
the value of social animals being able to 'mind read' ie. it is valuable for 
<br>
coordination to have a set of similar qualia experiences going in on in many 
<br>
brains so that the animals are working to the same 'story'.  Also my guess is 
<br>
that qualia are linked fairly closely to the neural 'attention system' - are qualia 
<br>
apparent to anyone if they are not paying attention to a phenomenon? My 
<br>
intuition is to say they are not.  
<br>
<p>My guess is that when we pay attention to sensory, or other data that our 
<br>
brains connects with a quasi-sensory response, the data is tagged with labels 
<br>
that are used to trigger a suite of qualia responses - deep hard-wired patterns 
<br>
and associations built up through life - linking to memories, emotions etc. My 
<br>
guess is that it is the richness of associations that makes the qualia feel rich.  
<br>
But this would be very demanding of brain processing capacity so I imagine 
<br>
that is why 'qualia triggering' would only be done in relation to things we are 
<br>
paying attention to.
<br>
<p>Am I right in feeling that many people associate the experience of qualia with 
<br>
the inuitive/folk notion of 'consciousness'?  If so, the connection might be the 
<br>
'attention system' linkage?
<br>
<p>I don't know whether any of what I've said deals with the 'hard problem' that 
<br>
you felt I had not addresses in my last message.  Let me know!  :)
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
