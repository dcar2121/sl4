Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's interesting that you are using the exact same flawed analogy class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Ben did in his response. The answer is the same as I gave him: your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy is incorrect because we know with great detail using existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics whether a given car design will actually result in a working car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not. With a given AGI design we do not know at all (you may think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, but if I ask you to prove it you will be unable to provide me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything near the level of concrete proof of design-worthiness that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car designer could provide using a physics model).
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.... Brian, IMO, this is not quite correct.
<br>
<p>We know with great detail that Cyc, SOAR and GP (to name three AI
<br>
systems/frameworks) will not result in an AI system capable of hard takeoff.
<br>
<p>And, we know this with MORE certainty than we know that no one now knows how
<br>
to build a ladder to Andromeda.
<br>
<p>IMO, it's more likely that next year some genius scientist will come up with
<br>
a funky self-organizing nano-compound creating a self-growing ladder to
<br>
Andromeda, than that one of these simplistic so-called AI systems will
<br>
self-organize itself into a hard takeoff.  Not all scientists would agree
<br>
with me on this, but I guess most would.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
