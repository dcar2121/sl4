<p>I also did years of thinking on philosophy of mind when I was a teenager. 
<br>
It's a good thing I didn't spend much time embarassing myself by writing it 
<br>
up, or at least that I didn't publish.  Though I suppose my recent works on 
<br>
Bayes contain &quot;philosophy of mind&quot;; it just happens to be philosophy of 
<br>
mind that can be applied to perform quantitative calculations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; About probability theory: I agree with Eliezer that in principle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain-minds act as if they were obeying an approximation to probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory.  Now, whether this is explicit or implicit in the structure and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have made some arguments as to how Hebbian learning in the brain might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give rise to probabilistic inference on the emergent level.  In an AI system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it may be implicit or explicit depending on the design.  In my own Novamente
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI design it's explicit, and I think Eliezer is proposing to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicit in his AI design as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to the foundation for the claim that probabilistic reasoning is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundational, Cox's mathematical arguments are pretty convincing.  Cox shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that any measure of plausibility that obeys certain very sensible axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *must* be probability:  for a discussion see e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://leuther-analytics.com/bayes/papers.html">http://leuther-analytics.com/bayes/papers.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't fully understand the fuss about &quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; -- to me, Bayes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule is just one among many useful mathematical rules derivable from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms of elementary probability theory, which IMO are the correct axioms to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use for making intelligent judgments in the face of uncertainty.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; nowadays appears to be used to describe reasoning 
<br>
obeying Cox's laws in general, including the inverse probability theorem 
<br>
a.k.a. Bayes's Rule.  With the distinction that Bayesian statistical 
<br>
techniques tend to be theorems, relating posterior probabilities to 
<br>
explicitly stated assumptions about prior probabilities and likelihood 
<br>
distributions, rather than ad-hoc methods like &quot;gee, let's calculate the 
<br>
squared error, cuz like it's fun&quot;.  A Bayesian would see that trying to 
<br>
minimize the squared error presumes a uniform prior and a Gaussian error 
<br>
function, or some similar assumption that ought to be stated explicitly. 
<br>
At least that is the tradition of Saint Jaynes.
