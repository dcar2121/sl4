I will only pursue this line of thinking with this final email on this

Subject: Re: When does it pay to play (lottery)?

<p><p><em>&gt; It's interesting that you are using the exact same flawed analogy class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Ben did in his response. The answer is the same as I gave him: your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy is incorrect because we know with great detail using existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics whether a given car design will actually result in a working car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not. With a given AGI design we do not know at all (you may think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, but if I ask you to prove it you will be unable to provide me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything near the level of concrete proof of design-worthiness that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car designer could provide using a physics model). Therefore your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that a car is more likely to be created by &quot;accident&quot; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledgeable designers is incorrect in my opinion.
</em><br>
<p>I have had literally hundreds of end users of my programs swear to me that
<br>
some data field was changed by a program all by itself.  I have done global
<br>
searches and can prove at least to myself that the program had absolutely no
<br>
way to change that particular field.  I have explained that software doesn't
<br>
just up and work in 1 way 10,000 times and then for no reason at all, do
<br>
something entirely different, even though it has no code with which to do
<br>
it.  I am not talking about the occational hardware malfunction.  I am not
<br>
talking about the occational garbage that might be dumped in any random
<br>
place on a hard drive.
<br>
<p>If software could just do whatever it wanted, then absolutely none of the
<br>
projects I have made could ever have worked.  There are times when some
<br>
problems occur because of some memory leak, or concurrency problems etc.,
<br>
but these are not what we are talking about.  If I have designed a program
<br>
to learn on it's own, develop it's own goals, be creative, spread to other
<br>
machines etc, then your argument might have some weight but an AGI wannabe
<br>
program without these attibutes has *no chance* of just gaining these
<br>
abilities by itself.  Software just doesn't work like that.  The probability
<br>
of a supremely complicated system appearing *by mistake* is directly
<br>
proportional to it's complexity.  The more complex, the less likely it could
<br>
just happen.  If you are talking about a *very* compicated system then the
<br>
probability approximates zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The whole point here is that you have no way of telling with any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute certainty whether or not a project that thinks its design will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to real AGI is close or not to taking off, or what exact point it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may do so. This is why I see a large conflict in your original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements. For my analysis to be incorrect you would need to have as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much concrete knowledge about how AGIs work as a physicist has about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics - and no one has that much knowledge yet.
</em><br>
<p>I need the *concrete* knowledge to suceed, not fail.  I have *never*
<br>
accidently created a working program by mistake.  It is only with perfect
<br>
knowledge (in that small domain) that I have ever got any programs to work
<br>
correctly.  I have *never* been pleasantly surprised at the resulting
<br>
program, quite the opposite.
<br>
<p>It might be that you are thinking of people who think that intelligence is
<br>
emergent from some complex froth of computation and that this emergent
<br>
intelligence (that was never programmed for directly) could get away from
<br>
it's designer.  I don't believe intelligence is emergent.  I can't imagine
<br>
making a program based on that phyilosophy.  I imagine an AI that is
<br>
programmed in a manner which conventional computers are programmed and my
<br>
arguments are directed at that view.
<br>
<p>If emergent intelligence is what your argumments are directed at: I would
<br>
point out that even if human intelligence is obtained by an emergence from
<br>
our complex neuron froth, babies take at least 20 odd years to show even
<br>
normal human level intelligence.  Regardless of how complex a human brain
<br>
is, without the contact with other humans over a huge amount of time, no
<br>
complex intelligence has very been detected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And perhaps you'll be surprised someday when your shiny new AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prototype takes off. All I'm attempting to point out is that you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize you are working with much greater uncertainty than your original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements implied you recognized.
</em><br>
<p>Uncertainty of the design causes bugs and failure, not smarter than human,
<br>
super intelligences that have the capability of annihilating the human race.
