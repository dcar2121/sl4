<em>&gt; Well, when I was a math prof at UNLV, a number
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; liked to gamble on a regular basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These folks had high IQ's, decently long lists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pure-math publications,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Probability theory was, after all, invented a
<br>
couple centuries ago by people who loved to
<br>
gamble and wished to improve their odds.
<br>
<p>An earlier letter poses a lottery ticket as a
<br>
good investment if one values time over money. It
<br>
can be said that time is the only real thing we
<br>
have. Money is but a somewhat fungible method of
<br>
buying time (in the form of goods and services
<br>
which, if one has enough money, can be provided
<br>
in such quantity as to minimize the time one has
<br>
to spend on undesired activities, and to extend
<br>
one's time alive as well).
<br>
<p>When Eliezer supports the 'blue tentacle parable'
<br>
by noting that laws of momentum are always the
<br>
same in our mundane world, he performs a sleight
<br>
of hand in exchanging 'alteration in inalterable
<br>
physical laws' (a true impossibility as we
<br>
understand it) for 'waking up with a blue
<br>
tentacle' (a heretofore impossible situation
<br>
which, given more advanced technology, becomes
<br>
more and more plausible, like landing a video
<br>
camera in the mud on Titan, while not becoming
<br>
likely unless someone has a motive to use such
<br>
possible technology in such a way). One can put a
<br>
rubber tentacle over a drunk friend's arm (see
<br>
shamings.com for activities almost as nefarious!)
<br>
What I am saying is that Eliezer could have
<br>
proposed that one imagine waking up and finding
<br>
that gravity is altered, or some similar true
<br>
viloation of physical law.
<br>
<p>Given these considerations, I would have answered
<br>
Eliezer's blue-tentacle question with a much more
<br>
likely hypothesis: Since the sudden appearance of
<br>
a blue tentacle is so improbable, and since you
<br>
ask, I am most probably dreaming, until I can
<br>
gather good evidence otherwise.
<br>
<p>Eliezer asserts that this cannot happen, but I
<br>
suppose I could dream later that it has happened,
<br>
because of having been given the idea.
