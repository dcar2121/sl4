<em>&gt; Suppose that humanity, instead of evolving intelligence on a hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion 200Hz synapses, had instead evolved essentially equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence on a million 2 GHz processors using slightly more efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serial algorithms (my example postulates a factor-of-ten efficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement, no more).  Let's call these alternate selves Humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would anyone here dare to predict, in advance, that it was even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *theoretically possible* to achieve Human-equivalent intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on 200Hz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processors no matter *how* many of them you had?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even I wouldn't dare.  Trying my best to be conservative and to widen my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence interval, my guess is that I would guess 10KHz, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1KHz given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligent programmer, and I would probably have the lowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the crowd - both because of my guess that intelligence doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crunch, and because I knew to widen my confidence intervals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben Goertzel would laugh at me, saying that Human-equivalent intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried out with one thousand sequential serial operations per second was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously impossible.  Perhaps Ben would suggest that I try writing code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that executed with a bound of ten thousand sequential serial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a feel for how restrictive that limit was.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, you're taking my name in vain!!!
<br>
<p>I guess you're saying that if we didn't have some experience with massively
<br>
parallel processing but only with serial computing, we'd think massively
<br>
parallel processing was implausible?
<br>
<p>Well, maybe.  But I wouldn't be so confident that your projection of that
<br>
particular alternate-universe &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot;'s reaction is correct...
<br>
<p>I think that if we only knew about serial computing, it would still seem
<br>
plausible that SOMEHOW something amazing could be done with a massive number
<br>
of very slow processors -- even if we didn't know *what* exactly.
<br>
<p>Just like now, it seems plausible that somehow something amazing can be done
<br>
with quantum computing ... even though as of now we don't really know what
<br>
exactly, as we have so little relevant experience...
