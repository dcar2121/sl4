</em><br>
<p>Hmm... I doubt a nanotech supercomputer will have more than five or
<br>
ten orders of magnitude advantage on the brain in terms of raw
<br>
performance (after all, the brain is already a nanotech computer!),
<br>
which I wouldn't expect to make a lot of difference to the optimal
<br>
software architecture (I'd expect to need thousands to millions of
<br>
orders of magnitude performance difference for that).
<br>
<p>I agree L(P, nanotech supercomputer), or practical AI approximations
<br>
thereof, will probably not closely resemble the brain, but for
<br>
different reasons:
<br>
<p>- An AI needs to be programmable; the brain needs to be evolvable;
<br>
different constraints.
<br>
- Not only do we need to be able to understand an AI well enough to
<br>
build it [1], we also need to be able to understand it well enough to
<br>
be confident of its Friendliness (not just right now, but projected
<br>
over however many generations of whatever learning/self-improvement
<br>
it'll be doing). The brain isn't designed for that.
<br>
- A von Neumann computer is much more flexible than biological neurons
<br>
(you can &quot;rewire&quot; things by storing pointers, timescale on the order
<br>
of microseconds, which is much faster than neurons forming new
<br>
connections). (Not that supercomputers are von Neumann machines,
<br>
strictly speaking, but they resemble them more closely than the brain
<br>
does.)
<br>
- Tradeoffs between serial speed and parallelism.
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>I'm curious: what aspects of AIXI do you see as being potentially
<br>
useful for practical AI?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The mixture of references to Chaitin's omega number and Tipler's Omega Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a bit confusing, no?
</em><br>
<p>In truth I didn't find it so, but that may be because I didn't do more
<br>
than glance at the Omega Point references; in the context of Marc's
<br>
hypothesis 2, which was the only one I was responding to, &quot;omega&quot;
<br>
referred only to Chaitin's work.
<br>
<p>[1] In a sense this is not strictly true; I can think of a potential
<br>
way to get at least semi-hard takeoff going: build the most powerful
<br>
AI system you can, put it in control of self-replicating nanomachinery
<br>
that can make use of naturally occurring raw materials, and let
<br>
evolution (which at this stage would be at least partially directed
<br>
rather than relying purely on random mutation) take over from there.
<br>
(Kids, don't do this experiment at home [2] unless supervised by an
<br>
adult [3].)
<br>
<p>[2] i.e. in your Hubble volume.
<br>
<p>[3] i.e. a Transcendent Power.
