</em><br>
<p>*shrug* The SL4 list is for high-grade discussion, not PR. SIAI's PR
<br>
is on their web site, which strikes me as well written. But
<br>
regardless...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (10)  General intelligence will turn out to subsume
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be inseparable from general intelligence after all.
</em><br>
<p>I hope nobody who's actually working on AI believes this. If anyone
<br>
here is and does, speak up and I'll try to talk you out of it ^.^
<br>
<p>Most of the other items on the list have been covered before, but I'll
<br>
address this one:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) The specific class of functions that goes FOOM is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be found somewhere in a class of recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions designed to investigate special maths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers known as 'Omega numbers' (Discoverer of Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers was mathematician Greg Chaitin)
</em><br>
<p>This is a substantive hypothesis. Here's why I disagree with it.
<br>
<p>Let I(P) = the best way to solve problem P given infinite computing power.
<br>
<p>Let L(P) = the best way to solve problem P given limited computing
<br>
power; for the sake of definiteness, say a nanotech supercomputer,
<br>
which is the most we can plausibly hope to get our hands on in the
<br>
foreseeable future.
<br>
<p>Consider chess as an example.
<br>
<p>We know what I(chess) is: the minimax function.
<br>
<p>What about L(chess)? We have good candidates in the form of a
<br>
collection of very strong chess programs. What do they look like?
<br>
Essentially tweaks (alpha-beta, iterative deepening, NegaScout etc) to
<br>
the minimax function.
<br>
<p>Maybe there's some very clever algorithm that could beat Deep Blue
<br>
while not relying much on minimax, but there's no evidence for such a
<br>
thing thus far, and my guess for what it's worth is that there isn't
<br>
any such.
<br>
<p>So I'll conjecture that L(chess) ~= I(chess).
<br>
<p>What about Go? I(Go) = I(chess) = the minimax function.
<br>
<p>L(Go) is a lot trickier. Go has a lot more possible moves at each
<br>
point than chess, and position evaluation is much less well
<br>
approximated by a simple count of material, and in practice while
<br>
programs of reasonable strength make some use of minimax, they don't
<br>
rely heavily on it. Again, maybe there's some trick to tweaking
<br>
minimax for this job that we just haven't stumbled on, but it doesn't
<br>
look that way.
<br>
<p>So I'll conjecture that L(Go) != I(Go). In other words, as we move to
<br>
a more subtle and complex game, L(P) is diverging from I(P).
<br>
<p>What about real life?
<br>
<p>We have candidates for (or at least plausible steps in the direction
<br>
of) I(real life); AIXI et al. And we note that some formulations of
<br>
these do, as Marc conjectures, relate to Chaitin's omega. But as I
<br>
remarked in a previous discussion a little while ago, there are good
<br>
reasons AIXI is PDFware rather than running code.
<br>
<p>Of course, we don't have candidates for L(real life) - finding one is
<br>
precisely the ultimate goal of AI research! The best we do have thus
<br>
far is the human mind - which looks nothing at all like AIXI and has
<br>
nothing to do with omega.
<br>
<p>Again, maybe there's some trick to making an AIXI-like algorithm
<br>
computationally tractable, which would make L(real life) ~= I(real
<br>
life). But the trend thus far suggests otherwise, and therefore I'll
<br>
conjecture this is not the case, and that L(real life) has no
<br>
significant connection to AIXI, omega etc.
