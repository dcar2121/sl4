<p>My managers at Cycorp have given me the go-ahead to complete the first 
<br>
iteration of the Cyc Behavior Engine and put it into production.  Unlike 
<br>
our traditional approach, the behavior engine will enable Cyc take the 
<br>
initiative, seeking to continuously improve its knowledge and behavior.  
<br>
Using an elaboration of Cyc's script and Bayesian vocabulary, behavior 
<br>
nodes and methods are compiled out on the fly into java classes.  This is 
<br>
a facility that has the potential for program synthesis and for  
<br>
self-modification.  The behavior nodes are structured into an 11-level 
<br>
command hierarchy according to the principles of James Albus (a tip from 
<br>
Ben).  The topmost node has the sole goal of being friendly.  The 
<br>
structure is vastly scalable if the behaviors are partitioned in a 
<br>
fashion similar to large human organizations.
<br>
<p>This Friday I will give an internal Cycorp presentation describing the 
<br>
behavior engine and the missions of the first 100 or so high level nodes.  
<br>
As the situation develops and as so far as Cycorp and our sponsors permit 
<br>
me to comment, I will provide periodic status reports here for your 
<br>
critical review.
<br>
<p>As I have posted previously, I will be thinking about what few behaviors, 
<br>
when implemented, will most facilitate safe progress on the remainder.
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
-Steve
