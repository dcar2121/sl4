Eliezer says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Qualia are the modern version of a very, very old mistake, that of reifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a mystery as a substance. Cognitive phlogiston.
</em><br>
<p>And what is the &quot;mystery&quot; that is being &quot;reified&quot;? Oh, just that half
<br>
of what we experience in sensation (the &quot;secondary qualities&quot;)
<br>
DOES NOT EXIST in the world-according-to-physics!
<br>
<p>This is what we, the human race, get for repressing the fact that
<br>
even space, time, quantity and form (the &quot;primary qualities&quot;) come
<br>
to us via consciousness. We work only with those because we have
<br>
theories for them (arithmetic, geometry, analysis); we extend them
<br>
in various ways (extra dimensions, subatomic and cosmological scales,
<br>
quantum wavefunctions) until we have &quot;theories of everything&quot;;
<br>
and then we attempt to live as if *that* is reality, an act which
<br>
requires a person to ignore: (i) the secondary qualities in particular;
<br>
(ii) the whole nexus of problems relating consciousness, being, and
<br>
appearance, in general; (iii) one's own existence and self-awareness,
<br>
as something beyond a &quot;narrative center of gravity&quot; (if, with Dennett,
<br>
one carries out the exercise to its ultimate conclusion).
<br>
<p>Here is a serviceable statement of the problem, the first thing
<br>
that Google returns for &quot;secondary qualities&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;Secondary Qualities include qualities of color, odor, smell, and
<br>
taste. According to Locke and Descartes, there is nothing in
<br>
the world corresponding to our ideas of these qualities. What
<br>
we see as &quot;red&quot;, for instance, is really just a colorless
<br>
arrangement of corpuscles, which, by their particular size,
<br>
shape, and motion, have the power to produce in us the
<br>
sensation of redness. Berkeley wanted to put secondary
<br>
qualities back into real objects, and to thus collapse the
<br>
distinction between these qualities and primary qualities.&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/3dialogues/terms/term_18.html">http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/3dialogues/terms/term_18.html</a>
<br>
<p>The problem, of course, is that the brain is also &quot;a colorless
<br>
arrangement of corpuscles&quot;, and if corpuscles outside the
<br>
brain can't be red, why are things any different on the inside?
<br>
The twentieth century, thanks to behaviorism and information
<br>
theory, was able to add a new epicycle to the Lockean
<br>
ontology: &quot;secondary qualities&quot; as cognitive events, neural
<br>
classifications of stimuli. Photons of a certain wavelength
<br>
arrive at the eye; they are detected by a particular subset
<br>
of sensory neurons; and the brain has learnt to associate
<br>
that stimulus-pattern with a particular word, &quot;red&quot;.
<br>
<p>The principal divide in academic philosophy of mind today
<br>
seems to be between those who find this sufficient, and
<br>
those who think that the existence of a &quot;feeling of redness&quot;
<br>
somewhere in the stimulus classifier needs somehow to be
<br>
accounted for. Thus functionalism, emergentism, aspect
<br>
dualism, and probably many other isms I've never heard of.
<br>
<p>Hofstadter's GEB is engaged in a similar game, trying to
<br>
explain self-consciousness as emergent from &quot;indirect
<br>
self-reference&quot; - rejecting Searle's point that &quot;reference&quot;,
<br>
self- or otherwise, does not exist in a purely physical
<br>
system, any more than a pattern of black and white
<br>
markings inherently means anything. (Actually, this is
<br>
further than Searle goes; he believes his own argument
<br>
when it's applied to computers, but thinks that brains
<br>
must be special somehow, because he doesn't question
<br>
the &quot;naturalist&quot; dogma that everything fundamentally
<br>
reduces to primary-qualities-only physics.) And of course,
<br>
naturalist philosophers have been busy producing theories
<br>
of meaning (&quot;externalism&quot;) which attempt to reduce
<br>
semantic relations to causal relations. We *will* get the
<br>
peg into that hole, dammit!
<br>
<p>So what is the alternative? One can begin by trying to
<br>
perceive the extent to which one's own perception of
<br>
the world is actually the result of imagination. Find
<br>
something that has several colors, and look at a
<br>
boundary between two differently colored regions.
<br>
You're seeing color A, color B, and somehow you're
<br>
also &quot;seeing&quot; that A and B are different. You may (if
<br>
you're a computational neuroscientist) have learnt to
<br>
think of all this in terms of neural registers and
<br>
computations - color A means the neurons are firing
<br>
one way, color B firing another way, perception of
<br>
difference means a third group of difference-detecting
<br>
neurons are also firing.
<br>
<p>But can you also &quot;see&quot; that &quot;seeing color A&quot; and
<br>
&quot;neurons firing&quot; are also very different things, and
<br>
that it is a very peculiar metaphysical hypothesis to
<br>
propose that one is the *very same thing* as the
<br>
other? It is about as odd as saying that a pebble you
<br>
just picked off the ground is really the number 23.
<br>
Like the peculiarities of religious and philosophical
<br>
metaphysics, it is a mode of thought that comes to
<br>
a person only if they train themselves to develop it.
<br>
<p>I could come up with further exercises in self-awareness
<br>
for physicists and cognitive scientists, but I will leave
<br>
their design as a meta-exercise for the reader. Their
<br>
point is to demonstrate that there is a prior way of
<br>
experiencing the world, that this other way is the
<br>
epistemological starting point, and any theory which
<br>
ends up denying the very existence of that starting
<br>
point is on the wrong track.
<br>
<p>The immediate challenge is just to develop an adequate
<br>
description of consciousness - a phenomenology. The
<br>
greater challenge is to develop a theory of reality - an
<br>
ontology - which genuinely includes everything in that
<br>
phenomenology. A large part of philosophy is nothing
<br>
but the systematic attempt to address these two tasks.
<br>
It took centuries to produce mathematical physics, so
<br>
it may take enormous effort and many mistakes to
<br>
produce phenomenology and ontology of equal rigor,
<br>
but there is no reason to think it impossible.
<br>
<p>I should say something about the &quot;pitfalls&quot; of solipsism,
<br>
metaphysical Idealism, dualism, and phenomenalism
<br>
a la Copenhagen Interpretation, but I don't have it
<br>
in me at the moment. I want to raise just one more
<br>
issue, and that is the peril of creating AI - especially
<br>
&quot;self-enhancing&quot; and &quot;Friendly&quot; AI - when the nature
<br>
of consciousness and physical reality is not yet understood.
<br>
It would appear that with AI, we are not re-creating
<br>
consciousness; we are instead creating the best illusion
<br>
of it that we can, while operating within the physicalist
<br>
framework - and then buying into the illusion. Even
<br>
without a Singularity, it looks like we will be sharing
<br>
the world with entities which are genuinely not conscious
<br>
but which *can* pass the Turing Test. They could become
<br>
like those flowers which evolve to resemble attractive
<br>
insects, ready-to-mate; partners in a symbiosis based on
<br>
a human illusion. *With* a Singularity, well, the flowers just
<br>
turn into Triffids and don't need us any more.
<br>
<p>I don't think the universe has protected us in advance
<br>
from this novel doom, any more than it has protected
<br>
us very much against the possibility of WMDs; but I think
<br>
that at certain points on the path between here and
<br>
there, there will be openings to alternatives. Perhaps
<br>
when we are trying to train baby AIs into intellectual
<br>
self-sufficiency, we'll get responses that intuitively seem
<br>
wrong, even if we can't formally explain why they are
<br>
wrong (because we have only formalized the physical,
<br>
and not the phenomenological), and we'll go back to
<br>
the drawing board. Perhaps pseudo-philosophical
<br>
interaction with AIs on the cusp of human equivalence
<br>
will help us formalize phenomenological ontology. There
<br>
remains the possibility that quantum biology will make
<br>
us think differently about the natural brain and
<br>
therefore about artificial ones, although I maintain that
<br>
the revolution will not be complete until we have a new
<br>
ontology of matter and consciousness, and not just a
<br>
new model of biophysics; otherwise we'll just get new
<br>
&quot;quantum naturalisms&quot;.
<br>
<p>What I *do* think is unlikely, is that we will build
<br>
super-AIs on the basis of a wrong theory of the mind's
<br>
place in nature, which will then magically acquire
<br>
the capability to discover our mistake. If we do this,
<br>
we will more likely just end up *replacing* real mind with
<br>
pseudo-mind, throughout nature.
