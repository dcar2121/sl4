<p>AI may indeed be developed in the next 100 years, but I bet when you were 
<br>
writing about expected utility you were thinking about benefits of FAI, not 
<br>
merely AI. So let me ask you this. Considering that development of safe FAI 
<br>
is equally hard or even harder than the task of creating functional AI, and 
<br>
that in order for humanity to benefit from FAI at all, the thing must work 
<br>
perfectly on the first try, are you still convinced that probability of 
<br>
winning lottery is *significantly* smaller than creation of successful AI 
<br>
and FAI?
<br>
<p>(And as for calculating the total expected utility of supporting FAI 
<br>
research, let's not forget to factor in the expected utility of 
<br>
inadvertently creating UFAI.)
