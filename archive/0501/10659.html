Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Usually the lab begins using strong protocols _after_ the organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has already shown it is dangerous - but with an AGI this may be too late
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wait before applying the strongest safety protocols. Bio labs have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the luxury of fooling around with strange totally unknown things using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low safety protocols initially, because if something does go wrong it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be the end of the world. With an AGI, it's probably not as simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as quarantining a lab or small geographic area when something bad happens.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....
<br>
<p>IMO, the odds of current biology experiments unexpectedly leading to a
<br>
humanity-destroying plague are higher than the odds of current AI systems
<br>
unexpectedly leading to a hard takeoff.  Fortunately both odds are very low.
<br>
<p>If I set Novamente aside and looked at the general rate of progress in
<br>
bioscience vs. AI, I'd have to say that the bio-danger looks more likely to
<br>
increase in the next 10 years than the AI-danger.  Because bioscience has
<br>
been progressing amazingly fast whereas AI has been rather stagnant for a
<br>
long time.
<br>
<p>Given my knowledge of Novamente, however, my assessment is that the
<br>
near-future AI risk is actually larger, because I can see that -- in spite
<br>
of the slow progress in AI in the past -- it is plausible for someone to
<br>
create a superhuman AI within the next few years, if they use the right
<br>
ideas and are adequately funded.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
