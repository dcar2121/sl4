<em>&gt; True, but the brain is known to be highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient in many many areas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g. (to choose a simple example) motion-direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detection neurons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are off by 80 degrees on average but are correct en
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masse due to averaging
</em><br>
<p>This is not necessarily inefficiency.  It may actually
<br>
be very efficient.  Neurons aren't &quot;off by 80 degrees&quot;
<br>
so much as they have wide response zones and respond
<br>
somewhat probabilistically within those zones. 
<br>
Neurons use redundancy to tolerate noise.  In
<br>
exchange, they can use much, much lower voltage levels
<br>
(by about 5 orders of magnitude) than integrated
<br>
circuits do, because they don't need to be completely
<br>
reliable.  This may lead to lower overall power
<br>
requirements for a computation.  You could work out
<br>
the numbers for known systems, but it wouldn't be
<br>
easy.
<br>
<p>There are also generally-accepted results showing
<br>
that noise in neural systems is beneficial, but I
<br>
don't really understand those papers, so I'll just
<br>
say that not all &quot;noise&quot; in the brain is bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Evaluating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; single prospective program requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; passing it through every related cortex area,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaning that you need duplication not only in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the area being evaluated, but in ALL areas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you assume all the competing programs are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evaluated in parallel.  Also important is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you cannot evolve concepts in multiple cortical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; areas at the same time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why?
</em><br>
<p>I shouldn't have stated this so confidently when
<br>
it relies on my personal, not-universally-accepted
<br>
notions of how the brain works.
<br>
<p>If you imagine that the brain processes stimuli,
<br>
and converts them into something like symbols,
<br>
and then manipulates these symbols somewhere (say
<br>
prefrontal cortex) to,
<br>
say, come up with a plan, and then pushes the
<br>
resulting plan symbols back towards the brain's
<br>
posterior (towards motor cortex) to carry out the
<br>
plan, then what I said wouldn't follow.
<br>
<p>I do think that the brain does something like
<br>
symbol-processing, because we can productively
<br>
generate an infinite number of, for instance,
<br>
sentences fitting a language's grammar.
<br>
But I don't think these symbols are cut off
<br>
from the sense data that gives rise to them.
<br>
If this were so, non-verbal priming would not have
<br>
such dramatic effects on abstract thought.  Also,
<br>
concepts would probably be more neatly defined,
<br>
along the lines of necessary and sufficient
<br>
conditions; or at least, we would have difficulty
<br>
working with non-typical category members, working
<br>
with metaphors, etc.  IMHO.
<br>
<p>I think that whenever a &quot;symbol&quot; is active somewhere
<br>
in anterior cortex, it is linked to, and activates (or
<br>
is activated by), a series of cortical areas
<br>
connecting it all the way back to the posterior
<br>
sensory cortex.  There's some evidence for this;
<br>
primarily I'm thinking of experiments that show
<br>
that visualization activates primary visual cortex.
<br>
Damasio's work on &quot;convergence zones&quot; is an example
<br>
of a theory of this type.  Also any theory that
<br>
involves using different frequencies to create
<br>
different &quot;bindings&quot; between cortical areas. 
<br>
<p>Say you're using neural darwinism in cortex area A to
<br>
select between different planned movement sequences.  
<br>
If you buy into my notion of how the brain works,
<br>
that means that each competing program in area A has
<br>
to be activating all of the other cortical areas
<br>
that create/correlate with the &quot;symbols&quot; being used
<br>
in area A.  All the way back into sensory cortex,
<br>
or at least premotor cortex.  And to prevent
<br>
collisions, that means that EVERY SINGLE CONCEPT
<br>
stored in every cortical area needs to be stored
<br>
hundreds of times over, so that these hundreds of
<br>
copies can be activated separately and used
<br>
simultaneously by competing programs in your planning
<br>
cortex.
<br>
<p>(I'm not talking about the ordinary sort of redundancy
<br>
in the brain.  Each of these hundreds of copies has
<br>
got to have that level of redundancy.)
<br>
<p>You could probably calculate whether this is possible.
<br>
We have some &quot;maps&quot; of temporal cortex indicating
<br>
where
<br>
&quot;words&quot; of various types are stored.  You could
<br>
probably estimate the number of different &quot;words&quot;
<br>
stored in a particular area of cortex, and estimate
<br>
the number of neurons in that area, and figure out
<br>
whether or not the number of neurons is in fact at
<br>
least a hundred times as many as you would need to
<br>
store those words.  But, again, this calculation
<br>
would not be trivial.
<br>
<p>I should probably re-read this before sending,
<br>
but I'm too tired.
