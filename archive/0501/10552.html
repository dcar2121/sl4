<p>When I have this conversation with intelligent lottery players, the usual

answer is &quot;Yes, but it's fun to try.&quot;

<p>Most lottery players know the expected value of a lottery ticket is less

than the price they pay for the ticket, but they play anyway because they

like the psychological drama of it.

<p>In this case, you are underestimating both the intelligence and the

psychological perversity of the average human, it would seem...

<p>p.s. In case you were wondering, I have never purchased a lottery ticket.
<br>
However, I have played casino games in Las Vegas from time to time, knowing
<br>
the odds were against me (I lived in Vegas for 4 years in the early 90's,
<br>
when I was on the faculty of UNLV.  I always did so in a group, with friends
<br>
who liked gambling, so my essential motivation was social.  But I did enjoy
<br>
the psychological drama of it anyway, a little bit, even though I knew the
<br>
odds were against me.
