</em><br>
<p>I do. I mean a massively parallel machine whose components are
<br>
constructed with molecular nanotechnology, therefore getting far
<br>
closer to the ln(2)kT limit than is possible with silicon microchips.
<br>
Such as the human brain. (Rough estimate, 1e18 flops - i.e. a single
<br>
brain is up there with the sum and total of all the digital computers
<br>
mankind has ever built. Perhaps starting to now lag a bit.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But something tells me that in 100 generations, using 19th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, we could breed humans any five-year-old of whom could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispatch Kasparov.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you were willing to frig up the definition of &quot;human&quot; quite a
<br>
bit. (And rightly get lynched by concerned parents.) If you were
<br>
looking at Go instead of chess, the above statement would become a bit
<br>
more reasonable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chess is trivially easy when compared to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skill it takes to, say, master a language the way a child does.
</em><br>
<p>For a computer, yep. Why? Because it so happens that the search space
<br>
of chess is narrow and simple, so that minimax isn't far from optimal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Run Deep Blue on a nanocomputer and I suspect it'll be unbeatable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by _any_ opponent, even one that has both infinite computing power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and perfect knowledge of Deep Blue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe so, but that's because you're using chess rather than something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less limited, say NxN go, or something even that does not have simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly! That's my whole point.
<br>
<p>As you get farther from a simple game like chess, to a more complex
<br>
and subtle game like Go, to an even more complex and subtle game like
<br>
real life, realistic ways to win diverge further and further from
<br>
simple algorithms like alpha-beta minimax or AIXI.
<br>
<p>Which was what I was saying from the start - Marc claimed a simple
<br>
mathematical function would be related to the optimal solution for
<br>
real life. I was disagreeing, and using chess as a starting point from
<br>
which to depart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The power of algorithmic superiority---just look at what the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose and very slow human brain can do (Hawkins' book)---surely is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponentially superior to the mindless crunching of Big Blue.
</em><br>
<p>Not when applied to chess, but definitely yes when applied to real life.
