Hi, Ben and Philip,
<br>
<p>This is my first post to this list.
<br>
<p>Paul Watzlawick makes a useful distinction in his book: _The Language of
<br>
Change_ (also in _How Real is Real?_); this is my interpretation of it:
<br>
<p>First-Order Reality (1OR): The Physical topology of &quot;matter&quot; (whatever
<br>
that means).
<br>
Second-Order Reality (2OR): Our Perceptions-Of and Thoughts-About 1OR
<br>
(and 2OR).
<br>
<p>It may be useful for some purposes to define further orders, but two are
<br>
sufficient for most things.
<br>
<p>I think it's also useful to realize that &quot;realness&quot; is itself 2OR; as are
<br>
all concepts people develop.
<br>
<p>To me, qualia are sensory-revived bundles; for example, colors generate
<br>
the quality/qualia of warmth (synesthetically): blue=cold; red=warm.
<br>
These are associations (and/or generalizations) from experience.
<br>
wood=warmth, family-togetherness, etc. Qualia are often specific to the
<br>
individual; people learn (associate) in different and unreproducible (in
<br>
fine detail) patterns.
<br>
<p>Subjective experience (as qualia) connects to the neural correlates by
<br>
association networks. In other words, stimuli (external or internal)
<br>
trigger association networks which associate to (and revivify) other
<br>
sensory/emotive/body-sense modalities, and highly-valued concepts (which
<br>
have their own revivified sensory-bundle sets); and people call the
<br>
resulting cascade of _experienceS_ of the cognitive-trace activation:
<br>
&quot;qualia&quot;. Most of this happens unconsciously, so it feels avolitional
<br>
(just like arm-levitation ratification in classical hypnosis feels), and
<br>
so some mystical ideas seem to have been associated with the concept of
<br>
qualia. Some people think it supports the mind-body duality idea, for
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>The survival value (1OR) of particular qualia associations and the
<br>
resulting cognitive-trace patterns (2OR); determines their
<br>
ideo-socio-bio-evolutionary development.
<br>
<p>I could go on, but I don't have a good idea of what would be most
<br>
relevant.

<p>Hi Philip,
<br>
<p>Interesting thoughts, but IMO they don't address the so-called &quot;hard
<br>
problem&quot; of consciousness, which is how the subjective experience of
<br>
qualia is connected to the neural correlates of qualia.
<br>
<p>You say &quot;qualia are properties generated in the brain relating to the
<br>
*experience* of real world&quot; ---- but the tricky question is how a
<br>
physical system (the brain) can &quot;generate&quot; subjective, phenomenal
<br>
experiences.   What is the nature of the &quot;generation&quot; that you mention?
<br>
<p>So far as I can tell, your comments don't address this at all...
<br>

Subject: [agi] What are qualia...
<br>
<p><p>Hi,
<br>
<p><p>I just been thinking about qualia a bit more recently. 
<br>
<p><p>(I have to make a disclaimer.  I know next to nothing about them, but
<br>
other people's ideas from this list have been fermenting in my mind for a
<br>
while.)
<br>
<p><p>Anyway, here goes......
<br>
<p><p>How about the idea that qualia are properties generated in the brain
<br>
relating to the *experience* of real world. They are artifacts that are
<br>
generated as ways of embedding labels or evaluations of data from the
<br>
real world into the data streams that, in the brain, are tagged as being
<br>
'real'. eg. 'red' is an identification label, a 'stink' is a safety
<br>
evaluation. 
<br>
<p><p>Using qualia is probably the quickest way to compile data about the real
<br>
world into a digested form that contains everything from data that is
<br>
relatively close to what the real world is like together with other
<br>
subjective responses from within the brain that is convenient to be
<br>
transferred through the brain tightly bound to the data that might be
<br>
considered more objective.
<br>
<p><p>Given that biological systems have had hundreds of millions of years to
<br>
evolve this 'objective'/'subjective'data bundling it is no wonder that it
<br>
seems marvellously rich and seemless and carries an overwhelming sense of
<br>
being reality.
<br>
<p><p>Once complex brained / complecly motivated creatures start using qualia
<br>
they could play into lifepatterns so profoundly that even obscure trends
<br>
in the use of qualia for aesthetic purposes could actually effect
<br>
reproductive prospects. For example, male peacocks have large tails that
<br>
look nice - clearly qualia are playing a role in the differentiation
<br>
process that decides which peacocks will be more or less successful in
<br>
breeding.
<br>
