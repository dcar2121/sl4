<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, there are a couple problems here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Though Friendly AI seems a difficult goal, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not quite ready to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's as difficult as the Omega Point.  I.e., I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider it reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible that the Omega Point of heaven-via-physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't exist and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI is achievable by some simpler means...
</em><br>
<p><p>Huh?  Under my scheme the goal of the Friendly A.I 
<br>
would be to carry out the *process* of trying to move
<br>
the universe towards the Omega Point in the optimal
<br>
way.  A process can be much simpler than the actual
<br>
end goal (The Omega Point itself is only an abstract
<br>
mathematical limit in any case, not something which is
<br>
ever reached from the point of view of sentients in
<br>
the universe).  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) It seems very unlikely that being nice to anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is critical for getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Omega Point, at least according to Tipler's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception of it.  A la
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tipler, getting there should involve reshaping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter across the universe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a way as to cause the right sort of (geometric)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity at the Big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crunch.  This has little to do with nice-ness except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sense that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end goal is supposed to be very nice.
</em><br>
<p>I admit it seems unlikely. But it's not impossible. 
<br>
What *seems* to be intuitively so is definitely not a
<br>
good guide as to what actually *is* so ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, it seems that you're extending Tipler's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception of the Omega Point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a big way, by hypothesizing some kind of subtle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection between *the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics* and your posited *laws of universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality*.  Is that right?
</em><br>
<p>That's corrrect yes.  That's exactly what I'm
<br>
suggesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO the only &quot;laws of morality&quot; we find embedded in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws of physics are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple and generic things like &quot;increase growth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But evidently you think that &quot;don't cause pain to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly conscious beings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going to be tied up with &quot;move maximally fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward the Omega point&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside the as-yet-unknown future laws of physics.
</em><br>
<p>Right!  That's what I'm suggesting. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why do you think that?  Is it just an intuition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from out of nowhere, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is there some detailed philosophical justification?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>As you probably realize from reading on SL4, I never
<br>
really liked Eli's CV scheme - I'm a fan of 'Objective
<br>
Morality' and it seems to me that Eli gave up on the
<br>
idea a bit too easily.  I didn't really like the
<br>
subjectivity that has crept into morality in the CV
<br>
scheme (there is a partial facts/values distinction).
<br>
<p>So I was continuing to try to come up with ideas to
<br>
make objective morality work.  And eventually it
<br>
seemed to me that the only possible way it can work is
<br>
to directly tie the laws of morality to the laws of
<br>
physics in order to define an 'ultimate goal' (telos)
<br>
that is truly universal (holds at all times and
<br>
places).  The goal 'move towards the Omega Point in
<br>
the optimal way' is the only possible one I know that
<br>
could fit the bill.
<br>
<p>Any way, it's a long shot but I'll continue to plug
<br>
away at the idea as a hobby over the next couple of
<br>
years, see if I can eventually write up a solid chain
<br>
of reasoning.
