<p>CALL FOR PAPERS
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Toward Social Mechanisms of Android Science
<br>
<p>A CogSci2005 Workshop
<br>
<p>Stresa, Italy, 25-26 July 2005
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Theme and goals
<br>
<p>The embodiment of social and cognitive theories in interactive robots
<br>
<p>sets a high bar for their evaluation. Theories that reify descriptions
<br>
<p>relying on a human interpreter for their grounding cannot be implemented
<br>
<p>in autonomous systems. The demands of coherently integrating responses
<br>
<p>cross-modally and coping with open, socially complex environments limit
<br>
<p>the applicability of theories that &quot;grew up in the laboratory.&quot; Androids
<br>
<p>will be confronted with circumstances that exhibit complex
<br>
<p>closely-coordinated social dynamics, where stable patterns emerge at
<br>
<p>various spatial and temporal scales, and expectations depend in part on
<br>
<p>a histories of interaction that are unique to individual relationships.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>We define an android to be an artificial system that has humanlike
<br>
<p>behavior and appearance and is capable of sustaining natural
<br>
<p>relationships with people. Although people may know that an android is
<br>
<p>not human, they would treat it as if it were, owing to the largely
<br>
<p>subconscious responses it would elicit. To pass the Total Turing Test,
<br>
<p>an android would need have the inclination toward &quot;mind reading&quot; that is
<br>
<p>characteristic of people. The development of androids is beyond the
<br>
<p>scope of mere engineering because, to make the android humanlike, we
<br>
<p>must investigate human activity, and to evaluate theories of human
<br>
<p>activity accurately, we need to implement them in an android. Thus, we
<br>
<p>need an android science.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to begin to lay a foundation for research
<br>
<p>in android science, a new field that integrates the synthetic approach
<br>
<p>from robotics with the empirical methodologies of the social sciences.
<br>
<p>Participants, coming from engineering and the social, cognitive, and
<br>
<p>biological sciences seek fundamental principles underlying cognition and
<br>
<p>communication between individuals. Cognition is not viewed as solely a
<br>
<p>property of brains, to be understood at a micro-structural level, nor as
<br>
<p>socially-definable and separable from biomechanical or sensorimotor
<br>
<p>constraints. By highlighting agent-world relations, androids have the
<br>
<p>potential for helping researchers to bridge the gap between cognitive
<br>
<p>neuroscience and the behavioral sciences, leading to a new way of
<br>
<p>understanding human beings. Thus, we hope to find principles that will
<br>
<p>apply equally well to androids and Homo sapiens.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Topics of interest
<br>
<p>- The role of affect and motivation in social development or
<br>
<p>communication
<br>
<p>- Empathic relationships among people and/or robots
<br>
<p>- Inter-species co-evolution, cooperation, and empathy
<br>
<p>- Processes of socialization and enculturation
<br>
<p>- Extended relationship
<br>
<p>- Social learning and adaptation, especially from people
<br>
<p>- The evolution, development, and nature of agency, intentionality, or
<br>
<p>social intelligence
<br>
<p>- Software architectures for embodied social interaction
<br>
<p>- The grounding, emergence, or acquisition of communicative signs or
<br>
<p>symbols
<br>
<p>- Mimesis and its role in communication and development
<br>
<p>- The development or implementation of hierarchies of meaning
<br>
<p>- Models of personal, interindividual, group, or cultural norms
<br>
<p>- Cross-modal synchronization or stabilized plasticity in speech and/or
<br>
<p>gesture
<br>
<p>- Learning with and from machines
<br>
<p>- Androids working alongside people as peers
<br>
<p>- Applications in human environments
<br>
<p>- Ethical issues concerning androids
<br>
<p>- Perception of naturalness, attractiveness, or charisma
<br>
<p>- The relationship between appearance and perceived behavior
<br>
<p>- Android personalities
<br>
<p>- Emotional intelligence
<br>
<p>- The Total Turing Test
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Target participants
<br>
<p>Robotics engineers and computer scientists with an interest in
<br>
<p>artificial intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, and
<br>
<p>control, especially those whose target platform includes humanoid
<br>
<p>robots; psychologists and sociologists who are concerned with real-time
<br>
<p>embodied communication or social development; cognitive scientists who
<br>
<p>are concerned with the relationship between brain processes and social
<br>
<p>dynamics; social and comparative biologists; and philosophers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The workshop is of interest to the target participants because androids
<br>
<p>will provide a critical test bed for social and cognitive theories in
<br>
<p>the future, and research in this domain depends on interdisciplinary
<br>
<p>collaboration between engineers and natural and social scientists.
<br>
