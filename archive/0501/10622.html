<p>I don't see that his attitude is self-contradictory.
<br>
<p>I would say &quot;The chance that anyone will build a ladder to Andromeda
<br>
tomorrow is effectively zero.  We don't really have any clear idea what
<br>
technology it would take to build such a ladder.&quot;  No contradiction there.
<br>
I don't know how to do it, but I know that none of our current methods come
<br>
close to sufficing.
<br>
<p>In contradiction to David Clark, I do NOT think that is the case with AGI.
<br>
IMO, the chance of an AI &quot;taking off&quot; in the near future is low, but not
<br>
nearly so low as that of a human building a ladder to Andromeda.
<br>
<p>And of course I think that I do have a very clear idea what it will take to
<br>
make a human-level AI... ;-)
<br>
<p>By the way, in a prior post David Clark said that he didn't agree with my
<br>
&quot;agents-based&quot; approach to AGI.  In fact, Novamente is not really
<br>
agents-based under any sensible interpretation of that term (I realize that
<br>
the word &quot;agent&quot; has sometimes been stretched beyond all sensible meaning,
<br>
in the computer science community).  Webmind, the AI system I worked on in
<br>
the late 1990's and 2000, was agents-based, but Novamente is not (though
<br>
Novamente and Webmind have many other commonalities).
