<p><p>When dealing with very very abstract ideas, you need
<br>
to read them very very carefully.  Don't dismiss what
<br>
you obviously didn't understand my friend.  It makes
<br>
*you* look like the idiot, not me.
<br>
<p>You have replaced the word 'Friendly' with the word
<br>
'physics' in my paragraph.  However you:
<br>
<p>(a)  Mis labelled one other very important phrase! 
<br>
That phrase is what changed my paragraph from being
<br>
meaningful to meaningless.
<br>
<p>(b)  Failed to realise that the thing being described
<br>
is *the limit* of a *recursive function* and becomes
<br>
meaningful once the mathematical limit (which is the
<br>
phrase you failed to correctly describe) is defined.
<br>
<p>O.K, so let me re-place the one phrase you
<br>
mis-labelled wih the correct phrase.  I have taken
<br>
your paragraph, and replaced the one phrase you
<br>
mis-labelled with the correct phrase.  Try reading my
<br>
paragraph again then, with the added proviso that you
<br>
realize that the thing being described is the *limit*
<br>
of a recursive function.  I think you then find that
<br>
it makes a great deal of sense indeed:
<br>
<p>&quot;I defined physics as functions (computations, aka
<br>
physical laws) which take in particular other kinds of
<br>
(object) and modify them in a certain way.  I said
<br>
that the 'particular kind' of functions operated on
<br>
were approxmiations to THE OMEGA POINT.  The 'certain
<br>
way' they are modified is that a poor approximation
<br>
function, which we don't have, is taken in as input,
<br>
and then a better approximation function is given as
<br>
output.&quot;
<br>
<p>Gotcha!
