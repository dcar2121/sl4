<p>No you didn't.  You used physics buzzwords, but didn't actually 
<br>
describe the physics of the Friendliness function.  You proposed your 
<br>
goals for what you want the Friendliness function used for, but not 
<br>
what it is or how it does it.  As an example, I could tell you that I 
<br>
have already have a function on my Macintosh right now to move the 
<br>
physical state of the universe closer to the Omega Point.  You would 
<br>
still have no idea what function I was talking about, what it does, or 
<br>
how it works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I proposed that in maths terms, the specific function
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No you didn't.  You used math symbols to give variable names to your 
<br>
ideas, but didn't actually describe any math associated with the 
<br>
Friendliness function.  You proposed that recursion might be useful in 
<br>
implementing the Friendliness function, but again didn't describe what 
<br>
the friendliness function is or how it does it.  As an example, I could 
<br>
tell you that my Macintosh already has several recursive functions 
<br>
built in.  You would still have no idea what functions I was talking 
<br>
about, what they do, or how they work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not claim to have logical proof that I am right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am only putting forward a proposal for the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is no question of &quot;right&quot; here.  If you had actually given any 
<br>
physics, we could have checked your observations.  If you had actually 
<br>
given any math, we could have checked your calculations.  All you have 
<br>
given us are your goals and your approach, which are personal choices.  
<br>
You have not proposed anything that can be tested to determine if it is 
<br>
right or wrong.
