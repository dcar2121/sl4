<em> &gt; 1. Usually the lab begins using strong protocols
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _after_ the organism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has already shown it is dangerous - but with an AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this may be too late 
</em><br>
<p>You can generalize this to humans almost always
<br>
react to a risk after the fact.  The examples are
<br>
numerous:
<br>
<p>- 50,000 years ago humans burned so much vegetation
<br>
that the interior of Australia tipped over to mostly
<br>
desert, killing off many species of plants and
<br>
animals.  A science news story appeared today
<br>
about this, and it is yet to be seen if we will
<br>
repeat the process in South America.  This may
<br>
qualify as the slowest reaction to a manmade risk.
<br>
<p>- Experiments with nuclear fission on university
<br>
campuses before they had an understanding of 
<br>
radiation hazards (Columbia &amp; U. of Chicago during
<br>
WWII).  Experiments with nuclear fission in a 
<br>
live reactor even after they knew about radiation
<br>
hazards (Chernobyl)
<br>
<p>- Funding for a Pacific Tsunami detection network
<br>
after devastating Tsunamae there in the 20th century.
<br>
Funding for Atlantic, Carribean, and Indian detection
<br>
networks after a devastating tsunami in 2005.
<br>
<p>- Funding for the Spacegard survey of
<br>
Earth-approaching
<br>
asteroids after comet Schumaker-Levy 9 demonstrated
<br>
what happens when a large body hits a planet. This is
<br>
despite decades of evidence that the dinosaurs were
<br>
killed off by such an object, and the copious
<br>
evidence of the Moon of past impact hazards.
<br>
<p>There seems to be a human inertia or inability to
<br>
understand a hazard in the abstract (or even after
<br>
seeing it in a Hollywood movie).  I'll leave
<br>
dissecting the psychology to people who have a better
<br>
understanding than me of that field.
<br>
<p>If you believe that the risks of an AI runaway are
<br>
serious, though, then how do you motivate other 
<br>
people to take it seriously too, given man's poor
<br>
record to date?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly, AGI-specific safety protocols need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed and refined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we gain more knowledge, and they will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost certainly have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be stricter in some ways than bio or other areas of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science if we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to pay more than lip service to the issue.
</em><br>
<p>I would rate the greatest risk right now is from
<br>
a distributed network based AI (run like the SETI
<br>
and protien folding projects at best, and like
<br>
spyware/zombie DDOS networks at worst).  An AI
<br>
project at a company or university lab will be
<br>
somewhat confined to a specific set of hardware.
<br>
A distributed network AI could already have built-in
<br>
features for further distribution, and a ready
<br>
made culture medium in the Internet. How do you
<br>
even begin to secure an environment like that?
