<em>&gt; The brain's construction of chained memories and actions is probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another tree, though a more functional metaphor might be the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candelabra-shaped railroad marshaling yard, with words for cars
</em><br>
<p>Firstly Calvin's and Edelman's versions of 'neural darwinism' aren't
<br>
the same. You're talking about Calvin's runtime DE, wheras Edelman
<br>
focuses on selection of neuron group with useful patterns, which more
<br>
closely resembles the way the human immune system operates than the
<br>
multi-generational selection and mutation needed for evolution.
<br>
<p>Edelman's stuff is quite plausible, since it beings to explain the rate
<br>
and dynamics of neural dieoff and how the genetic encoding of human
<br>
intelligence achieves such remarkable compression. OTOH while Calvin's
<br>
ideas struck me as reasonable when I first read it, I can now see that
<br>
it just wouldn't work as a cognitive design. As a method of primary
<br>
cognition evolution is both radically inefficient in wetware and (when
<br>
adjusted for plausibility) time requirements, plus if it's anything
<br>
like the DE I've experimented with unstable and prone to severe
<br>
reasoning pathologies (which don't match actual, observed flaws in human
<br>
cognition). The 'evidence' for Calvin's view can in fact be explained by
<br>
a much less radical view of cognition; simply the inevitable consequences
<br>
of the massive, stochastic parallelism required to operate at such low
<br>
clock rates and reliabilities in the first place. When the brain implements
<br>
multiple action generation pathways triggered by the same context and
<br>
funneling into the same motor control area, it must by necessity place
<br>
them in parallel with each other and the logic that will decide which
<br>
subnetwork (equivalent to a Minsky agent here) to permit to take control
<br>
of the output. That control logic is generally pretty good; we don't often
<br>
attempt to issue two contradictory responses at once. Sometimes however if
<br>
the decision is finely balanced both outputs may be active for a short
<br>
while before the unstable feedback loop of cross-suppression causes one to
<br>
be selected. This is a simpler and plausible explanation of the behavior
<br>
Calvin attributes to competition between patterns, and the mechanism also
<br>
extends to cover several other common errors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; imagine that many trains are randomly constructed on the parallel tracks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but only the best is selected to be let loose on the 'main track' of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness and speech.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good metaphor, but I can't imagine why it makes you think of
<br>
armies of copied thoughts competing for neural real estate instead of
<br>
(a neural version of) several speculative logic chains that operate in
<br>
parallel with the control logic that selects between them; after all
<br>
the latter is a common feature of modern microprocessors where clock
<br>
cycles are again at a premium.
