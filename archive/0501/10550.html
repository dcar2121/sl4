<p><strong>attached mail follows:</strong><hr><p>
[I'm back from holidays having done some reading relevant to some
<br>
recent discussion on this list.  Along with part of Popper's _Realism
<br>
and the Aim of Science_, I reread a little Penguin book on some of 
<br>
Feynman's lectures entitled  _The Meaning of It All_ containing a 
<br>
chapter entitled the Uncertainty of Science.   
<br>
<p>In his, imo, well written, and enjoyable essay A Technical Explanation
<br>
of Technical Explanation, <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html</a>
<br>
Eliezer writes (page 32 of 36 when I printed it out) :
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Imagine that you wake up one morning and your left arm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been replaced by a blue tentacle. The blue tentacle 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obeys your motor commands - you can use it to pick up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glasses, drive a car, etc. How would you explain this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hypothetical scenario? Take a moment to ponder this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puzzle before continuing.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>So I did imagine it. I imagined it in good faith, and I imagined it 
<br>
consistent with a spirit of exploration and good will built that Eliezer
<br>
had established through the early part of his essay. 
<br>
<p>Where Eliezer had placed &quot;spoiler space&quot;, I stopped reading and I
<br>
wrote down my explanation. (I'd been reading with pen in hand and
<br>
making critical notes in the margin.)  It seemed to be fair and 
<br>
scientific to provide an answer *before* reading on so as not to
<br>
contaminate the experiment. )
<br>
<p>I wrote (and I quote):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd &quot;explain&quot; it provisionally as some surprising organisation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of people had entered my house and replaced my arm whilst
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept with technology I didn't know existed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd be bewildered. Frightened even. But I'd not think &quot;magic&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had occurred&quot;.
<br>
<p>And then, with the heightened curiosity of one who has escalated
<br>
their commitment I went back to see what Eliezer the Bayesian,
<br>
Eliezer the spreader-of-analogical-probability-clay-mass would have
<br>
done.
<br>
<p>And he'd written this. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How would I explain the event of my left arm being replaced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a blue tentacle? The answer is that I wouldn't. It isn't going
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to happen.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Email perhaps can't convey my exact reaction to that but here's
<br>
the comments I wrote in the margin. 
<br>
<p><pre>
----
&quot;No. No. No. You cheated Eliezer. You cheated !  
You can't assign a probability of zero ! *
Not fair!! You said it did happen. Your being dishonest with the
data to say its not going to happen.&quot; 
----
Most of what I know of Bayesian reasoning I know as a result of
reading Eliezer's two essays on it.  So perhaps if my understanding
of Bayesian reasoning or inference is wrong I can escape by
blaming Eliezer for it :-) 
I suspect, on the basis of those two essays that I am a Bayesian
although I didn't know I was and so I haven't been calling myself
one. The merit I see in the Bayesian approach is that it manages
uncertainties more carefully and consistently then most people do
intuitively. [And boy does the world need that].
So, it's 2005.  I'm a Bayesian. And as long as I'm wearing metaphorical
teeshirts I'm also a Bright.  
Regards,
Brett Paatsch
*  Eliezer's assigning a probability of zero to observed facts however
unlikely those facts might have been a priori is the reason for my
heading this post Bad Bayesian - no buscuit.
PS: Happy new year.
