<p>Unless something mysterious is killing the animals, nobody is concerned about
<br>
pond scum or cave dirt.  Except for the occasional SARS virus, researchers are
<br>
well aware of the risks that they face with the organisms that they're
<br>
handling, and they are required in research protocols to declare what kind of
<br>
info/training they will provide for the members of their lab.  Even old labs
<br>
undergo yearly safety inspections, and fume hoods and instruments must be
<br>
updated to certain standards.  That's in America, Europe, and some Asian
<br>
countries, anyway.  
<br>
<p>But even then, things happen.  I knew a guy with a nervous tick.  He had
<br>
handled polyacrylamide for years without anyone telling him that it is
<br>
neurotoxic.
