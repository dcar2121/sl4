Taken from the comments I posted on the Imm Inst
<br>
forum.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>A Plain English description of Friendliness
<br>
<p>In order to get a handle on something as enormously
<br>
difficult as the concept of 'Friendliness', I had to
<br>
start right at the beginning and come up with the most
<br>
general definition that I could in order to lay the
<br>
foundations for the rest of my theory. Although what
<br>
I've posted here is very general, I don't think it's
<br>
vacuous. If you read what I said, I say that the exact
<br>
'Friendliness' function is uncomputable (it is not
<br>
Turing computable). Then I try to show that there
<br>
exist Turing computable functions that can approximate
<br>
any uncomputable function to any desired degree of
<br>
accuracy. This is a big mathematical claim. I attempt
<br>
to establish that in order for these functions to
<br>
exist, the Omega Point condition has to hold for our
<br>
universe, another big claim. So I've attempted to lay
<br>
the framework for establishing 2 big claims, which are
<br>
certainly not vacuous! To sum up my two big claims:
<br>
<p>*There exist Turing computable functions that can
<br>
approximate any uncomputable function to any desired
<br>
degree of accuracy
<br>
<p>*The Omega Point condition has to hold in our universe
<br>
for these functions to exist
<br>
<p>Defining concepts as utility functions is my key idea!
<br>
You may be aware of the old idea that everything that
<br>
exists is simply thoughts in the mind of God. Well,
<br>
I'm simply trying to re-phrase this idea in a modern
<br>
scientific sense. You are familiar with Objective
<br>
Idealism? Let me put it this way: In what sense can
<br>
something be said to exist if it could not be
<br>
perceived by some mind? The very word 'Concept' is
<br>
itself a concept. It is only meaningful in so far as
<br>
it means something to a mind which understands it. So
<br>
in what sense can anything be said to really be
<br>
'inert'? Perception is a *process*. And no concept in
<br>
reality can be separated from the perceptual process
<br>
required to understand it.
<br>
<p>Also consider the idea of universal computation. All
<br>
finite things in reality are 'computations'. But minds
<br>
are also believed be 'computations'. Again, we see a
<br>
kind of equivalence between 'thoughts' and 'things'.
<br>
What seems like an external 'thing' from one
<br>
perspective exists as a 'thought' from another
<br>
perspective. Consider your own thoughts. To you they
<br>
are internal subjective perceptions. But imagine
<br>
someone with a device capable of recording every
<br>
detail that was going on in your mind. To that person,
<br>
all your thoughts would actually appear to be material
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>So these are my reasons for regarding concepts as
<br>
being no different to the actual perceptual process of
<br>
understanding them.
<br>
<p>Of course we can then ask: Whose perceptual process
<br>
should we use as defining what a concept means? It
<br>
can't be our own - that would be no different to
<br>
solipsism - a confusion of our own internal map with
<br>
the territory. 
<br>
<p>That's where the idea of an Omega Point
<br>
super-intelligence comes in you see. We then have a
<br>
way to define a concept as a perceptual process in a
<br>
limiting case: the idea is that the concept is defined
<br>
to be the perceptual process of understanding taken by
<br>
super-intelligence at the end of time - the Omega
<br>
Point limit.
<br>
<p>You are right to say that there would be many utility
<br>
functions approximating Prospective attributes - and I
<br>
gave the example of 'Beauty' in the post. 
<br>
<p>But it seems that you missed my implicit definition of
<br>
Friendliness! 
<br>
<p>Utility functions approximating other prospective
<br>
attributes do not self-improve! That is, they not
<br>
inputting/outputting other functions. For instance the
<br>
utility function approximating beauty outputs examples
<br>
of beautiful things. 
<br>
<p>The Friendliness utility function is taking
<br>
*functions* as input/output. It's self-reflective
<br>
(recursive). It takes a function as input and outputs
<br>
an improved version of the function. For instance the
<br>
Friendliness function could take the Beauty function
<br>
and improve the Beauty function.
<br>
<p>You are asking what a Friendliness function actually
<br>
ultimately does? It should be obvious. The Omega Point
<br>
condition is the condition required to enable the
<br>
Friendliness function to exist. Therefore the ultimate
<br>
telos of Friendliness is to bring about the Omega
<br>
Point. It sounds paradoxical. But it's not. It's a
<br>
closed 'strange loop'.
<br>
<p>So the end purpose of the Universe is 'continue to
<br>
exist'. Immortality in other words! This is a journey
<br>
not a destination. It's the process of attempting to
<br>
continue to exist that is equivalent to the meaning of
<br>
life.
