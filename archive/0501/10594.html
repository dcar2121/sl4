But Eliezer, couldn't a rationalist explain fiction by the chain of 
<br>
events that led to the production of the fiction?  The fiction of, say, 
<br>
L. Ron Hubbard would confuse me if I took it to be factual reporting or 
<br>
good sci-fi, but I can explain it rationally by reflecting on Hubbard's 
<br>
heavy drug use. 
<br>
More clearly, I can explain my fictional self possesing a tentacle two 
<br>
ways.  One, I can say that a certain Yudkowsky, seeking to explain 
<br>
something, asked me to envision a contra-factual situation.  This does 
<br>
not confuse me so long as I do not mix levels.
<br>
Or, I could say that the root user of our simulation-verse decided to 
<br>
start screwing with me, possibly to engage in epistemologic or 
<br>
rationality experiments.

One more thing:  I can explain webcomics as part of history: 
<br>
specifically the part where publishing online became cheap enough for 
<br>
amateurs, and a sufficiently large segment of the population acquired 
<br>
the leisure necessary to acquire the skills neccesary for it to be a hobby.
