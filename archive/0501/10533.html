Hi Stephen,
<br>
<p>Well I'll give you my own point of view on this.  I am not affiliated with
<br>
SIAI, and I have some differences with their approach, but I think I
<br>
*almost* see eye-to-eye with them on the issue of probability theory.
<br>
<p>About philosophy of mind: I agree somewhat with your criticism. My own
<br>
approach to AI is founded on years of thinking I did about the philosophy of
<br>
mind, as well as more scientific considerations.  I think that Eliezer's
<br>
work could use a little more depth in this area.
<br>
<p>About probability theory: I agree with Eliezer that in principle,
<br>
brain-minds act as if they were obeying an approximation to probability
<br>
theory.  Now, whether this is explicit or implicit in the structure and
<br>
dynamics of a given brain-mind is a totally different question.  In the
<br>
brain I believe it's implicit, and in
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2003/HebbianLogic03.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2003/HebbianLogic03.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I have made some arguments as to how Hebbian learning in the brain might
<br>
give rise to probabilistic inference on the emergent level.  In an AI system
<br>
it may be implicit or explicit depending on the design.  In my own Novamente
<br>
AI design it's explicit, and I think Eliezer is proposing to make it
<br>
explicit in his AI design as well.
<br>
<p>As to the foundation for the claim that probabilistic reasoning is
<br>
foundational, Cox's mathematical arguments are pretty convincing.  Cox shows
<br>
that any measure of plausibility that obeys certain very sensible axioms
<br>
*must* be probability:  for a discussion see e.g.
<br>
<p><a href="http://leuther-analytics.com/bayes/papers.html">http://leuther-analytics.com/bayes/papers.html</a>
<br>
<p>I don't fully understand the fuss about &quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; -- to me, Bayes
<br>
rule is just one among many useful mathematical rules derivable from the
<br>
axioms of elementary probability theory, which IMO are the correct axioms to
<br>
use for making intelligent judgments in the face of uncertainty.
<br>
<p>As for fuzzy logic, I think it has its place, and we do use the fuzzy-set
<br>
min(,) and max(,) operators in Novamente in a couple places, as well as
<br>
fuzzy quantifiers.  But fuzzy logic IMO doesn't have the foundational status
<br>
that probability theory does.  The whole argument for fuzzy min/max truth
<br>
value operators is founded on the assumption that distributivity must hold
<br>
when manipulating uncertain truth values -- and I think this is just a false
<br>
assumption.  The fact that some of the proponents of fuzzy logic like Kosko
<br>
are smart is kind of a red herring -- of course history is full of smart
<br>
people advocating silly positions!
<br>
<p>In an accompanying email I will outline my thoughts on probability theory
<br>
and philosophy of mind in more depth.  Recently I have experimented with
<br>
introducing probabilistic notions at a very low, foundational level in my
<br>
&quot;pattern-based&quot; philosophy of mind.
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: Fuzzy vs Probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was looking over the Singularity Institute page on becoming a seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programmer the other day and I couldn't help but feel that there is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming bias towards bayesian reasoning and I have noticed that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of contributors to sl4 hail this as all-powerful - should they?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Check out this paper by Bart Kosko (clearly a 'brilliant' individual)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his other work -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/ProbabilityMonopoly.pdf">http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/ProbabilityMonopoly.pdf</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/">http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I couldn't help noticing also that generally there are gaps in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plan. As a philosopher I saw the ommission of any philosophy of mind -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial to any AI discussions and for any 'deep understanding' of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues actually outlined - strange... I have witnessed in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudice against philosophy and philosophers here too (apology already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted of course) and I wondered if the project of creating AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being pushed forward before it is ready. Now I believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity is inevitable and I am not suggesting that the institute is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, just that creating an Artificial General Intelligence, needs more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis on the general. Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
