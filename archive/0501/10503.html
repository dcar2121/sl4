I am not sure I see the difficulty.  If one has ways of measuring
<br>
correctness/degree of fit to a goal of results given problem context
<br>
and the efficiency with which a nominally correct solution was arrived
<br>
at and means for tweaking the mechanisms employed to reach the
<br>
solution then even something like a GA is in principle capable of
<br>
generating progressive improvments to the system.
<br>
<p>I don't see that recursive self-improvment requires that the
<br>
[super]goal itself is changing.    So what is the problem?

<em>&gt; &gt; You mean that when you write code, you have no way of knowing what any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individual module does, except letting it run for an open-ended period of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time?  That must make it awfully difficult to write code.  How many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; randomly generated strings do you need to test before you find one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compiles?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The distinction is between writing code to a specification, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deciding what the specification should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I know what output a program needs to produce for a given input,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and write code to do this... well, in practice, I can never be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure my code is correct, and it needs to be tested to be even somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure of that. However, if I know the desired output well enough that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could write it into a formal spec, I _could_ in principle write code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together with a formal proof of correctness (not that there's ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to do that in practice, but in principle an AI might be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this faster than I can).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, formal proof is relative to a formal specification. Improving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the intelligence of an AI (as opposed to merely its computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency) involves changing the output - so if there was a formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specification of the old version, the specification will have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed; therefore, formal proof no longer applies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how do you propose to solve this problem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Disclaimer of personal bias: I'd like full recursive self-improvement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work, so I'm hoping for a reply that'll make me go &quot;oh, yes, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hadn't thought of that; now I see how that could work&quot;, though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately think that's unlikely.)
