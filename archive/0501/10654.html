<p>
<em>&gt; Backprop NNs don't concern me because they are (usually) not open-ended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization processes.  A GA is an open-ended optimization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.  So is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one replicator or replicating hypercycle.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but a GA is a very simple, stupid and inefficient open-ended
<br>
optimization process.
<br>
<p>And, GA/GP's are always run with a fixed-size or max-size genome, which is
<br>
far too small to encompass any kind of intelligently behaviing program.
<br>
<p>The reason is that if you make the genome too big, the simple learning
<br>
algorithm of GA/GP is too dumb to learn anything with plausible population
<br>
sizes...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unintelligence coughed up intelligence once, and the spark of that fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (before it accumulated all the complexity to which you refer) was less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated and certainly less directed than today's GAs, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence carrying fully-formed complexity that might have taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years to evolve on Earth, or, in some cases, would not be accessible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection at all.
</em><br>
<p>This is just not true.  The primordial soup was vastly more complex than
<br>
today's GA's, because it relied on chemistry, which is astoundingly subtler
<br>
than the bit strings or simple program trees in GA/GAP...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The computational path from unintelligence to intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists.  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climbed once in the total absence of thoughtful design, just from steady
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization pressure.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, but the path from chemical complexity to biological complexity to
<br>
mental complexity is a totally different animal than the path from a
<br>
bit-string GA or Koza-style GP to anything.  There are all kinds of
<br>
self-organizational mysteries underlying soups of chemical compounds,
<br>
including potentially funky quantum phenomena involved with protein folding,
<br>
etc.  Not so for GA/GP....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't tell me it can't happen again, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can calculate your answer.
</em><br>
<p>Eli, we can't prove via calculations that the solar system won't collapse
<br>
tomorrow, as physics hasn't yet solved the newtonian N-body problem....
<br>
<p>The mathematical work of David Goldberg and Michael Vose on the GA lets us
<br>
estimate what kinds of programs can be learned via GA with what population
<br>
sizes.  This work makes pretty clear -- though does not prove
<br>
definitively -- that these methods will never be able to learn anything like
<br>
human-level intelligent behavior, even with billions of times as much
<br>
computational power as we have today.
<br>
<p>Novamente uses GP-like techniques, so I don't think these methods are bereft
<br>
of power for general AI.  But on their own they are clearly not sufficient.
<br>
