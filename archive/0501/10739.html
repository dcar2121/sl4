<p>What morality is not:
<br>
&quot;Objective&quot; morality is unrealistic since moral choices depend on 
<br>
values, which are necessarily subjective.  &quot;Universal&quot; morality is 
<br>
unrealistic, because at the universal level of context, there are no 
<br>
subjective values - the universe does not care.  Let's also make the 
<br>
point that there is no inherent moral good in what is natural - the 
<br>
Naturalistic Fallacy.
<br>
<p>What is being discussed here is predominately ethics, or meta-ethics, 
<br>
rather than morality, but there's much crossover between the terms.
<br>
<p>What morality is:
<br>
Choices about &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; behavior based on an assumed 
<br>
foundation that extends beyond the individual to the group, and beyond 
<br>
the immediate to the practically eternal, and beyond the situation at 
<br>
hand to classes of situations in general.  Morality as so defined and 
<br>
practiced is an illusion leading to apparent paradox, but one that is 
<br>
very commonly accepted and practiced.  Most of our current moral 
<br>
foundation is a result of evolutionary processes, promoting survival of 
<br>
the species and the group, without the expense of reasoning through the 
<br>
issues.  It worked well for a very long time.
<br>
<p>What morality is becoming:
<br>
Choices based on local values and circumstances, approximations to what 
<br>
works in the greater reality, providing local efficacy and a valuable 
<br>
source of diversity to the larger group.
<br>
<p>Overview:
<br>
Just as with the thermodynamic &quot;arrow of time&quot;, there is an analogous 
<br>
&quot;arrow of morality&quot; by which that which works (and is therefore seen as 
<br>
good) within local contexts will tend in the direction of that which 
<br>
works within a larger context as the local contexts combine to form 
<br>
larger contexts of interaction.  This is a true relationship between 
<br>
physics and morality.
<br>
<p>That which works (survives and grows) is considered good at any given 
<br>
sub-context.  Differences in perception over what works (what is good) 
<br>
are due to differences in local contexts, but in the increasingly bigger 
<br>
picture these converge.
<br>
<p><p>Why this is important:
<br>
Human society is rapidly widening its scope of awareness, and thus the 
<br>
context within which we interact and make moral choices.  As members of 
<br>
this list will generally agree, the acceleration of this process is 
<br>
itself accelerating, and we are faced with the challenge of handling 
<br>
rapid technological change that is engulfing many local contexts, 
<br>
forcing them into a larger context, but each based on largely obsolete 
<br>
evolved values, perceptions, and ways of perceiving.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, the challenge of humanity's survival will be met as we 
<br>
create the tools necessary to amplify our awareness of our own local 
<br>
context and the greater context within which we interact, and increase 
<br>
our awareness of the principles that determine the successful growth of 
<br>
these dynamical systems.  The exact solutions can not be predicted due 
<br>
to the chaotic nature of the system, but from our subjective point of 
<br>
view within the system we can further our subjective values via the 
<br>
increasingly objective methods of science.
