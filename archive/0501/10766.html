<em>&gt;I'm trying to figure out what you mean by constructing

</em><br>
<em>&gt;more-complex organisms have more objective beliefs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So that the abstractions in the brain of a human are

Yes, I would agree with your interpretation as it highlights the 
<br>
weakness in the stripped-down statement that I made above.  You might 
<br>
want to refer back to the somewhat more complete response that I made on 
<br>
this subject a day or two earlier, but even that would benefit from 
<br>
expansion to about ten pages. I'll try here to convey the essentials, 
<br>
but it won't be rigorous or complete due to lack of time. This is a 
<br>
train of thought I've been kicking around for a three or fours years, 
<br>
but the seeds were sown much earlier.   I do appreciate serious feedback 
<br>
and criticism and intend to write a more complete description, time 
<br>
permitting, over the next few months.
<br>
<p>More specifically in response to your question above, I was responding 
<br>
to Patrick and saying that local moral systems become more objective as 
<br>
they interact with other local moral systems and form larger (meaning 
<br>
more comprehensive in scope) moral systems that do tend to become more 
<br>
objective as a result. 
<br>
<p>With respect to your question and example of the spider and the human, 
<br>
my previous statement didn't apply because it was about moral systems 
<br>
becoming more objective, and spiders don't have moral systems.  I 
<br>
apologize for leaving it incomplete and misleading.
<br>
<p>I would agree with what I take as your point that a spider has little or 
<br>
no subjectivity, while a human can model intricate fantasies far from 
<br>
objective reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you mean that objectivity increases as time goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on, so that a civilization gradually refines more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and more objectively true beliefs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes, this is in alignment with my key point, disregarding local min/max 
<br>
bumps in the landscape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How does this principle apply to non-sentient systems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Principles of synergetic advantage apply at all levels of complexity, 
<br>
regardless of whether the system exploits a model of its own volition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does it apply to weather patterns?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Interesting question.   While weather patterns are cylic and recur, they 
<br>
don't exhibit the characteristic of persistence that I suspect is 
<br>
required for synergetic growth.
