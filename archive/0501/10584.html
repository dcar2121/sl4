<p>I'm replying to you offlist, Martin, since this

you, but I've been thinking a lot on this stuff,

and here's my take;

<p>See, I've been trying to write a second novel for
<br>
years. I abandoned a false start about
<br>
interdimensional travel when I bogged down
<br>
thinking about Many Worlds and
<br>
reality-as-information. But that led me to
<br>
stumble into the forum here, and I began to
<br>
understand that AI and Many Worlds were deeply
<br>
linked ideas, once you begin to read people like
<br>
Tegmark and Tipler. Some physicists say time is
<br>
an illusion and that what exists might be a vast
<br>
or infinite network of 'still snapshots' (I think
<br>
I picked that up from an article about Martin
<br>
Rees). Time in this view is like movie frames
<br>
flipping by. See this great survey, &quot;What do you
<br>
believe is true even though you cannot prove
<br>
it?&quot;:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html">http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html</a>
<br>
<p>I refer you to physicist Carlo Rovelli's answer
<br>
toward the bottom of this page:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_2.html">http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_2.html</a>
<br>
<p>Anyway, so if each instant is its own unique
<br>
pattern, then how is our consciousness jumping
<br>
from one Planck moment to the next, never mind
<br>
that we allegedly have not been dead in the
<br>
interval! If we assume that the consciousness is
<br>
a pattern which jumps probabilistically from
<br>
frame to frame, what is supposed to happen when
<br>
we die? The argument against consciousness
<br>
jumping over death I quote from the wiki:
<br>
&quot;Although quantum immortality is motivated by the
<br>
quantum suicide thought experiment, Max Tegmark,
<br>
one of the inventors of this experiment, has
<br>
stated that he does not believe that quantum
<br>
immortality is a consequence of his work. His
<br>
argument is that under any sort of normal
<br>
conditions, before someone dies they undergo a
<br>
period of diminishment of consciousness, a
<br>
non-quantum decline (which can be anywhere from
<br>
seconds to minutes to years), and hence there is
<br>
no way of establishing a continuous existence
<br>
from this world to an alternate one in which the
<br>
person continues to exist.&quot;
<br>
But that objection doesn't hold up! If it does,
<br>
we should not survive general anesthesia, which
<br>
creates a 'time hole' of several hours. I've gone
<br>
under at least twice, and they put the gas on you
<br>
or start the drip, and consciousness becomes
<br>
impossible to sustain no matter how hard you
<br>
fight. Then, a couple of subjective seconds
<br>
later, some nurse is making you sit up when all
<br>
you want to do is lie there, and the duration of
<br>
the operation is, for your purposes, nonexistent.
<br>
Dreamless sleep and comas share this quality.
<br>
<p>Tipler suggested that the same thing would happen
<br>
if the Omega Point revived you. You might have
<br>
been dead and dust for eleventy bajillion years,
<br>
but subjectively he suggests it's just like the
<br>
anesthesia.
<br>
<p>Better minds than mine have foundered on trying
<br>
to imagine the experience of not existing.
<br>
However, I think the outlines of the answer are
<br>
now coming clearer. If you don't exist, there's
<br>
no experience. As soon as you have an experience,
<br>
you have some sort of life. What if you put a
<br>
shotgun in your mouth and pull the trigger? If
<br>
the consciousness is always jumping Plancks
<br>
anyway, why *shouldn't* it jump again to the most
<br>
probable   next position consistent with
<br>
existing, since it has done so all your life? In
<br>
this scenario, your suicide is experienced by
<br>
your friends and family, but not by you! Maybe
<br>
you pull the trigger and it just goes click. Your
<br>
consciousness jumps into a frame where the primer
<br>
failed. But where will your consciousness jump if
<br>
you're an end-stage AIDS patient? Maybe to a
<br>
universe where they find a miracle cure? I dunno.
<br>
<p>The wiki says: &quot;Detractors regard this idea as
<br>
nonsense, and argue that this outcome does not
<br>
fall out naturally from the many worlds
<br>
interpretation of quantum mechanics.&quot; They're
<br>
half right, I say: it doesn't fall out of many
<br>
worlds but it does seem to fall out of
<br>
time-isn't-real interpretations, which may or may
<br>
not coexist with many worlds. Think about the pi
<br>
conjecture along with quantum immortality along
<br>
with time-isn't-real, and see what weirdness you
<br>
get when you add the aforementioned dose of
<br>
ether?
<br>
<p>Bear in mind that I've been stacking conjectures
<br>
like pancakes. But when I shared some of these
<br>
same ideas with a good friend a couple of years
<br>
ago, he reported having a mini-satori. It does
<br>
seem to have that effect. &quot;We were never born and
<br>
cannot die,&quot; I said to him then. I can't quite
<br>
shake the feeling that if this is true, it may be
<br>
one of the biggest things I ever learned.
