This is an issue of expected utility, is it not?  The payoff for a 
<br>
friendly Seed AI is orders of magnitudes higher than that for a 
<br>
multi-million dollar jackpot (after taxes).  I consider the chance of 
<br>
Yudkowsky et al. succeeding to be considerably better (but still not 
<br>
acceptable) than the billions-against lottery chances. Add in the higher 
<br>
return, the expected utility is considerably higher for donating to the 
<br>
Institute than for a lottery ticket.
