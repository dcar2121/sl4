<p>Come to think, I've been in the programming game long enough to have 
<br>
actually done this.  Back when computers were slower, I ran up against the 
<br>
30,000 tick bound in the MOO programming system.  I was a timing freak in 
<br>
my early days.  I would take other folks' MOOcode that had formerly taken 
<br>
ten thousand ticks on average and would occasionally cause runtime 
<br>
exceptions when it ran out of time, and rewrite the code with an improved 
<br>
architecture so that it would execute in less than a thousand ticks.  Yes, 
<br>
I know today that this is over-optimization and that I was teaching myself 
<br>
poor programming habits.  I was fourteen at the time.
<br>
<p>So a thousand-tick restriction is not as restrictive as all that in 
<br>
ordinary programming - though a tick of MOOcode translates to considerably 
<br>
more than one assembly-language instruction.  Still, AI coding is not 
<br>
ordinary programing, and I don't think anyone would dare to hypothesize - 
<br>
did they not have the example of humans before them - that the Sacred Grail 
<br>
of Intelligence might be doable at 200Hz.
<br>
<p>People confuse ignorance with difficulty.  Intelligence feels extremely 
<br>
hard because they don't know how to do it.  Obviously, a problem so 
<br>
difficult as intelligence cannot be solved with 200Hz processors.
