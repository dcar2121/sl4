<p>I have previously disputed this assumption, not least because of its 
<br>
consequence.  (Ten steps is just ridiculous...)  Neurologists can easily 
<br>
count spikes.  Decoding information is much harder.  Thus, I suspect that 
<br>
many complex encodings are reported in journals as &quot;firing rates&quot; because 
<br>
that's what neurologists know how to measure and they don't know what's 
<br>
being computed, let alone how to decode it.  For some brain areas, our 
<br>
knowledge of neurobiology may be equivalent to measuring the &quot;firing rates&quot; 
<br>
of transistors in a computer with no idea of what the transistors encode. 
<br>
In other areas, especially vision, we have some idea of what is being 
<br>
computed and so we can do better than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so the number of sequential neuron
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; often needs to compute a response with only time
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; book Unified Theories of Cognition says more about
</em><br>
