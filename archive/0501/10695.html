Ray Kurzweil is writing a book (The Singularity is Near) due to be published
<br>
in April 2005 that I surmise will answer these questions listed below and
<br>
written at a general level.

Subject: Pocket Guide to the Singularity
<br>
<p>Has anyone thought about writing a Pocket Guide to the Singularity?  I'm 
<br>
thinking about something the size of a small book, maybe 6-10 chapters 
<br>
and 20K to 40K words.  It would be written in a language that the 
<br>
average /Popular Science/ or /Scientific American/ reader would be able 
<br>
to understand.  Each chapter could contain a short list of end notes on 
<br>
where the reader could go to learn more.
<br>
<p>Since it's the general rule on this list to not post a bunch of 
<br>
questions, here's what I think would make a decent chapter list:
<br>
1. What is the Singularity?
<br>
2. Who are the the Singularitarians?
<br>
3. How far off is the Singularity?
<br>
4. Why not? / Technical Objections
<br>
5. Why not? / Moral (safety) Objections
<br>
6. Where to go from here.
<br>
<p>The wiki would be a great place to do most of the writing. Most of the 
<br>
content is probably already there, it's just a matter of organizing it 
<br>
in a consumable format.   I have no idea if we could get it published, 
<br>
but who knows... O'Reilly might just be interested in publishing.
<br>
<p>Another good rule is: less talk, more action.  I don't intend on this 
<br>
post to be just idle talk.  I've found myself trying to explain the 
<br>
Singularity one too many times already.  Even if I can't get a group of 
<br>
people to help, I think I'll try to write something up.  On that note, 
<br>
does anyone want to help?
<br>
<p>Feel free to flame me if you think a project like this would be wholly 
<br>
misguided and would result in more damage.
