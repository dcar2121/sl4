<em>&gt; Eliezer's argument seems self-defeating unless he thinks the odds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating AI, let alone FAI, by SIAI's team are better than the odds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning lottery. Otherwise, it would be irrational to tell people not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy lottery tickets while requesting support for SIAI's project to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI that has similarly poor odds of success.
</em><br>
<p>Undoubtedly some will reply, &quot;Given the potential payoff, you should buy 
<br>
that lottery ticket even if the odds were a billion to one.&quot;  (Since what's 
<br>
wrong with the lottery ticket isn't just the tiny odds, but that the payoff 
<br>
doesn't match the tiny odds, especially when the diminishing marginal 
<br>
utility of money is taken into account.  Otherwise, there'd be an industry 
<br>
in millions of people clubbing up to buy a sufficient number of lottery 
<br>
tickets, then dividing the proceeds.)
<br>
<p>I do not answer in this way, because I am on the inside, not the outside, 
<br>
of SIAI.  I do not think that a billion-to-one chance of humanity surviving 
<br>
is acceptable.  I do not think that a hundred-to-one chance is acceptable. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be investing my effort in SIAI unless I thought that, given 
<br>
some set of actions cognitively reachable to me, the odds could reach at 
<br>
least one-in-ten and preferably five-in-ten.  I may not regard these odds 
<br>
as fixed because they depend on my actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we assume this is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent argument, the difference between a plain lottery ticket and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI's version of a lottery ticket must lie in the perception of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respective odds, with the latter &quot;ticket&quot; having much better chance of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning than the former. So the question is very clear. What kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odds does SIAI think it has of succeeding,
</em><br>
<p>I think there's a way for me to get the odds to at least one-in-ten, if I 
<br>
make the right choices; nor are your own choices irrelevant.  If a billion 
<br>
to one isn't good enough for you, get out and push, or die; those are your 
<br>
options.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and beyond that, what is, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general, the odds or probability threshold above which it would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational to buy a type of lottery ticket? 1/10000, 1/1000, 1/100, 1/10?
</em><br>
<p>In general, the answer from expected utility is that it depends simply on 
<br>
the lottery payoff and on the payoff of other available investments.  The 
<br>
only reason I complicate the answer beyond that is because I'm a human, 
<br>
with aspirations and emotions and so on, and to me there is a qualitative 
<br>
difference between being satisfied with a choice and needing to try harder. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Under expected utility maximization, you always try harder.)
