<p>I'm sorry, but I again think your analogy is being used to appear to 
<br>
prove a point in a weaker way by sweeping aside AGI-specific qualities.
<br>
<p>Although I am not a bio expert, it is my understanding that bio labs 
<br>
have various levels of safety protocols which have been developed to 
<br>
deal safely with unknown organisms which are suspected of potentially 
<br>
being dangerous. But there are at least two problems with the analogy:
<br>
<p>1. Usually the lab begins using strong protocols _after_ the organism 
<br>
has already shown it is dangerous - but with an AGI this may be too late 
<br>
to wait before applying the strongest safety protocols. Bio labs have 
<br>
the luxury of fooling around with strange totally unknown things using 
<br>
low safety protocols initially, because if something does go wrong it 
<br>
won't be the end of the world. With an AGI, it's probably not as simple 
<br>
as quarantining a lab or small geographic area when something bad happens.
<br>
<p>2. The bio protocols have themselves been developed based on extremely 
<br>
strong knowledge we have about how to protect from bio dangers - but for 
<br>
AGIs we do not yet have such widely accepted protocols or enough 
<br>
knowledge to create real safety with high confidence (IMO).
<br>
<p>Clearly, AGI-specific safety protocols need to be developed and refined 
<br>
as we gain more knowledge, and they will always almost certainly have to 
<br>
be stricter in some ways than bio or other areas of science if we are 
<br>
going to pay more than lip service to the issue. Which makes sense 
<br>
because you are attempting to form last resort protections from 
<br>
something that is a heck of a lot smarter than a virus.
