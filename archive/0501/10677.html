<p>Good to know. Thanks.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, sure, if nothing interesting happens to FAI theory between now

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Once again, I'm having one of those feelings where either something is
<br>
seriously wrong with me or you're being ridiculous. Consider: people run up
<br>
against problems in every field of study. Some of those turn out to be
<br>
solvable problems. Others are fundamental, unsolvable or intractable problems.
<br>
I won't give you a list, because I hope to God that people interested in a
<br>
computer-related field would know a few. Now, given that intractable problems
<br>
exist, the hole that the Last Judge kludges closed could be either tractable
<br>
or intractable. You claim that there is zero probability that it is
<br>
intractable. Bullshit. I don't see why you have reason to assume any 
<br>
probability, unless you have some theory for a replacement that you're working
<br>
on. 
<br>
<p>But even if we can agree on a nonzero probability that a better solution will
<br>
be developed, it still doesn't make any sense to me to talk about the new
<br>
solution to the problem you expect to develop in X amount of time. We
<br>
criticise the current solution because it's there. 
<br>
<p>I'm thinking of something Eliezer said about being a professional paranoid and
<br>
worrying that everything will go wrong at once being the best way to ensure
<br>
that if it can go right, it will. I think that's a good policy, and I
<br>
encourage anyone else who thinks it's good to stop assuming that a better
<br>
solution to your problem can be found. I don't think that a SI will be able to
<br>
find a non-quantum polynomial time factoring algorithm, not because it's not
<br>
smart enough, but because I have no good reason to believe one exists.
<br>
Likewise, what reason do you have to assume a solution to this problem exists?
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
Daniel
