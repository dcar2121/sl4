<p>Taking into account expected utility of FAI seems like a good way of 
<br>
justifying the argument that it is rational to support SIAI while it is 
<br>
irrational to buy lottery tickets until one realizes that all potential 
<br>
benefits to humanity from having FAI around are entirely dependent on the 
<br>
successful event actually happening. In other words, a person won't benefit 
<br>
from FAI any more than from a winning lottery ticket if FAI doesn't get made 
<br>
and he doesn't win the lottery. In both cases the utility will equal zero. 
<br>
This makes the issue of expected utility of FAI completely irrelevant to the 
<br>
question of whether one should support SIAI rather than buy lottery tickets, 
<br>
if we treat both &quot;winning&quot; events as having virtually no chance of 
<br>
happening.
<br>
<p>So Eliezer's argument implicitly tries to convince people not to bother 
<br>
investing in anything with low probability of success, regardless of the 
<br>
return value on the investment (otherwise we should be encouraged to buy 
<br>
lottery tickets), inadvertently making also a good case for not supporting 
<br>
SIAI since FAI project has also low probability of success in the eyes of 
<br>
many.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I consider the chance of Yudkowsky et al. succeeding to be considerably
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances.
</em><br>
<p>Can I ask what you are basing this statement on?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Add in the higher return, the expected utility is considerably higher for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donating to the Institute than for a lottery ticket.
</em><br>
<p>True, but, like I said, the amount of expected utility is orthogonal to the 
<br>
issue.
