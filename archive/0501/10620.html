<p>Your two statements of certainty are in direct conflict with each other, 
<br>
so I don't see how you can hold both at the same time.
<br>
<p>If on one hand you claim there is an absolutely zero chance, then you 
<br>
must know in extremely amazing detail with 100% certainty what it takes 
<br>
for &quot;take off&quot;. Or conversely if you don't know with perfect knowledge 
<br>
what it takes for &quot;take off&quot; then how can you claim a zero chance.
<br>
<p>Of course the answer is that no one should be claiming a zero chance. 
<br>
And the other answer is that we need to continue gaining more knowledge. 
<br>
But because of the unknowns, gaining that knowledge should be done in as 
<br>
safe a manner as possible.
<br>
<p>For some reason this reminds me of the worries at the time of the a-bomb 
<br>
that many of the physicists had about whether it would accidentally 
<br>
ignite the entire atmosphere. They didn't know at first what would 
<br>
happen, and most of them would not have told you that the possibility 
<br>
was &quot;absolutely zero&quot;. In fact even after they ran some numbers on 
<br>
paper, they still weren't absolutely certain. But they did by that point 
<br>
have enough odds in their favor to proceed. But even at the end when it 
<br>
was tested they were still heard betting with each other on the outcome. 
<br>
There was never absolute certainty.
