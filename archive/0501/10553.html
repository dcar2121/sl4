<em>&gt; When I have this conversation with intelligent lottery players, the

</em><br>
<p>I know I've raised this point before, but I think we have different 
<br>
standards for whom we call &quot;intelligent&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most lottery players know the expected value of a lottery ticket is less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the price they pay for the ticket, but they play anyway because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they like the psychological drama of it.
</em><br>
<p>They play because they are not strong enough in the Way to feel emotionally 
<br>
the true meaning of the words, &quot;Odds of a hundred million to one&quot;.  They 
<br>
have not learned to translate mere dry statistics into a feeling of 
<br>
absolute and utter certainty, far exceeding any proposition of science or 
<br>
everyday life, that they SHALL NOT win the lottery.  If you understand 
<br>
that, there is no psychological drama.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case, you are underestimating both the intelligence and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological perversity of the average human, it would seem...
</em><br>
<p>I am not underestimating it.  You must distinguish between my disliking 
<br>
something and my thinking that it is improbable, or even unusual.  I 
<br>
understand the thriving lottery industry as the present state of affairs, 
<br>
and I ask &quot;How can we train people not to buy lottery tickets?&quot;  The 
<br>
parable of the blue tentacle is a means to that end - to convey the 
<br>
principle that we should devalue the affective weight of our thought 
<br>
experiments according to their statistical improbability or physical 
<br>
impossibility.
