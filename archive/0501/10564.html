<p>You don't understand 'The Way' Ben ;)
<br>
<p>What seems like an inexplicable 'value' (for instance
<br>
an emotional drive) from one perspective looks like a
<br>
‘reason’ from another perspective.
<br>
<p>Let me give you a parable to try to explain.  
<br>
<p>Imagine two observers watching a wood cutter using an
<br>
axe to chop wood.  The wood cutter has to chop the
<br>
same piece of wood repeatedly until he breaks it in
<br>
half.  One observer is a 3 year old let's say.  The
<br>
other observer is his brother who is 10 let's say.
<br>
<p>Every 10 seconds or so the 3-year old sees the man
<br>
raise the axe and bring it down on the wood.  Why did
<br>
the man keep doing that? he asks himself.  From his
<br>
perspective he only sees a series of disconnected
<br>
events corresponding to the goal 'Raise axe, bring it
<br>
down on wood'.  But this 'value' to him is
<br>
inexplicable.  He says to himself:  I understand the
<br>
axe rising and falling - that's rationally
<br>
explainable.  But why does the man want to keep doing
<br>
that? - His goal 'Raise axe, bring it down on wood' is
<br>
a value, and therefore outside rationally.
<br>
<p>But look at things from the perspective of the 10-year
<br>
old.  He does not see a series of disconnected events.
<br>
&nbsp;He perceives the motion 'Raise axe, bring it down on
<br>
wood', as a *sub-goal* and he *can* rationally explain
<br>
it - as being part of the meta-goal 'Break the wood in
<br>
half'.  
<br>
<p>Now perhaps that 10-year old might then ask himself:
<br>
'Ah, but why does that man want to break the wood in
<br>
half in the first place'? The events corresponding to
<br>
the man chopping the wood until it breaks he might say
<br>
is part of *rationality*.  But why is the man
<br>
motivated to be there in the first place?  He might
<br>
say: 'Oh well, that's a value and therefore outside of
<br>
rationality'.  But that would be to make the same
<br>
mistake as his 3-year old brother.
<br>
<p>You see?
