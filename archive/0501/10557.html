<p>
I'm glad I'm not the one working on FAI all day.  I'd
<br>
have gone mad by now.  Lucky I'm only looking into it
<br>
as hobby.  I can see why Eli called FAI theory
<br>
'friggin hard' (big understatement!).
<br>
<p>None the less, I think my understanding has improved
<br>
to the point where I at least understand in general
<br>
terms what the concept 'Friendliness' mean.  So here
<br>
I've had a go at attempting to give, in my own words,
<br>
a technical definition of 'Friendliness'.  Admittedly
<br>
it's only a very general definition, but I don't think
<br>
it's vacuous or gibberish.  That is, I think I'm
<br>
actually defining something meaningful here.  If you
<br>
disagree by all means please tell me.
<br>
<p>For background you just need to understand basic terms
<br>
from maths (functions, computability, uncomputability,
<br>
prospective attributes, listable attributes etc) and a
<br>
bit of cosmology too ;)  
<br>
<p>So here goes:
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>PROPOSED TECHNICAL DEFINITION OF FRIENDLINESS
<br>
<p>Marc Geddes, 19th Jan, 2005
<br>
<p>* Proposition: A mind is a utility function.  The
<br>
universe itself could be interpreted as a kind of mind
<br>
in the limit that it formed a super-intelligence at an
<br>
Omega Point.  Therefore any concept within reality
<br>
could be interpreted as a 'utility function' within
<br>
the universal mind.
<br>
<p>The 'Omega Point' condition requires that the rate of
<br>
information processing (computation) within the
<br>
universe approaches infinity as time approaches the
<br>
end.  The idea is that a concept is no different to
<br>
the computational function existing in the mind of a
<br>
super-intelligence which generates a list of all
<br>
things possessing the attribute, in the limit that the
<br>
Omega Point condition is approached.
<br>
<p>Example:  The concept 'Beauty' is defined as being
<br>
equivalent to the mathematical function which
<br>
generates a list of all beautiful things.  This is an
<br>
uncomputable function, since beauty appears to a
<br>
prospective attribute: the function to recognize or
<br>
generate beautiful things cannot be finitely
<br>
specified.  
<br>
<p>But if the Omega Point condition holds for our
<br>
universe, then the function can be defined to be the
<br>
one that a super-intelligence (Universal Mind) would
<br>
hold, in the limit that the rate of information
<br>
processing was approaching infinity (Omega Point).  So
<br>
all concepts can be thought of as 'utility functions'
<br>
in the universal mind.
<br>
<p>Concept x=
<br>
Omega x = 
<br>
Utility function generating all things with attribute
<br>
x in the limit that the universe becomes Omega Point
<br>
super-intelligence
<br>
<p>Partial  x  = 
<br>
Utility function which is a finitely specified
<br>
approximation to function Omega x
<br>
<p>* Propositions:  All concepts in reality can be
<br>
interpreted as utility functions.  'Friendliness' is a
<br>
concept; therefore Friendliness is a utility function.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The class of friendly sentients appears to be
<br>
potentially infinite, making 'Friendliness' a
<br>
prospective attribute.  Therefore the exact
<br>
Friendliness utility function is uncomputable.  
<br>
<p>All friendly sentients will consist of finitely
<br>
specified approximation functions  to the exact
<br>
utility function.  But by definition, a truly friendly
<br>
sentient aims to become as friendly as possible. 
<br>
Therefore all finite approximations to 'Friendliness'
<br>
must have the property that they are recursive and
<br>
converge on the ideal utility function.
<br>
<p>Let Partial Friendly (PF) = finitely specified
<br>
approximation to the Friendliness function.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omega Friendly (OF) = exact Friendliness
<br>
function (uncomputable)
<br>
<p>PF must be a recursive function such that PF (PF)
<br>
outputs PF’ which approaches OF as number of
<br>
iterations approaches infinity.  
<br>
<p>Definition of Friendliness  
<br>
<p>A computable 'Friendly' function (PF) is a function
<br>
which takes any finitely specified function Partial x
<br>
as input and modifies it such that the outputted
<br>
function Partial x' is a better approximation to Omega
<br>
x.   Successive output used as input for the next
<br>
iteration has to cause Partial x' to converge on Omega
<br>
x as the number of iterations approaches infinity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A PF function is itself a finitely specified function
<br>
approximating the uncomputable function Omega Friendly
<br>
(OF).  So PF (PF) approaches OF as number of
<br>
iterations approaches infinity.
