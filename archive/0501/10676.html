<p>Okay Daniel:  Perhaps you are not getting clear answers because the 
<br>
questions (1, 2 and 3) are poorly constructed and you do not have the same 
<br>
understanding of the problems as the respondents.  Maybe I can clarify by 
<br>
re-phrasing and critiquing the questions.
<br>
<p>Question (1) is poorly constructed because it asks about two completely 
<br>
different things.  It should be rewritten as two question, such as:
<br>
<p>1a. In developing FAI will some form of Last Judge be used?
<br>
<p>1b. In developing FAI will some form of AI Jail be used?
<br>
<p>The concepts of Last Judge and AI Jail should be considered separately 
<br>
because neither relies on the other to be created.  Also AI Jail is not well 
<br>
defined, and people will answer differently depending on their conception of 
<br>
it.  You may want to consider improving question (1a) by providing your 
<br>
definition of AI Jail.
<br>
<p>Question (2) shows that your concept of the Last Judge (LJ) is different 
<br>
from the originator's idea, in that you expect the LJ to assess friendliness 
<br>
whereas the originator specified that the LJ would assess an outcome.  These 
<br>
are two very different kinds of assessment.  The question could be rewritten 
<br>
as:
<br>
<p>2. Will a Last Judge be used and have sole authority to determine the 
<br>
acceptability of the outcome of CV?
<br>
<p>The short answer to (2) was made by Robin Lee Powell in an earlier post.
<br>
<p>Question (3) shows again that your concept of how to check friendliness is 
<br>
different from that of those involved, in that you ask about friendliness 
<br>
assessment specifically after the AI starts to improve whereas I doubt that 
<br>
the originators would alter friendliness assessment procedures at that time. 
<br>
Good procedures assessing friendliness should work before, during and after 
<br>
any self-improvement processes.  What code auditing would be used on a 
<br>
self-improving process? is a question on a different level and would have a 
<br>
substantially different answer.  I do not know the answer at this time and 
<br>
couldn't give a meaningful one until I saw a more detailed technical design. 
<br>
The questions &quot;Is it friendly&quot; and &quot;Is it doing what we programmed it to do&quot; 
<br>
are two quite different questions.  A friendliness assessment would be 
<br>
designed to answer the former question, a code audit would answer the 
<br>
latter.
