<p>Bad form to reply to one's self, but:
<br>
<p>Of course, in a strict sense, if simulations are
<br>
part of the current algorithm, there is no possible
<br>
algorithm which is more intelligent in a &quot;strong&quot;
<br>
sense.  However, the rest of what I wrote still stands,
<br>
since there will be algorithms which cannot be
<br>
simulated on the current hardware with the current
<br>
algorithm, which are in fact better than the current
<br>
algorithm (but perhaps not provably so).  Even given
<br>
this, though, they can't be *that* much better than
<br>
the current algorithm, since that would imply they
<br>
are simulable with a VM that can fit in the current
<br>
system.  Even a tiny difference in effective speed
<br>
or memory use may grow quite large in millions of
<br>
iterations, of course, and so the edge still goes to
<br>
AI without goals which require internal simulation
<br>
(goals which include Friendliness, e.g.).
<br>
<p>In the past, of course, Eliezer has mentioned using
<br>
proofs, which might replace some kinds of simulation.
<br>
Proofs of the correctness of code have so far proven
<br>
(sorry!) elusive.
