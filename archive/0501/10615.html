<em>&gt; I do not answer in this way, because I am on the inside, not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside, of SIAI.  I do not think that a billion-to-one chance of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity surviving is acceptable.  I do not think that a hundred-to-one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance is acceptable.  I would not be investing my effort in SIAI unless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that, given some set of actions cognitively reachable to me,

</em><br>
<p>A clarification:
<br>
<p>These are my ass numbers on what I think are the best achievable *complete* 
<br>
odds of success including all adversities (floods, wildfires, killer bees, 
<br>
nanowar, an AGI project crossing the finish line before an FAI project, and 
<br>
failure of Friendliness).  They are *not* meant to describe the achievable 
<br>
odds of Friendliness|AGI-success.  As I indicated before, I think that we 
<br>
ought to be able to get a theoretical guarantee on that.  Even in fallible 
<br>
human practice, a theoretical guarantee ought to drive the conditional 
<br>
probability of failure at that junction into the range of ten percent, 
<br>
maybe even 1 in 300 - not historically out of question for an engineering 
<br>
project based on clearly understood principles with engineers given free 
<br>
rein to implement multiple rings of safety margin.
