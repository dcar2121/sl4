<p>To clarify yet another point (I was asked in a private email), this doesn't
<br>
mean I believe that Ben is any closer to the finish line than, say, A2I2 or
<br>
James Rogers.  It means that if I thought Ben had solved the problem of
<br>
Friendliness, I would expect him to solve the lesser problem of AGI, hence,
<br>
would join his project.  I don't see how Ben-2004 could possibly solve FAI
<br>
- his reply to the above statement, especially paragraph 4, is clear enough 
<br>
evidence of that.  But I do not know how to calculate the space of AGI 
<br>
programs that go FOOM.  (It's an odd inability, I know, since so many 
<br>
others seem to be blessed with this knowledge.)  I don't know Novamente's 
<br>
source code, and couldn't calculate its probability of going FOOM even if I 
<br>
had it.  I just know the first rule of gun safety, which is that a gun is 
<br>
always loaded. Even if I had a mathematical proof that the gun wasn't 
<br>
loaded (which I don't) I would treat the gun as if it were loaded anyway, 
<br>
to avoid forming bad gun handling habits.
<br>
<p>This is kindergarten stuff.  I know this.  Harvey knows this.  Anyone else
<br>
who deals professionally with a risk to life and limb knows this.  People
<br>
who don't know this win Darwin Awards.  The only problem with the field of
<br>
AI is that one project that doesn't understand the kindergarten-level rules
<br>
of safety can potentially take the planet down with them.  Otherwise
<br>
natural selection would take care of the problem, just like it takes care
<br>
of kids who think that guns aren't loaded.
