<em>&gt; Stephen Gould's reputation is trash among serious evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biologists,
</em><br>
<p>It's just not true.  He's a controversial figure, but plenty of serious
<br>
evolutionary biologists think his contributions were highly important, and
<br>
very few would deny he made *some* important contributions.
<br>
<p>This article
<br>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i27/27a01401.htm">http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i27/27a01401.htm</a>
<br>
<p>gives a fair but generally critical assessment of Gould's academic
<br>
reputation:
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
...
<br>
Many paleontologists regard Mr. Gould favorably, even when they disagree
<br>
with him. &quot;There's no question he's been one of the most influential and
<br>
visible paleontologists, and indeed evolutionary biologists, in the last 50
<br>
years,&quot; says David Jablonski, a professor of geophysical sciences at the
<br>
University of Chicago and a young leader in the field. &quot;Gould has provided
<br>
an overarching vision and this astonishing ability to move among disciplines
<br>
and integrate these ideas into producing a coherent picture.&quot;
<br>
<p>Evolutionary biologists who study living organisms -- known as
<br>
neontologists -- are far less admiring. ....
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>But when they talk about his contributions, neither paleontologists nor
<br>
neontologists rank Mr. Gould nearly as high as the public does. In a study
<br>
of scientific citations, Florida State's Mr. Ruse found that few
<br>
evolutionary biologists, aside from paleontologists, refer to Mr. Gould's
<br>
key papers on punctuated equilibrium. The Chronicle's own examination of
<br>
citations -- performed by ISI, a database-publishing company in
<br>
Philadelphia -- yields more-favorable results, showing that three of the
<br>
papers studied by Mr. Ruse have garnered 500 citations, with one topping
<br>
1,000. Only 0.03 percent of papers ever top 500 citations, says David
<br>
Pendlebury, a researcher at ISI.
<br>
<p>That makes Mr. Gould special but far from unique. Some 6,000 papers in the
<br>
ISI database have gained more than 500 citations. To most scientists in his
<br>
field, he is simply one of dozens of evolutionary thinkers who have made
<br>
important contributions in the past 100 years.
<br>

<p><p><em>&gt; not always because Gould gets it wrong, but because Gould claims, as his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own brilliant revolutionary ideas, warped and dumbed-down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary tenets of modern evolutionary biology.  (Tooby and
