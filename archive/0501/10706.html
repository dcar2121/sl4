<p>
Suppose that humanity, instead of evolving intelligence on a hundred 
<br>
trillion 200Hz synapses, had instead evolved essentially equivalent 
<br>
intelligence on a million 2 GHz processors using slightly more efficient 
<br>
serial algorithms (my example postulates a factor-of-ten efficiency 
<br>
improvement, no more).  Let's call these alternate selves Humans.
<br>
<p>Would anyone here dare to predict, in advance, that it was even 
<br>
*theoretically possible* to achieve Human-equivalent intelligence on 200Hz 
<br>
processors no matter *how* many of them you had?
<br>
<p>Even I wouldn't dare.  Trying my best to be conservative and to widen my 
<br>
confidence interval, my guess is that I would guess 10KHz, or 1KHz given a 
<br>
superintelligent programmer, and I would probably have the lowest guess in 
<br>
the crowd - both because of my guess that intelligence doesn't require much 
<br>
crunch, and because I knew to widen my confidence intervals.
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel would laugh at me, saying that Human-equivalent intelligence 
<br>
carried out with one thousand sequential serial operations per second was 
<br>
obviously impossible.  Perhaps Ben would suggest that I try writing code 
<br>
that executed with a bound of ten thousand sequential serial operations, to 
<br>
get a feel for how restrictive that limit was.
<br>
<p>And if you suggested two hundred serial instructions per second - pfft! 
<br>
Now you're just being silly, they would say; and while I might credit you 
<br>
for fearless audacity, I probably wouldn't defend you, lest I be tarred 
<br>
with the same brush.  Like the reaction you might get if you suggested that 
<br>
intelligence could run on a 286, or use less than 4KB of RAM, or be 
<br>
produced by natural selection.
<br>
<p>If any computational neurobiologists were present, they might even be able 
<br>
to provide a quantitative mathematical argument, showing that some of the 
<br>
basic algorithms known to be used in Human neurobiology intrinsically 
<br>
required more than ten thousand serial steps per second.  So too did Lord 
<br>
Kelvin prove by quantitative calculation that the Sun could not have burned 
<br>
for more than a few tens of millions of years.
<br>
<p>One of the great lessons of history is that &quot;absurd&quot; is not a scientific 
<br>
argument.  The future is usually &quot;absurd&quot; relative to the past.  Reality is 
<br>
very tightly restrained in the kinds of absurdity it presents you with; the 
<br>
human history of the 20th century might be absurd from the perspective of 
<br>
the 19th century, but not one of those absurdities violated the law of 
<br>
conservation of momentum.  Even so, &quot;absurd&quot; is not good evidence because 
<br>
of the historical observation that the answers we now know were &quot;absurd&quot; to 
<br>
people who didn't grow up with our background assumptions.  &quot;Obvious&quot; is 
<br>
often wrong and &quot;absolutely certain&quot; isn't remotely close to 1.0 calibration.
<br>
<p>Widen the bounds of your confidence interval.  Spread the wings of your 
<br>
probability distribution, and fly.
<br>
