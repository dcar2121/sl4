Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, when I was a math prof at UNLV, a number of my fellow math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; professors liked to gamble on a regular basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These folks had high IQ's, decently long lists of pure-math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; publications, and generally a lot of common sense and rationality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyday life situations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was a bit perplexed at the time that these highly clever and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable mathematicians were at all interested in gambling, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was before I grasped the deep perversity of human nature as fully as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do now ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're admiring the wrong people!  Let them stop buying lottery tickets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then admire them.  It only defeats your own potential if you think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence has no better use than that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, my friend, I'm able to admire some aspects of a person while not
<br>
admiring others...
<br>
<p>Gambling is a form of entertainment.  We all entertain ourselves sometimes,
<br>
it's part of our human nature.  Are you sure gambling is *that* much less
<br>
rational than seeking entertainment via sending frivolous posts about
<br>
gambling to the SL4 list?  The latter takes time, and time is money as we
<br>
all know ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People pray because they want their child to not die of cancer.  Teaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them not to pray means (a) teaching them not to want their child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) associating different outcomes with the effort of prayer.
</em><br>
<p>People are screwier than this.  My 7-year-old daughter prays at night, and
<br>
she says she doesn't believe it works because she doesn't believe in God,
<br>
but she prays because she enjoys the ritual of it and it makes her feel
<br>
good.
<br>
<p>Of course, she's young and confused and I suspect that when she gets older
<br>
she'll either give up praying, or have some kind of religious &quot;leap of
<br>
faith.&quot;   But some people are old and confused too....
<br>
<p>So, IMO, teaching people not to pray mainly requires teaching them other
<br>
ways to derive the emotional &amp; spiritual gratification they derive via
<br>
praying.
<br>
<p>For instance, in my daughter's case, encouraging her to convert her prayer
<br>
ritual into a similarly soothing personal ritual without any fictive deity
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lottery.  Even if they claim to pursue the allure of the allure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unimaginable wealth rather than the allure of unimaginable wealth per se,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both allures depend on a false belief - a subtle false belief, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while their verbally reported probabilities may be correct, their feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of probability doesn't correspond to the verbal report.  If people knew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and thought faster, they wouldn't play the lottery.
</em><br>
<p>I really don't think that's true.  IMO, if they knew more and thought faster
<br>
but had the same emotional structure, they'd still play.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I strongly suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;I understand the probabilities, but I pursue the drama&quot; is a post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facto excuse so that they can retain their self-respect as rationalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without modifying a behavior they know to be irrational.  If they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood the probabilities, there would not be drama.
</em><br>
<p>It's just not true.  Nearly all mathematicians who gamble understand the
<br>
probabilities at least as well as you do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I.e. it involves changing their motivational structure rather than their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasoning methods, it seems to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Change the reasoning method, and the motivational structure will follow.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, you keep making this repeated statement, and I don't agree with it.
<br>
<p>Do you have any rational argument for this statement, or any empirical
<br>
evidence?
<br>
<p>It doesn't really match with what I know about the human psyche.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I am an AGI wannabe and I have made any sort of significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress, I ought to be able to solve problems in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eyes closed standing on my head in a cold shower with my left cerebral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hemisphere removed.
</em><br>
<p>I don't recommend you test this conjecture empirically...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
