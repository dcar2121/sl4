<p>I know you want to drop this topic, but I think you're still missing the 
<br>
point I've been trying to make all along which is that neither I nor you 
<br>
nor anyone yet has enough proof for taking strong stances regarding AGI 
<br>
safety. I have not made any definite claims, other than pointing out 
<br>
that uncertainties exist. You on the other hand have made several strong 
<br>
assertions in the last few posts, which if they turn out to be wrong, 
<br>
could be extremely dangerous.
<br>
<p>If you were simply being modest when you said that no one knows enough 
<br>
about AGI to create one yet, then by all means let us know the details 
<br>
of your knowledge that backup your AGI assertions. If not, then you must 
<br>
agree with me that there is no basis for such strong assertions, and 
<br>
therefore for safety we should proceed with AGI development as if those 
<br>
assertions will turn out to be wrong.
<br>
<p>Maybe you haven't yet imagined and internalized the feeling of 
<br>
accidentally igniting the atmosphere. If you had, I can't imagine why 
<br>
you would be making any non-proven assertions regarding practices and/or 
<br>
assumptions that would reduce AGI development safety. Put yourself in 
<br>
Oppenheimer's shoes and spend some time there, because if you are 
<br>
planning to actually attempt coding an AGI (even a prototype in my 
<br>
opinion) you are effectively placing yourself in such a position.
<br>
<p>I think what Eliezer just posted fits here too:
<br>
<p>&quot;But I do not know how to calculate the space of AGI programs that go 
<br>
FOOM.  (It's an odd inability, I know, since so many others seem to be 
<br>
blessed with this knowledge.)  I don't know Novamente's source code, and 
<br>
couldn't calculate its probability of going FOOM even if I had it.  I 
<br>
just know the first rule of gun safety, which is that a gun is always 
<br>
loaded. Even if I had a mathematical proof that the gun wasn't loaded 
<br>
(which I don't) I would treat the gun as if it were loaded anyway, to 
<br>
avoid forming bad gun handling habits.
<br>
<p>This is kindergarten stuff.  I know this.  Harvey knows this.  Anyone else
<br>
who deals professionally with a risk to life and limb knows this.  People
<br>
who don't know this win Darwin Awards.  The only problem with the field of
<br>
AI is that one project that doesn't understand the kindergarten-level rules
<br>
of safety can potentially take the planet down with them.  Otherwise
<br>
natural selection would take care of the problem, just like it takes care
<br>
of kids who think that guns aren't loaded.&quot;
