<p>I assert, however, that no oughts could exist if
<br>
the actor were the only individual. A social
<br>
vacuum is an ethical/moral vacuum. Indeed, no
<br>
human could stay sane alone for really
<br>
significant periods of time. Solitary creatures
<br>
(many of which are carnivores) are rather alien
<br>
to us, and the most intelligent animals are
<br>
social; complete solitude is incompatible with
<br>
what we call ethical or moral values. Nothing a
<br>
spider can do is right or wrong, while an ant has
<br>
a clear role it must play in a successful colony.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to equate people with ants, but I
<br>
guess I did anyway. And I'll stand by that
<br>
comparison insofar as I consider unethical
<br>
behavior to be wrong specifically because it is
<br>
bad for the hive. If humans could consistently
<br>
hold themselves to high ethical standards, the
<br>
world would be a noticeably safer place, with
<br>
less exploitation and and coercion, resulting in
<br>
less motivation among some parties to try to blow
<br>
each other up, etc.
<br>
<p>As an illustration of this principle, consider an
<br>
election in a liberal democracy where the loser
<br>
submits gracefully, knowing that the winner will
<br>
not proceed to have him shot.
<br>
If the winner does shoot the loser, it is
<br>
understood that losing is unhealthy and
<br>
submitting nonviolently to the election results
<br>
is a bad strategy.
<br>
If either side consistently cheats or resorts to
<br>
violence, a downward spiral ensues, perhaps to
<br>
civil war. The hive is rent asunder because the
<br>
ants could not restrain themselves.
<br>
<p>The cause and effect might be regarded as
<br>
objective, but that is not really the same as
<br>
'objective morality.' A scientist on the moon
<br>
might watch the civil war through a scope with
<br>
cold, clinical detachment, and say &quot;Ah, the
<br>
social contract broke down. Oh well.&quot; Or he might
<br>
say &quot;The social contract broke down! This is a
<br>
disgrace!&quot; and rain lightning bolts down on all
<br>
the malefactors.
<br>
You see, the idea that there is an objective
<br>
morality IMHO depends on an outside observer who
<br>
judges. William Blake used to call him Old
<br>
Nobodaddy.
