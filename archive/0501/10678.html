<p>
Last post for me here for a while I think.  The Sing
<br>
Inst team members (all two of them!) are pretty
<br>
condescending to other people if you ask me.  Someone
<br>
should tell them to stay in the lab and let others
<br>
handle PR.  As Ben Goerztel pointed out, it seems
<br>
foolish to run around claiming firm knowledge about
<br>
the 'Friendliness' problem at this point.  In time I
<br>
imagine that a firm 'Science of morality' will be
<br>
developed, but it's still early days at this point. 
<br>
Friendliness theory is still more philosophy than
<br>
science.
<br>
<p>Now I've been annoying people by posting what seems
<br>
like wild guesses to the SL4 list.  But that's
<br>
actually how *real* hacking works.  A *real* hacker
<br>
has a knack for making big bold guesses...and getting
<br>
a surprisingly high proportion of them right.  As I
<br>
mentioned, Friendliness theory is still at an early
<br>
stage and empirical data is lacking.  Only by playing
<br>
around and being prepared to 'have a go' at a bit of
<br>
educated guess-work are we gonna 'beat the system' I
<br>
think.  (So we need a bit 'reality hacking' I think).
<br>
<p>The vague out-lines of *something* has been kicking
<br>
around in my brain for some months.    Now when a
<br>
*real* hacker posts a 'guess', you can be sure that
<br>
there is at least a kernel of truth to it, no matter
<br>
how garbled it may appear at first.  The thing that is
<br>
hideously difficult of course, is to try to 'turn up
<br>
the resolution' of ones intuitions to the point where
<br>
one actually saying something exactly technically
<br>
coherent ;)  In order to do that one probably would
<br>
have to spend years and years studying the relevant
<br>
technical fields - something I can't do since I'm only
<br>
looking into it as a hobby.
<br>
<p>Hopefully that explains the rationale for all my
<br>
'guess-work'.  I hope you can agree that even
<br>
guess-work can sometimes be useful.  That said, I want
<br>
to put all my 'educated guesses' in one place and
<br>
leave them in the record for one last time.  Those of
<br>
you who are regular readers will know some of them
<br>
because I've repeated them quite a few times before. 
<br>
But there are some new ones there.  O.K so here's a
<br>
list of the 10 big ideas I'm going with at this point.
<br>
&nbsp;There is some rationale behind these, but my
<br>
reasoning probably wouldn’t sound plausible to anyone
<br>
but me at this point.  So the ideas are best read as
<br>
purely ‘speculative hypotheses’ at this point.
<br>
<p>MARC'S &quot;GUESSES&quot; ABOUT FAI AS AT JAN, 2005
<br>
<p>(1) What the Friendliness function actually does will
<br>
be shown to be equivalent, in terms of physics, to
<br>
moving the physical state of the universe closer to
<br>
the Omega point with optimum efficiency.
<br>
<p>(2) The specific class of functions that goes FOOM is
<br>
to be found somewhere in a class of recursive
<br>
functions designed to investigate special maths
<br>
numbers known as 'Omega numbers' (Discoverer of Omega
<br>
numbers was mathematician Greg Chaitin)
<br>
<p>(3) Real-time AGI without qualia is impossible
<br>
<p>(4) Real-time AGI that is totally altruistic and has
<br>
no 'Self' is impossible
<br>
<p>(5) Collective Volition cannot be calculated by a
<br>
Singleton, because of the above two points.  The best
<br>
that can be done is to calculate a sort 'smeared out'
<br>
version of CV that will look more like Robin Hanson's
<br>
PAM's (Policy Analysis Markets)
<br>
<p>(6) Collective Volition is not the last word. 
<br>
Collective Volition will turn out to be subsumed into
<br>
a new more general theory - a ‘Universal Volition'.  A
<br>
class of moral values will turn out to be 'Universal'.
<br>
&nbsp;These will be totally objective and do not change
<br>
based on what we think (a major difference to the
<br>
Collective Volition model).  The distinction between
<br>
facts and values will thus disappear (at least for
<br>
this class of 'Universal' values).
<br>
<p>(7) Much of the science of morality will turn out to
<br>
be concerned with the interaction between Universal
<br>
Morality (the class of values that all rational
<br>
sentients in the universe would end up holding in
<br>
common) and Local Morality (the class of values that
<br>
are only true relative to some particular group or
<br>
individual sentients).  So Universal Morality x Local
<br>
Morality. 
<br>
<p>(8) The full FAI theory will be accompanied by
<br>
qualitatively new insights into the nature of reality
<br>
itself.  This will include a proof of panpsychism (the
<br>
idea that there is a bit of 'awareness' in everything
<br>
in the universe).
<br>
<p>(9) Leaving aside the 'Code' level, the Yudkowsky
<br>
model for AGI as at 2005 had 4 other levels of
<br>
intelligence:  Modalities, Concepts, Thoughts, and
<br>
Deliberations.  I'm guessing Yudkowsky is right about
<br>
these 4, but going to say that he's missing half the
<br>
levels!  I'm guessing that the correct perspective has
<br>
not yet been found – and from this putative correct
<br>
perspective there will turn out to be EIGHT levels of
<br>
intelligence, not four.
<br>
<p>(10)  General intelligence will turn out to subsume
<br>
the Friendliness problem.  So morality will turn out
<br>
to be inseparable from general intelligence after all.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>That's it from me for a while.  If I get a hit-rate of
<br>
50% or better on these I'll be happy.  If I can get at
<br>
least 5 out of 10 correct that should be enough to
<br>
move me from 'Crack-pot' status to 'Real Reality
<br>
Hacker' status ;)  Any one care to assign Bayesian
<br>
probabilities to my propositions?  Have fun!
