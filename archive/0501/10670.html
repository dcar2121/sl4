<p>1. In developing FAI, some form of Last Judge/AI Jail will be used.
<br>
<p>2. ...[The] judge will have sole authority to determine whether an AI is 
<br>
sufficiently friendly/correctly programmed/whatever he's supposed to 
<br>
determine.
<br>
<p>3. ...[O]nce the AI begins to self improve, we have to evaluate its...degree 
<br>
of friendliness on the basis of its actions.
<br>
<p><p>The Last Judge concept is in the plan AFAIK, but begrudgingly so because it 
<br>
is such a kludge.  The Last Judge would determine the desirability of an 
<br>
outcome, not friendliness.  If someone has a better idea of how to evaluate 
<br>
an outcome without influencing it (Daniel?) then I'd be glad to hear it.
<br>
<p>The AI Jail concept will probably be used in the sense of &quot;running on 
<br>
computers that are not connected to the network&quot; but not in the sense of &quot;we 
<br>
will see how it behaves before we let it out&quot;.  The first sense is useful in 
<br>
that it provides a minimum level of protection against code 'escaping' or 
<br>
being stolen.  The second sense is not useful because it suggests that AI 
<br>
evaluation by humans can be done the same way as human evaluation by humans, 
<br>
which is false for the type of AI we are attempting to build.
<br>
<p>AI evaluation will use many methods of observation, all of which boil down 
<br>
to observing actions.  Determining a 'degree' of friendliness will involve a 
<br>
complex technical procedure of comparison against ideal data &amp; models - 
<br>
something that could only be done by a team of experts with a thorough 
<br>
understanding of the models.  My guess is that it will take a *lot* of time 
<br>
and effort.
