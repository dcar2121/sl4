New Scientist: Computers can learn the meaning of words simply by
<br>
plugging into Google. The finding could bring forward the day that
<br>
true artificial intelligence is developed.
<br>
Paul Vitanyi and Rudi Cilibrasi of the National Institute for
<br>
Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,
<br>
realised that a Google search can be used to measure how closely two
<br>
words relate to each other. For instance, imagine a computer needs to
<br>
understand what a hat is.
<br>
To do this, it needs to build a word tree - a database of how words
<br>
relate to each other. It might start with any two words to see how
<br>
they relate to each other. For example, if it googles &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;head&quot;
<br>
together it gets nearly 9 million hits, compared to, say, fewer than
<br>
half a million hits for &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;banana&quot;. Clearly &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;head&quot;
<br>
are more closely related than &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;banana&quot;.
<br>
The technique has managed to distinguish between colours, numbers,
<br>
different religions and Dutch painters based on the number of hits
<br>
they return, the researchers report in an online preprint.
<br>
The pair's results do not surprise Michael Witbrock of the Cyc project
<br>
in Austin, Texas, a 20-year effort to create an encyclopaedic
<br>
knowledge base for use by a future artificial intelligence. Cyc
<br>
represents a vast quantity of fundamental human knowledge, including
<br>
word meanings, facts and rules of thumb.
<br>
Witbrock believes the web will ultimately make it possible for
<br>
computers to acquire a very detailed knowledge base. Indeed, Cyc has
<br>
already started to draw upon the web for its knowledge. &quot;The web might
<br>
make all the difference in whether we make an artificial intelligence
<br>
or not,&quot; he says.
