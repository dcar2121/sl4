</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular matter.
</em><br>
<p>I said *starting with* and the terminology was deliberate.  I was referring 
<br>
to the initial replicator or initial replicating hypercycle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Roughly speaking you could say that: Genetic Algorithms and Genetic

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Backprop NNs don't concern me because they are (usually) not open-ended 
<br>
optimization processes.  A GA is an open-ended optimization process.  So is 
<br>
one replicator or replicating hypercycle.
<br>
<p>Unintelligence coughed up intelligence once, and the spark of that fire 
<br>
(before it accumulated all the complexity to which you refer) was less 
<br>
sophisticated and certainly less directed than today's GAs, which come into 
<br>
existence carrying fully-formed complexity that might have taken a billion 
<br>
years to evolve on Earth, or, in some cases, would not be accessible to 
<br>
natural selection at all.
<br>
<p>The computational path from unintelligence to intelligence exists.  It was 
<br>
climbed once in the total absence of thoughtful design, just from steady 
<br>
optimization pressure.  Don't tell me it can't happen again, not unless you 
<br>
can calculate your answer.  If you look in George Williams' classic 
<br>
&quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot; (circa 1966!) you will find more math 
<br>
than you have now, and it is math indicating surprisingly small cumulative 
<br>
selection pressures from the first replicator to humankind.  First rule of 
<br>
gun safety:  A gun is always loaded.
