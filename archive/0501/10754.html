Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; True, but the brain is known to be highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inefficient in many many areas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; e.g. (to choose a simple example) motion-direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; detection neurons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are off by 80 degrees on average but are correct en
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; masse due to averaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not necessarily inefficiency.  It may actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be very efficient.  Neurons aren't &quot;off by 80 degrees&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much as they have wide response zones and respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat probabilistically within those zones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neurons use redundancy to tolerate noise.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange, they can use much, much lower voltage levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by about 5 orders of magnitude) than integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuits do, because they don't need to be completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reliable.  This may lead to lower overall power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements for a computation.  You could work out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the numbers for known systems, but it wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are also generally-accepted results showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that noise in neural systems is beneficial, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't really understand those papers, so I'll just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that not all &quot;noise&quot; in the brain is bad.
</em><br>
<p>OK, well since we don't fully understand the brain (or anywhere near),
<br>
there's no way to conclusively settle an argument like this.
<br>
<p>My best guess (based on reading a lot of neuroscience) is that viewed from a
<br>
computational perspective, the human brain has some wild inefficiencies in
<br>
it, but let's leave it at that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that whenever a &quot;symbol&quot; is active somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in anterior cortex, it is linked to, and activates (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is activated by), a series of cortical areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connecting it all the way back to the posterior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensory cortex.  There's some evidence for this;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily I'm thinking of experiments that show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that visualization activates primary visual cortex.
</em><br>
<p>Just because visualization activates primary visual cortex, doesn't really
<br>
imply or suggest that, say, abstract mathematical thinking does...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Say you're using neural darwinism in cortex area A to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; select between different planned movement sequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you buy into my notion of how the brain works,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that means that each competing program in area A has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be activating all of the other cortical areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that create/correlate with the &quot;symbols&quot; being used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in area A.  All the way back into sensory cortex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least premotor cortex.  And to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collisions, that means that EVERY SINGLE CONCEPT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stored in every cortical area needs to be stored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of times over, so that these hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies can be activated separately and used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously by competing programs in your planning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortex.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I see that Neural Darwinism contradicts your own speculative brain
<br>
theory ;-) ... Ok, that's fine...  but that's different from saying it
<br>
contradicts known facts about the brain!
