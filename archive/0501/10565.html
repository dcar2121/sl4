<em>&gt; What's less commonly appreciated is that reality

</em><br>
<em>&gt; *not* stranger than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction; humans just have a warped idea of what
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of conservation of momentum is not that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentum is conserved *most* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the time or *nearly all* of the time, it is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentum is conserved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *every single time*.  It isn't a coincidence, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesize, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservation of momentum has been observed on every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasion thus yet where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity has had opportunity to test it; it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because reality obeys this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *absolute* rule, and this absolute rule has given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to humanity's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fallible humans may not dare to assign a probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of unity to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of conservation of momentum.  Let us say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we assign a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of at most 90%, meaning that if we took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten contemporary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical hypotheses of equal status, we would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least one to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconfirmed a millennium hence.  But the hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of conservation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentum is not that momentum is conserved 90% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time or even 99.9999% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the time.  The hypothesis of conservation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentum is that momentum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is conserved 100.00000% of the time.  We may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertain, but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis of &quot;conservation of momentum&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesizes a state of affairs in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which reality is *not* uncertain; a reality in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is *absolutely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain* that momentum will be conserved on each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every occasion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Uh...there's a bit of a puzzle here that I ran into
<br>
when debating J.C.Wright.
<br>
<p>The trouble is that according to Bayes we can't
<br>
actually assign a probability of 0 or unity to
<br>
anything.  And the only natural interpretation of the
<br>
probabilities as I understood it is that they were
<br>
referring to the frequency of space-time systems in
<br>
the multi-verse.  For instance a probability of 99%,
<br>
meant that in 99 out of 100 alternative space-times
<br>
such and such a thing was true.
<br>
<p>So are you sure it actually makes sense to assign a
<br>
probability of say 99% that something is *absolutely*
<br>
true?  To say that something is truly 'Universal' is
<br>
to say that there is no region of the Tegmark
<br>
multiverse where the something is not true.  But in
<br>
that case, what would the counter-factual mean?  How
<br>
could the 1% probability of falsehood have any
<br>
meaning?
