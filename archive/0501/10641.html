<em>&gt; Hi,

<em>&gt;&gt;It's interesting that you are using the exact same flawed analogy class
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as Ben did in his response. The answer is the same as I gave him: your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;analogy is incorrect because we know with great detail using existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;physics whether a given car design will actually result in a working car
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or not. With a given AGI design we do not know at all (you may think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;know, but if I ask you to prove it you will be unable to provide me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;anything near the level of concrete proof of design-worthiness that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;car designer could provide using a physics model).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm.... Brian, IMO, this is not quite correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know with great detail that Cyc, SOAR and GP (to name three AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems/frameworks) will not result in an AI system capable of hard takeoff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, we know this with MORE certainty than we know that no one now knows how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build a ladder to Andromeda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO, it's more likely that next year some genius scientist will come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a funky self-organizing nano-compound creating a self-growing ladder to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Andromeda, than that one of these simplistic so-called AI systems will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-organize itself into a hard takeoff.  Not all scientists would agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with me on this, but I guess most would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Disregarding issues I still have with your analogies, I think you are 
<br>
sidestepping the original statement from David, which was regarding 
<br>
*any* AGI implementations in the *near future*. I interpret that to 
<br>
include things like Novamente within the remainder of this decade, but 
<br>
perhaps that's not what he meant?
<br>
<p>Here's the quote again:
<br>
<p>&quot;The chance that *any* implementation of AI will
<br>
*take off* in the near future is absolutely zero.  We haven't the foggiest
<br>
clue exactly what it will take to make a human level AI, let alone an AI
<br>
capable of doing serious harm to the human race.&quot;
<br>
<p>That combined with his casual &quot;Oh and even if it does take off it will 
<br>
be constrained by current day hardware&quot; kind of set me off. These aren't 
<br>
the kinds of attitudes that you would expect or hope to hear from people 
<br>
doing this kind of work.
