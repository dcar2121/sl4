</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's also make the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point that there is no inherent moral good in what

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturalistic Fallacy.
</em><br>
<p>*Sigh*  I could argue about this until I was blue in
<br>
the face.  Unfortunately there isn't the time - I
<br>
really must be taking my leave from SL4 soon because
<br>
I've been spending way too much time on-line.
<br>
<p>Just briefly:  I strongly disagree with you.  Now if
<br>
you just think carefully about what you say below
<br>
(which I *do* actually agree with!) you will see that
<br>
you are contradicting yourself.  What you say below
<br>
actually *implies* a Universal Morality.
<br>
<p>You say that values are 'necessarily subjective'. 
<br>
<em>&gt;From whose frame of reference?  Once a goal has been
</em><br>
chosen, all the sub-goals which follow can be
<br>
objectively determined (in theory).  But why should we
<br>
draw a distinction between 'meta-goal' and
<br>
'sub-goals'?  Even meta-goals do not appear out of
<br>
thin air.  They come from physical objects (our
<br>
brains).  What looks likes a meta-goal from one frame
<br>
of reference, can actually appear to be *just another
<br>
sub-goal* from another frame of reference.  So if you
<br>
agree that the sub-goals can be objectively determined
<br>
once the meta-goal is given, then agree that there is
<br>
no real basis for distinguishing meta-goals from
<br>
sub-goals, you'll see that there can indeed be an
<br>
Objective morality.
<br>
<p>What perhaps you hung up on is the fear that a
<br>
Universal Morality implies uniformity.  Not so!  It's
<br>
not an either/or.  There can exist 'Local' values
<br>
right along side 'Universal Values'.  I agree that
<br>
there are Local Moralities  (values true only for some
<br>
particular group like 'humans' or 'Europeans' or
<br>
'residents of the city of London').  But these local
<br>
values do not contradict the Universal values.  There
<br>
would exist a core of values that everyone should hold
<br>
in common (The Universal values), and then a great
<br>
diversity of other values on top (the Local values). 
<br>
That's why I many times on SL4 have repeated the
<br>
formula:  Universal Morality x Local (or Personal)
<br>
Morality.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Overview:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just as with the thermodynamic &quot;arrow of time&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is an analogous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;arrow of morality&quot; by which that which works (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is therefore seen as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good) within local contexts will tend in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction of that which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works within a larger context as the local contexts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combine to form 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger contexts of interaction.  This is a true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics and morality.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but if you think about what you saying here
<br>
you'll see that it implies a Universal Morality.  If
<br>
we imagine intelligence and life eventually spreading
<br>
out across the universe until all the life forms meet
<br>
up and the whole universe is full of intelligence (aka
<br>
the Omega Point limit) then the context will have
<br>
become Universal.  Since as you agree there has to be
<br>
some values which will work for the enlarged context
<br>
(otherwise sentients will never be able to get along)
<br>
it follows that when the context has enlarged to
<br>
include the whole universe there has to be a Universal
<br>
Morality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That which works (survives and grows) is considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good at any given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub-context.  Differences in perception over what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works (what is good) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are due to differences in local contexts, but in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly bigger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture these converge.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  And if they converge then they are becoming
<br>
increasingly objective.  It follows that even at the
<br>
local level they cannot have been *totally*
<br>
non-Universal.  Even at the local value there will
<br>
still be *some* values that will be survive all the
<br>
way to the Universal context.  So even at the local
<br>
level, values will be mixture of Local Morality and
<br>
Universal Morality.  Again, my formula
<br>
<p>Universal Values x Local Values
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It's not an either/or.  Both Local and Universal
<br>
values are always present.
