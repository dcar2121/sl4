<em>&gt; Most of the other items on the list have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covered before, but I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address this one:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (2) The specific class of functions that goes FOOM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be found somewhere in a class of recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; functions designed to investigate special maths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; numbers known as 'Omega numbers' (Discoverer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; numbers was mathematician Greg Chaitin)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a substantive hypothesis. Here's why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let I(P) = the best way to solve problem P given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite computing power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let L(P) = the best way to solve problem P given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power; for the sake of definiteness, say a nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supercomputer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is the most we can plausibly hope to get our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands on in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeable future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider chess as an example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know what I(chess) is: the minimax function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about L(chess)? We have good candidates in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection of very strong chess programs. What do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they look like?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Essentially tweaks (alpha-beta, iterative deepening,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NegaScout etc) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the minimax function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe there's some very clever algorithm that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beat Deep Blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while not relying much on minimax, but there's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing thus far, and my guess for what it's worth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any such.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I'll conjecture that L(chess) ~= I(chess).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about Go? I(Go) = I(chess) = the minimax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L(Go) is a lot trickier. Go has a lot more possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moves at each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point than chess, and position evaluation is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximated by a simple count of material, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs of reasonable strength make some use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimax, they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rely heavily on it. Again, maybe there's some trick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tweaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimax for this job that we just haven't stumbled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, but it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look that way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I'll conjecture that L(Go) != I(Go). In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, as we move to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more subtle and complex game, L(P) is diverging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from I(P).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about real life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have candidates for (or at least plausible steps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of) I(real life); AIXI et al. And we note that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these do, as Marc conjectures, relate to Chaitin's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omega. But as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarked in a previous discussion a little while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago, there are good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons AIXI is PDFware rather than running code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, we don't have candidates for L(real life)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - finding one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely the ultimate goal of AI research! The best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do have thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far is the human mind - which looks nothing at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like AIXI and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to do with omega.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, maybe there's some trick to making an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIXI-like algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computationally tractable, which would make L(real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life) ~= I(real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life). But the trend thus far suggests otherwise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conjecture this is not the case, and that L(real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life) has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant connection to AIXI, omega etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Russell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<p>O.K, you've some what misinterpreted what it was I was
<br>
actually hypothesizing.
<br>
<p>I agree that in terms of the low-level structure of
<br>
the *algorithms themselves* there is likely a huge
<br>
difference between I(P) and L(P) in real life.
<br>
<p>But in terms of the *utility* of the algorithms (the
<br>
effectiveness with which they achieve the desired end
<br>
goals), I think that for any problem there is an
<br>
algorithm using finite computing power that can
<br>
approximate the results of the ideal one (one that
<br>
used infinite computing power) to any desired degree
<br>
of accuracy.
<br>
<p>Remember, in my hypothes, I clearly distinguished
<br>
between Omega numbers themselves and functions
<br>
designed to approximate them.
<br>
<p>Now about Omega numbers and the Omega Point.  Despite
<br>
the fact the word 'Omega' appeared in both in my list
<br>
of hypotheses and this was just coincidence, I do
<br>
wonder whether there may actually be some deep
<br>
connection between the two (which would make the names
<br>
a very nice coincidence!)
<br>
<p>Now in my quest for Universal morality I've been
<br>
looking for a three-way tie-in between the physical
<br>
world, the mental world and the mathematical world.
<br>
<p>This could be the big connection:
<br>
<p>Maths approximation to Omega numbers &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br>
Physics approximation to the Omega point&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
Recursively self-improving Friendliness function
<br>
<p>What am I hypothesizing there?  I shall try to
<br>
explain.  You are aware of course that there appear to
<br>
be 3 different modes of descriptions with which we can
<br>
describe reality: we can give a physical description
<br>
of something, we can give a mathematical description
<br>
of something  and we can give a informational
<br>
(perceptual) description of something.  Yet all three
<br>
descriptions are equivalent. For instance we could
<br>
describe the state of your mind in terms of physics
<br>
(by using a physical device to examine your brain
<br>
state), in terms of mathematics (by giving a
<br>
description of the algorithm representing your mind
<br>
software) or in terms of information processing (a
<br>
cognitive science description of what your mind is
<br>
doing in terms of things like concepts, reasoning
<br>
etc).  Yet all 3 modes of description would in some
<br>
sense be equivalent.
<br>
<p>So my big idea is that the 3 different kinds of
<br>
description I suggested are also equivalent to each
<br>
other.
<br>
<p>*Mathematics:  A function approximating Omega numbers
<br>
<p>*Physics:  Certain physical objects (i.e sentients)
<br>
taking actions which help move the universe closer
<br>
towards the Omega Point 
<br>
<p>*Mental:   Friendliness.  The attribute of being
<br>
ethical.
<br>
<p>I'm hypothesizing that all three of these *could
<br>
actually be one and the same thing*
