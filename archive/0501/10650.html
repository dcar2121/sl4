W/r/t the lottery: the intial chance doesn't really matter.  What 
<br>
matters is when you plug in that intial chance and possible payoff into 
<br>
your utility formula, is the expected utility high enough to justify the 
<br>
expense and oppurtunity costs?
<br>
As far  as AI goes, I think (you don't have to agree with me here) that 
<br>
barring existential threats or wholesale abandonment of tech, AI is 
<br>
pretty close to a certainty- as others have pointed out, within the next 
<br>
100 years it will be entirely feasible to bruteforce it.  So the 
<br>
relevant probability is the chance that a FAI will be first, and that 
<br>
FAI is possible at all.  Do you think it is less than several hundred 
<br>
million to one (the most favorable odds for a multimillions jackpot I've 
<br>
heard) that a FAI will be first?

<em>&gt;&gt; Your first paragraph doesn't make much sense.  Of course if the event

<em>&gt;&gt; you do win compensate, probablistically, for when you don't. That's 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we know that unity as a possibility is impossible.), but must always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be less to compensate for the failures. So expected utility *is* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If expected utility is important when the probability of winning is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually zero, then a rational person should be buying lottery 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tickets, shouldn't he?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If you regard the probability of a win as infintesmial (but not 0, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bayesian reasoners we are...), than the expected utility is likewise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; minuscule.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And my assesment of the chances that AI will be done and a win is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; calculated through my own understandings of AI and the difficulty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thereof, the chance of a win,  the computing power available now and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the future (which allow more brute-force techniques to be used, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lowering the difficulty of AI).  I cannot believe that it is easier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to win a Mega-millions jackpot for any one randomly selected ticket 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than for all of humanity to develop an AI in the next 100 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI may indeed be developed in the next 100 years, but I bet when you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were writing about expected utility you were thinking about benefits 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of FAI, not merely AI. So let me ask you this. Considering that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of safe FAI is equally hard or even harder than the task 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of creating functional AI, and that in order for humanity to benefit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from FAI at all, the thing must work perfectly on the first try, are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you still convinced that probability of winning lottery is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *significantly* smaller than creation of successful AI and FAI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (And as for calculating the total expected utility of supporting FAI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research, let's not forget to factor in the expected utility of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inadvertently creating UFAI.)
