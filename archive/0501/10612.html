<p>As a security professional, this is my concern with most areas of 
<br>
transhumanist interest.  Not just AI, but nanotech, biotech, robots, 
<br>
computers, mind chips, etc.  Our entire culture is based on rushing a 
<br>
solution in place and not making sure that it is safe first.  Many 
<br>
transhumanists even argue that the number of people dying today that 
<br>
might be saved with futuretech gives us the urgency to cut corners and 
<br>
skip safety.  Most groups only promote the benefits of the technology 
<br>
and ignore the threats.
<br>
<p>I agree totally with Eliezer.  The planet is unsafe.  Most of our 
<br>
developments are unsafe.  I love technology, and believe we can do it 
<br>
safely.  But sadly, nobody is.
