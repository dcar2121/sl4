Reasoning by analogy is always suspect . . . but . . . I wonder if a newly 
<br>
hatched AI might not have some of the problems a person with even a wide 
<br>
ranging knowledge of integrated circuits would have if they were dumped 
<br>
into a 1900 technology environment?
<br>
<p>I.e., even if you know exactly what you need to do, the tools are just not 
<br>
there to do it  In fact, they are several *generations* of tools away from 
<br>
doing integrated circuits.
<br>
<p>Eliezer has mentioned an AI doing a nanotech bootstrap by ordering a mess 
<br>
of custom made proteins.  That might work, or it could be as useful as 
<br>
ordering a batch of 1900 fountain pins would be to building ICs.  We 
<br>
(collectively) know the route from 1900 to ICs.  We don't know a route into 
<br>
nanotech.
<br>
<p>It would seem most likely to me that even the most malicious AI would use 
<br>
us to bootstrap by making itself mind bogglingly useful.
<br>
<p>Of course, so would a friendly AI.
