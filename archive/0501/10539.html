<em>&gt; If Eliezer's discussions are not considered 'deep understanding' or at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very least detailed explanations then you haven't been reading SL4 or his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documents very carefully.
</em><br>
<p>In my not so humble opinion, Eliezer's documents demonstrate VERY deep 
<br>
understanding of some things, relatively superficial understanding of some 
<br>
things, and even a misunderstanding of a few things.  Problematically too, 
<br>
for various reasons, he has elected to either hide, not elucidate, or not 
<br>
follow up on a number of issues that are key to a complete coverage of the 
<br>
problem.  My belief is that SIAI is spending far too much time and effort on 
<br>
the bottom-most layer of the problem and totally ignoring the rest of the 
<br>
problem (apparently expecting the solution to the rest to be either 
<br>
immediately emergent or immediately obvious from the bottom most layer).  As 
<br>
an analogy, I would say that they are focussing on quantum mechanics and 
<br>
expect to be able to predict the rest of the world to follow from there 
<br>
(possibly true with infinite knowledge and resources but clearly impossible 
<br>
in any real world).  There's also very much the feel that the approach is 
<br>
that of the ivory-tower scientist rather than the engineer who might make it 
<br>
happen before someone else.  I would strongly suggest that Stephen's 
<br>
comments DO have some merit and shouldn't be dismissed so rapidly out of 
<br>
hand (particularly since it seemed to me that you misunderstood the thrust 
<br>
of much of his argument anyways).
