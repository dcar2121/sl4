<p><em>&gt;From the point of safety it would actually be much

better for us all if (10) was true, because then the
<br>
difficulty of FAI would be no greater than the
<br>
difficulty of AGI.
<br>
<p>As I understand it, Eliezer originally believed (10)
<br>
but then he changed his mind and now thinks that the
<br>
Friendliness problem is different to the problem of
<br>
general intelligence.  I believed him for a while.
<br>
<p>However my reason for finally going back to (10) is
<br>
related to my ideas for Objective Morality and the
<br>
abolition of the facts/value distinction.  The idea
<br>
that Friendliness is seperate from general
<br>
intelligence just screwed everything up.  
<br>
<p>I just don't buy the idea that there's there's this
<br>
wonderful theory of general intelligence on the one
<br>
hand and then on the other we're stuck with trying to
<br>
choose some mysterious 'invariant' which has to be
<br>
choosen by us to be 'nice' and plugged in by hand.  I
<br>
say:  Baloney!  
<br>
<p>Better to try to change the model of general
<br>
intelligence to fit in Friendliness.  And here's the
<br>
beginnings of my idea for that:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sl4.org/wiki/TheWay">http://www.sl4.org/wiki/TheWay</a>
<br>
<p>I simply looked at the 4 levels of intelligence
<br>
described in LOGI (Modalities, Concepts, Thoughts,
<br>
Deliberations) and generalized by analogy to obtain 4
<br>
new levels of intelligence (Snap-Shots, Wisdoms,
<br>
Relations and Expansions) which fully encompass
<br>
'Volition'.
<br>
<p>The Snap-Shot level is the intelligence looking at
<br>
it's own internal states (representing it's volition).
<br>
&nbsp;The Wisdoms level is stringing together the internal
<br>
states of an intelligence (i.e the intelligence is
<br>
trying to extrapolate it's own volition).  The
<br>
Relations level is looking at the state of the
<br>
intelligence relative to the states of various things
<br>
in the external world.  And The Expansions level is
<br>
stringing together the various relationships between
<br>
states to maximize utility.
