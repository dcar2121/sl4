<em>&gt; &gt; I agree with just about everything Harvey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Newstrom says, and am especially impressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the definition scheme he presents; but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some disagreement as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I (Marc) was the one trying to come up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition scheme.  Harvey was giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critique.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
I was referring (sloppily) the the nested precise
<br>
engineering definitions he used as an example. As
<br>
to your definition scheme, I think most of the
<br>
critique is valid; but I know I couldn't do any
<br>
better, and wouldn't try. I think a precise
<br>
definition of Friendliness is impossible (well,
<br>
problematical) until we fully grasp our own needs
<br>
and wants, now *and* in the future! Suppose our
<br>
well-placed limitations on the FAI succed
<br>
perfectly in preventing it from going against our
<br>
will, and in the process prevent it from doing
<br>
something unforeseeable which we need?
<br>
<p>When I think of the maze of possible exigencies
<br>
we might need to define for FAI, of all the
<br>
individual decisions we might need to make on
<br>
whether to permit or deny the FAI to act, I fear
<br>
ending up with a nested precise definition tree
<br>
which is itself too complex for human
<br>
comprehension! I hope I'm wildly wrong about
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Friendliness is a brutally complex issue. Think
<br>
how simple it was to define success with the
<br>
Apollo moon landing. Go. Get rocks and photos.
<br>
Come back alive. Hard to do, but easy to define.
<br>
With FAI, on the other hand, one might say
<br>
defining success *is* the hard part. The
<br>
implementation cannot even properly begin with
<br>
ill-defined goals.
<br>
Be of good cheer: if it were easy everybody would
<br>
be doing it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think the general concept of an Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neccesserily implies Tipler's particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you point out, it appears that the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tipler gave his book has been falsified by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The general condition for an Omega Point is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the average rate of information processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit space approaches infinity in bounded time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be many different ways that this could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I sure hope so. Another way I might suggest is
<br>
that some other universes do have the proper
<br>
collapsing properties to enable infinite
<br>
processing under Tipler's scheme, and can
<br>
recreate copies of us. But if a copy of me
<br>
experiences all the goodies in that Omega Point,
<br>
is it really 'me'? Who knows? I would have no
<br>
control over that, being in this universe. Might
<br>
as well pray. Unfortunately, it's lack of control
<br>
that makes the concept shade into religion. Even
<br>
if one did live in that collapsing universe, the
<br>
collapse would be aeons in the future. I regard
<br>
Omega Point as an umbrella term for any such
<br>
infinite free lunch, and worry more about more
<br>
immediate crises (i.e. this century, not x to the
<br>
x years from now). After all, what if we achieve
<br>
FAI but find that although it can give us a
<br>
galactic civilization of dazzling splendor, even
<br>
it cannot get us to the Omega Point because we
<br>
were born in the wrong universe with an
<br>
inescapable heat death? (It's 2 degrees
<br>
Fahrenheit outside right now, and that's probably
<br>
affecting my thinking).
