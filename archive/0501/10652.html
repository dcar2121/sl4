<em>&gt; designs and philosophy are admirable goals but if we are talking about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software system that works in the real world, then what you see is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters.  Even if most of the plan was on paper but *something* was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software, my complaint would be retracted.  I also haven't started to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually write my AI code so this same criticism also applies to me.
</em><br>
<p>Even as we speak, plenty of running AI code is trading commodities, playing
<br>
chess, filtering spam, etc.  I could easily implement some standard AI
<br>
algorithm, and lo, I would have running code.  Lots of people with running
<br>
code out there.  Creating AGI is harder than that.  Judging by history,
<br>
running code in a limited AI domain is not good reason to think that the
<br>
project can go the rest of the way.  And even if one had assurance that
<br>
project X would create AGI, FAI is an entirely different order of problem,
<br>
which subsumes the AGI problem and piles additional requirements on top.
<br>
<p>And this problem I shall solve as swiftly as I can, avoiding detours, even 
<br>
detours for the sake of pride.  I, an individual blessed with an 
<br>
individual's abilities, as distinct from you and your abilities as an 
<br>
individual, currently judge that I can think faster than I can program. 
<br>
Your advice has been noted and you do not need to repeat it to me again. 
<br>
Thank you.
