<p>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Occasionally I tread on the futile task of trying to persuade people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; not to buy lottery tickets, and they say something along the line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Someone has to win!&quot; or &quot;You can't win if you don't play!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When I have this conversation with intelligent lottery players, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; usual answer is &quot;Yes, but it's fun to try.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know I've raised this point before, but I think we have different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards for whom we call &quot;intelligent&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, when I was a math prof at UNLV, a number of my fellow math professors
<br>
liked to gamble on a regular basis.
<br>
<p>These folks had high IQ's, decently long lists of pure-math publications,
<br>
and generally a lot of common sense and rationality in everyday life
<br>
situations.
<br>
<p>I was a bit perplexed at the time that these highly clever and reasonable
<br>
mathematicians were at all interested in gambling, but that was before I
<br>
grasped the deep perversity of human nature as fully as I do now ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the thriving lottery industry as the present state of affairs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I ask &quot;How can we train people not to buy lottery tickets?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But if people buy lottery tickets because they find the emotional drama of
<br>
it FUN, then teaching them not to buy lottery tickets means either
<br>
<p>a) teaching them not to want to have fun
<br>
<p>b) teaching them to find different things fun than they currently do
<br>
<p>I.e. it involves changing their motivational structure rather than their
<br>
reasoning methods, it seems to me.
<br>
<p>Personally I have pretty much given up on teaching people not to have silly
<br>
chimp-like motivational structures.  It's a damn hard problem, harder than
<br>
creating an AGI, in my opinion.
<br>
<p>I try to guide my kids to have motivational structures that I respect, but
<br>
that's an easier problem than the more general case, since they have genetic
<br>
material that's relatively amenable to my taste, and they get a lot of
<br>
personal attention from me....  And it's still not such an easy problem, as
<br>
they've all inherited my individuality and pigheaded stubbornness along with
<br>
many of my other fine and not-so-fine traits ;-)
