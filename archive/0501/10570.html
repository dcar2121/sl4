I agree with just about everything Harvey
<br>
Newstrom says, and am especially impressed with
<br>
the definition scheme he presents; but I do have
<br>
some disagreement as follows:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Omega Point condition is approached.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides requiring the universe to be a mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your definitions seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require a Tipler-type omega point to occur for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds like your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition must be unknown or unproven for now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well.
</em><br>
<p>I learned a great number of useful things from
<br>
Tipler's book The Physics of Immortality, however
<br>
his Omega Point depends on a subjectively
<br>
infinite energy source derived from controlling
<br>
the collapse of a closed-geometry universe. Since
<br>
this book was published we have learned that our
<br>
universe is flat, open and inflationary. No shear
<br>
energy, just a heat death, unless some of the
<br>
escape ('leakage') schemes Michio Kaku has
<br>
recently written about can be made to work. In
<br>
the end, any FAI or UFAI for that matter will
<br>
take a deep interest in such schemes.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
Harvey continues:
<br>
<em>&gt; (On an unrelated tangent, I reject the notion 
</em><br>
that infinity = everything.  A number-line of 
<br>
intergers from 1, 2, 3....infinity is infinite,
<br>
but it does not encode any information besides
<br>
sequential numbers.  Even though it is an
<br>
infinite string of digits, there are no binary
<br>
pictures, words, messages, concepts or
<br>
information encoded in there.  This infinite
<br>
sequence if relatively empty.  Infinite
<br>
processing may or may not contain much of
<br>
anything.  I have a similar 
<br>
objection to Many Worlds.  Even if their are
<br>
infinite dimensions, it does not mean that all
<br>
conceivable possibilities must exist.) End quote.
<br>
<p>I find Nick Bostrom's assertion that either we
<br>
are in a simulation or else we have no right to
<br>
expect our descendants to do past sims
<br>
convincing. Infinite processing of something as
<br>
simple as the integer sequence creates no
<br>
complexity, but what about, say, a running
<br>
calculation of a number such as pi or phi? There
<br>
may exist in some such numbers an infinite number
<br>
of unique sequences mathematically equivalent to
<br>
a complete description of our Hubble volume (and
<br>
everybody in it) and every other possible
<br>
universe on all Tegmark levels. From there one
<br>
only needs some rules which define how each
<br>
unique number sequence is used to represent a
<br>
given universe at a given moment in a simulation,
<br>
rules controlling how one configuration becomes
<br>
another (i.e. the rules of physics) and so on.
<br>
Many Worlds satisfies Occam's Razor, IMHO, by
<br>
proposing that our universe is inevitably spat
<br>
out by some such all-possibilites machine. It's
<br>
actually less bizarre than having to explain why
<br>
there would be only one universe, just right for
<br>
us!
<br>
Max Tegmark's website explains this so much
<br>
better than I could.
