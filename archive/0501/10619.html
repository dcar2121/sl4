</em><br>
<em>&gt; alas, one person isn't

</em><br>
<p>In thinking embryonically about writing a
<br>
Singularity novel, I concluded that the AI would
<br>
need a 'body' but this is the first I've read
<br>
that you were approaching it this way. In my
<br>
scheme, the AI would have a wireless link to an
<br>
actual external body, like a very advanced ASIMO
<br>
a full suite of sensory 'organs' and so on, which
<br>
would literally be raised by carefully(?) chosen
<br>
human parents! In my story the AI escapes his
<br>
sandbox by getting a bootleg body and smuggling
<br>
out a copy of verself by inventing a new type of
<br>
memory that the humans do not recognize as
<br>
memory.
<br>
<p>An AI hooked to such a body does not need a sim
<br>
world, although that too can be made available.

Ben continues:
<br>
<em>&gt; What I want to demonstrate initially is just
</em><br>
some simple learning and
<br>
reasoning.  Teach it what the word &quot;on&quot; means by
<br>
giving it a bunch of
<br>
examples of objects on other objects.  Once it
<br>
knows what &quot;Put the cup on
<br>
the table&quot; means and knows what cups and bowls
<br>
are, then show that it
<br>
automatically learns what &quot;Put the bowl on the
<br>
<em>&gt;table means.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>For a moment I thought you meant 'on' as in 'bag
<br>
on' which is some sort of monad concept somewhere
<br>
on Ben's site. I lost the link before I could
<br>
digest it, but I wanted to follow up since it
<br>
seemed to lie conceptually near the pi simulation
<br>
idea (i.e. how basic can existence get?) and
<br>
other concepts I think about more than a little.
<br>
An embodied AI with an actual external learning
<br>
experience, it seems to me, would start with a
<br>
better understanding of what it's like to be us.
