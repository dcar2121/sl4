-A previous writer said:
<br>
<em>&gt; The risk of some nut intentionally creating an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that achieves hard takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and destroys the human race, during the next 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, is IMO **not**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The chance of this happening during the next 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, IMO, is *scarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
- And another said:
<br>
<em>&gt; We haven't the foggiest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clue exactly what it will take to make a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level AI, let alone an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capable of doing serious harm to the human race.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the first comment and disagree with the
<br>
second.  We know to some extent how the human brain
<br>
functions, at least at the level of neurons and
<br>
synapses.  A sufficiently accurate simulation of
<br>
10^11 neurons and 10^14-10^15 synapses should
<br>
produce a human level intelligence by brute force.
<br>
Clever AI software design may require less than
<br>
this, but I claim that it is an upper limit.
<br>
<p>The exact computation required to simulate a neuron
<br>
sufficiently accurately is not known exactly, but
<br>
we can put some reasonable estimates to it.  I use
<br>
1 synapse firing = 1 bit +- factor of 30, which 
<br>
leads to a human equivalent = 3,000 Tflops (range
<br>
100-100,000 TFlops).
<br>
<p>I will take as a proxy for 'largest computer 
<br>
available for AI research' the 500th computer listed
<br>
in the top500.org list of most powerful
<br>
supercomputers.
<br>
<p>The trend has been for the #500 machine to grow at
<br>
93% per year in performance. A factor of 30
<br>
uncertainty in required performance thus only leads
<br>
to a 5 year unceratinty in date.  
<br>
<p>3000 Tflops for the #500 machine would occur in
<br>
2017 at historical trend rates, to which I would
<br>
add 5 years for software development/AI training,
<br>
so the 'danger zone' for superhuman AI starts at
<br>
2017-2027.
<br>
<p>In response to the first comment, SETI@home runs
<br>
65 Tflops currently on a distributed network, which
<br>
is barely below my low end 100 Tflops estimate,
<br>
so I would concur that the risk of a runaway
<br>
intelligence on a distributed network is non-zero
<br>
(whether malicious or well meaning).  The risk
<br>
from a top ranking supercomputer is lower in
<br>
my opinion.  The #1 machine clocks 70 GFlops, but
<br>
the top ranking machines are operated in a much
<br>
more controlled environment.
<br>
<p>If I was asked what will seal our doom, I would
<br>
say it's the playstation 3.  It will contain a
<br>
'Cell' processor jointly developed by IBM, Sony,
<br>
and Toshiba.  It's designed to be highly parallel,
<br>
and it will be produced in mass quantities which
<br>
will make it cheap.  Thus it will will be well
<br>
suited to MPP type supercomputers.
