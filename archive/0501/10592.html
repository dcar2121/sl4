Eli,
<br>
<p>Calling qualia a &quot;substance&quot; is indeed an error, and one which many
<br>
philosophers have avoided.  E.g. in Peirce's metaphysics, qualia are First
<br>
whereas substance is Second.
<br>
<p>However, the fact that no substance of qualia exists, doesn't eliminate the
<br>
mystery.  Nor does it mean that talk of &quot;qualia&quot; is meaningless.  Words
<br>
(such as &quot;qualia&quot;) can meaningfully denote non-substances...
<br>
<p>I long ago gave up on trying to convince hard-core empiricists that
<br>
non-empirical, non-&quot;substantial&quot; phenomena (like experiences or qualia) can
<br>
actually exist.  I don't seem to have a common grounding for the word
<br>
&quot;existence&quot; with such people.  (And I'm not sure if you fall into the
<br>
category of hard-core empiricists or not.)
<br>
<p>As I understand it, hard-core empiricists believe that there is a physical
<br>
reality which is actually existent, and we humans are physical systems
<br>
within this reality, and &quot;mind&quot; is a way of talking about some of the
<br>
activities of these physical systems.
<br>
<p>While I respect this as an often useful perspective, I can also take the
<br>
perspective that my mind is primary, and sensations and ideas arise within
<br>
it, and among these sensations and ideas are the ideas of the physical
<br>
world, a body, a brain, science, physics.  From this point of view there is
<br>
nothing at all mistaken or nonsensical in thinking about qualia as existing
<br>
separately from physical reality, yet still being in a sense fully existent
<br>
and real.
<br>
<p>I know of no way to convince a hard-core empiricist that the subjectivist
<br>
view of the world is at least equally valid.
<br>
<p>What's funny to me is that I see hard-core empiricism as a form of
<br>
dogmatism, somewhat similar to religious fundamentalism.  From an inner,
<br>
experiential point of view, both &quot;God&quot; and &quot;physical reality&quot; are ideas that
<br>
the mind conceives in order to organize its experiences.  Clinging onto any
<br>
one of these ideas as absolutely real and existent is IMO a mistake.
<br>

<em>&gt; Qualia are the modern version of a very, very old mistake, that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mystery as a substance.  Cognitive phlogiston.
