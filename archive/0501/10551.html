</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What about the spirit of cunning plots and mischief?  For the life of me, I 
<br>
don't understand why people are so shocked to find that I have a goofy 
<br>
sense of humor; it's not as if my writings don't provide ample warning. 
<br>
Anyway...
<br>
<p>I'm trying to forge rationality into a new and more coherent art, reusing 
<br>
my l33t build-a-mind-from-scratch skillz to go beyond that accumulated 
<br>
handicraft of rationality passed down from generation to generation. 
<br>
Sometimes I may say things that shock a listener raised in the ancient 
<br>
tradition.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Where Eliezer had placed &quot;spoiler space&quot;, I stopped reading and I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wrote down my explanation. (I'd been reading with pen in hand and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; making critical notes in the margin.)
</em><br>
<p>Got a scanner?  I wouldn't mind seeing a copy of the notes (if that 
<br>
wouldn't be too much effort for you).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; It seemed to be fair and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; scientific to provide an answer *before* reading on so as not to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; contaminate the experiment. )
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I wrote (and I quote):
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     &quot;I'd &quot;explain&quot; it provisionally as some surprising organisation
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     of people had entered my house and replaced my arm whilst
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     I slept with technology I didn't know existed.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     I'd be bewildered. Frightened even. But I'd not think &quot;magic&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     had occurred&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I also wouldn't think &quot;magic&quot; had occurred.  The magic hypothesis is rather 
<br>
vague without further specification, has tended to be disproved to the 
<br>
extent it has been historically specified, and makes no particular 
<br>
prediction of my arm being replaced with a tentacle.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; And then, with the heightened curiosity of one who has escalated
</em><br>
<em> &gt; their commitment I went back to see what Eliezer the Bayesian,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Eliezer the spreader-of-analogical-probability-clay-mass would have
</em><br>
<em> &gt; done.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; And he'd written this.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;    &quot;How would I explain the event of my left arm being replaced
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     by a blue tentacle? The answer is that I wouldn't. It isn't going
</em><br>
<em> &gt;     to happen.&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Email perhaps can't convey my exact reaction to that but here's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the comments I wrote in the margin.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ----
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;No. No. No. You cheated Eliezer. You cheated!
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; You can't assign a probability of zero!*
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Not fair!! You said it did happen. You're being dishonest with the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; data to say it's not going to happen.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that's a traditional response.  :P
<br>
<p>I was hoping for pretty much that reaction from my readers, who I assumed 
<br>
would be traditional rationalists.
<br>
<p>The ideal of traditional rationality is that reality is allowed to tell you 
<br>
anything it wants, and you ought to shut up and listen - a stance arising 
<br>
from the sad human tendency to deny experimental evidence when it conflicts 
<br>
with something more valuable, like hope or authority.
<br>
<p>What's less commonly appreciated is that reality does *not* tell you just 
<br>
anything.  Reality is *extremely constricted* in what it tells you, far 
<br>
more constricted than human storytelling.  Truth is *not* stranger than 
<br>
fiction; humans just have a warped idea of what constitutes normality.  The 
<br>
theory of conservation of momentum is not that momentum is conserved *most* 
<br>
of the time or *nearly all* of the time, it is that momentum is conserved 
<br>
*every single time*.  It isn't a coincidence, we hypothesize, that 
<br>
conservation of momentum has been observed on every occasion thus yet where 
<br>
humanity has had opportunity to test it; it's because reality obeys this 
<br>
*absolute* rule, and this absolute rule has given rise to humanity's 
<br>
experience so far.
<br>
<p>Fallible humans may not dare to assign a probability of unity to the 
<br>
probability of conservation of momentum.  Let us say we assign a 
<br>
probability of at most 90%, meaning that if we took ten contemporary 
<br>
physical hypotheses of equal status, we would expect at least one to be 
<br>
disconfirmed a millennium hence.  But the hypothesis of conservation of 
<br>
momentum is not that momentum is conserved 90% of the time or even 99.9999% 
<br>
of the time.  The hypothesis of conservation of momentum is that momentum 
<br>
is conserved 100.00000% of the time.  We may be uncertain, but the 
<br>
hypothesis of &quot;conservation of momentum&quot; hypothesizes a state of affairs in 
<br>
which reality is *not* uncertain; a reality in which it is *absolutely 
<br>
certain* that momentum will be conserved on each and every occasion.
<br>
<p>The absolute character of physical law is foreign to human thinking.  When 
<br>
humans make rules, there's always some unwritten give-and-take, some room 
<br>
for compromise.  Even some atheists are shocked by the uncompromising 
<br>
attitude of radical foaming-at-the-mouth atheist hard-liners like myself, 
<br>
that there is *no* room for magic in the universe, that there is *no* 
<br>
separate magisterium reserved for thoughts &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;magical&quot;.  And to those who claim that every belief system partakes of the 
<br>
transcedent, I say:  Yes, every known culture divides the universe into a 
<br>
mundane realm of verifiable assertions and a sacred realm where sloppy 
<br>
thinking is allowed; but I'm saying that's a mistake.
<br>
<p>It is not a coincidence that every sacred hypothesis in human history which 
<br>
infringes on testability has been falsified.  (And that is nearly all 
<br>
sacred hypotheses.  The makers of such hypotheses lack the skill in 
<br>
rationality to make the hypotheses genuinely unfalsifiable.  If they 
<br>
understood what constitutes Bayesian evidence, they wouldn't be 
<br>
constructing sacred hypotheses.)  The most probable cause of humanity's 
<br>
experience so far is that we live in an *absolutely* mundane universe, 
<br>
mundane in every place and every time with 100.00000000000000% frequency.
<br>
<p>By asserting that conservation of momentum is *absolute*, the hypothesis 
<br>
sticks out its neck very far, and perhaps its neck will be sliced off by an 
<br>
experiment that violates conservation of momentum - but that's part of the 
<br>
point.  If someone reports an experiment that violates conservation of 
<br>
momentum, you shouldn't chalk it down to a rare exception to the general 
<br>
rule (maybe someone negotiated the laws of physics down a little from their 
<br>
extreme and unreasonable position that momentum should be conserved on 
<br>
every single occasion).
<br>
<p>Experiments in cognitive psychology show that people fear air travel more 
<br>
than car travel.  Why?  Because airplane accidents are more frequently 
<br>
reported in the media.  People's fear of a particular hazard is, generally, 
<br>
directly proportional to how often that hazard is reported in the media. 
<br>
Rare hazards that kill lots of people, like airplane crashes, tend to be 
<br>
reported in the media often; common small hazards go relatively unnoticed. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This bias is only one of many experiments where people have been observed 
<br>
reason, not from the actual statistical frequencies of cases, but from the 
<br>
most attention-grabbing cases or most commonly reported cases.  I think 
<br>
that part of the Way is trying to fit yourself to the real world, to the 
<br>
actual statistical frequency of events - deliberately thinking about the 
<br>
statistical likelihood of any sample case presented for your attention.
<br>
<p>No one in all human history has ever woken up with a functioning tentacle 
<br>
in place of their arm.  You should have noticed that when I asked you to 
<br>
find an explanation for it.  Yes, you were tricked.  But it's a kind of 
<br>
trickery that goes on all the time and which I wish my readers to notice. 
<br>
For example, a thought experiment which postulates &quot;zombies&quot;, people that 
<br>
behave exactly like people in this universe except that they are not 
<br>
conscious.  (Why do they write papers on consciousness, including 
<br>
discussion of zombie experiments, if they are not conscious?  For more on 
<br>
this see Dennett's &quot;The Unimaginable Preposterousness of Zombies&quot;.)  Or 
<br>
consider Damien Broderick's swift reaction to John C. Wright's attempt to 
<br>
quote Scrooge as an argument against skepticism.  Damien didn't actually 
<br>
use my phrase &quot;logical fallacy of generalization from fictional evidence&quot;, 
<br>
but I hope my writing had something to do with it.
<br>
<p>Occasionally I tread on the futile task of trying to persuade people not to 
<br>
buy lottery tickets, and they say something along the line of &quot;Someone has 
<br>
to win!&quot; or &quot;You can't win if you don't play!&quot;  To which the answer is, 
<br>
&quot;'Someone' will not be you.  You will not win the lottery, period.  I could 
<br>
make a hundred thousand statements of equal strength and not be wrong even 
<br>
once.  I have *godlike* confidence that you will not win the lottery.  Stop 
<br>
thinking about the pleasantness of the outcome, stop attending to this 
<br>
improbable event, because it will *not happen*.&quot;  I ask people to stop 
<br>
buying lottery tickets, and they think, &quot;But what if I would have won?&quot;, 
<br>
and imagine a thought experiment which, though physically possible - not 
<br>
*absolutely* impossible like violating conservation of momentum - has a 
<br>
probability so low that *they shouldn't be thinking about it while making 
<br>
the decision*.
<br>
<p>I would advise philosophers who indulge in thought experiments to 
<br>
consciously weight the emotional force of a thought experiment by the 
<br>
probability of that thought experiment, so that they may learn to live in 
<br>
this, our real world.
<br>
<p>Lottery players are led astray by attending to hypothetical events of great 
<br>
emotional intensity and extremely low probability.  So too, John C. Wright 
<br>
was led astray by attending to a powerful and sympathetic experience, 
<br>
Scrooge's discovery of magic and the triumphant comeuppance of skepticism, 
<br>
which never actually happened.  Nor will it happen, ever, in this our 
<br>
mundane universe.
<br>
<p>You won't wake up with a blue tentacle in place of an arm.  Remember that, 
<br>
the next time someone asks you to imagine the impossible, or even the 
<br>
statistically improbable.  You followed where I asked you to go, imagined 
<br>
what I asked you to imagine, and then found yourself betrayed.  But next 
<br>
time you will notice when someone tries to lead you astray.
<br>
<p>Let us learn to live in this universe the way it really is, attending to 
<br>
the real frequency of events instead of the frequency of media reports of 
<br>
events.  When someone asks us to imagine a magical outcome, let us forget 
<br>
all of the novels we have read, and all the movies we have seen, and all 
<br>
the hopes of our childhood, and remember that the observed frequency is zero.
<br>
<p>At the same time, let's not forget how ridiculous the 20th century would 
<br>
have sounded if you'd reported it to a 19th-century listener.  But reality 
<br>
is very constrained in what kind of ridiculousness it presents us with. 
<br>
Not one of the ridiculous things that happened in the 20th century violated 
<br>
conservation of momentum.
<br>
<p>Oh... and if you *do* wake up with a tentacle in place of an arm... it's 
<br>
probably not because anyone snuck into your room; there must be a simpler, 
<br>
more likely explanation you didn't think of, or the event wouldn't have 
<br>
happened.  When you have only a poor explanation, one that doesn't make 
<br>
things ordinary in retrospect, just admit you don't have an explanation, 
<br>
and keep going.  Poor explanations very, very rarely turn out to be 
<br>
actually correct.  A gang of people sneaking into your room with unknown 
<br>
technology is a poor explanation.  Whatever the real explanation was, it 
<br>
wouldn't be that.  If that's the best you can do, then &quot;I wasn't expecting 
<br>
this and I have no clue why it happened or what will happen next&quot; is a far 
<br>
superior answer.  If I demanded that you produce a specific hypothesis 
<br>
anyway, you should have told me to stuff it.  Why develop a habit of 
<br>
producing hypotheses that can't be right?  What good will it serve you?
<br>
<p>In real life, sometimes we don't know what happened.  Real life is where we 
<br>
will actually apply our l33t rationality skillz, so &quot;I don't know&quot; was the 
<br>
correct answer, taking the impossible experience as a fixed given.  If I'd 
<br>
sworn that I really did possess some concrete reason to anticipate that you 
<br>
might *actually* wake up with a tentacle, and asked you to guess my good 
<br>
reason, &quot;I don't know&quot; would have been the correct answer (taking my 
<br>
rationality as a fixed given).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Most of what I know of Bayesian reasoning I know as a result of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reading Eliezer's two essays on it.
</em><br>
<p>If you enjoy the art, read more literature on it.  &quot;Rational Choice in an 
<br>
Uncertain World&quot; is good.  If you're ready for academic stuff, start with 
<br>
&quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot;.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; So perhaps if my understanding
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of Bayesian reasoning or inference is wrong I can escape by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; blaming Eliezer for it :-)
</em><br>
<p>Whoa, I'm a highly atypical Bayesian.  If you're judging Bayesian academia 
<br>
by me, that's, er, not a good idea.  I did warn my readers that Technical 
<br>
Explanation would be controversial.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I suspect, on the basis of those two essays that I am a Bayesian
</em><br>
<em> &gt; although I didn't know I was and so I haven't been calling myself
</em><br>
<em> &gt; one. The merit I see in the Bayesian approach is that it manages
</em><br>
<em> &gt; uncertainties more carefully and consistently then most people do
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intuitively. [And boy does the world need that].
</em><br>
<p>Human beings aren't designed as Bayesians (though our thoughts sometimes 
<br>
have Bayes-structure, which is why we work at all).  The word &quot;Bayesian&quot; 
<br>
usually refers, not to someone who actually implements Bayesian principles 
<br>
(for that is humanly unattainable), but to someone who espouses Bayesian 
<br>
principles.  I don't think you could be a Bayesian without knowing it, 
<br>
unless you had unwittingly demanded that people be principled about 
<br>
assigning prior probabilities, or some such stance which today is commonly 
<br>
known as &quot;Bayesian&quot;.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; So, it's 2005.  I'm a Bayesian. And as long as I'm wearing metaphorical
</em><br>
<em> &gt; teeshirts I'm also a Bright.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Regards,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; *  Eliezer's assigning a probability of zero to observed facts however
</em><br>
<em> &gt; unlikely those facts might have been a priori is the reason for my
</em><br>
<em> &gt; heading this post Bad Bayesian - no buscuit.
</em><br>
<p>You can't assign a probability of 0.000000..., but you could theoretically 
<br>
assign a probability of 1e-100 if you think you can get away with it, 
<br>
because it isn't actually *zero* - the logarithm is minus a thousand 
<br>
decibels, but not actually negative infinity.  1e-100 is effectively zero, 
<br>
but there's a world of difference between effectively zero and actually 
<br>
zero.  My point is that you should be wary of probabilities which are, 
<br>
*given* the dominant physical hypothesis, actually zero or effectively zero.
<br>
<p>If your explanation:  &quot;A secret organization of people entered my house and 
<br>
replaced my arm with a tentacle using unknown technology&quot; doesn't make you 
<br>
anticipate (even just a little) waking up with a tentacle tomorrow in this 
<br>
our real world, then it's a poor explanation.  For it is this, our real 
<br>
world, in which you must live.  Nor should you bother trying to develop a 
<br>
better explanation.  For in this, our real world, you will have no need of it.
