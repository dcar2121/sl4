</em><br>
<em>&gt; *everything*
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Security engineering does not work with things that are known.  Hackers 
<br>
try creative things.  New exploits are discovered all the time.  
<br>
Unexpected interactions occur between systems and over the network.  
<br>
Unexpected bugs exist all over.  Technology can fail in 
<br>
catastrophically unexpected ways.
<br>
<p>Come to think of it, there are a lot of fields that work with the 
<br>
unknown.  Safety doesn't work with the known.  Policing or war actions 
<br>
don't work with the known.  Exploring space doesn't work with the 
<br>
known.  Medicine and healthcare are often unpredictable.  Most of 
<br>
science is exploring the unknown.  This is not a unique problem to AI.
<br>
<p>What you describe as engineering the known only applies to 
<br>
mass-produced widgets on an assembly line, or standard architecture 
<br>
techniques using known technology.  All scientific developments and 
<br>
research face the same difficulties with trying to approach the vast 
<br>
unknown and develop the state of the art until it becomes known.  This 
<br>
is standard science.  It can be done safely.
<br>
<p>Witness the Manhattan Project, the Apollo Missions, and AIDS 
<br>
treatments.  I would argue that standard security, safety and 
<br>
precautionary measures already exist in most technology fields.  
<br>
Combining those safety protocols from environmental hazards, medical 
<br>
testing, psychology experiments, computer security, and policing enemy 
<br>
combatants should cover the many of the same unknowns that an AI might 
<br>
present to us.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying there aren't unique unknowns, but the challenges 
<br>
presented by AI are not entirely outside the experience of what 
<br>
scientists have faced before.
