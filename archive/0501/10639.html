</em><br>
<p>It's interesting that you are using the exact same flawed analogy class 
<br>
as Ben did in his response. The answer is the same as I gave him: your 
<br>
analogy is incorrect because we know with great detail using existing 
<br>
physics whether a given car design will actually result in a working car 
<br>
or not. With a given AGI design we do not know at all (you may think you 
<br>
know, but if I ask you to prove it you will be unable to provide me 
<br>
anything near the level of concrete proof of design-worthiness that a 
<br>
car designer could provide using a physics model). Therefore your 
<br>
statement that a car is more likely to be created by &quot;accident&quot; by 
<br>
knowledgeable designers is incorrect in my opinion.
<br>
<p>The whole point here is that you have no way of telling with any 
<br>
absolute certainty whether or not a project that thinks its design will 
<br>
lead to real AGI is close or not to taking off, or what exact point it 
<br>
may do so. This is why I see a large conflict in your original 
<br>
statements. For my analysis to be incorrect you would need to have as 
<br>
much concrete knowledge about how AGIs work as a physicist has about 
<br>
physics - and no one has that much knowledge yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Of course the answer is that no one should be claiming a zero chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And the other answer is that we need to continue gaining more knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;But because of the unknowns, gaining that knowledge should be done in as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;safe a manner as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Safety is something you will *absolutely* get if you never write any code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I couldn't agree more with the need for more knowledge.  I am only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreeing with the method for getting it.  The only way I have ever found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to really know a software algorithm is to make a successful program of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been surprised many times by thinking a technique would work or be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast enough, only to find out just how wrong I was.
</em><br>
<p>And perhaps you'll be surprised someday when your shiny new AGI 
<br>
prototype takes off. All I'm attempting to point out is that you should 
<br>
realize you are working with much greater uncertainty than your original 
<br>
statements implied you recognized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;For some reason this reminds me of the worries at the time of the a-bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that many of the physicists had about whether it would accidentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ignite the entire atmosphere. They didn't know at first what would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;happen, and most of them would not have told you that the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;was &quot;absolutely zero&quot;. In fact even after they ran some numbers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;paper, they still weren't absolutely certain. But they did by that point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have enough odds in their favor to proceed. But even at the end when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;was tested they were still heard betting with each other on the outcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;There was never absolute certainty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is it any comparison.  The people working on the A-bomb didn't just send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first bomb over Hiroshima without any successful tests.  They had many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years of very expensive and extensive tests that lead up to the ignition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first A-bomb.  How does that compare with the effort at SIAI?  I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting down the effort made so far by the SIAI but please don't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparisons with the development of the A-bomb.  Your group isn't close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that development group by many orders of magnitude.  Who knows what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be if the government of the USA spent the same amount of money through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SIAI as was spent in developing the A-bomb?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The point I was attempting to make was not regarding SIAI, although you 
<br>
can be sure our test methods will be at least as rigorous as the rather 
<br>
lackadaisical ones used in the A-bomb project. The point was that even 
<br>
after all their testing and design they realized that they still weren't 
<br>
absolutely sure what would happen. So again I was attempting to show 
<br>
that statements of absolute certainty like you made are not warranted.
