<p>There are two basic problems with philosophy. One is that it lacks
<br>
a strong selective mechanism, and thus while 10% of it is highly
<br>
useful the other 90% of it is useless junk. The requirement to make
<br>
correct predictions in science means that Sturgeon's Law only
<br>
applies to the bleeding edge (and crank) stuff that hasn't been
<br>
subjected to peer review and independent testing. The second is that
<br>
most philosophy takes the correctness of intuitive human notions
<br>
about various aspects of cognition, as well as the basic validity of
<br>
introspection, pretty much as a given. By contrast cognitive science
<br>
has been slowly but steadily proceeding from trying to answer
<br>
mysterious philosophical questions to explaining where the illusion
<br>
of mystery comes from and why we ask these badly formed questions
<br>
in the first place.
<br>
<p>Much of AGI consists of untested theories that are supported at
<br>
best by several steps of inference from experimental psychology,
<br>
neuroanatomy or decision theory. More often, they are just
<br>
plausible sounding guesses based on someone's intuitive ideas on
<br>
cognition works, possibly aided by some compelling metaphors to
<br>
intelligent seeming processes people are familiar with. However
<br>
normative probability and decision theory (including Bayes) and
<br>
the failings of the dualistic viewpoint (and other philosophical
<br>
delusions inconsistent with the integrated causal model and the
<br>
specific findings of evolutionary psychology) are not in this
<br>
class. They are basic facts which one must be acquainted with to
<br>
have any hope of explaining how and why intelligence works.
<br>
<p>The hostility to philosophers is quite frankly because as a rule
<br>
philosophers have proven to have a vastly inflated expectation
<br>
of how relevant their work is to reality, in particular how the
<br>
human brain works and how to build AGI. Numerous philosophers have
<br>
nonetheless made important contributions, but all those that have
<br>
done so took the time to intensively study relevant science and
<br>
maths before speculating. If you don't do this your fate will be
<br>
probably resemble that of the philosopher in this story;
