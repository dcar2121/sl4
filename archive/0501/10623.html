Your first paragraph doesn't make much sense.  Of course if the event 
<br>
you are betting on fails, you get nothing or less.  The events where you 
<br>
do win compensate, probablistically, for when you don't. That's why the 
<br>
expected utility can never be equal to the reward of a success (unless 
<br>
the probability is 1; but Bayesian reasoners we are, we know that unity 
<br>
as a possibility is impossible.), but must always be less to compensate 
<br>
for the failures. So expected utility *is* important.  If you regard the 
<br>
probability of a win as infintesmial (but not 0, bayesian reasoners we 
<br>
are...), than the expected utility is likewise minuscule.
<br>
And my assesment of the chances that AI will be done and a win is 
<br>
calculated through my own understandings of AI and the difficulty 
<br>
thereof, the chance of a win,  the computing power available now and in 
<br>
the future (which allow more brute-force techniques to be used, lowering 
<br>
the difficulty of AI).  I cannot believe that it is easier to win a 
<br>
Mega-millions jackpot for any one randomly selected ticket than for all 
<br>
of humanity to develop an AI in the next 100 years.

<em>&gt; Taking into account expected utility of FAI seems like a good way of

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So Eliezer's argument implicitly tries to convince people not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother investing in anything with low probability of success, 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of success in the eyes of many.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I consider the chance of Yudkowsky et al. succeeding to be considerably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better (but still not acceptable) than the billions-against lottery
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can I ask what you are basing this statement on?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Add in the higher return, the expected utility is considerably higher 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; donating to the Institute than for a lottery ticket.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but, like I said, the amount of expected utility is orthogonal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the issue.
