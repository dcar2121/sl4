</em><br>
<p>Stephen Gould's reputation is trash among serious evolutionary biologists, 
<br>
not always because Gould gets it wrong, but because Gould claims, as his 
<br>
own brilliant revolutionary ideas, warped and dumbed-down versions of quite 
<br>
ordinary tenets of modern evolutionary biology.  (Tooby and Cosmides 1997; 
<br>
<a href="http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html">http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html</a>.)  In this case, the point 
<br>
made by Gould in his 1996 book _Full House_ is stolen from George 
<br>
Williams's classic _Adaptation and Natural Selection_ (1966).  Nor was it 
<br>
Williams's original idea, and I can't look up whose it was because I don't 
<br>
have my books right now.  But in 1966, there actually *was* a widespread 
<br>
Panglossian optimism to inveigh against.  When Gould wrote his book in 
<br>
1996, such ideas were no longer current among serious evolutionary 
<br>
biologists; Williams had dispelled them long since.
<br>
<p>It's true that there's no steady increase in species complexity, but the 
<br>
reason given above is not correct.  Rather, natural selection tends to 
<br>
increase genetic complexity, as genomes accrete additional adaptive 
<br>
functions, *until* natural selection hits the right boundary, which is the 
<br>
limited selection pressure available to maintain genetic information 
<br>
against the noise of mutation.  See Williams 1966 for more details on this.
<br>
<p>If Gould had written his books in the 1940s, they might have done some 
<br>
good.  For Gould to write such books in the 1990s and present himself as 
<br>
the hero of past revolutions is simply intellectual dishonesty, as Tooby 
<br>
and Cosmides and others observe.
