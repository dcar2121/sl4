Hi,
<br>
<p>I just been thinking about qualia a bit more recently. 
<br>
<p>(I have to make a disclaimer.  I know next to nothing about them, but other 
<br>
people's ideas from this list have been fermenting in my mind for a while.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, here goes......
<br>
<p>How about the idea that qualia are properties generated in the brain relating to 
<br>
the *experience* of real world. They are artifacts that are generated as ways 
<br>
of embedding labels or evaluations of data from the real world into the data 
<br>
streams that, in the brain, are tagged as being 'real'. eg. 'red' is an 
<br>
identification label, a 'stink' is a safety evaluation. 
<br>
<p>Using qualia is probably the quickest way to compile data about the real world 
<br>
into a digested form that contains everything from data that is relatively close 
<br>
to what the real world is like together with other subjective responses from 
<br>
within the brain that is convenient to be transferred through the brain tightly 
<br>
bound to the data that might be considered more objective.
<br>
<p>Given that biological systems have had hundreds of millions of years to evolve 
<br>
this 'objective'/'subjective'data bundling it is no wonder that it seems 
<br>
marvellously rich and seemless and carries an overwhelming sense of being 
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>Once complex brained / complecly motivated creatures start using qualia they 
<br>
could play into lifepatterns so profoundly that even obscure trends in the use 
<br>
of qualia for aesthetic purposes could actually effect reproductive prospects.  
<br>
For example, male peacocks have large tails that look nice - clearly qualia are 
<br>
playing a role in the differentiation process that decides which peacocks will 
<br>
be more or less successful in breeding.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
