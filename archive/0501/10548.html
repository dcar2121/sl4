Mike Wilson Wrote - 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are two basic problems with philosophy. One is that it lacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a strong selective mechanism, and thus while 10% of it is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;useful the other 90% of it is useless junk. 
</em><br>
<p>There are two basic poroblems with saying this - the first and a large
<br>
part of the reason why 'philosophy' does get a bad rap - is that it
<br>
encompasses so much. I am not saying that any AGI projects need to take
<br>
into account any metaphysics, aesthetics or comparisons of milk and wine
<br>
- 90% of 'philosophy' is useless. Secondly  philosophy has the same
<br>
selective mechanism as science, if a philosophical conjecture is
<br>
experimentally disproven then it will never again see the light of day,
<br>
its just that philosophical ideas may be discussed for a long time
<br>
before they can be experimentally disproven - scientific conjectures are
<br>
made expressly for the purpose of being experimentally tested - or
<br>
sometimes just mathematically tested, like in the case of string theory,
<br>
which a lot of people do view as philosophy, this doesn't make it
<br>
useless though. As for ideas that obviously can never be experimentally
<br>
tested, that is why discussion needs to take place, because its the only
<br>
tool we have for coming to any conclusions and scientific conjectures
<br>
are subject to this exact same process before they are or can be
<br>
experimentally tested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The second is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that most philosophy takes the correctness of intuitive human notions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about various aspects of cognition, as well as the basic validity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;introspection, pretty much as a given. 
</em><br>
<p>You say this as though philosophy and science are two diametrically
<br>
opposed disciplines
<br>
I don't know what philosophy you have been reading but you don't seem
<br>
to have a very good idea of what its about - taking something as a given
<br>
is the domain of other disciplines - thats why they have particular
<br>
names and delve into particular areas of knowledge, philosophy as a
<br>
discipline doesn't really have a strict set area of knowledge that one
<br>
must subscribe to to be a philosopher and it certainly doesn't rest on
<br>
any assumptions - other than the one that we can communicate to come to
<br>
aggreement or disagreement about stuff - there are even those who say we
<br>
shouldn't bother because its useless -but never more useless than their
<br>
view though. Sorry I just realised you were talking about 'most'
<br>
philosophy - is that more or less vague a term than philosophy as a
<br>
whole? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By contrast cognitive science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has been slowly but steadily proceeding from trying to answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mysterious philosophical questions to explaining where the illusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of mystery comes from and why we ask these badly formed questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I was talking about philosophy of mind, which is undeniably important,
<br>
even if we don't model an AGI exactly around human intelligence, and any
<br>
philosopher of mind worth reading operates on the edge of cognitive
<br>
science's discoveries. The trouble is that philosophy is on the scene
<br>
before science and I think that trained philosophers in the same
<br>
position as scientists are often better at knowing where the directions
<br>
of progress should be, what the right questions to ask are, and what
<br>
kind of experiments should be done - philosophers make great scientists
<br>
in this respect - they're usually just better at performing though
<br>
experiments than real ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Much of AGI consists of untested theories that are supported at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best by several steps of inference from experimental psychology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neuroanatomy or decision theory. More often, they are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plausible sounding guesses based on someone's intuitive ideas on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cognition works, possibly aided by some compelling metaphors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent seeming processes people are familiar with. 
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly why philosophers can provide many valuable insights
<br>
into what direction any AGI project should take - they can't be any
<br>
worse than the people already doing so - except that they don't have the
<br>
expertise in particular fields - but they are trained to understand
<br>
problems - and to find innovative ways of solving them. Sometimes its
<br>
better to think about a problem when you are not working entirely inside
<br>
that system, this is what philosophers can do for the AGI project. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;normative probability and decision theory (including Bayes) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the failings of the dualistic viewpoint (and other philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delusions inconsistent with the integrated causal model and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific findings of evolutionary psychology) are not in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;class. 
</em><br>
<p>I find the inclusion of a reference to the dualistic viewpoint typical
<br>
of your misunderstanding - dualism is the most criticised doctrine in
<br>
the history of philosophy and rightly so (the same goes for the John
<br>
Searle references in your story - except his Chinese room is only the
<br>
second most criticised) I don't know anyone that believes this and I
<br>
actually have some philosophers as friends. I'm not sure normative
<br>
probability and decision theory should be taken as facts though - I know
<br>
very little about either so I'll try and get back to you as to why I
<br>
think not - or that I think they should be taken as facts...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The hostility to philosophers is quite frankly because as a rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophers have proven to have a vastly inflated expectation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of how relevant their work is to reality, in particular how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human brain works and how to build AGI. 
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly what I'm talking about - unneccessary hostility - and
<br>
hostility that has I'm sure been aimed at anyone else who so arrogantly
<br>
believes themselves to be unquestionably right, or presents
<br>
unquestionable facts. So calling yourself a philosopher automatically
<br>
conjures up peoples expectations of this 90% (which I think isn't
<br>
neccessarily accurate but won't debate it just now) of philosophers who
<br>
tend to be idiots. End the discrimination - jettison your
<br>
preconceptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Numerous philosophers have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nonetheless made important contributions, but all those that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done so took the time to intensively study relevant science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maths before speculating. If you don't do this your fate will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably resemble that of the philosopher in this story;
</em><br>
<p>What do you think interests me about SL4 if I haven't at least read
<br>
some of the relevant material? It is entirely unlikely that your
<br>
preconcieved 'philosopher' would accidentally stumble here but thats the
<br>
way your first reply treated me. I felt somewhat patronised  that your
<br>
first reply mimicked my initial post, but from a memetic point of view I
<br>
feel honoured - does memetics have any place in a theory of AGI
<br>
everybody? What about cybernetics and systems thinking like Lovelock's
<br>
Gaia theory and non-linear mathematics? A great contemporary philosophy
<br>
site which may surprise you is Principia Cybernetica:-
