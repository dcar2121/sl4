</em><br>
<p>I think paperclips are an excellent way to summarize two key points:
<br>
<p>- Intelligence (in the operational sense of ability to come up with
<br>
effective plans in the service of some goal system) and wisdom (in the
<br>
sense of having goals we would recognize as wise) are completely
<br>
different things.
<br>
- Anthropomorphism is a fallacy; nonhuman entities can be dangerous
<br>
without feeling malicious emotions. (Consider anthrax.)
<br>
<p>But by all means use another term if you prefer.
<br>
<p>As for the most likely danger, I don't think it's going to come from
<br>
AI undergoing hard takeoff in someone's basement and popping out to
<br>
eat the world - reality is bigger and more complex than that. (Though
<br>
I think everyone trying to create AI in their basement should act on
<br>
the assumption that that is a danger - always assume the gun is
<br>
loaded.)
<br>
<p>I think the danger is larger scale and longer term: that evolution
<br>
will lead the universe out of the region of state space that contains
<br>
sentience, and into the region that contains an optimal
<br>
self-replicator. The ancestors could have been AIs, uploaded humans,
<br>
genetically engineered transhumans or plain biologically evolved
<br>
transhumans (the last being in my opinion the least likely, since
<br>
biological evolution is slow; but it would get the job done if given
<br>
enough time), but the end result is a future light cone full of
<br>
optimal self-replicators and empty of people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, what poses the bigger risk: an AI with a mind of its own, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that doesn't.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;mind of its own&quot;?
<br>
