<em>&gt;Love is a literary invention of the Renaissance. What people call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;love at different times is at least three separate emotions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infatuation (phenethylamine), bonding (oxytocin) and lust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(testosterone).  The way you &quot;love&quot; your mother (bonding) is different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the way you &quot;love&quot; your girlfriend (infuation, probably lust),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but when people use the term interchangeably, they obfuscate rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than elucidate their desires. Contemporary society's inability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinguish between these separate emotions is the cause of much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heartache.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was aware of the latter two chems but not the prior. You've probably saved 
<br>
me a lot of trouble through that education.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is a literary invention of the Renaissance, but it has an intended 
<br>
function of providing people a meta-qualia to describe their optimization of 
<br>
relationships between themselves and other people, their country, their 
<br>
profession, their god ect. In this sense it might be worthwhile to use &quot;Love&quot; 
<br>
to describe a meta-characteristic of cognitive optimization processes 
<br>
regarding stability and happiness. The scientific method emerged out of the 
<br>
culture of the Renaissance, and we still find that useful, maybe &quot;Love&quot; is a 
<br>
word still worth applying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Emotional stability is achieved in the early 20s following a drop in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hormone levels.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose in another year I'll be able to verify this emphirically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I would conclude that the Friendliness of a strongly transhuman mind would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; benifit from the love of a good transwoman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would a transhuman care?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Martin
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A transhuman would care for the same reason that a superintelligence or 
<br>
radically transcendant mind would care, that is not at all unless they 
<br>
maintained a self-consistent goal system or value regarding the above 
<br>
optimization process as useful with reliably good results. If &quot;Love&quot; in this 
<br>
sense was valued, it might go a long way toward refining heuristics regarding 
<br>
Friendliness.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note when I wrote replied to Eliezer's message twelve hours ago I was 
<br>
under the influence of alcohol and oxytocin, with just a hint of 
<br>
phenethylamine.
