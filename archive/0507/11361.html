Touche, you make some good points about design pitfalls regarding as vague a 
<br>
term as &quot;Identity&quot;. I think you miss my point though, what I'm advocating is 
<br>
an inclusion of all information held by the AGI into what functionally might 
<br>
be seen by humans as identity, the AGI treats everything as it would treat 
<br>
itself if it had a tangible individuated self-concept as we do; functional 
<br>
selflessness. Sentience isn't a pre-requisite for this inclusion, only 
<br>
existence, or computability if you want to avoid the philosophical problems 
<br>
associated with the term &quot;Existence&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is a major issue with how the AGI would treat itself if it had 
<br>
an individuated self-concept, for instance just because it sees everything and 
<br>
itself as one doesn't mean it wouldn't optimize everything into nano-tiles. 
<br>
Plus you have to consider that not only am I a human trying to reason about 
<br>
transhuman altruism, I'm a cognitive science layman trying to reason about 
<br>
implementing said altruism. All I'm proposing is a design hueristic for the 
<br>
consideration of the real scientists: Altruism is inclusive selfishness.
