<em>&gt;===== Original Message From H C &lt;<a href="mailto:lphege@hotmail.com?Subject=RE:%20Fighting%20UFAI">lphege@hotmail.com</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intelligence is an optimization process, wisdom is intelligent (highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimized, perhaps?) information.
</em><br>
<p>Thats the best definition I've read on this list, it does wonders to frame the 
<br>
whole &quot;AI with mind vs. mindless AI&quot; issue as well as the difference between 
<br>
Friendly and Unfriendly AI. The reason the paperclip example is useful is 
<br>
because the task of tiling the whole light cone with a consistent physical 
<br>
pattern requires plenty of intelligence, but hardly any imagination or wisdom. 
<br>
To make an analogy to human pattern-reasoning, it takes intuitive intelligence 
<br>
for a cave-man to throw a rock with precision, but it takes wisdom to apply 
<br>
meta-patterns to that general optimization process of throwing and decide on 
<br>
the proper context (target, position, escape route if target is bigger than 
<br>
you and survives ect.) If dinosaurs got into genetic engineering they would 
<br>
have been wise to not breed a man who could simply learn to throw, but who 
<br>
could learn to reason about his throws. Of course these hypothetical dinosaurs 
<br>
should also be aware that the extra work involved in ensuring wise throws from 
<br>
their grown-up creation would not ensure that well-reasoned rocks throws 
<br>
wouldn't attempt to harm them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By analogy, their are many more UFAI designs than FAI designs, but their 
<br>
are also many more blind optimization process UFAI designs than their are 
<br>
blind optimization process FAI designs. Meta-information makes better 
<br>
information.
