*sigh*
<br>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you all... 
<br>
<p>there... is...no...threat...from ... unfriendly..ai
<br>
<p>objective...morality....exists
<br>
<p>I swear I'll prove it if it's the last damn thing I
<br>
ever do
<br>
<p>yeah, I admit my opinion is still (mostly) intuition,
<br>
but that doesn't mean it's wrong.  The idea that
<br>
there's no objective morality is educated guess-work
<br>
as well you know.  Why should my guess by any more
<br>
likely to be wrong than eli's guess?
<br>
<p><p>O.K, so my attempts to intellectually mix it with
<br>
wilson and yudkowsky have been pretty pathetic so far
<br>
I must admit - as humorous as wile coyote trying to
<br>
beat road runner.  but I still convinced it's only a
<br>
matter of time before I intellectually have them both
<br>
on the ropes ;)
<br>
<p>I repeat my guess again:
<br>
<p>*Computational intractability is what will always stop
<br>
an ufai from endless self-improvement.  I think any
<br>
ufai can only improve to a point before being *jammed*
<br>
by intractability.  So yes, I think that unfriendly ai
<br>
is possible, but only of a kind that is limited in
<br>
intelligence.  
<br>
<p>Objective morality does not constrain the *content* of
<br>
the goal system, but suppose it constrains the
<br>
*structure* ? (the process of acting upon the goal
<br>
system).  What if objective morality will always *jam*
<br>
an unfriendly goal system by hitting it with
<br>
computational intractability?
<br>
<p>So, an unfriendly ai cannot recursively self-improve
<br>
past a certain point.  Only a friendly ai can.  That's
<br>
my story and I'm sticking to it.
<br>
<p>Do I have any hard evidence to support my assertions? 
<br>
Not yet.  It's still (mostly) intuition.  Should I
<br>
assume I'm wrong?  Of course!  It is only rational to
<br>
assume the gun is loaded (I'm not really crazy you
<br>
know, I only act that way ;)
