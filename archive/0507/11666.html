Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, *my* interpretation of the &quot;hard problem&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;explaining how/why there is a connection between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective conscious experience, on the one hand, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular physical phenomena like electricity flowing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in brains on the other hand.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chalmers may have put it in an overly objective-reality-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flavored way, but I suppose this is the essence of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was getting at.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  
<br>
<p>My concern is that by framing the problem in an objective-reality-flavored way, it's too easy for materialists to dismiss the hard problem as a ghost and claim that it simply doesn't exist.  The topics of qualia and subjective experience have been brought up on this list a number of times, although such discussions usually evaporate pretty quickly and I'm afraid that the hard problem might soon be relegated to the &quot;dead horse&quot; graveyard.
<br>
<p>I understand that these discussions disintegrate so quickly because all we can do is speculate.  I do not propose any solutions to the problem, nor that we speculate about the problem, or even that a solution is possible.  I only propose that we acknowledge our own ignorance.  Admitting that the hard problem might be too hard to solve is honest, while denying that it exists at all is dangerous.
<br>
<p>Why is this topic relevant to SL4?  If the AI views the world as an objectively-closed system -- that is, with the presumption that objective reality is primary built right into the foundation of its reasoning -- it may never be able to completely deduce subjective reality and may conclude that it's a ghost.  While our own ignorance on this issue is somewhat excusable, this conclusion would be catastrophic if reached by an entity capable of reshaping the world.  
<br>
<p>Does conscious experience emerge from complex patterns or the execution of certain algorithms?  Maybe... Perhaps even probably.  But we don't know that and &quot;not knowing&quot; is the position we should take when encoding the initial reasoning algorithms of the seed AI.
<br>
<p>Norm Wilson
