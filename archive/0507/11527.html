<p>Hmm... actually I think within the assumptions that the participants
<br>
in that conversation appeared to be making, you're right.
<br>
Specifically, I think it's about the speed and timing of takeoff.
<br>
<p>I think your vision of the default scenario (the one most likely to
<br>
occur unless people see it as an existential danger and take steps to
<br>
avert it) is as follows (correct me if I'm wrong):
<br>
<p>1) An AI program in someone's basement crosses a threshold that allows
<br>
it to undergo &quot;hard takeoff&quot; and begin self-improving at a very high
<br>
and sustained rate, so that it can become more powerful than the rest
<br>
of the world before any effective reaction can take place.
<br>
2) This happens relatively early, perhaps in the next few years, at
<br>
any rate in a world that isn't already full of proto-AIs, uploads,
<br>
nanotech weapons etc that might have a chance of catching up.
<br>
3) Intelligence per se is in any case enormously powerful, so much so
<br>
that if the initial AI becomes smarter than everything else, it can
<br>
defeat everything else even if heavily outclassed in material terms.
<br>
<p>The combination of these three things implies that the far future
<br>
population will have evolved from a single, compact core, and the
<br>
combination of 1 and 2 mean that the core will have started with a
<br>
simple, low-entropy goal system. Given that, yes, Darwinian evolution
<br>
may well not apply.
<br>
<p>My vision of the default scenario differs on all three counts. I think
<br>
there is no single threshold beyond which the rules abruptly change;
<br>
if we ever do have &quot;each hour now longer than all the time that went
<br>
before&quot; in Vinge's memorable phrase, that will require highly
<br>
developed ultratechnology, which means it will be late, which means
<br>
ultratechnology will be widely available. I also think intelligence is
<br>
not quite as dominant over numbers as you think it is, so a single
<br>
entity that got ahead could still be pulled down.
<br>
<p>Thus it will resemble previous transitions (biological, cultural,
<br>
technological) in that the population going into the transition will
<br>
be large, with very high total entropy; there will be no single goal
<br>
system, and no single core to preserve it; thus, Darwinian evolution
<br>
will dominate the overall dynamics because it will be the _only_ force
<br>
with global scope; thus, the population will converge on a nonsentient
<br>
optimal self-replicator from many directions.
