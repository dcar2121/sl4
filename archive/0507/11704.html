<em>&gt; &gt; Combine that with a Darwinian / Adam-Smithian view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the universe, and it's hard to see how anything worthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the name &quot;transhuman&quot; could operate in a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not interpret as hostile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't seem very clear to me.  For instance, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally quite benevolent to dogs, and nearly all dogs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to view me as such.
</em><br>
<p>What you call &quot;dogs&quot; are descendants of wolves who have
<br>
been extensively genetically modified by humans to be
<br>
stupid, weak, and subservient, and never to advance
<br>
mentally beyond pre-adolescence. This &quot;benevolence&quot;
<br>
involves
<br>
depriving them of the freedom to roam for miles, and
<br>
to hunt, and to have a pack or a family, and often
<br>
involves sterilizing them or choosing their mates for
<br>
them on the basis of your aesthetic preferences.  If
<br>
their owners do let them have children, they usually
<br>
take them away after a few weeks and sell them to
<br>
strangers, after which they will never see their parents
<br>
again.  If they get sick to the point where we would
<br>
have to spend time taking care of them, we kill them
<br>
and tell ourselves it's for their own good.  Strangely,
<br>
we never do this to our own parents.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, actual wolves have been deliberately,
<br>
aggressively exterminated almost everywhere on earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe a transhuman mind can be created that is benevolent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to humans in the same way that I am benevolent to dogs.
</em><br>
<p>I would rather be exterminated.
<br>
<p>BTW, this is sounding harsh.  I'm not actually angry
<br>
at you, Ben.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, dogs of course were bred by humans to trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans....  In the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are now considering, it is the inferior beast (humans)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the superior beast (the transhumans) rather than vice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versa -- which is of course a far trickier situation....
</em><br>
<p>I would rather view this as an issue of self-accelerated
<br>
evolution, than as an &quot;us vs. them&quot; issue.
<br>
<p>- Phil
