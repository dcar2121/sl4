<em>&gt;   Before you answer that question you have to consider through introspection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this question: to what extent does human wetware cognition preserve

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would my rational structures cease to be useful and be discarded? Would I

<em>&gt; enlightened? Or both? My inclination is that these questions are undecidable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading me to conclude an inability to identify any non-anthropomorphic value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth keeping.
</em><br>
<p>Whether we would be completely overwhelmed by a radically new
<br>
environment depends on how much our brain is able to change to
<br>
accomodate that new environmnent. If the brain is able to find some
<br>
foothold in the new world that enables it to make sense of at least
<br>
some of its input, and can gradually build up from there, it's
<br>
possible that the &quot;human&quot; mind, greatly changed, could have some
<br>
meaningful interaction with such another world.
<br>
<p>My own inclination is that it's fairly likely that the human cognitive
<br>
adaptations would completely fail us in these circumstances, as the
<br>
brain has evolved not as a general purpose computing device (except
<br>
inefficiently at the very highest levels) but as a device with a
<br>
number of processes specifically designed to process information from
<br>
our particular subjective universe. To what extent is it meaningful to
<br>
say &quot;if my sensory modality were to change&quot;? Modalities determine what
<br>
format information about the world will be stored in by our memories,
<br>
and brain modules geared toward processing some specific aspect of our
<br>
cognitive model of reality are often (always, in some combination)
<br>
reused for new purposes when we think abstractly. So we would fail in
<br>
this other world, because too much is hard-wired.
<br>
<p>Would it be useful for a FAI to have more generality in the way its
<br>
modalities function? Well, not at the beginning. Since we don't know
<br>
of any worlds where Bayes' doesn't hold, there's not much point in
<br>
trying to build an AI that would work in it. If the AI is able to find
<br>
such a world verself, ve can self-modify if ve decides ve wants to
<br>
bother with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Is emotion, for example, a natural byproduct of the combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intelligence, consciousness and experience? Perhaps it is not - but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;perhaps there are some identifiable examples.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Intelligence, as we've discussed, can be thought of as a utlity function or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization process, consciousness is a nueral feed-back loop (though a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysterious one indeed) and experience is sense data compressed to symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autopoiesis and highly selective memory. Emotions are nuero-chemical functions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which interact with these mental components. I don't think this implies a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical or &quot;emotional&quot; context to electronic cognition to be be inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompatable with Turing computation. If we could get the kinks out of fluid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum computing this would be an engineering option worth considering.
</em><br>
<p>Eh? What about emotion is so special that it would require anything
<br>
more than a Turing machine to implement as part of an GAI? (That begs
<br>
the question of whether it's even desirable for Friendliness. That one
<br>
seems to be emphatically NO.) How would quantum computing help
<br>
anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I'm a proponent of the notion that irrationality is rationality if construed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an autopoetic system with different underlying rules and axioms. As I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested above, a mind privy to worlds with utterly different ontologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not give much a damn for human logic. Whether this translates into our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilation or the gentle amusement of the AI is the six billion person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite understand what kind of threat you could see concerning
<br>
an AI suddenly understanding a different ontology and going crazy. How
<br>
likely would this be?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the question of what &quot;attitudes&quot; to instill in an
<br>
AI seems to depend on a conception of &quot;attitudes&quot; as having a
<br>
meaningful relation in application to a particular AI design, which
<br>
presumes a considerable knowledge of that design, it seems like.
