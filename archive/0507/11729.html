<em>&gt; Human babies might have such simple minds that a purely individual

</em><br>
<em>&gt; diapers per second.  I, as I am right now, would not choose to take them from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their mothers and consign them to that destiny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you cannot presumptively ban &quot;power over others&quot; as a possible result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CEV, not unless you want to, on your personal authority and responsibility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrench babies off what we conceive to be the track to humanity.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not. I'm proposing no such thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Russell proposed letting the AI programmers hardcode, for all future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization until the end of time, a definition of adulthood.  I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's a very good solution.
</em><br>
<p>Where the hell did you get that from? Not only did I not propose that,
<br>
I explicitly clarified that I was not proposing it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, it's also clear that modern-day humans enjoy meddling in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other's lives a great deal, so that in a democracy it's easy to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote on banning offensive speech.  Libertarians argue that banning offensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech is wrong, and to this end, propose many arguments about both the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of banning offensive speech, the actual consequences of offensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech, propositions about fair play in the realm of ideas, and inalienable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights and the value of personal freedom, and warnings about the undesirable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal consequences of allowing such a framework to exist.  I think each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these arguments is correct, in the sense that I would still so believe even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I knew more and thought faster.  If this is not true of other humans, being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people that they are - if, being smarter, they would yet prefer to censor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and be censored by the force majeure of superintelligence, nor allow that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterable realm of freedom should exist - then I'm not sure in what sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of speech could be said to be what humanity wants.  At that point I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up in a genuine moral dilemma, or rather the Last Judge would, that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still haven't thought of any morally acceptable way to resolve.  I do know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it would not be morally acceptable to me, to, on my own authority, impose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedoms on those who would *never* wish them.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely. That's why I propose that there be a domain where
<br>
a given freedom is allowed, and a domain where it is not, and that
<br>
people have the choice of which they want to emigrate to.
