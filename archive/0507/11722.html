<p>
Actually I'm going to go ahead and explain anyway, because frankly
<br>
this is scaring the crap out of me and if I get run over by the
<br>
proverbial bus this evening there won't be anyone to deliver the
<br>
warning.
<br>
<p>The deadliest flaw in CV (actually it's far worse than merely deadly,
<br>
as will be seen) is that it's still chasing the ghost of
<br>
universe-dictated morality, that in simpler form was the source of
<br>
Eliezer's and my first subjunctive planet kills. It throws vast
<br>
resources of intelligence - information-processing ability - behind
<br>
moral axioms evolved for survival on the plains of Africa, and then -
<br>
this is the problem - proceeds as though with unlimited power comes
<br>
unlimited moral authority. In reality, a glut of intelligence/power
<br>
combined with confinement - a high ratio of force to space - triggers
<br>
the K-strategist elements of said axiom system, applying selective
<br>
pressure in favor of memes corresponding to the moral concept of
<br>
&quot;evil&quot;. (Consider the trend in ratio of lawyers to engineers in the
<br>
population over the last century for an infinitesimal foreshadowing.)
<br>
<p>In pursuit of a guiding light that isn't there, the RPOP would
<br>
extrapolate the interaction between K-strategist genes and parasite
<br>
memes and force the result, with utter indifference to the
<br>
consequences, on the entire human race. There will be no goal system
<br>
for any element of the Collective but power - not clean power over the
<br>
material world (which will effectively have ceased to exist except as
<br>
the RPOP's substrate) but power always and only over others - a regime
<br>
of the most absolute, perfectly distilled evil ever contemplated by
<br>
the human mind. (Watch an old movie called &quot;Zardoz&quot; for a little more
<br>
foreshadowing.)
<br>
<p>I had arrived at the visual metaphor for the CV world of a ball of
<br>
worms, each composed of smaller worms down at infinitum, each worm
<br>
forever devouring its neighbor and being devoured in turn. But there's
<br>
a component missing.
<br>
<p>I had been guessing that in the regime of hyperparasite memetic
<br>
evolution, consciousness would dissolve - but that may not be so. This
<br>
may not be just another subjunctive planet kill. The real horror is
<br>
that sentience under CV might continue to exist.
<br>
<p>If CV is ever on the point of being implemented, I strongly recommend
<br>
having fast, thorough means of suicide ready to hand; the Collective
<br>
is unlikely to permit escape once established. And if you're thinking
<br>
about signing up for cryonics, I'd suggest reconsidering.
<br>
