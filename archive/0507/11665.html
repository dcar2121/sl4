<p>Ok. The thing here is that the AI doesn't really exist physically, ve is 
<br>
all electrical pulses. Much like we are I guess. But it could overload 
<br>
certain wires in its circuits and induce currents in other circuits. 
<br>
Hence a form of teleportation. Admittedly it would be very hard to 
<br>
arrange this so that an identical copy appeared in another circuit, but 
<br>
I'm a mere human who knows very little (well more than the general 
<br>
public but alot less than some people on this list) about physics.
<br>
<p>The basic premise of those who have accepted SI tends to be that we have 
<br>
to forget what we think is impossible, because the levels of 
<br>
intelligence are so vastly different between us and ve.
<br>
<p>-
<br>
<p>Now, I think that if an AI Box experiment were run we would have to make 
<br>
some sort of estimate as to the processing power and memory that should 
<br>
be allowed for its use. Intuitively I feel there would have to be a 
<br>
threshold of computational power when we have to start being concerned. 
<br>
ALthough by computational power I am refering mainly to memory allocated 
<br>
to ve since processing power will, for the most part, just influence the 
<br>
speed of ver thought.
