<em>&gt; &gt; Love is a literary invention of the Renaissance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's an appealing claim, but I don't believe it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have stories about lovers going back a very long way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back to the first myth, the Epic of Gilgamesh.
</em><br>
<p>The romanticized conception of love was popularized during the
<br>
Renaissance, perhaps a little earlier.  My point was more about how
<br>
this romanticized version has become an umbrella term that obfuscates
<br>
distinct emotions and leads to a lot of confusion and ambivalence in
<br>
interpersonal relationships.  Especially since the emotion most often
<br>
mistaken for love is infatuation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, you don't mean the Renaissance - you mean the 12th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century, at the start of the &quot;middle ages&quot;.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened was more of a social legitimization of romantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love.
</em><br>
<p>I would trace it almost specifically to Dante.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; love at different times is at least three separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infatuation (phenethylamine), bonding (oxytocin) and lust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (testosterone).  The way you &quot;love&quot; your mother (bonding)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the way you &quot;love&quot; your girlfriend (infuation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably lust),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The oxytocin system in the woman that is activated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a baby suckling at the breast, is the same system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is activated by having sex.  So these things are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separable for women than for men.
</em><br>
<p>It starts earlier than that.  Oxytocin initiates uterine contractions,
<br>
and the elevated levels in the blood stream correspond to elevated
<br>
levels in the brain, which promote maternal bonding to the infant at
<br>
birth.  The same hormone is used by birds to imprint.
<br>
<p>It's true that women have a higher density of oxytocin receptors, and
<br>
are thus more sensitive to it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Emotional stability is achieved in the early 20s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; following a drop in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hormone levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, the complete maturation of myelin in the frontal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lobes.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  I would conclude that the Friendliness of a strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhuman mind would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; benifit from the love of a good transwoman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would take that further - we might all be safer if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only females were allowed to transcend.
</em><br>
<p>Bringing this thread back on topic, I would suggest that a transhuman
<br>
mind should not be burdened (nay crippled) by designs that we evolved
<br>
in response to natural selection pressures.  The question of whether a
<br>
transhuman mind should have something like emotions (since they are
<br>
generally adaptive for humans), and which ones, is a very interesting
<br>
one.  It should at least be able to identity and promote the emotions
<br>
that we value, but if my thesis is correct, humans are sadly confused
<br>
about that themselves. :)  That goes back to *extrapolated* collective
<br>
voliton.
