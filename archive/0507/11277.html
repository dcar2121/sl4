</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;From what I know, this is *reaallly* unlikely.  It gets more unlikely, the 
<br>
longer I study it; and conversely, the less one knows about how intelligence 
<br>
does work, the more anything seems possible - even that the human brain would 
<br>
not have an incredibly crappy design.
<br>
<p>But suppose it were so.  What is it that would need to be done?  What is there 
<br>
that humanity could or should be doing to prepare for the possibility?  Say 
<br>
the actions that need to be taken, and perhaps they will look like good ideas 
<br>
even if the motive were to change.  I know that the world would seem a little 
<br>
safer to me, even from UFAI, if there were a centralized Internet shutdown 
<br>
switch.  It's not so much that it'll protect you from a transhuman entity, but 
<br>
it might help stop an entity from becoming transhuman.  Once you deal with a 
<br>
transhuman, I really do think you're just screwed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted, given what I know about the hodge-podge nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization of the brain, it's unlikely that an AI programmer would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate most of the same problems that humans have in an AI. But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's the case that some of humans' intelligence shortcomings are due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a rather fundamental architectural problem, so fundamental that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's hard for us to even comprehend it, so fundamental that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences of different architectures would be unrecognizable as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences to us, then that could be a huge crimp in developing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI that actually has transhuman intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that I already know enough about human intelligence and the 
<br>
specific origin of its shortcomings to know that this isn't the case.  Or 
<br>
rather, to know that there are specific things which can be fixed to yield 
<br>
much greater effective intelligence, whatever remained unfixed.  But perhaps I 
<br>
am wrong.
