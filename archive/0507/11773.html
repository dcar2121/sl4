<p><em>&gt; Sorry if none of this directly addresses your concerns, but I do think

</em><br>
<p>Actually, I thought it was a reasonably sophisticated defense of the
<br>
validity of considering qualia. I have no real qualms about
<br>
considering human minds to be nonprivileged in their ability to
<br>
experience qualia. I don't regard qualia as a kind of arrow to be shot
<br>
at transhumanists.
<br>
<p>But I do regard it to be a kind of arrow to be shot at physical
<br>
reductionists - which is to say people who believe that talking about
<br>
brain states is the same thing as talking about mental states.
<br>
<p>I'm even willing to accept that mental states supervene on our brain
<br>
states, which is to say that physical modelling of the brain is
<br>
possible, and that a constructed brain built on those principles could
<br>
enjoy the same experiences as the mind being modelled.
<br>
<p>What I'm not willing to accept is that *all* intelligent simulations
<br>
have access to qualia, or that qualia are illusory. There is something
<br>
which pain is like which is not described by physics equations, even
<br>
if physics equations can account for the progress of the state of the
<br>
world. This is sounding mightily like a dualist argument, which I
<br>
would rather not subscribe to. Rather, I would say that there is a gap
<br>
in physics if it cannot distinguish between matter forms which support
<br>
qualia and those which don't.
<br>
<p>Until we can provide some better than merely intuitive argument about
<br>
why, for example, a traditionally embodied mental machine like a brain
<br>
supports qualia, and why alternatively embodied machines either might
<br>
or might not, I think it is a dangerous leap of faith to assume that
<br>
*all* good physical modelling programs will be conscious just because
<br>
they are imbued with goals.
<br>
<p>Like Ben G obviously does when he says :
<br>
<p>&quot;I tend to think that if one builds a software program with the right
<br>
cognitive structures and dynamics attached to it, the qualia will come along
<br>
&quot;for free&quot;.  Qualia don't need to be explicitly engineered as part of AI
<br>
design, but this doesn't make them any less real or any less important. An
<br>
AI created with humanlike cognitive structures and dynamics will spawn
<br>
humanlike qualia; an AI constructed with other cognitive dynamics and
<br>
structures will have other sorts of qualia...&quot;
<br>
<p>I am happy to admit that he may be right, but I reject the idea that
<br>
he is clearly or convincingly entirely right. There's plenty of room
<br>
here to respect his position while still establishing the parameters
<br>
for argument surrounding non-conscious entities which react in complex
<br>
ways to their environment.
<br>
<p>Norm asked 
<br>
&quot;2.  How can we (or an AI) know, let alone prove, that a sufficient
<br>
model for consciousness has been created?  Can we define a &quot;Turing
<br>
Test&quot; for qualia?&quot;
<br>
<p>One response is that we might not need to. If we build an embodied
<br>
intelligence using the same biological componentry as a human, with
<br>
perfect functionality, then in essense we have done nothing more
<br>
dangerous than give birth. The problem of other minds is open for
<br>
philosophical discussion, but I think we have to draw a practical line
<br>
in the sand about that.
<br>
<p>One way to avoid the problem might be to use similar biological
<br>
componentry to human brains. By analogy, the hardware should support
<br>
qualia, and we can proceed with more confidence.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, it may be possible to identify differences between
<br>
modelled simulation and observed effects. It may be that brains are
<br>
not reducible to brain models. With more science, it might not be
<br>
necessary to rely on Turing Test guesswork and mere acting ability.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm out of time. More later.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
