</em><br>
<p>Juvenile?  That's one I hadn't heard before... I use &quot;paperclips&quot; to convey 
<br>
the idea of an AI with goals that may be simple or complex but are essentially 
<br>
uninteresting to a human.  What do you recommend as a less juvenile way to 
<br>
convey the same concept?  Business suits, hundred-dollar bills?  If you want 
<br>
to convey an actual, different concept in order to sound less juvenile, then I 
<br>
have to object: &quot;not sounding juvenile&quot; isn't a consideration when you're 
<br>
trying to figure out the actual facts of the matter.
<br>
<p>As for what are realistic dangers - the &quot;realistic danger&quot; is a very broad 
<br>
possible range of outcomes of which a paperclip-maximizer is a representative 
<br>
example - including, representative in its improbability.  I guess that 
<br>
whatever kills us will be an X-maximizer where X is something specific and 
<br>
pretty much arbitrary, and therefore, even if we knew what it was in advance, 
<br>
it would sound just as improbable as paperclips.  If anything, &quot;paperclips&quot; is 
<br>
anthropomorphic because it's too humanly comprehensible; more likely would be 
<br>
a future light cone tiled with an incomprehensible little 3D pattern 
<br>
miniaturized to the molecular level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd love to hear well-reasoned thoughts on what and whose motivation would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up being a bigger or more likely danger to us.
</em><br>
<p>I think that all utility functions containing no explicit mention of humanity 
<br>
(example: paperclips) are equally dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, what poses the bigger risk: an AI with a mind of its own, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that doesn't.
</em><br>
<p>If a cognitive system has the ability to predict reality and compose effective 
<br>
plans to manipulate it, which I generally take as the definition of AGI, then 
<br>
what is left to say - what specific features are you talking about - when you 
<br>
ask whether the AI has &quot;a mind of its own&quot; or &quot;doesn't&quot;?  I am honestly 
<br>
confused here.  What's the difference between &quot;AI&quot; and &quot;mind of its own&quot; - 
<br>
what functionality are you divvying up between one and the other?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are specific risks that a run-of-the-mill AGI poses?
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I mainly worry about explosive recursive self-improvement and the end 
<br>
of the world.  An economic depression is something we can survive, so it just 
<br>
doesn't rate as high on my agenda.
