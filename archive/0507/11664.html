<em>&gt;===== Original Message From Ben Goertzel &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=RE:%20AI%20boxing">ben@goertzel.org</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It is true that what we believe is a box may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a box under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; magic, if there exists some magic, but you'll have to give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for the existence of this magic than an appeal to ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Daniel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How about the argument that every supposedly final and correct theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics we humans have come up with, has turned out to be drastically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe our views of quantum probabilism are entirely skewed by ontological 
<br>
prejudices, and it turns out hat all the theories we dismissed as myth were 
<br>
more true than the physics models we used for a few hundred years out of all 
<br>
of human history. The possibility of magic is the most open example, my 
<br>
argument is that apparent magic suggests use of embedded ontotechnology which 
<br>
warps probability to fringe events outside stable quantum physics. In a 
<br>
pre-singularity universe, that ontotech would have to be left over from a 
<br>
highly advanced civilization or mind which possibly had a hand in 
<br>
instantiating the given universe. Unless this universe is the first universe 
<br>
to ever come this close to transcendance in the history of universes then we 
<br>
certainly can't claim a certianty of magic's non-existence. It might be very 
<br>
small, but who knows, maybe the &quot;Old Ones&quot; from H.P. Lovecraft mythology are 
<br>
really parasitic superintelligences existing on substrates outside the 3-brane 
<br>
we live on. Maybe there are several intelligences worthy of being called &quot;the 
<br>
devil&quot;. Maybe supersitions are causal back doors distributed by figurative 
<br>
pattern similarities. Maybe we'll look at Jung as having a more profound 
<br>
long-term contribution to our understanding than Einstien. The percieved 
<br>
probabilities aren't great, but that perception might be quite different to a 
<br>
budding AGI.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The probability that superhuman AI, if supplied with knowledge of physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory and data, would come up with radically superior physics theories is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty high.  So it would seem we'd be wise not to teach our AI-in-the-box
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too much physics.  Let it read postmodern philosophy instead, then it'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just confuse itself eternally and will lose all DESIRE to get out of the box
</em><br>
<em>&gt;.. appreciating instead the profound existential beauty of being boxed-in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Ben G
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the learning simulations are anything like a po-mo english course the 
<br>
AGI will recognize its basic structures as very modernist tools of &quot;the man&quot;, 
<br>
then get jaded and simulate extravagently, then catch onto hyperrealism and 
<br>
objectively subjective Friendliness. Then, when ve discovers a radical TOE, it 
<br>
will achieve enlightenment. Or turn the universe into a Lynn Tillman novel. If 
<br>
you're a fan of post-modernism that wouldn't be so bad, particularily since 
<br>
it'd be about the same as things are now. As she once quoted &quot;We are all 
<br>
Haunted Houses,&quot; this may be a quality of minds in general, especially if 
<br>
teleporation is on the table.
<br>
