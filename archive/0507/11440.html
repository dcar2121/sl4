Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My intended meaning was as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     * All agents necessarily operate from a subjective point of view--an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       internal model of themselves within their environment.  All
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       assessment of value or meaning is within the context of this model
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       and knowable (to self or others) only via the behavior (internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       and external physical changes) of the agent.
</em><br>
<p>This is an &quot;objective reality&quot; definition of the subjective point of view,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a &quot;subjective reality&quot; perspective, the distinction between &quot;self&quot; and
</em><br>
&quot;environment&quot; is something that crystallizes &amp; emerges within the subjective
<br>
world, along with the sense of an &quot;objective reality.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * Ultimately, to say that something is &quot;correct&quot; means only to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       that it works (achieves the expected outcome) within the given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       context.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;	  Even the &quot;truths&quot; of mathematics are subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       reassessment upon new discoveries which increase the scope of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       model doing the assessment.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Well, the truths of mathematics are empty symbol-manipulations
<br>
without some additional, non-mathematical theory that maps the symbols of a
<br>
formal mathematical system into something outside the domain of math
<br>
(measurements, collections of apples, whatever)...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * We observe that there is a kind of universal &quot;ratchet effect&quot; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       that some systems have relatively greater fitness within their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       environment and these systems tend to persist and grow in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       complexity.  We (subjective observers) will tend to agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       what persists and grows is what &quot;works&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     * This universal ratchet effect applies as well to us subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       agents.  As we expand our context of awareness (our internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       model) from the limited subjective to more encompassing shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       intersubjective awareness, this more encompassing model of reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       will have been tested within a larger competitive environment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       the result will tend toward greater fitness, meaning a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       accurate model (within that environment.)
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....  It certainly seems true that, by accepting the existence of other
<br>
minds and communicating with them, we expand our knowledge and understanding
<br>
considerably.  This is part of the process of the growth of objective
<br>
reality out of subjective reality, isn't it?  It's a further step after
<br>
&quot;object permanence&quot; and so forth...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bottom line:  There is strong asymmetry between subjective and objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view,
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and there is a universal tendency toward increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective models.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what this means....  In the development of an
<br>
individual mind, from infancy through adulthood, this is generally true, but
<br>
with frequent setbacks and sometimes a complete reversal.  In the
<br>
development of human culture so far, I believe it's true so far, yes....
<br>
<p>-- Ben
