Chris:
<br>
<p>The point is that our individual *cannot learn* from physics alone,
<br>
what the experiencing of seeing a red rose is like. If she could learn
<br>
from physics alone, then she would not experience anything new,
<br>
period. She would be entirely un-surprised by what she experienced,
<br>
even though it was the first time, because she would know what to
<br>
expect.
<br>
<p>It is not a challenge to the thought experiment to draw a distinction
<br>
between knowing the theory and knowing how to use it, like Michael
<br>
did.
<br>
<p>I agree with him when he says, &quot;This should be obvious; memorising
<br>
detailed instructions on how to ride a bicycle does not immediately
<br>
grant
<br>
you the ability to ride a bike competently, because you cannot
<br>
deliberatively modify your neural circuitry with an act of will.&quot;
<br>
<p>But that is precisely what is interesting. A human cannot understand
<br>
logically everything that they can learn, nor can they describe with
<br>
phyics everything that is immanent (loosely, &quot;real&quot;) to them.
<br>
<p>This is, per se, interesting. This is where the debate lies. It was
<br>
not my intent to prove an argument with this, but it seemed that some
<br>
people were unfamiliar with the intuitive appeal of &quot;qualia&quot;, and I
<br>
thought the thought experiment would help.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>She can make new qualitative predictions. Even if I were to accept
<br>
(which I don't), that minds are reducible to brains, perfect physical
<br>
knowledge could stil only make predictions at the physical level.
<br>
Without a qualitative understanding of &quot;how that feels&quot; to a person,
<br>
the scientist would be un-able to provide a proper description of
<br>
experience / qualia.
<br>
<p>Physics, for example, doesn't enable to me understand what language
<br>
means, nor does merely understanding the grammar and syntax and
<br>
symbolism of a language allow me to use it.
<br>
<p>The suggestion is that for all its physical knowledge, humans have
<br>
access to knowledge that a nonfeeling machine simply cannot.
<br>
<p>A machine, albeit capable of /acting in a way perfectly coherent with
<br>
a perfect understanding of physics and the appearance of intelligence/
<br>
might be no more than a big rock, as far as any sense of
<br>
self-understanding or greater meaning is concerned.
<br>
<p>I agree that a machine seems capable of true intelligence,
<br>
consciousness and qualia. But equally, I think a machine is capable of
<br>
a lifeless mimic.
<br>
<p>If consciousness is our inner life, and qualia is what that
<br>
consciousness is like, then a machine without qualia is a machine
<br>
without an inner life.
<br>
<p>To me, that is the greater danger, compared with the possibility of an evil AGI.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
