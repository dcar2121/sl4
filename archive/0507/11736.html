<p>The non-sequitur society; we don't make sense, but we do like pizza.
<br>
<p>Read some real evolutionary psychology.  You might want to delete the words 
<br>
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; from your vocabulary while you do that, then restore them 
<br>
afterward, once your empirical picture of the world is correct.
<br>
<p>In a genetic sense, the competitors are always, always, always the alternative 
<br>
alleles at a given genetic location - which in turn are carried by 
<br>
conspecifics.  Genes for various types of altruism only become fixed in a 
<br>
species if they drive all alternative alleles to extinction.  Genetically the 
<br>
competitor is always your conspecific, never Nature or the environment.  The 
<br>
greatest environmental success has no effect on the frequency composition of 
<br>
the gene pool if all conspecifics hav equal success.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now suppose you have a species that's basically K-strategist, but with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a flexible brain, that has encountered a variety of conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including those with low ratio of force to space (lots of sparsely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occupied territory, environmental hardship is the enemy), and high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratio of force to space (you have to dominate or kill others of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own kind to get resources), what would we expect to see? Scatter a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of members of that species over a large landscape where they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free to come into contact or avoid each other as they wish, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll get along fine; lock them in a sealed box with no escape and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll turn on each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CV locks all of humanity in a sealed box with no escape. (The problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't the Volition part, it's the Collective part.)
</em><br>
<p>The problem here is the ratio of cubic expansion through galaxies to 
<br>
exponential reproduction.  CEV doesn't solve this problem of itself, though it 
<br>
might search out a solution.  Neither does CEV create the problem or make it 
<br>
any worse.  Why do you suppose that we want to lock ourselves into a little 
<br>
box rather than expanding cubically?
<br>
<p>Oh, and how exactly do you determine resource division between your domains?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Starting with present human society, create a world government with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;absolute knowledge and absolute power, capable not only of seeing into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;people's homes a la 1984, but into their very thoughts; with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Constitution (you don't want any hardwired protections, after all) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;no escape, ever (nobody gets to opt out of CV). Don't you find it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;all reasonable to suggest that society would turn utterly evil very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;quickly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It's plausible.  But I don't understand why you think this is what CEV
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;simulates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CEV doesn't _simulate_ it, it _instantiates_ it. The RPOP is a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government with absolute knowledge and absolute power.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  I think I may write you off as simply having failed entirely to 
<br>
understand the concept of _extrapolated_ volition writing an AI, as opposed to 
<br>
putting an AI in the hands of an immediate majority vote, a fairly common 
<br>
misunderstanding.  I honestly don't know how I can make the distinction any 
<br>
clearer short of grabbing people by the shirt and screaming at them.
