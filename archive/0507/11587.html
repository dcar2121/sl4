Hello, all. I originally posted this article yesterday on my blog at 
<br>
<a href="http://futureimperative.blogspot.com/2005/07/augmentation-is-train-leaving-station.html">http://futureimperative.blogspot.com/2005/07/augmentation-is-train-leaving-station.html</a>
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, all of the links were stripped out of this copy when I put it 
<br>
in this email, but that's life. You can check out the above link if you want 
<br>
to examine those points, or you can go to 
<br>
<a href="http://futureimperative.blogspot.com">http://futureimperative.blogspot.com</a> if you want to survey my blog as a 
<br>
whole.
<br>
<p>Comments are welcome.
<br>
<p>Ralph
<br>
---- 
<br>
<p><p>Given how fast augmentation techniques have been surfacing in recent years, 
<br>
the question arises: How long before we have augmentation methods too 
<br>
powerful to ignore? And for that matter, how long before we have neo-humans 
<br>
who are in many ways definitively superior to the previous model -- that is 
<br>
to say, the rest of us?
<br>
<p>Personally, as a human-enhancement enthusiast, it has been surprising to see 
<br>
progress in this field consistently outracing even my expectations. 
<br>
Especially considering that no large organization or wealthy entity seems to 
<br>
be pushing such research. Indeed, given the position of the President's 
<br>
Council on Bio-Ethics, it would seem that the present attitude of the U.S. 
<br>
government is relatively hostile to the field. Yet progress is continuing 
<br>
regardless, and a number of breakthroughs enabling the creation of 
<br>
&quot;superhumans&quot; using existing technology may already be possible.
<br>
<p>So far on this blog, I've either discussed or linked to significant new 
<br>
discoveries with the potential to create people who are &quot;more than human.&quot; 
<br>
There's been the techniques for doubling muscle mass and amplifying 
<br>
cardio-vascular endurance through genetic manipulation -- already in use in 
<br>
animals, and which experts speculated could well be in use in our next 
<br>
Olympics, if they weren't already a part of the last one.
<br>
<p>When injecting rats with the gene for IGF-1 and then having them exercise 
<br>
results in a doubling of their muscle mass (and when merely being injected 
<br>
and not exercising increases muscle size and strength by 15% to 30%), it 
<br>
becomes clear that only a relative handful of such modifications would be 
<br>
necessary for a genetically human &quot;sub-species&quot; to pull away from the rest 
<br>
of us in terms of performance. Particularly if they started at an elevated 
<br>
baseline of abilities.
<br>
<p>And of course, there's been the various bio-energy manipulations described 
<br>
here, here, here and here. And the accelerated learning and creativity 
<br>
boosting techniques described here, here, here, here, here, here, here, 
<br>
here, here, here, here, here, here, and here, among others. Some of my 
<br>
previous articles, such as this one and this one, have surveyed the rate at 
<br>
which science has been making strides in biologically enhancing human 
<br>
beings. Obviously, there's no shortage of enhancement methods, even for 
<br>
those of us not yet (or perhaps never) biologically, pharmacologically or 
<br>
cybernetically augmented. Which raises the very basic question -- how long 
<br>
before someone realizes that any effective methods for significant human 
<br>
improvement could be synergistically combined, thus leading to ever more 
<br>
radically evolved beings? And that a relatively simple program could take a 
<br>
relatively small number of such people -- a few hundred to a few thousand or 
<br>
tens of thousands -- and with a fairly small budget (within the reach of 
<br>
many companies, not to mention nations) develop a host of &quot;posthumans&quot; to 
<br>
serve that organization's interests...?
<br>
<p>Not a grandiose leap of the imagination if the people in said program 
<br>
included many of the leaders and thinkers of such a group, particularly 
<br>
people who would have reason to expect to see great improvements in their 
<br>
personal compensation in exchange for substantial improvements in the 
<br>
quality of their work and thought. And who might be personally, 
<br>
ideologically and/or philosophically devoted to the group and its goals.
<br>
<p>Along these lines, here's my response to one query about potential augmented 
<br>
humans:
<br>
<p>&quot;As to the exceptional individuals I mentioned, that was technically one of 
<br>
the relatively fictional parts of the post (unlike, say, the two computers 
<br>
engaged in automated biotech research). But you're right to ask about them, 
<br>
because in fact both were based on human capabilities that have been 
<br>
developed not through genetic engineering, but through regular practice of 
<br>
particular disciplines.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'll save a more detailed discussion for another blog post, but to 
<br>
summarize, the guy with the unusually well-developed capillaries is based on 
<br>
simple techniques by Dr. Win Wenger for increasing healthy circulation to 
<br>
your brain. He's the easier of the two to create through simple, daily 
<br>
exercises -- especially given several years of work.
<br>
<p>&quot;The girl with the superior limbic access/learning skills is based on a 
<br>
number of accelerated learning techniques, including a number of hypnosis 
<br>
methods developed (and never written down) by Dr. Milton Erickson, Dr. 
<br>
Raikov, and others. She'd be more difficult to develop -- in particular the 
<br>
kind of automatic access to her superlearning gifts that I describe -- but 
<br>
given the research and an intensive project to create one or more such 
<br>
people, hardly impossible.
<br>
<p>&quot;One key point of this article was that there are a number of ways to 
<br>
develop a superhuman (or &quot;superentity&quot;). Also implied, I think, is the point 
<br>
that many of the methods available could be used to enhance each other -- a 
<br>
genetically augmented person using accelerated learning and mindtech to 
<br>
leverage their assets and then turning around to improve a computer system 
<br>
that researches biotech options.
<br>
<p>&quot;You quickly end up with a snowball effect here. Or a &quot;Singularity.&quot; =)&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Future Imperative -- A broad look at human enhancement, from gene therapy to 
<br>
accelerated learning, from neural implants to smart drugs, from posthuman 
<br>
evolution to the wildest flights of human imagination.
