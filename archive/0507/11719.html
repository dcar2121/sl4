<em>&gt;I was pointing out that there has to be a way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translate between these two types of languages, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggested that Friendliness naturally falls out as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logical consequence of the fact that you *can*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translate between the two levels of organzation ie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intelligence imples Friendliness and visa versa i.e
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Objective Morality.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, well that sounds like something testable, albiet requiring a full FAI 
<br>
theory. However, what if objective morality is real, but it turns out to 
<br>
something of a tangled loop, such as &quot;Objective Morality is fulfilled for 
<br>
every individual mind which experiences a subjective sensation of fulfilling 
<br>
their own personal morality&quot;, or if the correlation between logic and agency 
<br>
proves to be more tenous than a mere bottum to top correlation, then the 
<br>
consciousness of an FAI, no matter how powerful, would still be considerably 
<br>
subjective. If this subjective &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness persists even 
<br>
in a superintelligence, its reasonable to assume the possiblity that a full 
<br>
theory of FAI is unattainable, perhaps along the same lines as a complete 
<br>
panuniversal TOE, or an Objective Morality. But you've made your case, and I 
<br>
think its one of the most important questions one can ask, however assuming 
<br>
its truth a priori tends to ignore serious risks of Objective Morality being 
<br>
less Friendly than we'd like, ect.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a wild conjecture regarding what Objective Morality might be, did 
<br>
something resembling it prove to exist. What if Objective Morality were a 
<br>
system of heuristics embedded into an ultracomputing substrate governing a set 
<br>
of universes, perhaps an infinite though not total set, put into place by an 
<br>
intelligence so powerful that a mind merely billions of times smarter than us 
<br>
would seem like an amoeba to it. This is as far out and awe inspiring to a 
<br>
religionist as it is frightening to a humanist. Were controls like this to 
<br>
exist there is no assurance our goals would have a place in them, or that an 
<br>
AGI seeking them out would experienced enchance Friendliness, or that these 
<br>
controls reflected a truly Objective Morality of a truly objective God 
<br>
(presumably infinite, rather than a &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; merely 3^^^^^7 times more 
<br>
intelligent than us). The only assurance would be that these moral controls 
<br>
would be something extremely powerful and discrete, and that they would have 
<br>
to be negotiated with, particularily in the worst case scenarios.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just to clarify, I also don't think there's anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mystical about intelligence or consciousness.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness is entirely dependent on physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proccesses and that intelligence is completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computational.  No mysticism required.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair enough. But what if Friendliness isn't directly emergent from 
<br>
intelligence, but rather dependant on design, useful yet compassionate 
<br>
meta-hueristics, or something even more elusive that General Intelligence does 
<br>
not embody a priori? If General Intelligence depends of qualia, as you 
<br>
suggest, then that &quot;something&quot; is included in General Intelligence, hopefully. 
<br>
Engineering that is a huge challenge, however, and assuming it without a 
<br>
complete thoery of qualia probably strikes many on this list as 
<br>
counter-productive. Then again, Einstien's first few papers were flamed and 
<br>
rejected for accusedly sweeping hard problems like &quot;Ether dynamics&quot; under the 
<br>
rug.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to keep the subject line honest, some words on intuition. We don't 
<br>
know how intuition works in the brain, yet, but we can glean from studying the 
<br>
numerology of myth and literature that it often produces outcomes sculpted by 
<br>
subconscious hueristics which assert correlations between symbols without 
<br>
stipulating a causal correlation. For instance, why suggest there be 7 
<br>
Knowledge Domains? Why not 8? Its nothing proven that there can only be seven, 
<br>
but the number does intiutively strike most as more elegant, perhaps holy. Or 
<br>
above, when I described the intelligence of the &quot;Oz&quot; entity behind a 
<br>
theoretical Objective Morality, I wrote three to the five times nested power 
<br>
of seven. Three, five, and seven are all very significant numbers in 
<br>
occultism, wicca, Christianity; not to mention the second, third, and fourth 
<br>
prime numbers. Coincidence? Exactly a coincedence. I had no conscious thought 
<br>
of those number's ontological signifigance when I wrote down that ridiculously 
<br>
large value, but somehow they emerged from my memeome as they did, like magic. 
<br>
Intuition is a powerful cognitive technology of human wetware, perhaps 
<br>
indistinguishable from magic to some, but its probably more similar to a 
<br>
powerfully selective, heuristic driven evolutionary algorithm in our brains 
<br>
than any mystic insight to the &quot;Objective&quot;. Everybody, for Marc to Eliezer, 
<br>
would benifit from an introspective self-diagnostic regarding their 
<br>
subconscious influences.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead horse has now been turned into glue, thank you for your time.
