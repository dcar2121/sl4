Ender's game series, what a great source of inspiration (.. ahem ^_^)
<br>
<p>Given FAI, I think humans would have the means to defend themselves against 
<br>
aliens (of lesser intelligence than the FAI!), however, there would be no 
<br>
reason to ATTACK the aliens, unless the only means of defense was attack.
<br>
<p>Thus…
<br>
<p>Essentially the way I see it is that our first primary problem is FAI (due 
<br>
primarly to UFAI threats, however besides that AI seems to be the most 
<br>
optimal way to go about things), whereas our next problem is the &quot;big 
<br>
freeze&quot; (which is the ultimate threat to the immortalist way of life). An 
<br>
intermediate problem of those two would also be the threat of “Other” 
<br>
Unfriendly Intelligence- aka Evil Aliens. Even if we have an all powerfully 
<br>
smart FAI, there is still the threat of an even more all powerfully smart 
<br>
Evil Alien Intelligence.

<em>&gt;Philip,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that these golden rules are not something I want to have alien 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;species use in judging how they treat me. For instance - a species may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe in life sacrifice and that it is the highest honour, however unless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe in their spirituality I don't want an FAI deeming it okay because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it fits these golden rules (presumably any of the aliens would volunteer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and *want* to be the sacrificial individual). Those that have read the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ender's saga by Orson Scott Card may recognise this scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When other sentient beings actions *intentionally* put the primary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interests (i.e. existance) of other individuals at risk, then they should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be prevented from doing so.
</em><br>

<em>&gt;&gt;I don't think it's a coincidence that golden rules are common in the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;widespread human philosophies eg.  &quot;do unto other as you would have them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;do unto you&quot; (golden rule 1) or &quot;don't do unto others what they would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you not do unto them&quot; (golden rule 2).  Things seem to work reasonably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;well when diverse cultures have contacts that are governed by these sorts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of rules.  I imagine it wouldn't be impossible to implement these ideas in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;any galaxy where there are sentients clever enough to create AGIs exist.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Golden rule 1 can guide action even if you know nothing about the other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sentients you are contacting (which means it is not a fail safe rule).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Golden Rule 2 means you need to build understanding of any sentients you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;contact before taking action that could have a potential to violate the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rule.  Golden rule 2 would require an attitude of forberance, and patience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and of careful learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;By the way, the goldern rules were invented to inject a bit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;friendliness into natural general intelligences where contact between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;non-kin or out-groups occurred - especially in larger rural and early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;urban communities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;My guess is that AGIs on earth that adhered to both these rules would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;at least a basic level of friendliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Cheers, Philip
