<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Norm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What you're pointing out is basically the (in)famous &quot;hard problem of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness&quot;, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I addressed this in an essay a while back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wow, I thought I was reading Marc Geddes there.  :)  But seriously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you've presented a lot of ideas without any method of verification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, that is not really true...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's true that I don't describe specific experiments in that essay -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that essay contains a combination of purely philosophical content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (unverifiable like all pure philosophy is) and philosophy-guided scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance, that essay contains the hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the brain processes associated with consciousness will be the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes associated with representing newly perceived or conceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns, enacting new patterns, or taking pattern-codes out of memory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reassembling them into patterns once again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;
</em><br>
<p>Setting aside the fact that your definition of &quot;patterns&quot; is rather
<br>
vague, that says nothing about &quot;qualia.&quot;  A physiologist could measure
<br>
all that and verify it from an eliminativist perspective (with some
<br>
materialist definition of patterns).  You have to demonstrate that
<br>
qualia can be detected from outside the system.  They can't be.  They
<br>
don't exist.  There is no way that we could infer &quot;redness&quot; from any
<br>
empirical observations if we didn't experience it ourselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then you can think of this as a scientific hypothesis about *verbal reports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of consciousness* among humans, and you can dodge the question of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;verbal reports of consciousness&quot; relate to any kind of &quot;real qualia.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if the hypothesis of qualia is found to consistently suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific hypotheses that wind up to be validated by experiment [and I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this hasn't happened yet, but the science of consciousness is still very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young], then this would seem to be some sort of justification for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This latter sentence is in fact an argument that qualia may be roughly as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;real&quot; as electrons, or trees, are.  The electron is a fictitious entity --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's a way of organizing data from various instruments, and assuming it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists helps us to generate a lot of valid hypotheses.  So we talk as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrons are real when in fact all there are, are patterns.  The same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument in fact applies to trees.  Electrons, trees and qualia are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts that we create in order to organize the patterns we experience.
</em><br>
<p>Ugh.  This sounds just like Robert Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality
<br>
nonsense (just substitute &quot;patterns&quot; or &quot;qualia&quot; for &quot;quality&quot;), which
<br>
isn't surprising since he too drew heavily from Charles Pierce.  (I
<br>
should know something about that:  just google my name and &quot;MoQ&quot;.) 
<br>
Get off this train of thought while you still can.
<br>
<p>**Assuming** the electron exists?  If a bear walks into a cave, I
<br>
don't have to substitute a &quot;pattern&quot; token in its place to do anything
<br>
useful with the information.  Inference is about finding out **what's
<br>
really there** from indirect evidence.  Patterns, like quality, are
<br>
just an obfuscation.
<br>
<p>Your faithful Dennett-oid,
<br>
Martin
