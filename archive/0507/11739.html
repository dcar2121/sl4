<p>Can you explain this a bit more? There's a specific scenario I have in
<br>
mind. The AI is created to determine the CEV of humanity, and it
<br>
decides that the CEV is to make a large number of different societies
<br>
run on different principles, some of which are insulated from the
<br>
others. Do you admit that this scenario is possible? Do you think that
<br>
CV inevitably leads to a single society in which certain overbearing
<br>
moral principles are absolute? Because it seems to me that it's
<br>
extremely unlikely for a non-broken CV AI to decide that humanity's
<br>
CEV is that every thought, word, and deed be controlled according to
<br>
this or that moral system. Unless you can show that this is an
<br>
inherent property in CV (what you seem to be arguing) or that it's
<br>
somehow the most likely CEV of humanity as you see it, then this rings
<br>
hollow to me. Does the very existence of an AI who has the ability to
<br>
determine the fate of every individual necessary entail that not one
<br>
thought, word, and deed is any longer free?
