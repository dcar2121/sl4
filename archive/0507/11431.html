Hi,
<br>
<p>Regarding the possible derivation of the details laws of objective reality
<br>
from principles regarding subjective reality, in fact I do have something
<br>
specific in mind here, but it's a line of research that I developed only to
<br>
the level of whacky speculation, and then dropped off (in the mid-1990's) in
<br>
order to focus on AGI development.
<br>
<p>The basic idea is to derive physical laws from general principles of pattern
<br>
theory.  For instance, there is a big push in fundamental physics today to
<br>
derive physical laws from abstract-algebraic structures.  So, my focus with
<br>
this work was to figure out how to derive the algebraic structures
<br>
underlying physics from abstract pattern-theoretic principles (which are
<br>
more redolent of philosophy of mind than of physics).
<br>
<p>The details get technical.  As a starting point, I wanted to prove that the
<br>
octonion algebra (which underlies a lot of physics, e.g. the Standard Model
<br>
and also some varieties of quantum gravity) is in a sense the optimal
<br>
algebra of agent interaction (meaning the optimal algebra involving the use
<br>
of a * operator along a standard + operator, where * is taken to denote the
<br>
action of one agent on another to produce a third agent).  &quot;Optimal&quot; means
<br>
&quot;has the most emergent algebraic structure as a ratio of the algorithmic
<br>
information of its rule table).
<br>
<p>This sort of argument may potentially allow one to derive physical law from
<br>
general principles like &quot;the universe starts out as a soup of patterns, and
<br>
then tries to find the most intense patterns possible&quot;.   I.e., general
<br>
patterns that can be posited in a purely subjectivist, existentialist way,
<br>
without assuming the existence of any kind of objective matter...
<br>
<p>For some old, rough speculative writing fleshing out these ideas,  see
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/books/complex/ch8.html#10">http://www.goertzel.org/books/complex/ch8.html#10</a>
<br>
<p>(leading up to the section entitled &quot;Mental-Physical Optimality Principle&quot;)
<br>
and also ee section 5 of this essay
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/papers/eventnet.html">http://www.goertzel.org/papers/eventnet.html</a>
<br>
<p>Please note that I don't necessarily agree with the details that I wrote
<br>
back then, anymore.  But I still think that train of thought may have some
<br>
merit -- though to turn it anything really powerful and scientific would
<br>
require years of hard work, and I have other priorities right now.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Re: Objective versus subjective reality: which is primary?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this point gives rise to an interesting asymmetry. While it's easier
<br>
to explain the existence of objective reality based on subjective reality
<br>
than vice versa, it seems like it's probably easier to explain the details
<br>
of subjective reality based on objective reality than vice versa. Of course,
<br>
this is largely speculative, since right now we don't know how to do
<br>
either -- we can't explain particle physics based on subjectivist
<br>
developmental psychology, but nor can we explain the nature of conscious
<br>
experience based on brain function. However, my intuition is that the latter
<br>
is an easier task, and will be achieved sooner.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the former possible at all? Or, alternatively, haven't we already
<br>
done it? All that's necessary to explain particle physics starting with
<br>
subjective reality is to formulate a theory of objective reality from
<br>
subjective experience and go from there. Or did you have something
<br>
fundamentally different in mind? I have a hard time visualizing what it
<br>
would be.
