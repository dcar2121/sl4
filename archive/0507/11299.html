<em>&gt; *sigh* I've argued the case for objective morality on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist lists for years.  No one listens.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually my arguments have been growing stronger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About 1-2 months ago my theory took a quantum leap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still nothing water-tight though.  I've stopped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating it because I can see that only a precise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical theory with all the t's crossed and i's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dotted is going to convince this crowd.  Ah well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To cut a long theory short…
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the goal system constrains the intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level.  An unfriendly cannot exceed a certain level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smartness.  Only a friendly can undergo unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improvement.  Past a certain level of smartness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm hoping  an unfriendly goal system will always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *jammed* by computational intractability/instability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or both.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're clearly right to say that the goal system can constrain
<br>
the intelligence. It just seems obvious - if you have a set of goals
<br>
which does not encourage you to move towards the relevant maxima, you
<br>
will never reach said maxima.
<br>
<p>Whether there is any necessary link between morality and the goal
<br>
system is another thing, and would probably take both a formal
<br>
definition of morality, and some kind of explication of possible goal
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>It seems at least logically coherent to suggest that a moral agent
<br>
might be able to achieve greater intelligence than an immoral one by
<br>
virtue of being able to reach different configurations.
<br>
<p>It is equally logically coherent to suggest the reverse.
<br>
<p>It seems like an objective human morality is at least defensible, as I
<br>
alluded to. You might consider what arguments for an objective human
<br>
morality might transfer to a transhuman morality.
<br>
<p>You also need to establish a positive link between morality and
<br>
intelligent configurations. Plenty of philosophers (objectivists for
<br>
example) have argued that morality is earthed in rational principles.
<br>
The fundamental system is hedonistic - the maximisation of whatever
<br>
virtues the system considers as good in their own right - as ultimate
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p>I think in order to establish your position, you need to identify
<br>
what, if any, ultimate goals will lead to the most intelligent
<br>
configurations.
<br>
<p>Even if people here aren't interested in the groundwork for that
<br>
argument, they might be interested in the final product.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
