<p><em>&gt; &gt; You have to demonstrate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; qualia can be detected from outside the system.  They can't be.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly, my reaction to this statement of yours is about the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your initial reaction to my paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, in these sentences, you seem to me to be stringing together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words in a completely meaningless, empty and useless way ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Empty and useless?  Then I guess the entire scientific method is empty
<br>
and useless.  My statement reformulated the same clear premise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, what you do here is to implicitly define &quot;exist&quot; in a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules out qualia, and then say qualia don't exist.  Big deal!  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting question is: what is the right definition of &quot;exist&quot; ...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it also rules out invisible pink unicorns.  And until you can put
<br>
forth a reasoned and recurrently verifiable way to distinguish between
<br>
the two from an objective perspective, I can continue to treat them as
<br>
the same kind of thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is no way that we could infer &quot;redness&quot; from any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empirical observations if we didn't experience it ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not certain this is true, you certainly haven't proved it.
</em><br>
<p>I can't prove it any more than I can prove invisible pink unicorns
<br>
don't exist.  It's a matter of induction.  Once I've made the same
<br>
observation enough times, I can make a confident (albeit temporary)
<br>
conclusion.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **Assuming** the electron exists?  If a bear walks into a cave, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't have to substitute a &quot;pattern&quot; token in its place to do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful with the information.  Inference is about finding out **what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really there** from indirect evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, inference is about inferring propositions from other propositions, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact.  This is standard logic.  The definition of inference has nothing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with any theory of &quot;reality&quot;, unless your theory is that reality consists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of logical propositions (as in John Wheeler's &quot;it from bit&quot; approach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum-gravity pregeometry...)
</em><br>
<p>That's the definition of inference within the narrow domain of
<br>
propositional calculus.  Think beyond that.
<br>
<p>Cf.: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=inference">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=inference</a>
<br>
<p>I was using 1.b.
<br>
<p>Anyway, since you admit it was only a first draft, perhaps I shouldn't
<br>
be so hard on you.  I look forward to your new thoughts on the
<br>
subject.
<br>
<p>Martin
