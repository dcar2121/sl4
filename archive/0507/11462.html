Geez! WHAT are the odds of THAT! How likely is it that an inhumanly 
<br>
persuasive mind could find, somewhere on the planet Earth, a person willing to 
<br>
follow phoned instructions about mixing couriered test tubes, in exchange for 
<br>
a million dollars and a sob cover story about a dying twelve-year-old girl who 
<br>
needs a cure in the next 48 hours?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we save this dying girl?  Yes, there might be a single-digit % of the population which would be duped by such a scheme, and a smaller subset who would volunteer to (though this # is growing in some ares of the world).  But there would be many who would call the authorities and an even smaller subset who might suspect what is really going on.  UFAI would no doubt, select people it had data-mined as being more susceptible to serving it, but these people could also be flagged by intelligence agencies and telecom companies.  The idea being, to get the UFAI warnings spread to a significant fraction of the world's population of potential unknowing servants.  The AI could put out contracts, or otherwise have persons who deny to aid it, killed.  But the bodies would pile up.  The &quot;Don't aid UFAI through telecommunications&quot; warning could be spread as spam, a benign computer virus, by telecommunications to customers; all media.  Maybe even tool-AI monitoring of as many
<br>
&nbsp;telecommunications as possible.  If the ratio of compliant to uncomplaint AI-contacts can be made low enough, this method of exterminating humans might not be a sure enough bet for UFAI to attempt.  By monitoring our telecommunications, spreading the risks of unknowingly aiding UFAI, shadowing potential UFAI human accomplices, and keeping close tabs on key industrial infrastructures, we might buy enough time to beat UFAI with FAI or MM.
