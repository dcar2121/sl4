<em>&gt; Science is a materialist system, like it or not. Either you claim that minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not objects of scientific study (and there's still plenty of room for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialist work here) or you claim that science must accept a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phlogistum (sp?) without it making any predictions, which is bad form in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science. This is why materialist explanations can get away with not bringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence yet, they don't possit any extra stuff.
</em><br>
<p>It's possibly my fault in arguing -- but I think the materialist
<br>
position is different to science. The materialist position is that
<br>
everything which exists is material.
<br>
<p>Science is a process based, ultimately, on predictiveness.
<br>
<p>If materialist science cannot be predictive with respect to the the
<br>
mind, but continues to deny the distinction between the mind and the
<br>
brain, then there would appear to be good reason to expand ones
<br>
ontology.
<br>
<p>I don't think we have good enough physics to say conclusive things
<br>
about minds and brains, so we can't reject a non-materialist
<br>
description of the mind out-of-hand.
<br>
<p>I think I would be forced to distastefully accept the materialist
<br>
position if it did prove to have perfect predictive ability with
<br>
respect to *both* physical and mental descriptions of the mind-brain.
<br>
<p>I believe that science will need to undergo some expansion before it
<br>
can properly describe mental reality, and I think that expansion will
<br>
address my concerns.
<br>
<p>My chief concern being that it would be possible to build a physical
<br>
mimic of intelligence without actually reproducing the mind. i.e. it
<br>
would be possible to build a zombie-brain, which has some
<br>
intelligence, but which has neither a mental life, nor does the
<br>
physics underlying its rules have any description of mental life.
<br>
<p>I hope you see what I'm saying. I'm not anti-scientific - I really
<br>
want to hold that minds are reducible to *some* brains, but I don't
<br>
think it's true that *all* brains will give rise to minds. And we need
<br>
a scientific description of that difference.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
