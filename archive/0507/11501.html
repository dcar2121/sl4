&nbsp;what poses the bigger risk: an AI with a mind of its own, or

<em>&gt;&gt; one that doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What are specific risks that a run-of-the-mill AGI poses?

<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a more realistic alternative to paperclips, consider the possibility of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superhuman AI that holds &quot;advancing science, mathematics and technology&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its ultimate goal.  Such an AI might well want to pulverize humans so as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use their mass-energy as computing material that will lead it to greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discoveries and inventions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Consider the phase space of AI design's lacking a self-reflective or 
<br>
conscious general intelligence to be much larger than that of AGI's exibiting 
<br>
the general qualities deemable of being &quot;a mind of its own&quot;. My intuition 
<br>
having relatively little knowledge of the cognitive problems associated with 
<br>
general intelligence is that the mindless but efficient, goal-driven AI design 
<br>
space is much bigger than the mindful reflective goal-driven AGI space. A 
<br>
mindless AI might brute-force Ben's examples of a sience goal or happiness 
<br>
goal without requiring the trappings of consciousness, computroniumizing us 
<br>
all in the process, but a mindful, adaptive, reflective AGI might do exactly 
<br>
the same after much subjective deliberation. The question comes down to: which 
<br>
region of design space does Friendliness stand a better chance of surviving 
<br>
recursive-self improvment? I've had the idea (for the sake of example) that 
<br>
Friendliness involves empathy, which involves an inclusive self-plex. A 
<br>
mindless AI could turn this into something of an empathy hack, simply 
<br>
associating a string labeled &quot;Self&quot; with everything object it can process, 
<br>
while a legitimate mind stands a much better chance of extrapolating the 
<br>
empathy measure into stronger internal Friendliness as its design improves 
<br>
into greater complexity. So my proposed answer to Peter's question is an AI 
<br>
having a mind is less risky than otherwise. At the least, I'd find my death in 
<br>
the face of global apocalypse much more interesting if I knew its perpetrator 
<br>
had some really well reasoned motivations behind the slaughter, rather than 
<br>
just some blind replicatory optimization process.
