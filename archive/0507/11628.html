<p>Size, in thise case, presumably being the complexity of the

computations done by the machine, not the size of the data that it

works on. It would only model the physical laws that govern the
<br>
universe, and start with some set of data describing the conditions at
<br>
the big bang that we don't count against its size. Otherwise, the
<br>
simplest machine would be one which randomly comes up with new things
<br>
to introduce to the Cartesian Theater of our subjectivity that happen
<br>
to rationally agree with everything the individual person knows at the
<br>
time. In other words, life is just a dream. Because then the machine
<br>
doesn't have to bother modeling the rest of the universe (which we
<br>
assume a machine modeling objective reality would do) which would
<br>
probably vastly simplify the size of the machine.
