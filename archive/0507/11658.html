<p><em>&gt; &gt; I plug symbolic data gleaned from sensory modality, if my sensory modality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were to change, say in a simulated (or subjectively real) universe with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different physics regarding just photon dynamics, would my symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interpretations become radically different from all prior earthly ontologies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Would my rational structures cease to be useful and be discarded? 
</em><br>
<p>I get what you are saying about sensory modalities. It is a
<br>
fascination point. Furthermore, I would argue that it is not out of
<br>
the realms of empirical testing.
<br>
<p>I was reading about someone who was attaching an electrode grid to the
<br>
surface of skin, and re-creating the voltage pattern given by the eyes
<br>
in response to various stimuli, including visual stimuli. This was in
<br>
New Scientist, and seemed to be legitimate. Success was reported in
<br>
vision assistance, balance, even touch data. It was absolutely
<br>
fascinating. Moreover, it sounded like an interface  that any
<br>
moderately skilled engineer could re-create, and the software to drive
<br>
it sounded doable also.
<br>
<p>It would be a fascinating exercise to attempt to learn new sensory
<br>
modalities using just such a device.
<br>
<p>I would say that some of our rational structures would remain. I
<br>
believe in the specialness of qualia, the universal correctness of
<br>
basic logic, and that consciousness is generally enhanced by
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eh? What about emotion is so special that it would require anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a Turing machine to implement as part of an GAI? (That begs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question of whether it's even desirable for Friendliness. That one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be emphatically NO.) How would quantum computing help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything?
</em><br>
<p>Allow me to respond to this entirely out-of-context, as this was a
<br>
debating point against something I didn't stay. Rather, let me pose a
<br>
thought experiment to you.
<br>
<p>An intelligent scientist in the future is born on, and living in a
<br>
space ship. The inside of the spaceship is not devoid of light, but
<br>
the colouring of all the internal surfaces happens to be
<br>
black-and-white in appearance. However, she has a huge amount of
<br>
information about physics. In this experiment, she is not capable of
<br>
reproducing anything that is coloured for her to see, but she is able
<br>
intellectually to fully understand the nature of light, its effects on
<br>
the human eyeball, brain, nervous system etc.
<br>
<p>One day she lands on Earth at the end of her mission. Upon opening the
<br>
hatch, she casts her eyes first on an enormous bunch of red roses
<br>
which have been given to her.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh&quot;, she says, &quot;so that's what it's like&quot;.
<br>
<p>Has she learnt anything new about colour? If you accept that she has,
<br>
then qualia must be real, because she already knew everything that
<br>
science could inform her about the world and about colour. There must,
<br>
therefore, be something real about colour which is not addressed by
<br>
science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't quite understand what kind of threat you could see concerning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI suddenly understanding a different ontology and going crazy. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely would this be?
</em><br>
<p>The quote marks indicate that you are replying to me, but in fact I
<br>
didn't suggest this.
<br>
<p>Just to be clear on the matter.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
-T
