<p>Unfortunately, the bootstrap curve for seed AI seems steep enough that 
<br>
by the time an emergent UFAI is noticed, it's very likely time has 
<br>
already run out.  Ruling out the possibility of a false alarm and 
<br>
confirming that the emerging seed is unFriendly would take even more 
<br>
time.  Remember that a bootstrapping AI will most probably be thinking 
<br>
and acting very rapidly compared to humans - one second of human time 
<br>
could be equivalent to millions of years of time from the AI's point of 
<br>
view, plenty of time to consider strategies for wiping out all the 
<br>
opposition.  Of course there is also the problem of smartness - a 
<br>
smarter-than-human AI running at human thinking speed would still be 
<br>
very likely to overwhelm all opposition or seemingly clever plans to 
<br>
stop it.
<br>
<p>On the idea of UFAI markers - if we had a comprehensive set of UFAI 
<br>
markers, then we'd have enough knowledge to create a FAI simply by 
<br>
building an AI that lacked those markers.  Part of the difficulty facing 
<br>
us is that UFAI isn't an isolated special case of seed AI - it's the 
<br>
norm.  Creating a *Friendly* AI means narrowing down the state space 
<br>
enough to find a dynamic we can coexist with even if that dynamic is 
<br>
applying near-asmyptotic optimization pressure on its environment.  This 
<br>
specific type of dynamic seems rare and clear-cut enough that it's 
<br>
dangerous to use terms like &quot;99% safe&quot; with respect to AI - in my 
<br>
current mental picture, an AI is either Friendly or it isn't.  Anything 
<br>
not thoroughly verified as Friendly should be regarded as an danger to 
<br>
the planet.
<br>
<p>The idea of using a prehuman Friendly AI as an ally in performing tasks 
<br>
is an interesting one, though.  Even a very dumb FAI might be able to 
<br>
produce ideas that would be fantastically useful to us.  Most intriguing 
<br>
would be the idea of using a prehuman FAI to assist in creating a 
<br>
smarter FAI.  Given a codic modality early, a sufficiently intelligent 
<br>
Friendly AI might have more insight into its own workings than even the 
<br>
most skilled of FAI programmers.  Of course the road to this point is 
<br>
sure to be long and hard.
