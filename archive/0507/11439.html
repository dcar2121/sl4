<p>Your total body of sensory data is a string, S. Find the smallest java
<br>
program, which, without any external input, will print the string S. The
<br>
program may print other stuff after printing S, but it may not print
<br>
anything before S.
<br>
<p>A program which simply generates every possible string will fail,
<br>
because it also has to locate S within that vast mess, and specifying
<br>
the location of S will take approximately as many bits as S itself
<br>
contains.
