<p>
I hope I finish this reply before the thread gets killed, unlike last time.
<br>
<p>Let us start with some epistemological basics. In contemporary philosophy of 
<br>
mind, qualia are often discussed as if they were a sort of afterthought to 
<br>
the material universe, the debate being over the alleged necessity or even 
<br>
just the reasonableness of positing such extra entities.
<br>
<p>However, epistemologically, qualia are the starting point, and the material 
<br>
universe is the thing posited. For example, my present visual sensory 
<br>
manifold consists of a continuum of colored forms, which I interpret as 
<br>
objects in three-dimensional space, and about which I make many further 
<br>
assumptions. Those assumptions may or may not be correct, but there is no 
<br>
point in denying the existence of the colored forms themselves, at least if 
<br>
I am interested in reality.
<br>
<p>It should be equally obvious that a patch of color cannot be the same thing 
<br>
as a configuration of colorless particles in space. I ask you to conceive of 
<br>
point particles possessing a specified mass, a specified charge, a specified 
<br>
location, and no other properties. Sprinkle them about in space as you will, 
<br>
you will not create a 'sensation of color'. Equip them with a certain 
<br>
dynamics, and you may be able to construct an 'environment with properties' 
<br>
and a 'stimulus classifier'; name some of those environmental properties 
<br>
'colors' and some of the classifier's states 'sensations of color', and you 
<br>
may be able to mimic the apparent causal relations between our environment 
<br>
and our sensations of color; but the possible world you have thereby 
<br>
specified does not contain sensations of color as we know them, and 
<br>
therefore cannot be the world we are inhabiting.
<br>
<p>In fact, the class of possible worlds presently contemplated in fundamental 
<br>
physics - that is, those taken seriously as candidate descriptions of the 
<br>
world we are inhabiting - is extrapolated from an ontological base 
<br>
originally constructed by exclusion of so-called 'secondary properties' such 
<br>
as color and pitch from consideration. Theoretical understanding of the 
<br>
residual properties (notably quantity, spatial location, and process) has 
<br>
been extensively developed (under the formal titles of algebra, geometry, 
<br>
and dynamics), and present physical theory relies almost exclusively on 
<br>
these disciplines for its concepts. As a result, we are rather good at 
<br>
describing and predicting the motions of things in space, but we are at a 
<br>
loss almost everywhere else.
<br>
<p>This would be a purely philosophical conundrum were it not for information 
<br>
technology, which in its microphysical particulars is a fruit of that same 
<br>
success in understanding matter in motion. We are faced, not just with a 
<br>
self-denying sensibility which wishes to assert that colorless matter in 
<br>
motion is all that exists (in which case the secondary properties - the 
<br>
qualia - are either mysteriously identical with certain unspecified 
<br>
conjunctive properties of large numbers of these particles, or even more 
<br>
mysteriously do not exist at all), but with the construction in the world we 
<br>
are inhabiting of imitative mechanisms like the one in the thought 
<br>
experiment. By 'imitative' I do not mean 'capable only of behaviors already 
<br>
performed by human beings'; I mean 'constructed in imitation of the apparent 
<br>
mechanisms of human beings'.
<br>
<p>My attitude to the problems of consciousness and the problems of artificial 
<br>
intelligence as discussed on this list is as follows. Mathematical physics, 
<br>
as we know it, is both an apex and a dead end. No amount of quantitative 
<br>
predictive progress through better model-building is going to explain 
<br>
consciousness, because the models in question exclude certain aspects of 
<br>
reality *by construction*. If you like, physical theory and contemporary 
<br>
technology illustrate how far you can go while operating in a mode of 
<br>
consciousness based on such exclusion. However, if we wish to actually 
<br>
understand ourselves, we need to readmit the 'secondary properties' to 
<br>
attention, and in fact everything in phenomenology that has been passed over 
<br>
as difficult to physicalize; and we are going to have to exhibit some 
<br>
philosophical imagination when it comes to ontology. Meanwhile, we have 
<br>
managed to automate the imitation of cognition, raising the possibility that 
<br>
we will create behaviorally superintelligent systems before we truly 
<br>
understand what awareness is. Dealing with this situation is a practical 
<br>
problem, and I respect the design philosophies discussed here as approaches 
<br>
to that problem, but I very definitely dissociate them from the physicalist 
<br>
theories of mind with which they tend to come packaged. To what extent AI 
<br>
theorists need to think about post-physicalist ontology is an open question; 
<br>
I suspect that there is room for division of labor, with some working on 
<br>
problems confined to the domain of algebraically/geometrically/dynamically 
<br>
describable phenomena, and others really looking at the complicated 
<br>
interplay between full-spectrum phenomenology, possible ontologies, and 
<br>
possible mind-like entities. It does seem unlikely that an AI designed 
<br>
solely to operate in that first domain will be much help with the broader 
<br>
problems, except negatively, by inadvertently demonstrating its limitations.
