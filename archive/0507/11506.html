<em>&gt;Subject: FAI/intelligent goals (was: Fighting UFAI)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Thu, 14 Jul 2005 19:13:43 +1200
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I think in order to establish your position, you need to identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;what, if any, ultimate goals will lead to the most intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;configurations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that a goal of fulfilling the goals of all other existing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent agents would lead to the most intelligent configuration. How ve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does this I'm not sure, since there would be many conflicting goals and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vis'd need to select the optimum solution, clearly very difficult. But I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not a super intelligent friendly AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course there would have to be alot of immutable constraints. I.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preserving the existance of all the agents, so that it doesn't kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone bar one person - who's goals are then fulfilled thus gaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;100% goal satisfaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Joel
</em><br>
<p><p>Obviously. Friendliness is entirely defined by human goals. Not just human 
<br>
goals, but ALL human goals.
<br>
<p>Friendly AI is simply an AI that derives all of its desire from satisfying 
<br>
ALL human goals.
<br>
<p>This inherently implies that although one human may have the goal to kill 
<br>
everyone that is American, this is in opposition with all of the Americans 
<br>
goals, thus an optimal solution must be found. Perhaps it will pull some 
<br>
strings and bring education into this American killer's life (willingly). Or 
<br>
maybe through its benevolent technologies it creates, human society will 
<br>
inherently change to such a degree that killing Americans doesn't even mean 
<br>
anything anymore.
<br>
<p>Also, it has been said that an objective morality is meaningless, because 
<br>
morality is relative. Morality is relative in the sense that one thing can 
<br>
be both bad and good depending upon the goal. However, just because good and 
<br>
bad are relative to the goal doesn't mean that it is impossible to 
<br>
understand the framework of these goals and thus determine an objective 
<br>
morality.
<br>
<p>And also, just because understanding objective morality is possible, doesn't 
<br>
mean its necessary to know for our future Friendly existence. If you can 
<br>
independently think of a scenario (the ones I think of involve some form of 
<br>
sysop) that satisfies what DEFINES objective morality, then we can all live 
<br>
in a reality that is objectively moral and Friendly without actuallying 
<br>
knowing the current state of objective morality for every decision. Our 
<br>
decisions would just be inherently bound by what is objectively moral. Like, 
<br>
uh, don't permanently end the existence of a sentient being. Or, find a way 
<br>
to do things without injusty imposing yourself.
<br>
<p>An AI with the goal system to satisfy all human goals is a possible FAI. The 
<br>
only possible way it could go wrong is through overconfidence (in its 
<br>
actions, understanding, or feelings).
