In defense of the dissenter; sure, he has crappy logic, but I find him in a 
<br>
role more dignified than mere canary, Geddes is a holistic thinking contrarian 
<br>
on a list dominated by reductive logical positivists. If a movie were made 
<br>
about the intellectual tribulations of this movement, Geddes would be the guy 
<br>
that gets the cliched slow clap going at a moment of high emotion and poetry. 
<br>
That clap might serve to rally the masses to a counter-productive 
<br>
anthropomorphic attitude, but hey, thats entertainment.

<p><em>&gt;===== Original Message From &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=RE:%20On%20Geddes">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt; 
</em><br>
=====
<br>
<em>&gt;A few people have asked me why I haven't removed Marc Geddes from the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;First, he doesn't swear at people and he spells correctly.  This counts for 
</em><br>
*a
<br>
<em>&gt;lot* in whether someone stays on SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Second, when someone obeys basic netiquette, I am biased against rejecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them from the list because their opinions conflict with mine.  There's some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;known phenomena in social psychology that say:  Leave the outliers in!  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they are valuable in their own right, but their presence shows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dissent is tolerated, and mainstream people feel freer to express opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that leave the mainstream.  If Geddes were not the list oddball, someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be, and then people would ask why that person was still on the list, 
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt;then when that person was gone, someone else would be the list oddball...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Third, Geddes makes a good, *clear* example of how *not* to do things.  Fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious posters have appealed to intuition to support their statements on AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since Geddes made &quot;intuition&quot; look very silly, showing it could be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support completely arbitrary assertions.  I still wish that people understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*why* &quot;intuition&quot; is a poor way of arguing, but failing that, it's better 
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;they think the argument will make them look silly.  &quot;Not *looking* stupid&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the closest thing most people have to a grasp on rationality, and Geddes 
</em><br>
helps
<br>
<em>&gt;make &quot;intuition&quot; *look* stupid.  Geddes has also helped show the folly of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believing that you understand everything but not being able to express it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematically, like those other guys can who are admittedly clever but alas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not so intuitively gifted as Geddes; may this encourage us all to study the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;math.  I realized that I could not get away with calling Bayesian probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory &quot;the Way of cutting through to the correct answer&quot;; it was nice 
</em><br>
poetry,
<br>
<em>&gt;but Geddes rapidly appropriated &quot;The Way&quot; and started turning it into his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gibberish, which tells me the effect nice poetry has on weak minds.  Think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geddes as the SL4 List Canary.  His function is to fall over first when 
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt;start wandering into dangerous territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, I would emphasize that nobody needs to reply to Geddes's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incomprehensible screeds.  If Geddes doesn't have to work at being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comprehensible to get a response - just like I or any other author has to 
</em><br>
work
<br>
<em>&gt;at being comprehensible - then he will only wander off farther into the far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spaces, and that's not helping him.  When Geddes seems to be going completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nuts, just watch and learn what not to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
