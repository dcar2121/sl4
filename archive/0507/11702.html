<em>&gt; Combine that with a Darwinian / Adam-Smithian view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe, and it's hard to see how anything worthy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the name &quot;transhuman&quot; could operate in a way that humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not interpret as hostile.
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't seem very clear to me.  For instance, I am
<br>
generally quite benevolent to dogs, and nearly all dogs
<br>
tend to view me as such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be talking about something much smarter than humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some ways, but more limited than humans in other ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that helps ensure its safety to humans.  Do we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word for that?
</em><br>
<p>This is one possibility, but it's not proved that this is the only one.
<br>
<p>Maybe a transhuman mind can be created that is benevolent to humans
<br>
in the same way that I am benevolent to dogs.
<br>
<p>Sometimes I do things that frustrate dogs, but once they get to know me,
<br>
they always realize that I'm acting in their best interest overall, so
<br>
they accept the fact that I'll frustrate them from time to time.
<br>
<p>(Of course dogs are not as paranoid as humans on average, which is only
<br>
one among many problems with this analogy -- but I guess you get the point.)
<br>
<p>Now, dogs of course were bred by humans to trust humans....  In the case
<br>
we are now considering, it is the inferior beast (humans) that is creating
<br>
the superior beast (the transhumans) rather than vice
<br>
versa -- which is of course a far trickier situation....
