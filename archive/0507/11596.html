Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when we propose abstract goals like &quot;freedom, joy and growth&quot; ........
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever, we are using terms that are not precisely defined -- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are...defined only in terms of the whole human culture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human psychology. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ......
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if we're going to recommend to an alien civilization that it adopt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some goals we make up, we should remember that the alien civilization may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not actually have terms or concepts like our &quot;freedom&quot; , &quot;joy&quot;, &quot;growth&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;peace&quot;, etc.  In order to explain what our goals mean to the aliens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll need to steep them in the wonderful peculiarities of human culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and human individual and collective psychology.
</em><br>
<p>I think this helps to illustrate my point that taking the perspective of 'advising 
<br>
another galaxy&quot; is valuable is sharpening up the needs and dilemmas.
<br>
<p>Just as sentient beings in another galaxy might have goals or aspirations 
<br>
that we don't share, so not all humans share the same goals and neither 
<br>
most likely will the AGIs they create.
<br>
<p>So it seems very likely to me that AGIs everywhere throughout the universe 
<br>
will have non-uniform initial goal sets.
<br>
<p>But the issue of friendliness or at least tolerance still remains.  If a flock of 
<br>
AGIs from various galaxies were to decend on Earth what 
<br>
friendliness/tolerance codes would we like these AGIs to adhere to - in 
<br>
relation to us and the other living things on Earth? If we are to be ethical in 
<br>
our dealings with sentients in other galaxies what friendliness/tolerance 
<br>
codes should we build into the AGIs that we create?
<br>
<p>I don't think it's a coincidence that golden rules are common in the most 
<br>
widespread human philosophies eg.  &quot;do unto other as you would have 
<br>
them do unto you&quot; (golden rule 1) or &quot;don't do unto others what they would 
<br>
have you not do unto them&quot; (golden rule 2).  Things seem to work 
<br>
reasonably well when diverse cultures have contacts that are governed by 
<br>
these sorts of rules.  I imagine it wouldn't be impossible to implement these 
<br>
ideas in any galaxy where there are sentients clever enough to create AGIs 
<br>
exist.  Golden rule 1 can guide action even if you know nothing about the 
<br>
other sentients you are contacting (which means it is not a fail safe rule).  
<br>
Golden Rule 2 means you need to build understanding of any sentients you 
<br>
contact before taking action that could have a potential to violate the rule.  
<br>
Golden rule 2 would require an attitude of forberance, and patience and of 
<br>
careful learning.
<br>
<p>By the way, the goldern rules were invented to inject a bit of friendliness into 
<br>
natural general intelligences where contact between non-kin or out-groups 
<br>
occurred - especially in larger rural and early urban communities.
<br>
<p>My guess is that AGIs on earth that adhered to both these rules would have 
<br>
at least a basic level of friendliness.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
