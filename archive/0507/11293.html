<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is a truly intelligent AI ever going to make the kind of monumental

<em>&gt; &gt; slip-up required to decide to do something so blatantly dumb as just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cover the universe in paperclips?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Giant bug or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, it's likely to be wired pretty much the same way we are, so presumably it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will also find human females sexually attractive.&quot;
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Paperclips are not inherently a dumb idea.
</em><br>
<p>Point. But nonetheless, it seems to be a cop-out to suggest that we
<br>
can know _nothing_ about the minds of nonhuman intelligences and/or
<br>
super-intelligences.
<br>
<p>Before leaping from one example of someone who failed to consider that
<br>
a different kind of mind would be, well, different, we should try to
<br>
establish some bounds on the problem.
<br>
<p>We have access to consciousness through introspection. Can we identify
<br>
which elements of consciousness are arbitrary, and which are not? To
<br>
put it another way - can we identify which elements of ourselves might
<br>
be preserved, or perhaps even necessarily must be preserved, in
<br>
another kind of mind.
<br>
<p>Is emotion, for example, a natural byproduct of the combination of
<br>
intelligence, consciousness and experience? Perhaps it is not - but
<br>
perhaps there are some identifiable examples.
<br>
<p>What do you think? Do you think that what we have access to as
<br>
intelligent beings is not even the same kind of thing that another
<br>
intelligence might have access to? Does it make sense to call FAI
<br>
intelligent if the mind cannot be in any sensible way called &quot;the
<br>
same&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I know people have posed race conditions between FAI and paperclips,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but there seems to me to be a kind of contradiction inherent in any AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which is intelligent enough to achieve one of these worst-case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outcomes, but is still capable of making stupid mistakes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actions are only &quot;stupid mistakes&quot; relative to a cognitive reference frame.
</em><br>
<p>Partial point. Obviously irrationality is irrationality however you
<br>
slice it. I don't care who you are, (A -&gt; B) -&gt; (!B -&gt; !A) is going to
<br>
stay a logical law. But you rightly didn't respond like that, my point
<br>
was the &quot;stupidity&quot;, the disconnect between the logic and the sense if
<br>
you will, of being able to formulate paperclips as a goal, and
<br>
believing it to be a good idea.
<br>
<p>One thing about humans - we ask existential questions. Why are we
<br>
here? What shall we do now? In a sense, human intelligence is a defeat
<br>
of instinct and of mindless goal-following. A superintelligence poses
<br>
a strange reversal. By being able to remove uncertainty, it is
<br>
supposed that in answering the questions &quot;Why am I here?&quot; and &quot;What
<br>
shall I do now?&quot;, the AI will return to a near-instinctual level of
<br>
behaviour, with deadly efficiency if it so chooses.
<br>
<p>Do you think that's a fair analysis? Some kinds of AI are scary
<br>
because they might come to a doubt-free conclusion?
<br>
<p>Or do you perhaps not think that existential questions are like that.
<br>
It might be that the greater the intelligence, the less cosmic
<br>
certainty one has. We should have the opportunity to interrogate
<br>
merely somewhat superintelligent beings about this question at some
<br>
point before singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Does it make sense that something so intelligent could have such mindless goals?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.85 billion years of natural selection was powerful enough to poof primordial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soup into peregrine falcons, a nontrivial amount of design ability.  Yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection's goals were pretty mindless from a human standpoint, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as human beings having sex with contraception is pretty stupid from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mindless standpoint of natural selection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can define an UFAI as &quot;unintelligent&quot; but it will still have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-consistent goal system that can tear apart stars.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm also willing to accept the risk-in-principle posed by advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanotech, or some kind of &quot;subverted&quot; power which destroys humanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I'm both reluctant to tag it as truly intelligent, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doubtful about the real possiblity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't matter what you call a real thing.  Definitions don't control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical outcomes.
</em><br>
<p>I thought that was the point I was making. It's worth considering the
<br>
in-principle risk of such a situation, but just because we can imagine
<br>
it, doesn't make it physically possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the real possibility, a paperclip utility function looks perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-consistent to me.  If anything it looks a lot more self-consistent than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To some extent, there is a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For example, the energy requirements might be too high to sustain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existence across the void of space. Just as lions in the sahara starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when there is no food, so being powerful is not always a survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advantage. I'm sure this point may have been up before, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know that it's a given that evil nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evil nanotech?  Evil is a term that applies to cognitive systems, not systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a particular size.  And an UFAI is not evil; it just transforms local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality according to a decision criterion that makes no internal mention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human life.
</em><br>
<p>I was just grabbing some syntactic efficiency. There was no need to
<br>
miss my point. That point was that there's a constraint problem here,
<br>
and that some of the imagined worst-case scenarios may turn out not to
<br>
be possible.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
