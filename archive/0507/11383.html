<em>&gt;&gt;The term &quot;supergoal&quot; is a word I used in the early days of writing &quot;Creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Friendly AI&quot; because I was literate enough to have heard of goals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;subgoals, but not quite literate enough to know that I should be saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;utility function&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted all this, surely the term &quot;supergoal&quot; is still useful. I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has a meaning distinct from &quot;utility function&quot;, even when it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misused. (Has it been misused in any recent posts? I haven't noticed.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whereas the utility function is the process or algorithm by which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI decides the expected utility of any given action, the supergoal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the overall direction that the AI's actions tends to bring the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be like. In a real AI system, it's possible that the utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function could be coded without ever referencing any sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal, (indeed, bringing terminology as vague and metaphorical as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;supergoal&quot; into discussions about the low-level architecture of an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably meaningless in most designs,) but &quot;supergoal&quot; can still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to describe the real-world effects of the utility function.
</em><br>
<p>No.  &quot;Decision process&quot; is the process or algorithm by which the AI ranks 
<br>
actions according to preference; or just the process that selects an action, 
<br>
if they possess no well-defined preference ordering.
<br>
<p>A &quot;utility function&quot; plays a particular role in a particular kind of algorithm 
<br>
for ordering actions.
<br>
<p>The role of a utility function is that it assigns real numbers to *outcomes*. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a predictive mechanism associates probability distributions over 
<br>
outcomes with particular actions.  (Note that this predictive mechanism is 
<br>
purely factual, purely testable and falsifiable, since it only predicts the 
<br>
probability of an outcome conditional on an action being performed.)  A real 
<br>
number is then associated with the action, the action's expectation of utility 
<br>
- &quot;expectation&quot; here having its customary mathematical sense of a weighted 
<br>
average.  This latter real number we might call &quot;expected utility&quot; and is 
<br>
quite distinct from a &quot;utility&quot; assigned by a utility function to a fixed 
<br>
outcome.  The decision system then orders preferences over actions using the 
<br>
standard ordering over the real numbers with respect to their associated 
<br>
expected utilities.  Then the decision system selects a greatest action 
<br>
(usually there will be only one greatest action).
<br>
<p>So an &quot;expected utility maximizer&quot; is an AI that predicts the probable 
<br>
consequences of actions, assigns utilities over outcomes via a utility 
<br>
function, and then chooses an action with maximal expectation of utility, that 
<br>
is, a maximal weighted average of utilities over probable outcomes.
<br>
<p>Similarly a &quot;paperclip maximizer&quot; is an AI that estimates the probable number 
<br>
of paperclips associated with different outcomes, assigns probabilities to 
<br>
outcomes given actions, and chooses an action with maximal expectation of 
<br>
paperclips.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So is this usage of supergoal valid? And since you dislike the word,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is there a less misleading word that captures this sense distinct from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;utility function&quot;? It seems that most of the words we use to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same orientation in humans (things like the &quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;meaning&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;direction&quot; of one's life) are too anthropocentric to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful. &quot;Supergoal&quot; certainly avoids this problem, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misconception it does lead to--the idea that it makes sense to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this or that goal &quot;overrides&quot; one or another goal, or that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal somehow represents a constraint on the behavior of the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of a simple specification of its behavior--might be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pernicious than the mistakes associated with more anthropocentric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminology. But if you have an ever better term, I, for one, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly use it.
</em><br>
<p>Should the AI be a good predictor, it will systematically steer reality into 
<br>
regions which its utility function assigns high utilities.  Thus, the term 
<br>
&quot;supergoal&quot; that I used in CFAI means simply &quot;utility function&quot;.  And if the 
<br>
AI is a good predictor, its utility function also serves as a good description 
<br>
of the target of the optimization process, the regions of reality into which 
<br>
the AI does in fact steer the future.
