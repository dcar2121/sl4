</em><br>
<p>Extreme-fidelity replication is easily disposed of, since many members
<br>
of the population will be _deliberately_ engaging in low-fidelity
<br>
replication - namely, self-improvement. Sure, it may be possible to
<br>
self-improve with high assurance of preserving one's goal system, but
<br>
there are going to be individuals for whom that will not be a
<br>
priority, that will accept nonpreservation of goal system for the sake
<br>
of faster replication. (This isn't hypothetical - I've seen someone on
<br>
SL4 remark that he himself, given the chance to upload, would
<br>
cheerfully ditch all vestiges of humanity and sentience in a quest to
<br>
become an optimal self-replicator.)
<br>
<p>Frequency of death is an interesting one: it comes down in large part
<br>
to whether offense ultimately beats defense. Unfortunately, the
<br>
potential existence of a weapon called the Nicoll-Dyson laser (see
<br>
Google Groups for references) appears to suggest that it does and
<br>
therefore that this condition is met.
<br>
<p>Covariance of goal system content with replication speed... I think
<br>
this is the one that offers most hope (if not met, it could mean
<br>
survival even of a botched Singularity); but it strikes me as likely
<br>
to be met. In the previous conversation, you suggested that a
<br>
replicator spending 1% of its resources on carrying a payload of
<br>
sentient life might still replicate 99% as fast as one that did not
<br>
carry such a payload... which suffices if each seed starts at a
<br>
different location.
<br>
<p>However, if they all start at the same location, then by the time the
<br>
sphere is a million light years across, optimal self-replicators have
<br>
tens of thousands of years to gobble all new resources before sentient
<br>
beings arrive.
<br>
<p>(And I _want_ someone to point out a flaw in that logic, believe me.)
