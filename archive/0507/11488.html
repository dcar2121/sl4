<em>&gt; yeah, I admit my opinion is still (mostly) intuition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that doesn't mean it's wrong.  The idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no objective morality is educated guess-work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well you know.  Why should my guess by any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be wrong than eli's guess?
</em><br>
<p>You know, you've left yourself wiiiide open there! ;)
<br>
<p>I get your argument. I however believe &lt;a
<br>
href=&quot;<a href="http://melbournephilosopher.blogspot.com/2005/07/moral-relativism.html">http://melbournephilosopher.blogspot.com/2005/07/moral-relativism.html</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
in moral relativism &lt;/a&gt;. That argument is about human moral
<br>
relativism, so I'm arguing for a bounded relativism to account for
<br>
human psychology.
<br>
<p>But I am being strongly opposed by people who believe in an objective morality.
<br>
<p>If there is an objective morality, and it's also tied to practical
<br>
success, you could be right. Have you considered the option that
<br>
objective morality /does not/ present any practical advantages after
<br>
all?
<br>
<p>You can have as much objective morality as you like, but if it's easy
<br>
to ignore, then you might find it does you no good at all when the
<br>
revolution comes... If UFAI doesn't have morality as a goal, where
<br>
morality is defined as some kind of scriptural designation of good
<br>
things and bad things, such as valuing human life, rather than being
<br>
directly tied to the pleasure principle, then we're still screwed.
<br>
<p>Plato argued for an objective morality based on the best satisfaction
<br>
of the pleasure principle, which he argued came about through
<br>
self-discipline, moderation and fulfillment. But he was still killed
<br>
by pissed off Athenians.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
