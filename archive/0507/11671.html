<p><em>&gt; &gt; Like what?  You never provided that in the earlier message.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This is actually a tricky topic...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider for instance Benjamin Libet's very interesting empirical work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free will and determinism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet</a>
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As is clear from Libet's book on his research, this work was motivated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libet's belief in qualia, and probably would not have arisen otherwise...
</em><br>
<p>Are you kidding me...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance, the description of Libet's experiment in the above-linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wikipedia page includes language like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject would be asked to note the position of the dot on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oscilloscope timer when &quot;he/she was first aware of the wish or urge to act.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we have valuable experiments that are designed by someone who thinks in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of qualia, and that make use of experimental subjects'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking-in-terms-of-qualia ...
</em><br>
<p>Libet's work is well known, but I fail to see how qualia had any
<br>
predictive value.  What hypothesis about qualia and/or the system
<br>
(mind/brain) was forged or confirmed?  When the subjects acted before
<br>
conscious awareness, or in any other experiment, these results were
<br>
surprising precisely because qualia (or any other model) FAILED to
<br>
predict them.  Further, they certainly didn't establish the existence
<br>
of said qualia.
<br>
<p>I can come up with an alternative explanation: if Libet had had a
<br>
better understanding of the synaptic organization (wire diagram) of
<br>
the brain, he could have predicted that motor execution commands
<br>
temporally precede conscious awareness (due to the lag while
<br>
sufficient neurons are recruited to establish conscious awareness: ~50
<br>
ms).  The fact that he happened to be motivated by a belief in qualia
<br>
and designed an experiment that inadvertently allowed him to discover
<br>
this phenomenon doesn't mean that the qualia themselves predicted it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; However, you could argue of course that the scientific results are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting *in spite of* the silly qualia-infested ideas of the researcher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the subjects... ;-p
</em><br>
<p>Then you admit you still haven't provided an unequivocal example of
<br>
falsifiability, explanatory power, or preditive value for qualia. :)
