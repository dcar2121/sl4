<p>Human babies might have such simple minds that a purely individual 
<br>
extrapolation of their volition would end with a superbaby pooping a billion 
<br>
diapers per second.  I, as I am right now, would not choose to take them from 
<br>
their mothers and consign them to that destiny.
<br>
<p>So you cannot presumptively ban &quot;power over others&quot; as a possible result of 
<br>
CEV, not unless you want to, on your personal authority and responsibility, 
<br>
wrench babies off what we conceive to be the track to humanity.
<br>
<p>Russell proposed letting the AI programmers hardcode, for all future 
<br>
civilization until the end of time, a definition of adulthood.  I don't think 
<br>
that's a very good solution.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it's also clear that modern-day humans enjoy meddling in 
<br>
each other's lives a great deal, so that in a democracy it's easy to get a 
<br>
vote on banning offensive speech.  Libertarians argue that banning offensive 
<br>
speech is wrong, and to this end, propose many arguments about both the actual 
<br>
consequences of banning offensive speech, the actual consequences of offensive 
<br>
speech, propositions about fair play in the realm of ideas, and inalienable 
<br>
rights and the value of personal freedom, and warnings about the undesirable 
<br>
personal consequences of allowing such a framework to exist.  I think each of 
<br>
these arguments is correct, in the sense that I would still so believe even if 
<br>
I knew more and thought faster.  If this is not true of other humans, being 
<br>
the people that they are - if, being smarter, they would yet prefer to censor 
<br>
and be censored by the force majeure of superintelligence, nor allow that any 
<br>
enterable realm of freedom should exist - then I'm not sure in what sense 
<br>
freedom of speech could be said to be what humanity wants.  At that point I'd 
<br>
end up in a genuine moral dilemma, or rather the Last Judge would, that I 
<br>
still haven't thought of any morally acceptable way to resolve.  I do know 
<br>
that it would not be morally acceptable to me, to, on my own authority, impose 
<br>
freedoms on those who would *never* wish them.
<br>
<p>In short, I think that the present fact that people vote for a lot of stupid 
<br>
things, is one of those things that we would outgrow if we could only grow up 
<br>
without destroying ourselves.
