<br>
<em>&gt; The term &quot;supergoal&quot; is a word I used in the early days of writing &quot;Creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI&quot; because I was literate enough to have heard of goals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subgoals, but not quite literate enough to know that I should be saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;utility function&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Granted all this, surely the term &quot;supergoal&quot; is still useful. I think
<br>
it has a meaning distinct from &quot;utility function&quot;, even when it's not
<br>
misused. (Has it been misused in any recent posts? I haven't noticed.)
<br>
Whereas the utility function is the process or algorithm by which the
<br>
AI decides the expected utility of any given action, the supergoal is
<br>
the overall direction that the AI's actions tends to bring the world
<br>
to be like. In a real AI system, it's possible that the utility
<br>
function could be coded without ever referencing any sort of
<br>
supergoal, (indeed, bringing terminology as vague and metaphorical as
<br>
&quot;supergoal&quot; into discussions about the low-level architecture of an AI
<br>
is probably meaningless in most designs,) but &quot;supergoal&quot; can still be
<br>
used to describe the real-world effects of the utility function.
<br>
<p>So is this usage of supergoal valid? And since you dislike the word,
<br>
is there a less misleading word that captures this sense distinct from
<br>
&quot;utility function&quot;? It seems that most of the words we use to describe
<br>
the same orientation in humans (things like the &quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;meaning&quot;,
<br>
or &quot;direction&quot; of one's life) are too anthropocentric to be more
<br>
useful. &quot;Supergoal&quot; certainly avoids this problem, and the
<br>
misconception it does lead to--the idea that it makes sense to say
<br>
this or that goal &quot;overrides&quot; one or another goal, or that the
<br>
supergoal somehow represents a constraint on the behavior of the AI
<br>
instead of a simple specification of its behavior--might be less
<br>
pernicious than the mistakes associated with more anthropocentric
<br>
terminology. But if you have an ever better term, I, for one, will
<br>
certainly use it.
