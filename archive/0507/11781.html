<em>&gt; Sort of. We're talking about &quot;the will of the '...Machine'&quot;, but being

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;From that eternal optimist, Rudyard Kipling:
<br>
<p>**
<br>
<p>Whether the State can loose and bind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Heaven as well as on Earth:
<br>
If it be wiser to kill mankind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before or after the birth--
<br>
These are matters of high concern
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where State-kept schoolmen are;
<br>
But Holy State (we have lived to learn)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endeth in Holy War.
<br>
<p>Whether The People be led by The Lord,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lured by the loudest throat:
<br>
If it be quicker to die by the sword
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cheaper to die by vote--
<br>
These are things we have dealt with once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And they will not rise from their grave)
<br>
For Holy People, however it runs,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endeth in wholly Slave.
<br>
<p>Whatsoever, for any cause,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeketh to take or give
<br>
Power above or beyond the Laws,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffer it not to live!
<br>
Holy State or Holy King--
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Holy People's Will--
<br>
Have no truck with the senseless thing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order the guns and kill!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying --after--me:--
<br>
<p>Once there was The People--Terror gave it birth;
<br>
Once there was The People and it made a Hell of Earth
<br>
Earth arose and crushed it. Listen, 0 ye slain!
<br>
Once there was The People--it shall never be again!
<br>
<p>**
<br>
<p>But there is quite a huge distinction, Russell Wallace, between asking which 
<br>
actions people choose, and asking which real-world consequences people would 
<br>
abhor upon experiencing them.  What you do not seem to realize is that even 
<br>
your horror of a dark future exists only in you, and there is nowhere but 
<br>
human beings that I can send an AI to find it.  I do not wish to be ruled over 
<br>
by The People, and there is nowhere *but* people to find such positive 
<br>
determinants of the future.
