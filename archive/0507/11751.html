<em>&gt; &gt; Can you explain this a bit more? There's a specific scenario I have in

<em>&gt; &gt; mind. The AI is created to determine the CEV of humanity, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decides that the CEV is to make a large number of different societies
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others. Do you admit that this scenario is possible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's certainly conceivable. Unfortunately I don't think it's at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely, because the historical trend has been very strongly towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more centralization of power and a tighter web of control [...].
</em><br>
<p>The only reason this is possible is that the masses of people, however
<br>
good intentioned on average, are easily manipulable. The main reason
<br>
this is the case is that they're apathetic to the concerns of
<br>
self-government. They're not involved citizens. They're appallingly
<br>
informed. (This in turn is partially because news media is
<br>
profit-driven and the most profit turning news is the most
<br>
sensationalist news, which lets political leaders run campaigns based
<br>
on fear- and prejudice-mongering. News media fail to keep the
<br>
electorate informed in a purely capitalist system.) Collective
<br>
volition has the opportunity to find out what kind of goverment people
<br>
wish they had, not just the kind they deserve. People know that
<br>
economic recessions are bad. They know that hunger and religious
<br>
oppresion are bad. The majority of people in the world don't want to
<br>
live in a theocratic state (at least if the religion is the other
<br>
guy's). If collective volition is done right, a solution that would
<br>
sound deceptively appealing if presented by a manipulative leader to
<br>
uninformed masses of people would be as obviously wrong to most people
<br>
as it is now to informed people. That global warming is occurring
<br>
would be obvious to everyone. That GWB is the worst president EVAR (if
<br>
it's the case) would be obvious. It's likely that our extrapolated
<br>
selves would warmly embrace the autonomy and humanity of large classes
<br>
of people that are currently subject to huge amounts of prejudice
<br>
and/or mutual hatred. It's possible that the extrapolation process
<br>
would eliminate the phenomenon of science being censored or
<br>
manipulated on ideological grounds. And so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (and this in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the presence of increasing intelligence, education and communication,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which suggests that extrapolating for more of these things will _not_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve the problem)
</em><br>
<p>Apathy is immune to having information available to make better
<br>
choices. Apathy makes it so they don't care. CV would not be affected
<br>
by apathy. People are remarkably self-centered and short sighted. They
<br>
live with blinders on. They only learn about, give attention to, the
<br>
things that directly affect them. National and global politics is
<br>
simply theater. But if they were informed about the relevant facts,
<br>
and asked their opinion, I think you'd see a remarkable homogeneity of
<br>
opinion, and I think that opinion would be what most existing people
<br>
would consider fairly enlightened. I think the process of
<br>
extrapolation is so fundamentally different than any sort of education
<br>
or media we have today that comparisons are pretty much moot.
<br>
<p>Not to say that doing any of this right would be easy. While I trust
<br>
the basic goodness of people, if they have the right knowledge, I
<br>
think that the process of increasing their knowledge without
<br>
programmer bias is an incredibly tricky and dangerous one. If I could
<br>
remind CV defenders of my earlier post now, where I outline how this
<br>
could happen in various ways; I think it deserves a reply or two.
