<em>&gt; Setting aside the fact that your definition of &quot;patterns&quot; is rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vague,
</em><br>
<p>That is a conceptual essay, not a rigorous scientific paper.  It was
<br>
supposed to be vague.  It is quite possible to operationalize my
<br>
mathematical definition of &quot;pattern&quot; but that requires a lot of formal
<br>
computer science stuff (the introduction of some particular universal
<br>
mathematical model like combinatory logic, etc.) which was not the point of
<br>
that conceptual paper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that says nothing about &quot;qualia.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you are right that the empirical prediction I pointed out said nothing
<br>
about &quot;qualia.&quot;  I never said it did.  What I said was that that essay of
<br>
mine contained some (admittedly not precisely formulated) empirical
<br>
predictions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A physiologist could measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all that and verify it from an eliminativist perspective (with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialist definition of patterns).
</em><br>
<p>Correct: that statement I pointed out is an empirical prediction (and
<br>
possibly a quite useful one), but is not directly relevant to the issue of
<br>
qualia.  I never said it was.
<br>
<p>It is however a prediction *motivated* by the concept of qualia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to demonstrate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia can be detected from outside the system.  They can't be.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't exist.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, my reaction to this statement of yours is about the same as
<br>
your initial reaction to my paper.
<br>
<p>In other words, in these sentences, you seem to me to be stringing together
<br>
words in a completely meaningless, empty and useless way ;-)
<br>
<p>Basically, what you do here is to implicitly define &quot;exist&quot; in a way that
<br>
rules out qualia, and then say qualia don't exist.  Big deal!  The
<br>
interesting question is: what is the right definition of &quot;exist&quot; ...
<br>
<p>More on this later...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no way that we could infer &quot;redness&quot; from any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirical observations if we didn't experience it ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>I am not certain this is true, you certainly haven't proved it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ugh.  This sounds just like Robert Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense (just substitute &quot;patterns&quot; or &quot;qualia&quot; for &quot;quality&quot;), which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't surprising since he too drew heavily from Charles Pierce.
</em><br>
<p>Peirce not Pierce, FYI
<br>
<p>I like Pirsig's work OK, but I thought his philosophy in &quot;Lila&quot; (a much
<br>
worse novel) was a lot better than in &quot;Zen in the Art of Motorcycle
<br>
Maintenance&quot; ....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; **Assuming** the electron exists?  If a bear walks into a cave, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have to substitute a &quot;pattern&quot; token in its place to do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful with the information.  Inference is about finding out **what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really there** from indirect evidence.
</em><br>
<p>No, inference is about inferring propositions from other propositions, in
<br>
fact.  This is standard logic.  The definition of inference has nothing to
<br>
do with any theory of &quot;reality&quot;, unless your theory is that reality consists
<br>
of logical propositions (as in John Wheeler's &quot;it from bit&quot; approach to
<br>
quantum-gravity pregeometry...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Patterns, like quality, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just an obfuscation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your faithful Dennett-oid,
</em><br>
<p>In fact, Dennett is a bit fan of the notion that &quot;mind is made of pattern&quot;,
<br>
I believe he has an essay in Brainstorms to this effect.  So if you believe
<br>
&quot;Patterns ... are just an obfuscation&quot;, you are not a faithful Dennett-oid,
<br>
just a Martin-oid ;-)
