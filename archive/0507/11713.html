<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is very
<br>
<em>&gt;easy to disturb.  It has a balance, it grows up with a balance, and it has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even harder time repairing that balance after puberty.  Humans are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed for radical modification.  Everything in the brain is adapted to 
</em><br>
work
<br>
<em>&gt;in the context of everything else in the brain working the way it does now.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very on point suggestion about the nature of human consciousness, 
<br>
especially after the nuerochemical rollercoster ride of puberty. I would argue 
<br>
that a human mind doesn't find true stability after puberty until they 
<br>
experience what better poets than I have called &quot;love&quot;. Love is of course a 
<br>
subjective sensation brought on by oxytocin release, but when that chemical 
<br>
function is combined with good interaction between the two parties, then the 
<br>
instability of a radically altered mind module in context with the integrated 
<br>
holistic function is brought to a more &quot;objective&quot; notion of stability by 
<br>
constrast with the instabilities of the beloved mind. In other words, I like 
<br>
girls because my shit seems inconsequential to their shit, the testosterone 
<br>
based sexuality of it not withstanding. I consider myself weakly transhuman in 
<br>
that I have awareness of my own memeome, thus being privvy to my own 
<br>
relatively retarded self-improvement, so from this experience (my life) I 
<br>
would conclude that the Friendliness of a strongly transhuman mind would 
<br>
benifit from the love of a good transwoman. The better a network of 
<br>
connections we have, the more likely our strongly transhuman augmentee will 
<br>
find his weakly transhuman bride, or at least satisfyingly complex 
<br>
intellectual discourse, such as this list. So even this threat, being one 
<br>
millionth of the severity of a badly programmed SI, is still marginalized 
<br>
under improved interaction. I'd bet if a strong transhuman did post on this 
<br>
list we'd laugh him off for being anthropomorphic, but thats another thread!
