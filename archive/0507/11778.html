<p>
Discussions of qualia tend to carry on interminably for multiple 
<br>
reasons.  One of the more elusive reasons is that we don't all share a 
<br>
clear understanding of what we mean by &quot;qualia&quot;. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* One person will argue that obviously qualia exist, as the term
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;describes the most immediate, subjective, most &quot;knowable&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience we have. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Another person will argue that qualia don't exist because there's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no physically measurable evidence of such &quot;stuff&quot; and it is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore a hypothesis bereft of any measurable significance. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Another person will argue that the term &quot;qualia&quot; is just as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaningful as most other concepts that we use and communicate, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let's not confuse the map with the territory and think qualia are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anything more than a description of a (necessarily subjective)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience.
<br>
<p>Some of these understandings will begin to show their limitations when 
<br>
exposed to a larger context, asking *who* is this &quot;self&quot; that is 
<br>
understood to be &quot;experiencing&quot; the qualia. For a &quot;self&quot; to &quot;experience 
<br>
qualia&quot; requires that the self be apart from the qualia being 
<br>
experienced, and thus contradiction quickly arises.
<br>
<p>Any system with a model of itself within its environment that can report 
<br>
on this internal model can be demonstrated to have qualia essentially 
<br>
the same in any measurable way to yours and mine.  The only way you have 
<br>
to know your own subjective experience is by interrogating that very 
<br>
same system. It only looks special from within the system.
<br>
<p>We look around us, and the behavior of the rest of the world including 
<br>
all the other humans like us seems explainable in non-mysterious terms, 
<br>
but because our perception--from within the system--seems so vivid, so 
<br>
immediate, so real, and because at a very basic level we are built to 
<br>
protect the &quot;self&quot;, and raised in a culture where our interactions with 
<br>
others reinforce the illusion of self, we feel deep down in our souls 
<br>
selves minds that there must be something special going on.
