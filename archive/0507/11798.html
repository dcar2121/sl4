<p>
<em>&gt; It's possibly my fault in arguing -- but I think the materialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position is different to science. The materialist position is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything which exists is material.
</em><br>
<p>OK, perhaps we're using material and materialism in a slightly different
<br>
manner. By material I mean ameanable to be perceived by the senses, or by
<br>
constructed sensors. This is, non-spiritual.
<br>
<p>Science depends on empirical experiments to be able to provide data for
<br>
inference. If there's something non-material in the sense I mean,
<br>
observation and experimentation will not tell us ought about it, and it is
<br>
therefore ipso facto outside of science. If the mind is something that is
<br>
only, for example, ameanable to subjective phenomenological discursive
<br>
study, and it cannot be aprehended through the usual tools of science, id
<br>
est, sensors, models, etc, then the game is over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If materialist science cannot be predictive with respect to the the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, but continues to deny the distinction between the mind and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, then there would appear to be good reason to expand ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ontology.
</em><br>
<p>Not before the present research program finds clear obstacles. For now we
<br>
neither have the computational power nor the physiological knowledge to make
<br>
high-level predictions about the mind from its physical substrate, but
<br>
progress (or what seems like progress) is done in this area all the time,
<br>
and there's still room. If in a few years we come to a standstill and we
<br>
verify that, indeed, the stuff we can measure with our apparatus is no
<br>
longer useful to make further higher-level predictions, then we should
<br>
consider alternative explanations of the phenomenon of consciousness, the
<br>
mind, etc. For the time being though, it would be unwarranted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think we have good enough physics to say conclusive things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about minds and brains, so we can't reject a non-materialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the mind out-of-hand.
</em><br>
<p>That much is probably the case, although I'm not entirely sure. But neither
<br>
can we say that the materialist way has been exhausted and a non-materialist
<br>
explanation is now inevitable. Until this comes to pass, the parsimonious
<br>
and standard thing to do is not to introduced new unnecessary (until now)
<br>
entities into the theories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that science will need to undergo some expansion before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can properly describe mental reality, and I think that expansion will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address my concerns.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that materialism is essentially correct about the mind, but that
<br>
tractable high-level explanations of mental phenomena might require of
<br>
things such as qualia, not because they have any ontological significance
<br>
but because they greatly reduce the complexity and act as good encapsulators
<br>
of it, such as flows, which are hardly ever described in terms of their
<br>
constituent molecules, but at higher organizational levels, due to
<br>
tractability issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My chief concern being that it would be possible to build a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mimic of intelligence without actually reproducing the mind. i.e. it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be possible to build a zombie-brain, which has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, but which has neither a mental life, nor does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics underlying its rules have any description of mental life.
</em><br>
<p>You have zero evidence for this. In my opinion it is impossible, but
<br>
opinions are like....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope you see what I'm saying. I'm not anti-scientific - I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to hold that minds are reducible to *some* brains, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's true that *all* brains will give rise to minds. And we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a scientific description of that difference.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, what is there to a mind but information processing? Are you in the
<br>
&quot;brains have some special physical substrate that imbues them with
<br>
mind-ness&quot; camp? If info processing is all there is to it (as it seems) that
<br>
still does not indicate that all mind-seeming processes are minds as we
<br>
would understand them, but if the information processing is identical or
<br>
substantially similar to that of a known mind, then what doubt can there be?
<br>
<p>--David.
