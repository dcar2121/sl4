<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Looking at the responses, I think several people haven't actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously considered a materialist analysis of subjective sensation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, they have the general notion that it's all biology and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, but they haven't considered what sort of intermediate detail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is or what the corresponding causal mechanisms might look like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I admitt that if I hadn't thought about this detail the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience is something special/nonphysical/noncomputable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seem more plausible.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not sure about others, but I know that both Mitchell Porter and I
<br>
have thought these things through in a lot of detail, over a period of
<br>
decades.
<br>
<p>My position is a bit different than Mitchell's, though a bit closer to his
<br>
than to yours.  Mitch seems a bit more of a conventional quale-iac, whereas
<br>
I have crafted a more peculiar view that walks a middle line (though it was
<br>
not devised with the intention of walking a middle line -- it was devised to
<br>
be correct, and just happened to work out to be a &quot;middle path&quot;, just as
<br>
Novamente happened to work out to be a sort of middle path between
<br>
connectionism and symbolic AI.)
<br>
<p>Like you, I *do* think there is an empirical, scientific (I won't say
<br>
&quot;mechanistic&quot; due to quantum weirdness) explanation of the behaviors and
<br>
utterances of beings like humans (and future AI's) that claim to be
<br>
conscious and have qualia.  I think one can formulate this explanation in
<br>
terms that don't involve qualia, awareness, and the like.  Modern science
<br>
doesn't have all the details worked out yet, but I'm pretty confident they
<br>
will be.
<br>
<p>However, this does *not* indicate to me that qualia are meaningless,
<br>
nonexistent, yadda yadda.
<br>
<p>I think that, as science develops further, we will find that theories
<br>
involving qualia form a far *simpler* way of explaining the behaviors and
<br>
utterances of beings-that-claim-to-be-conscious-and-have-qualia than
<br>
theories that don't involve qualia.
<br>
<p>Thus, I think that as future science unfolds, even die-hard materialists
<br>
will have to admit that qualia have at least the same sort of &quot;reality&quot; that
<br>
electrons do.
<br>
<p>Also, I think that future science will allow us to BEGIN with some plausible
<br>
assumptions about qualia, and then DERIVE the mathematics of the physical
<br>
world therefrom.  I.e., to explain apparent objectivity in terms of
<br>
subjectivity; just as future neuroscience will allow us to explain
<br>
subjectivity in terms of objectivity.
<br>
<p>Overall, you can see that my belief in the reality and interestingness of
<br>
qualia is not due to a lack of careful thinking about the potential power of
<br>
physical explanations to account for the particulars of reported subjective
<br>
phenomena.  I just don't think these physical explanations, even when
<br>
complete, will tell the whole story.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I'd like to note that, while my hypothesized &quot;explanation of
<br>
physics in terms of qualia&quot; and &quot;detailed explanation of cognitive systems'
<br>
behavior in terms of qualia dynamics&quot; are not yet actualized -- NEITHER IS
<br>
THE DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE BEHAVIORS AND UTTERANCES OF INTELLIGENT
<br>
SYSTEMS BASED ON PURE MECHANISM.  On all sides we are dealing with
<br>
speculations about what future science may provide.
<br>
<p>In terms of current science, we have no way to explain subjective experience
<br>
in terms of empirical science nor vice versa.  To assume that future science
<br>
will yield an explanation in one direction (subjectivity in terms of
<br>
objectivity) but not the other direction (physics from qualia, a variant of
<br>
John Wheeler's &quot;it from bit&quot;) is merely to indulge in speculation biased by
<br>
one's particular metaphysical assumptions.  (I am also indulging in
<br>
speculation biased by  my own metaphysical assumptions, but I admit it,
<br>
whereas positivist/reductionist types seem not to: they seem to accept the
<br>
detailed explanation of the subjective in terms of the objective as a done
<br>
deal even though it isn't, and dismiss out of hand the possibility of a
<br>
detailed reverse explanation).
<br>
<p>Regarding Mitch Porter's hypothesis that an AI engineered on purely
<br>
reductionist theories might not have qualia, I still doubt it.  I think that
<br>
if we engineered an AI to reflect on its own structures and dynamics in such
<br>
a way that it believed ,based on its own self-study, that the simplest
<br>
hypothesis for explaining its own behavior was a hypothesis involving &quot;I
<br>
have qualia&quot; -- then this AI would have qualia in exactly the same sense
<br>
that human do.  Not because qualia are somehow an epiphenomenon of material
<br>
phenomena, but because subjectivity and objectivity are different
<br>
perspectives on pattern-sets -- meaning they are pattern-sets that often
<br>
have significant intersection, and the intelligence-associated patterns in
<br>
intelligent self-reflective systems lie in this intersection.
<br>
<p>I also think it might be possible to engineer an AI (like Eliezer's
<br>
hypothesized &quot;non-sentient highly powerful optimization process&quot;) that
<br>
lacked the kind of self-reflective cycles correlating with the human use of
<br>
qualia for self-modeling, and hence had a very qualitatively different sort
<br>
of qualia than we do.  Not an AI with no experience at all, but an AI with
<br>
such a different sort of experience that we would have a hard time
<br>
classifying its experiences as &quot;experience&quot; on an intuitive basis (in a
<br>
vaguely similar way to how most people in Western civilizations have a hard
<br>
time intuitively classifying a plant's experience as &quot;experience&quot;).  AIXItl
<br>
would fall into this category if it could be plausibly constructed (which is
<br>
not the case).
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I do not delude myself that my view of qualia has been
<br>
definitively proved; however I have found it a very useful working
<br>
hypothesis for AI engineering, study of human psychology, and internal
<br>
analysis and modification of my own cognitive and emotional processes.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
