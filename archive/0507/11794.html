</em><br>
<em>&gt;I read this section as; 'qualia are what we call the primitive data

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This discussion requires a descriptive vocabulary for consciousness that 
<br>
does not presuppose materialism. We cannot have it if at the first 
<br>
opportunity you wilfully reinsert the very assumptions I wish to proceed 
<br>
without. Already I am driven to talk about qualia because 'sensation' has 
<br>
long since been implicitly redefined to mean 'neural representation', and 
<br>
therefore a state of a material system by definition. In his day, Bertrand 
<br>
Russell could puzzle about the relationship between sensation and the 
<br>
physical world, but if I had written 'Sensations are the starting point, 
<br>
physics is the thing posited', it apparently would have been read as a 
<br>
statement about neural data structures.
<br>
<p>In a previous discussion in January, when I brought up qualia, you wrote: 
<br>
&quot;The mysterious question is 'what are qualia?'. The non-mysterious question 
<br>
that we should be asking is 'why do people think they have qualia'?&quot; Clearly 
<br>
this creates a dilemma for me. No matter what new words I introduce - 
<br>
qualia, raw experience, first-person experience, the phenomenal world - they 
<br>
will either be dismissed as designating a non-entity, or interpreted in a 
<br>
way that presupposes materialism. Yet I think we do have the potential to 
<br>
communicate, since you write below of people seeing that &quot;their mental 
<br>
representation of physics is nothing like their mental representation of 
<br>
pain&quot;, which I read as ;-) a statement, in representationalist idiom, of the 
<br>
phenomenological fact demonstrating that materialism about the mind is a 
<br>
hypothesis.
<br>
<p>So there are two issues on my agenda here. One is the development of a 
<br>
phenomenological discourse and practice which goes as far as it can without 
<br>
speculation, including speculation about neural and computational 
<br>
substrates. The other is the critical examination of the prevailing 
<br>
ontological hypotheses about mind, such as identity theory and property 
<br>
dualism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I ask you to conceive of point particles possessing a specified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mass, a specified charge, a specified  location, and no other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properties. Sprinkle them about in space as you will, you will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; create a 'sensation of color'. Equip them with a certain dynamics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and you may be able to construct an 'environment with properties'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and a 'stimulus classifier'; name some of those environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properties 'colors' and some of the classifier's states 'sensations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of color', and you  may be able to mimic the apparent causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relations between our environment and our sensations of color; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the possible world you have thereby specified does not contain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sensations of color as we know them, and therefore cannot be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world we are inhabiting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not clear if you're building a classifier out of the particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and embedding it in the universe, or tacking something on to the base
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics. I agree that the latter wouldn't work anything like our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe, where secondary properties are entirely higher-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regularities in the group of particles that constitute the perceiver.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But in either case, if you immitate /all/ the causal properties of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human concepts of colour (including intermeidate sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processing details that affect our conscious reasoning but which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't clearly describe), how is that not sensations of color?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Substrate indepedendence includes both the internal details of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;black-box lower level algorithms (assuming they don't systematically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect the output) and the details of whatever physics you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implemented it. The more coherent proposals of the people who want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualia to be part of physics are superficially plausible because in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle qualia could really work as ontological primitives; it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just that there's overwhelming evidence that our universe does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work like that.
</em><br>
<p>The classifier is to be conceived of as, indeed, a high-level structure in a 
<br>
possible world with the base physics specified. In fact, feel free to think 
<br>
of it as a proposed physical model of human cognition, with string theory or 
<br>
the Standard Model as the base physics. When a person asks themselves, 
<br>
'Could that be the way the world is?', what happens? They take their own 
<br>
experience, they take the model, and they ask if there's something in the 
<br>
model for everything in their experience. You have suggested that intuitions 
<br>
of dualism arise merely because 'physics' and 'pain' are apprehended through 
<br>
different modalities, whereas I say there is an intrinsic mismatch between 
<br>
the two objects of apprehension, independent of modality.
<br>
<p>Most of the rest of this message is a game of 'is not, is too'. But we may 
<br>
be able to get somewhere by focusing on the interplay between phenomenology, 
<br>
epistemology, and ontology of mind; the analogous interplay between 
<br>
cognitive science, computer science, and physics-based neuroscience; and the 
<br>
relationship between those two. I think the latter is a subset of the 
<br>
former, and needs to be pursued in that context, but doing this properly 
<br>
requires a philosophical fluency that is difficult to build up (it's taking 
<br>
*me* a long time to get it, at least).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We are faced, not just with a self-denying sensibility which wishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to assert that colorless matter in motion is all that exists (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which case the secondary properties - the qualia - are either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mysteriously identical with certain unspecified conjunctive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properties of large numbers of these particles, or even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mysteriously do not exist at all),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People (well, most of them) don't go around saying that 'thoughts do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not exist' because they're happy with the idea that thoughts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inside their head, and that they exist as patterns that the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elements of their brain (e.g. synapses, activation spikes) adopt. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confusion about qualia exists because people intuitively believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualia are 'out there' rather than 'in here'. This is sensible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normal reasoning; it saves a deference to just store 'the bus is red'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than 'there is an object that reliably causes the red detector
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to fire'. As usual though direct intuition is worse than useless -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actively misleading - when trying to unravel how human cognition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;works.
</em><br>
<p>But there is no actual redness inside the classifier any more than there is 
<br>
outside it. The 'firing of the red detector' is a different thing, and 
<br>
people should not be happy with the idea that thoughts are patterns of 
<br>
brain-elements. As I said previously, this is a metaphysically exotic 
<br>
assertion of identity, &quot;on a par with the assertion that this rock over here 
<br>
is 'really' the number 2&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Mathematical physics, as we know it, is both an apex and a dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; end. No amount of quantitative predictive progress through better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; model-building is going to explain consciousness, because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; models in question exclude certain aspects of reality *by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; construction*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree, assuming you allow the search for and use of higher level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regularities (and hence all parts of the unified causal model other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than the physical foundation). I have yet to hear any coherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question about consciousness on this list which cannot be irrefutably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answered given enough research and computer time (though that amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may well be sufficient that it won't be so answered any time soon).
</em><br>
<p>Again, this philosophy rests on the viability of identifying consciousness 
<br>
with a &quot;high-level regularity&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But I do regard it to be a kind of arrow to be shot at physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reductionists - which is to say people who believe that talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about brain states is the same thing as talking about mental states.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is something which pain is like which is not described by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physics equations, even if physics equations can account for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progress of the state of the world.
</em><br>
<p>(That wasn't me, that was Chris Capel.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A stock example of an inexact or vague predicate is baldness. You're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not bald when you have a full head of hair; you are bald if you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; none; but what if you have one hair, ten hairs, a thousand hairs;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where is the dividing line between bald and not-bald? There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason to think that there is any way to answer that question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without arbitrary stipulation that, say, 1000 hairs is the most you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can have and still be bald.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think you need to be so concerned about using exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predicates. Fuzzy predicates are a direct consequence of the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tractable classifiers are usually unreliable, particularly on human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neural hardware; the probability of returning 'bald' on seeing a head
</em><br>
<em>&gt;varies smoothly from 'nearly 0' at some lower threshold of hair to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'nearly 1' beyond a higher threshold. I agree that exact predicates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are usually preferable when constructing a precise theory, but we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a /long/ way to go before we're at that point with subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensation. Right now the terms people are using have much more serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clarity issues than being based on simple probabilistic classifiers.
</em><br>
<p>My point is that when you look at the *metaphysics* of identity theory
<br>
(or even of functionalist dualism, such as David Chalmers seems to espouse),
<br>
you find that it rests on fuzzy predicates. Computational states are 
<br>
associated
<br>
with microphysical states by a fuzzy coarse-graining of physical state space
<br>
which, to be made exact, requires the exact specification of boundaries,
<br>
and that step is where the arbitrariness enters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But if we consider all possible distributions of electrons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; throughout a transistor, there will clearly be marginal cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We solve this by adding a third 'undefined' state. We set the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thresholds for '0' and '1' such that all states in those categories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result in predictable behaviour. All marginal cases and in practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some predictable states for which the distance to the threshold is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within the range of measurement error go in the 'undefined' category.
</em><br>
<p>But then the arbitrariness comes in the setting of thresholds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I take it as given, not just that there are qualia, but that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is awareness of qualia, and an associated capacity to reason about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their nature, and that this is what makes phenomenological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reflection possible in human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since the human brain is an evolved structure, do you believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural selection discovered qualia or invented them? Either way, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think qualia are indivisible primitives please answer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question 'what use is half a qualia' ?
</em><br>
<p>Ontologically, I think the existence of qualia in our world is necessitated 
<br>
by the weak anthropic principle. That is, if you need qualia to have 
<br>
conscious observers, then a-priori there are qualia here. But this doesn't 
<br>
tell you whether everything is a quale (panpsychism) or just some things 
<br>
(e.g. as in dualist scenarios of 'strong emergence'), and therefore it 
<br>
doesn't tell you whether they were 'discovered' or 'invented'.
