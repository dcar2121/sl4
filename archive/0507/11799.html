<em>&gt; &gt; My chief concern being that it would be possible to build a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mimic of intelligence without actually reproducing the mind. i.e. it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be possible to build a zombie-brain, which has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence, but which has neither a mental life, nor does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physics underlying its rules have any description of mental life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have zero evidence for this. In my opinion it is impossible, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions are like....
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but that's not true. I have circumstantial evidence, based on
<br>
machine-based intelligences not demonstrating any mental life. The
<br>
onus is on them, because inanimate objects are taken to have no mental
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>Consciousness as arising from intelligence as ariving from various
<br>
physical systems is a plausible explanation. It might able be the
<br>
current best scientific theory, but if you were to analyse the
<br>
confidence we might have about such a position, I do not think you
<br>
could stake a strong claim to confidence about the matter.
<br>
<p>Things with no mental life clearly exist. Ditto things which exhibit
<br>
complex behaviour and have no mental life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I hope you see what I'm saying. I'm not anti-scientific - I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to hold that minds are reducible to *some* brains, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think it's true that *all* brains will give rise to minds. And we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a scientific description of that difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, what is there to a mind but information processing? Are you in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;brains have some special physical substrate that imbues them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-ness&quot; camp? If info processing is all there is to it (as it seems) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still does not indicate that all mind-seeming processes are minds as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would understand them, but if the information processing is identical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially similar to that of a known mind, then what doubt can there be?
</em><br>
<p>I would say it's more than processing, but depends on processing.
<br>
<p>I don't know what the mechanism is - there is a gap in physics. I
<br>
would say it could be either specific kinds of processing have a
<br>
causitive effect in the physical realm, outside of what could be
<br>
predicted from the matter interaction per se -- i.e. there are
<br>
additional physical laws relating to processing which descript qualia.
<br>
OR alternatively, there is something specific about the matter
<br>
configuration of brains, which gives rise to qualia, and is not
<br>
necessitated by the processing.
<br>
<p>I think it's possible that, for example, the physical matter
<br>
differences between our brains and, for example, a mechanical Turing
<br>
machine built from metals, might be relevant. I am not convinced that
<br>
mental processing is either demonstrably or convincingly reducible to
<br>
Turing computing. The brain is an analog machine, and may depend on
<br>
its physical layer in unexpected ways.
<br>
<p>I am arguing for a degree of scepticism, and for more science to be
<br>
done, in order to determine the nature of qualia.
<br>
<p>I don't think that I can, a priori, prove that qualia imply a
<br>
non-materialist position. However, I think I can, a priori, disprove
<br>
that a materialist position is necessarily true.
<br>
<p>I have to head off from work now, but just wanted to quickly reply to
<br>
this. Will try to give it proper consideration later.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
