<p>O.K, I made 'scrambled eggs' (garbled stuff) for
<br>
arguments again.  That's what happens when one tries
<br>
to convert intuitions into words *sigh*
<br>
<p>Let me try to take another crack at it.  Warning: 
<br>
This new argument tack is highly abstract though.
<br>
<p>So why do I think unfriendly utilities limit
<br>
intelligence?
<br>
<p>Here's the argument:  
<br>
<p>I've identified a distinction between *projection* on
<br>
the one hand, and *prediction* on the other.  Now
<br>
*projection* is a higher level form of prediction.  I
<br>
define *projection* to be a cross domain integration
<br>
between two different forms of prediction:
<br>
<p>*Predictions about inanimate proccesses
<br>
*Predictions about volitional agents
<br>
<p>Clearly there are two different levels of description
<br>
here and *Projection* has to integrate the two.  So
<br>
*Projections* are a higher level form of prediction.
<br>
<p>I hold that intelligence is about *projection*, not
<br>
*prediction*.  Real intelligence has to reason about
<br>
future outcomes which involve the mixing of volitional
<br>
agents with inanimate proccesses - that's
<br>
*Projection*, as I just defined it above.
<br>
<p>Now scientific prediction, as it is ordinarily
<br>
defined, does not allow the mixing of levels of
<br>
organization in this way.  Scientific prediction
<br>
assumes a sharp distinction between inanimate
<br>
processes on the one hand and volitional agencies on
<br>
the other.  (In order to objectively study something,
<br>
the system under study has to be completely isolated
<br>
from interference by our own volition).  So the hidden
<br>
assumption behind ordinary scientific *prediction* is
<br>
that there is no mixing between our own volitional
<br>
agency and the inanimate proccess under study.  Can
<br>
you see the distinction between my definition of
<br>
'Projection' and ordinary 'Prediction'?
<br>
<p>Now if we allow that intelligence is really about
<br>
'Projection' and not 'Prediction', then there's some
<br>
room for new kinds of theories.
<br>
<p>And here is where my argument gets really abstract and
<br>
fuzzy.  I just defined 'Projection' to be a
<br>
cross-domain integration between predictions about
<br>
volitional agency and predictions about inanimate
<br>
process.  By allowing a mixing between levels of
<br>
description there is room for a link to be established
<br>
between utilites (our goal system - our morality) and
<br>
projections (our prediction system - our
<br>
intelligence).
<br>
<p>With this link established, it's now plausible that
<br>
you can't just have any old morality and still have
<br>
real intelligence.  Because real intelligence is about
<br>
*projection* and not just prediction, there's a
<br>
cross-domain link between utilities and predictions,
<br>
so the wrong kind of morality might interfere with our
<br>
prediction system.
<br>
<p>The theory here is that unfriendly utilities are the
<br>
utilites which interfere with projections in such a
<br>
way as to reduce their effectiveness.  Friendly
<br>
utilies, on the other hand, are the one's which
<br>
increase (better enable the actualization of) the
<br>
projection system.  If this is so, intelligence would
<br>
be bounded (limited by) the degree of friendliness.
