<em>&gt; Read some real evolutionary psychology.  You might want to delete the words
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>*rolls eyes heavenward* Eliezer, if I wanted to write a textbook on
<br>
evolutionary psychology, I would do so. That's not what I'm trying to
<br>
do here. If you don't get the line of argument, then you don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem here is the ratio of cubic expansion through galaxies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential reproduction.  CEV doesn't solve this problem of itself, though it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might search out a solution.  Neither does CEV create the problem or make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any worse.  Why do you suppose that we want to lock ourselves into a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box rather than expanding cubically?
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;locked into a box&quot; I don't mean a bounded volume of physical space
<br>
- that's not the issue. I mean that everyone will be forced at all
<br>
times to follow the will of the Collective in every deed, word and
<br>
thought, with no escape, no refuge and no privacy; it doesn't matter
<br>
whether their material substrate is a meter or a gigameter away from
<br>
the center.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, and how exactly do you determine resource division between your domains?
</em><br>
<p>The way I would suggest doing it is that each domain is allocated
<br>
(number of people) / (6 billion) of the total resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay.  I think I may write you off as simply having failed entirely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the concept of _extrapolated_ volition writing an AI, as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting an AI in the hands of an immediate majority vote, a fairly common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misunderstanding.  I honestly don't know how I can make the distinction any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearer short of grabbing people by the shirt and screaming at them.
</em><br>
<p>Grabbing by the shirt and screaming is exactly what I feel like doing
<br>
right now! Let me try once more:
<br>
<p>*It doesn't matter whether it's extrapolated or not!!!* [1] Someone
<br>
who wants to trample a human face when his IQ is 100 is still going to
<br>
want it when his IQ is 200, he'll just be more effective at finding
<br>
ways to get what he wants.
<br>
<p>*This is the bit you keep refusing to understand.* I know you're smart
<br>
enough to understand it if you tried, but you keep half-believing in
<br>
the ghost of the old &quot;intelligence =&gt; morality&quot; idea. I'd feel a damn
<br>
sight safer if you went back to completely believing in it and just
<br>
working on unfriendly AI. At least that way the worst case scenario is
<br>
merely that we're all dead.
<br>
<p>Let me put it another way:
<br>
<p>Your hyperlibertarian Sysop scenario was effectively domain protection
<br>
with a domain size of 1 person, with the obvious problems previously
<br>
discussed.
<br>
<p>With CEV, all of humanity is forced into the same domain.
<br>
<p>What objection do you have to allowing the intermediate position of
<br>
multiple domains? I know you don't believe it's necessary. How certain
<br>
are you that you're right? If I'm right and you're wrong, you're
<br>
trying to bring about something worse than the extinction of all
<br>
sentient life. How do you get to be so sure of being right that you
<br>
insist on putting all our eggs in the one basket?
<br>
<p>[1] That's not quite true - unextrapolated would be better, it'd mean
<br>
there'd be a better chance of a mistake resulting in an outright
<br>
planet kill, which would be an improvement on the CEV future.
<br>
