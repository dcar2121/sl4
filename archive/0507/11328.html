Heya, I'm a college English major with interest in writing (both fiction and 
<br>
non) as well as speculative philosophy empowered by scientific literacy. My 
<br>
primary field is interactive storytelling, I'm currently (as of 2005) working 
<br>
with legendary game designer Chris Crawford on design issues pertaining to his 
<br>
Erasmatron engine, as well as creating interactive stories using the engine. 
<br>
Long-term I'd like to create a AI intensive engine using the memetic algorithm 
<br>
guided by authorial hueristics to produce game content dynamically.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I read &quot;Staring into the Singularity&quot; at the end of my freshmen year back in 
<br>
may '04. Its almost an SL4 cliche, split between 'Staring' and &quot;FAQ On The 
<br>
Meaning of Life&quot;; the essay completely blew my mind and forced both a 
<br>
re-arrangement and neat capping off of the worldview I'd been cultivating. 
<br>
While my intelligence is largely intuitive/artistic/pattern-oriented (and all 
<br>
those other cop-outs for irrationality) and I don't feel I can argue cognitive 
<br>
science at the level of Eli, Ben, Peter: et al. I do have a strong interest in 
<br>
the social implications of the Singularity. To put it simply: my concept of an 
<br>
FAI is that of an Interactive Storyteller. Its all about how our post-singular 
<br>
ally interfaces with us mere mortals and induces us into a pleasantly 
<br>
hyperreal becoming. In the mean-time, I'm all about getting people thinking, 
<br>
and I believe interactive storytelling is the best way about it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward to bright futures, Patrick Dugan
