<p>A false analogy.  No one has a full theory of FAI yet.
<br>
&nbsp;So we just don't know what the final theory is going
<br>
to look like.  Saying that UM *doesn't exist* is
<br>
therefore as much of a guess as saying that it *does*
<br>
<p>And I do think I have some general idea of what the UM
<br>
is.  I just don't know the details or have the maths -
<br>
I haven't proved it yet.  That's all I meant.
<br>
<p>Intuition can certainly lead one astray in areas where
<br>
one doesn't have a strong 'modality' (inbuilt
<br>
conscious awareness).  But in subject areas where one
<br>
*does* have a good modality, one doesn't need
<br>
deductive calculations.  For instance for vision, you
<br>
don't need to perform calculations of how things move.
<br>
&nbsp;Humans have a good 'Spatial' modality, so we have
<br>
direct conscious awareness of where objects are.
<br>
<p>I don't need maths or calculations to be absolutely
<br>
confident that Eli and Wilson are wrong.  I just know
<br>
it.  I'm 'hooked into' the morality modality.  They
<br>
ain't.
<br>
<p>But if you want reasons, I'll take a crack at it. 
<br>
Here goes:
<br>
<p>Here's something subtlely wrong with the notion that
<br>
intelligence is all about 'prediction'.  I prefer the
<br>
word 'projection'.  It would be more accurate to say
<br>
that intelligence is all making correct *projections*
<br>
rather than saying that it's all about making correct
<br>
*predictions*.  What's the difference?
<br>
<p>Well the way the word 'prediction' is normally used,
<br>
it means predicting outcomes in the *physical
<br>
sciences*.  The physical sciences deal with inanimate
<br>
objects - or objects that are (in the limit) totally
<br>
isolated from interference from volitional entities
<br>
(like humans).  When predicting a solar eclipse for
<br>
instance, scientists are assuming that no one is going
<br>
to come along to influence the sun in such a way that
<br>
stops the ecilpse from happening.  For instance if a
<br>
trickster alien were to use advanced technology to do
<br>
something to the sun, the prediction of an ecilpse
<br>
could be invalidated.  So the hidden assumption in
<br>
'predictions' in the physical sciences in that systems
<br>
are totally isolated from *volitional agencies*
<br>
(conscious entities that might interfere with the
<br>
results)
<br>
<p>*Projections* are slightly different from predictions,
<br>
because projections are *possible outcomes* that can
<br>
include actions by volitional entities.  So they can
<br>
*mix* agency (volition) with inanimate objects. 
<br>
<p>Now once you mix inanimate and animate objects in
<br>
making projections, there's a link then established
<br>
between utilities (goals of sentient beings) and
<br>
predictions (movements of inanimate objects).  And
<br>
it's this link that busts Bayes and allows the
<br>
possibility of an objective morality.
<br>
<p>Bayesian reasoning (induction) assumes as a limit that
<br>
a system is isolated from interference from one's own
<br>
volition.  Bayes is about making *predictions*.  But
<br>
as I just explained, real intelligence is about
<br>
*projections*, where the movements of inanimate
<br>
objects are mixed with the actions of sentient beings.
<br>
<p>An unfriendly goal system may place bounds on
<br>
intelligence, because unfriendly goals might be the
<br>
one's to cause agency (volition) to mix with inanimate
<br>
objects in such a way as to interfere with accurate
<br>
*projections*
<br>
<p>To all you wannabe Singularitarian Jedis:
<br>
<p>You have a lot to learn my young padawans ;)
