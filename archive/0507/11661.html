<p>That's actually a good example of how the seemingly mysterious problem
<br>
of 'qualia' is the result of relatively poor human introspection
<br>
capability. Imagine an AGI with full self-examination and
<br>
self-modification capability performing the same experiment. The AGI
<br>
could work out exactly what bit streams its visual sensors would
<br>
produce upon seeing something red, would know exactly how its sensory
<br>
processing code would react and could in effect imagine a red rose
<br>
in its 'mind's eye' without ever needing to see something red first.
<br>
In principle, the human could use a detailed map of her brain wiring
<br>
to work out where to stick some electrodes to generate the mental
<br>
image of a red rose before she actually lays eyes on it, but a
<br>
reflectively transparent AGI can do this kind of thing with fairly
<br>
trivial effort and much greater precision and reliability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you accept that she has, then qualia must be real, because she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already knew everything that science could inform her about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world and about colour.
</em><br>
<p>Human knowledge can't be applied to all cognitive processing in an
<br>
orthogonal sense. This should be obvious; memorising detailed
<br>
instructions on how to ride a bicycle does not immediately grant
<br>
you the ability to ride a bike competently, because you cannot
<br>
deliberatively modify you neural circuitry with an act of will.
<br>
Humans have several ways of storing information which have varying
<br>
degrees of accessibility for different tasks and cannot always be
<br>
easily translated between. By contrast a fully reflective AGI could
<br>
learn to ride a bike simply by reading the instructions (and doing
<br>
some physical modelling, and generating the appropriate code) and
<br>
can in principle apply any of its knowledge base to any cognitive
<br>
task (though in practise this may incur significant computational
<br>
efficiency penalties). It is unfortunate that the human brain's
<br>
complicated many-tiered information storage and encoding strategy
<br>
(the result of much messy evolutionary design against tight real
<br>
time performance requirements) looks sufficiently confusing from
<br>
the inside to spawn endless debates about qualia and the nature
<br>
of knowing.
