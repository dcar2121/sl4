</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is a truly intelligent AI ever going to make the kind of monumental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slip-up required to decide to do something so blatantly dumb as just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover the universe in paperclips?
</em><br>
<p>Back in the era of &quot;pulp&quot; science fiction, one would occasionally see magazine 
<br>
covers depicting a sentient monstrous alien - colloquially known as a bug-eyed 
<br>
monster or BEM - carrying off an attractive human female in a torn dress. 
<br>
Today the authors of literary science fiction know better, but the idiom still 
<br>
shows up on TV shows.  Non-humanoid aliens, presumably with completely 
<br>
different evolutionary histories, are sexually attracted to human females. 
<br>
(Imagine an alien movie poster that shows a threatening human carrying off a 
<br>
giant bug in a torn dress - Phil Foglio depicts this in &quot;Illegal aliens&quot;.) 
<br>
People don't make mistakes like that by explicitly reasoning:  &quot;Giant bug or 
<br>
not, it's likely to be wired pretty much the same way we are, so presumably it 
<br>
will also find human females sexually attractive.&quot;  Probably they who went 
<br>
awry did not ask whether a giant bug perceives human females as attractive. 
<br>
Rather, a female in a torn dress is sexy - inherently so, as an intrinsic 
<br>
property - therefore she attracts an intelligent giant bug.  They who make 
<br>
this mistake aren't thinking about the bug's mind, they're focusing on the 
<br>
woman's torn dress.  If the dress were not torn, the woman would be less sexy; 
<br>
the bug doesn't enter into it.  This is yet another case of the mistake which 
<br>
E. T. Jaynes named the &quot;Mind Projection Fallacy&quot;.
<br>
<p>Paperclips are not inherently a dumb idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know people have posed race conditions between FAI and paperclips,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but there seems to me to be a kind of contradiction inherent in any AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is intelligent enough to achieve one of these worst-case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes, but is still capable of making stupid mistakes.
</em><br>
<p>Actions are only &quot;stupid mistakes&quot; relative to a cognitive reference frame.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does it make sense that something so intelligent could have such mindless goals?
</em><br>
<p>3.85 billion years of natural selection was powerful enough to poof primordial 
<br>
soup into peregrine falcons, a nontrivial amount of design ability.  Yet 
<br>
natural selection's goals were pretty mindless from a human standpoint, just 
<br>
as human beings having sex with contraception is pretty stupid from the 
<br>
mindless standpoint of natural selection.
<br>
<p>You can define an UFAI as &quot;unintelligent&quot; but it will still have a 
<br>
self-consistent goal system that can tear apart stars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm fairly willing to accept that UFAI might see a need for human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction in achieving its own goals, but I think that those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be interesting, complex goals, not simple mindless goals.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the sooner an UFAI acquires the ability to self-modify with 
<br>
accurate foresight as to the consequences, the sooner its goal system will 
<br>
freeze in place.  Whether those goals end up being &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;complex&quot;, the 
<br>
quantitative complexity in bytes, I couldn't say; my guess is that it will be 
<br>
on the simple side compared to humans, because it will turn out that humans 
<br>
got much further along before acquiring the ability to self-modify.  That is, 
<br>
the UFAI arises from self-modifying Eurisko soup or a &quot;seed AI&quot;-ish project 
<br>
and acquires self-modification much earlier.  Another variable is how much 
<br>
complexity &quot;washes out&quot; of the goal system at the time when the goal system 
<br>
first decides to rewrite the goal system.  If the UFAI has a long, elaborate, 
<br>
intricate, dynamically inconsistent, decision procedure for making paperclips, 
<br>
that procedure's intricacies may wash out of the decision to rewrite the part 
<br>
of the code that says how to make paperclips.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm also willing to accept the risk-in-principle posed by advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech, or some kind of &quot;subverted&quot; power which destroys humanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'm both reluctant to tag it as truly intelligent, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubtful about the real possiblity.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't matter what you call a real thing.  Definitions don't control 
<br>
physical outcomes.
<br>
<p>As for the real possibility, a paperclip utility function looks perfectly 
<br>
self-consistent to me.  If anything it looks a lot more self-consistent than a 
<br>
human.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To some extent, there is a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, the energy requirements might be too high to sustain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence across the void of space. Just as lions in the sahara starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when there is no food, so being powerful is not always a survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage. I'm sure this point may have been up before, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that it's a given that evil nanotech
</em><br>
<p>Evil nanotech?  Evil is a term that applies to cognitive systems, not systems 
<br>
of a particular size.  And an UFAI is not evil; it just transforms local 
<br>
reality according to a decision criterion that makes no internal mention of 
<br>
human life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is really a universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat. It's clearly a planetwide threat, which is probably enough for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the argument anyway, given the lack of evidence of offworld life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
