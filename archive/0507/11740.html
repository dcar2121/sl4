<em>&gt; &gt; The deadliest flaw in CV (actually it's far worse than merely deadly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as will be seen) is that it's still chasing the ghost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe-dictated morality, that in simpler form was the source of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer's and my first subjunctive planet kills.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What were those?
</em><br>
<p>Gung-ho plans to develop AI without realizing the need for Friendliness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Guiding light&quot; here being the overall convergence of volition? So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're claiming that volition wouldn't really converge?
</em><br>
<p>I'm using &quot;guiding light&quot; as a metaphor for morality - to put things
<br>
in colder terms, volition will converge, but on a state with zero or
<br>
negative rather than positive utility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I really don't understand this. What axiom system, and how is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; K-strategist? Grasping at your analogy, I guess that you mean to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that human society has tended toward power-grasping, power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conglomeration, and that CV would extrapolate this tendency and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause--who?--to be placed in absolute power over everyone else.
</em><br>
<p>Probably not one individual, but the Collective. True Communism at
<br>
last. (Watch 'Zardoz', it gets the atmosphere nicely. &quot;We want to die,
<br>
what's the trick?&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doesn't this idea seem to go against the idea of CV giving each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience equal weight (or perhaps weight corresponding to their level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of awareness) in determining what the CV of humanity is? Or maybe you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean to say that each individual human, when they gain knowledge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness, tend to lust for power? But I think that most power-hungry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are abberant in this sense. In any case, there's a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoherence in trying to find the convergence in two people's desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hold power over each other. Because each's idea is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themself are the one in power, and so the intersection of those two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires is very small.
</em><br>
<p>You would think so from calculating the abstract logic, but look at
<br>
what people empirically vote for even when they themselves are at the
<br>
bottom of the heap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then again, the effects of gravity on a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of individual particles gives rise to planets and suns. Each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle in a planet attracts each other particle, yet the effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't cancel out completely and lead to no gravity. In sum, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes large amounts of pressure to be exerted on the core of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet. Perhaps this is a good metaphor for the CV dystopia you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in mind?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm less trying to criticize your post than to give you food for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, so you might perhaps be able to make clearer the exact nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the danger you see.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks! You make some good points in the rest of your post - I'm going
<br>
to have to reread them a few times to really absorb them and form an
<br>
opinion, so I'll postpone further comment for the moment.
<br>
