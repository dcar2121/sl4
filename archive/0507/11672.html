<em>&gt; Does conscious experience emerge from complex patterns or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; execution of certain algorithms?  Maybe... Perhaps even probably.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I don't think this formulation is exactly right...
<br>
<p>Clearly, human conscious experience emerges from complex patterns of the
<br>
execution of certain algorithms -- the question is in what sense are the
<br>
algorithms *alone* sufficient to produce the conscious experience
<br>
<p>more on this later though, I have some more practical things to attend to
<br>
right now ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But we don't know that and &quot;not knowing&quot; is the position we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should take when encoding the initial reasoning algorithms of the seed AI.
</em><br>
<p>Mitch Porter raised an amusing possibility a while back.  Suppose that
<br>
qualia are somehow tied into quantum dynamics, but that intelligent behavior
<br>
is achievable with or without qualia, e.g. through qualia-free AI programs
<br>
running on classical computers.  Then by creating superhuman AI's and having
<br>
them annihilate us, we would effectively be annihilating experience from the
<br>
universe in favor of non-aware intelligent processes ;-p
<br>
<p>Really though I think that is the wrong way of thinking about the issue
<br>
(funny as it is) -- but I'll save my new thoughts on &quot;the right way of
<br>
thinking about it&quot; for a long and systematic post tonight or (more likely)
<br>
tomorrow.
<br>
