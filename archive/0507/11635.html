<p>
Norm,
<br>
<p>What you're pointing out is basically the (in)famous &quot;hard problem of
<br>
consciousness&quot;, isn't it?
<br>
<p>I addressed this in an essay a while back
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm</a>
<br>
<p>but that essay seems to have failed to communicate to almost anyone.  I'm
<br>
about ready to try to write a fresh formulation of my views on this issue,
<br>
but I don't have time today -- hopefully tonight or later in the week ;-)
<br>
<p>As I said, I think a proper understanding of the relation between subjective
<br>
and objective reality is a prerequisite for a clear understanding of
<br>
consciousness (including the &quot;hard problem&quot;), but it's not sufficient...
<br>
it's just a prerequisite...
<br>
<p>Just one more comment: From a subjective point of view, there are aspects of
<br>
reality that cannot be captured by objectivist ideas (e.g. the raw feel of
<br>
pain, as you note).  On the other hand, from an objective point of view,
<br>
there are aspects of reality that cannot be captured by subjective ideas:
<br>
for instance, quantum reality, which is totally out of the scope of human
<br>
subjective experience....
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: RE: Objective versus subjective reality: which is primary?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is by no means a rigorous argument, but I feel that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains something important about the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectivity and objectivity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the following experiment:  You are told that ten people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are connected to electrodes and that pressing any of ten buttons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will administer an electric shock to one of the subjects.  Each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person is also connected to an array of sophisticated monitoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment, which produces various readouts about the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states of their brains.  You start pressing buttons and each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person receives a shock and reacts in a predictable way.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find that the subjects' reactions are dictated by the electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states of their brains, and eventually you even learn how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict each subject's reaction in advance based on data from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous readouts.  However, one thing you did not predict was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the painful experience you felt when you pressed the sixth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; button.  For some reason, pressing that button was very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than pressing any of the others, and none of the readouts could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have told you that in advance.  What is it about person number 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes him or her so special?  As yo!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; u sift through the data you find that each person in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment has their own life history, personality, genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makeup, memories, self-concept, etc., all of which play a part in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determining their reaction to the shock.  Still, search as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may, there's no hidden brain circuitry that fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguishes person number 6 from the others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the experiment is less interesting when examined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectively.  Given the prior knowledge that person number 6 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one pressing buttons, it's predictable that after pressing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 6th button this person would experience something different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, in offering this explanation, the subject &quot;YOU&quot; has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced by &quot;person number 6.&quot;  Objectively, this substitution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes sense and does not make any difference, while from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective it makes all the difference in the world.  What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this strange connection between &quot;YOU&quot; and person number 6?  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me that starting from the subjective perspective (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from where else can you start?), there are aspects of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective perspective that cannot be derived objectively.
</em><br>
