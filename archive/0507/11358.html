Here's something subtlely wrong with the notion that
<br>
intelligence is all about 'prediction'. I prefer the
<br>
word 'projection'. It would be more accurate to say
<br>
that intelligence is all making correct *projections*
<br>
rather than saying that it's all about making correct
<br>
*predictions*. What's the difference?
<br>
Well the way the word 'prediction' is normally used,
<br>
it means predicting outcomes in the *physical
<br>
sciences*. The physical sciences deal with inanimate
<br>
objects - or objects that are (in the limit) totally
<br>
isolated from interference from volitional entities
<br>
(like humans). When predicting a solar eclipse for
<br>
instance, scientists are assuming that no one is going
<br>
to come along to influence the sun in such a way that
<br>
stops the ecilpse from happening. For instance if a
<br>
trickster alien were to use advanced technology to do
<br>
something to the sun, the prediction of an ecilpse
<br>
could be invalidated. So the hidden assumption in
<br>
'predictions' in the physical sciences in that systems
<br>
are totally isolated from *volitional agencies*
<br>
(conscious entities that might interfere with the
<br>
results)
<br>
*Projections* are slightly different from predictions,
<br>
because projections are *possible outcomes* that can
<br>
include actions by volitional entities. So they can
<br>
*mix* agency (volition) with inanimate objects. 
<br>
Now once you mix inanimate and animate objects in
<br>
making projections, there's a link then established
<br>
between utilities (goals of sentient beings) and
<br>
predictions (movements of inanimate objects). And
<br>
it's this link that busts Bayes and allows the
<br>
possibility of an objective morality.
<br>
Bayesian reasoning (induction) assumes as a limit that
<br>
a system is isolated from interference from one's own
<br>
volition. Bayes is about making *predictions*. But
<br>
as I just explained, real intelligence is about
<br>
*projections*, where the movements of inanimate
<br>
objects are mixed with the actions of sentient beings.
<br>
An unfriendly goal system may place bounds on
<br>
intelligence, because unfriendly goals might be the
<br>
one's to cause agency (volition) to mix with inanimate
<br>
objects in such a way as to interfere with accurate
<br>
*projections*
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting the rest of your scheme, for the moment.  What makes you so sure that AGI will be a sentient being, and not just another class of inanimate object, which seems to be the composition of everything else not conscious, in your ontology.  If AGI can be made to be sentient, it seems to make friendliness a whole lot easier to instill.  But apart from a &quot;Blue-Brain XVII&quot; creation, I don't think the world's 1st AGI will be a conscious actor in any sense.
