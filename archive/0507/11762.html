Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Few quick questions on the CEV post - notice that you've turned 
<br>
&quot;Collective Extrapolated Volition&quot; into &quot;Coherent Extrapolated Volition&quot; 
<br>
here - is this a permanent jargon change or are you just using the term 
<br>
&quot;coherent&quot; to make some sort of point in this context?  Please explain.

<p><em>&gt; 3.  THE CEV WRITES AN AI.  THIS AI MAY OR MAY NOT WORK IN ANY WAY

<em>&gt; REMOTELY RESEMBLING A VOLITION-EXTRAPOLATOR.
</em><br>
<p>...though it's extremely likely it would, right?  In the broadest sense, 
<br>
&quot;volition extrapolation&quot; basically means &quot;guessing what people want&quot;, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  THE CEV RETURNS ONE COHERENT ANSWER.  THE AI IT RETURNS MAY OR MAY 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT DISPLAY ANY GIVEN SORT OF COHERENCE IN HOW IT TREATS DIFFERENT 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PEOPLE, OR CREATE ANY GIVEN SORT OF COHERENT WORLD.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, if it doesn't display any sort of coherence in how it treats 
<br>
different people, or doesn't create any sort of coherent world, that 
<br>
would be a failure, right?  Is this statement being put forth to help 
<br>
people distinguish the difference between the CEV and the AI it creates?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5.  THE CEV RUNS FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE PRODUCING AN OUTPUT.  IT IS 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT MEANT TO GOVERN FOR CENTURIES.
</em><br>
<p>Though of course, there could be substantial mutual information between 
<br>
the CEV and the AI it creates - correct?  Though such an AI (nor the CEV 
<br>
which created it) would not &quot;govern&quot; in the anthropomorphic sense, it 
<br>
would surely exert optimization pressure upon the world.  There are 
<br>
probably some people out there who feel infinitely uncomfortable with 
<br>
the idea of a superintelligent AI with initial conditions set by a human 
<br>
programming team creating changes in the world, and will hence object to 
<br>
any such proposals, but of course it seems like this event is basically 
<br>
unavoidable...  I think it's important to distinguish between people who 
<br>
are objecting to *any* FAI theory on the grounds that they haven't come 
<br>
to terms with the reality of recursive self-improvement yet, and people 
<br>
who have already accepted that superintelligent AI will eventually come 
<br>
into existence whether we like it or not, and that it's merely our duty 
<br>
to set the initial conditions as best we can.  It's sometimes difficult 
<br>
to tell the difference between the two, people because it seems like 
<br>
people in group #1 may occasionally pretend to be in group #2 for the 
<br>
sake of argument (which ends up going nowhere).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6.  THE CEV BY ITSELF DOES NOT MESS AROUND WITH YOUR LIFE.  THE CEV 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; JUST DECIDES WHICH AI TO REPLACE ITSELF WITH.
</em><br>
<p>...but the CEV isn't explicitly being programmed to create an AI output 
<br>
- aye?  The AI output is based on the assumption that our wish if we 
<br>
knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had 
<br>
grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than 
<br>
diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as 
<br>
we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted, we 
<br>
would decide to construct an AI that exerts a sort of optimizing 
<br>
pressure on the world such that it makes it a better place to live?  I 
<br>
would agree with this assumption - I just think it's worthwhile to point 
<br>
out explicitly for the sake of clarity.  Theoretically, the (extremely 
<br>
improbable) output of CEV could merely be a single object, like a 
<br>
banana, or something along those lines, yes?
