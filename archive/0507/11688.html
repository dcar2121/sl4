<p>*Geddes suddenly bursts back on to SL4 and

non-chalently fires off something brilliant that makes
<br>
perfect sense
<br>
<p>___
<br>
Take the set of all geometrical objects possessing
<br>
high levels of the following meta-properties:  
<br>
a Symmetry , b Complexity
<br>
<p>Take the set of all algebraic functions possessing
<br>
high levels of the following meta-properties:  
<br>
a Consistency 
<br>
b Consilience ( functions which tend to unify lower
<br>
level functions)
<br>
<p>Map the two sets to each other by converting all the
<br>
geometric objects into algebraic functions.  Note the
<br>
correlation between the two sets of meta-properties
<br>
(a) and (b).  
<br>
<p>The two sets of meta-properties (Symmetry and
<br>
Complexity of geometrical objects) and (Consistency
<br>
and Consilience of algebraic functions) are correlated
<br>
IF AND ONLY IF it is possible to fully convert
<br>
algebraic functions into geometrical objects and visa
<br>
versa.
<br>
<p>Now:
<br>
<p>Take the set of all complex systems (high level
<br>
computational functions) possessing high levels of the
<br>
following meta-properties: 
<br>
a Efficiency (runs on least action principles), 
<br>
b Optimal predictive power (ability to effectively
<br>
model of other complex systems).
<br>
<p>Take the set of all goal systems (cognitive agents)
<br>
possessing high levels of the following
<br>
meta-properties:  
<br>
a Goals which tend to promote expansion of the
<br>
complexity of goal system 
<br>
b Goals which tend to promote harmony (minimal goal
<br>
clashes) with other agents
<br>
<p>Map the two sets to each other by converting the
<br>
computational functions into descriptions of cognitive
<br>
agents and visa versa.  Is there a correlation between
<br>
the two sets of meta-properties (Efficiency and
<br>
Predictive power) of computational systems and (Goals
<br>
promoting expanding complexity of goal system and
<br>
goals promoting reductions in goal clashes with other
<br>
agents) of cognitive agents?  
<br>
<p>Hint:  ‘Cognitive agents’ and ‘Computational
<br>
Functions’ are just higher level descriptions of
<br>
‘Geometrical Objects’ and ‘Algebraic functions’.  
<br>
<p>Theorem:  The two sets of meta-properties (Efficiency
<br>
and Predictive power) and (Goals promoting expansion
<br>
of complexity in goal system and goals promoting
<br>
reduction in goal clashes with other agents) are
<br>
correlated IF AND ONLY IF it is possible to fully
<br>
convert the descriptions of computational functions
<br>
into descriptions of cognitive agents and visa versa.
