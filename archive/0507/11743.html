<em>&gt; *rolls eyes heavenward* Eliezer, if I wanted to write a textbook on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary psychology, I would do so. That's not what I'm trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do here. If you don't get the line of argument, then you don't.
</em><br>
<p>If you're not trying to write a textbook on evolutionary psychology, then 
<br>
state the exact condition you believe the CEV to simulate, its effect on human 
<br>
psychology, and the distorting effect you believe it has on the output of CEV. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without tossing in random terms from evolutionary biology that I've never 
<br>
heard anyone even try to relate to ev-psych before; if there's a relevant 
<br>
paper, feel free to reference it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The problem here is the ratio of cubic expansion through galaxies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;exponential reproduction.  CEV doesn't solve this problem of itself, though it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;might search out a solution.  Neither does CEV create the problem or make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;any worse.  Why do you suppose that we want to lock ourselves into a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;box rather than expanding cubically?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;locked into a box&quot; I don't mean a bounded volume of physical space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - that's not the issue.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it bloody is in evolutionary biology!  K-selection and r-selection are 
<br>
not metaphors!  They refer to bounded resources for growth, THAT'S ALL.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean that everyone will be forced at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times to follow the will of the Collective in every deed, word and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, with no escape, no refuge and no privacy;  it doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether their material substrate is a meter or a gigameter away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the center.
</em><br>
<p>CEV(4) CEV(6)
<br>
<p>Which has absolutely NOTHING repeat NOTHING to do with
<br>
<p>dN/dt = rN(K - N)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Okay.  I think I may write you off as simply having failed entirely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;understand the concept of _extrapolated_ volition writing an AI, as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;putting an AI in the hands of an immediate majority vote, a fairly common
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;misunderstanding.  I honestly don't know how I can make the distinction any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;clearer short of grabbing people by the shirt and screaming at them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Grabbing by the shirt and screaming is exactly what I feel like doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now! Let me try once more:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *It doesn't matter whether it's extrapolated or not!!!* [1] Someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who wants to trample a human face when his IQ is 100 is still going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want it when his IQ is 200, he'll just be more effective at finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways to get what he wants.
</em><br>
<p>Either CEV(2), or, how do you know this?
<br>
<p>How do you know this holds true for every one of the billion different 
<br>
extrapolation dynamics I might eventually decide to implement?
<br>
<p>If I observed an attempted CEV returning this result, I would conclude that 
<br>
the extrapolation dynamic was broken or failing to take something into account 
<br>
required to return the desired sense of &quot;want&quot;, most likely the part I 
<br>
described as &quot;More the people we wished we were&quot;.  If no extrapolation dynamic 
<br>
can get past that, the CEV concept fails - silently, I would expect, though 
<br>
I'm afraid I'd presently have to rely on the Last Judge to implement the 
<br>
silent failure part.
<br>
<p>I do not believe it to be true, as an empirical fact, that people with IQ 100 
<br>
and IQ 150 display the same distribution of personal moralities.  For a start, 
<br>
they don't display the same distribution of theologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *This is the bit you keep refusing to understand.* I know you're smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to understand it if you tried, but you keep half-believing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ghost of the old &quot;intelligence =&gt; morality&quot; idea.
</em><br>
<p>*In humans*.  Which makes all the difference in the world.  Also it's not just 
<br>
increased intelligence that the CEV extrapolates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me put it another way:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your hyperlibertarian Sysop scenario was effectively domain protection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a domain size of 1 person, with the obvious problems previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With CEV, all of humanity is forced into the same domain.
</em><br>
<p>CEV(4) CEV(5) CEV(6)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What objection do you have to allowing the intermediate position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple domains?
</em><br>
<p>I never proposed to directly build a Sysop in the CFAI days, much less the 
<br>
Objective Morality days.  I would have strongly objected to directly building 
<br>
a Sysop of any kind.  Likewise domain protection.  Such power should not exist 
<br>
without a superhumane veto.  Multiple domains are all well and good, provided 
<br>
that some kind of superhumane veto has the chance to say &quot;No&quot;.  I would expect 
<br>
that such decisions are best made by a superhumane entity directly, but 
<br>
perhaps I am mistaken.  I wouldn't want to exert that kind of optimizing power 
<br>
without a superhumane veto on the decision to exert optimizing power.
