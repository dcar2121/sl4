<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this point gives rise to an interesting asymmetry. While it's easier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to explain the existence of objective reality based on subjective reality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than vice versa, it seems like it's probably easier to explain the details 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of subjective reality based on objective reality than vice versa. Of course, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is largely speculative, since right now we don't know how to do either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- we can't explain particle physics based on subjectivist developmental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology, but nor can we explain the nature of conscious experience based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on brain function. However, my intuition is that the latter is an easier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; task, and will be achieved sooner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How is the former possible at all? Or, alternatively, haven't we already 
<br>
done it? All that's necessary to explain particle physics starting with 
<br>
subjective reality is to formulate a theory of objective reality from 
<br>
subjective experience and go from there. Or did you have something 
<br>
fundamentally different in mind? I have a hard time visualizing what it 
<br>
would be.
