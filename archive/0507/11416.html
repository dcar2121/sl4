<p>
How very strange it feels, to read an obviously intelligent and 
<br>
carefully thought out train of thought--and to have it seem so 
<br>
inside-out.  I have been interested for many years in understanding how 
<br>
to encompass both points of view in order to achieve more effective 
<br>
cooperation between the two camps.
<br>
<p>Ben, I agree with you that an understanding of the relationship between 
<br>
subjective and objective points of view is essential for a coherent 
<br>
understanding of the nature of consciousness (and &quot;self&quot;, &quot;qualia&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;free will&quot; and &quot;morality&quot;) and is therefore relevant to this list.
<br>
<p>Your usage of the term &quot;primary&quot; may add some confusion to this 
<br>
discussion, but also may hint at the actual crux of the matter.  Saying 
<br>
something is &quot;primary&quot;, meaning first, is not necessarily the same as 
<br>
saying it is more /fundamental/ or that that it is more /encompassing/, 
<br>
in terms of explanatory capability.  I would certainly agree though, 
<br>
that to any of us subjective selves, our subjective experience is 
<br>
primary in terms of /immediacy/.  This would seem to make the awareness 
<br>
of logical contradiction, as with awareness of any kind, &quot;primary&quot; from 
<br>
a subjective point of view.
<br>
<p>But when we consider which point of view provides the greatest 
<br>
explanatory capability (even for subjective concepts such as values), a 
<br>
more objective view provides both the advantage of greater detail as you 
<br>
pointed out, but similarly provides the advantage of the bigger picture 
<br>
where multiple subjective views combine to cancel out those observations 
<br>
which don't match their external reality and to reinforce those parts of 
<br>
individual subjective models which more closely match their external 
<br>
environment.  Overall, an increasingly bigger view of thing tends to 
<br>
increasingly approximate what works and is thus considered more correct.
<br>
<p>What more is there to say?
<br>
