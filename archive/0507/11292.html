<em>&gt; Something I've been meaning to comment on for a long time: Citing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperclips
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a key danger facing us from AGI avoids the real difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue: what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic dangers - threats we can relate to and debate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It also demotes the debate to the juvenile; not helpful if one wants to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken seriously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd love to hear well-reasoned thoughts on what and whose motivation would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up being a bigger or more likely danger to us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, what poses the bigger risk: an AI with a mind of its own, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are specific risks that a run-of-the-mill AGI poses?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peter
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p>As a more realistic alternative to paperclips, consider the possibility of a
<br>
superhuman AI that holds &quot;advancing science, mathematics and technology&quot; as
<br>
its ultimate goal.  Such an AI might well want to pulverize humans so as to
<br>
use their mass-energy as computing material that will lead it to greater
<br>
discoveries and inventions.
<br>
<p>Or, consider an AI that wants to &quot;make humans happy&quot; (probably among other
<br>
goals), but proceeds to work toward this goal by transforming humans into
<br>
fundamentally nonhuman minds that are, however, happier.  (This is basically
<br>
the idea of Jack Williamson's classic novel &quot;The Humanoids&quot;, which everyone
<br>
on this list presumably knows.)
<br>
<p>Or an AI that wants to &quot;keep humanity as it is, unless it wants to change by
<br>
its free choice&quot; and thus institutes a kind of fascism, preventing humans
<br>
from becoming transhuman, because it interprets &quot;free choice&quot; a bit
<br>
differently from (future) humans ...
<br>
<p>We don't need to posit evil AI's or AI's with absurd goals like tiling the
<br>
universe with smiley-faces to see that superhuman AI's pose a lot of
<br>
potential dangers to the future of humanity.
<br>
<p>These sorts of dangers don't arise if one has a &quot;run-of-the-mill AGI&quot;; they
<br>
arise if one has an AGI that has drastically superhuman powers.  The reason
<br>
these dangers seem worth discussing is that many of us on this list believe
<br>
that
<br>
<p>a) a human-level AGI is plausible during the next few decades (maybe much
<br>
less)
<br>
<p>b) once human-level AGI is reached, superhuman AGI is not far off due to
<br>
recursive self-modification
