<p>I thought I was, but I checked Wikipedia and had got my definitions mixed up,

either that or I read a different definition.  Regardless, I still don't

understand what you think happens.  Or why you think natural r-selection is 
<br>
any less cruel than natural K-selection.

</em><br>
<p>It's plausible.  But I don't understand why you think this is what CEV 
<br>
simulates.  Obviously, CEV doesn't start out by simulating human society + 
<br>
CEV.  That's an infinite recursion.  CEV starts out by considering abstractly 
<br>
human society plus a predefined set of enhancements.  The initial dynamic, the 
<br>
thing SIAI builds, has *no* intended effect on the world itself - it just 
<br>
writes another AI.  The CEV initial dynamic cannot simulate its own effect on 
<br>
the world because it has no effect - though CEV can simulate the effect of a 
<br>
potential output AI.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if you'd want to build, into the initial dynamic, a second round 
<br>
of extrapolation abstractly considering human society plus first-order CEV, 
<br>
that is, human society plus the effect of the AI that is the first-order 
<br>
answer of CEV.  But even if you did build a second round into the initial 
<br>
dynamic, human society would not start out being simulated as possessing, 
<br>
under control of unenhanced human majority vote, the ability to see into 
<br>
people's thoughts etc., unless that was the AI output by first-order CEV.
