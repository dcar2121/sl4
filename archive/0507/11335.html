</em><br>
<p>Intelligence can be defined as 'the ability to

think up optimal ways to achieve goals.' Wisdom
<br>
can be defined as 'the ability to understand
<br>
which goals are optimal.'
<br>
<p>Put this way, a paperclip optimizer can be very
<br>
intelligent about how it efficiently turns
<br>
everything inside the Kuiper Belt into
<br>
paperclips. A wise AI can be just as efficient in
<br>
turning the solar system into paperclips, but
<br>
before it embarks on that act it will think &quot;What
<br>
supergoal am I trying to achieve by turning the
<br>
solar system into paperclips? Is there a better
<br>
way to achieve that supergoal? Is that supergoal
<br>
itself optimal?&quot; A SAI that is not wise is worse
<br>
than useless; one which is wise will figure out
<br>
what we need better than we can; if CV is
<br>
workable ve will work it out; if some other
<br>
strategy is optimal it will work that out.
<br>
<p>This reminds me of one of the techniques of NLP
<br>
(neurolinguistic programming: the most famous NLP
<br>
maven is Tony Robbins, but he didn't invent it
<br>
and there are plenty of others in the field). NLP
<br>
in a nutshell: study high achievers, dissect
<br>
their thought patterns, learn to use the same
<br>
thought patterns.
<br>
The technique is to find out the higher value.
<br>
'Values' in NLP mean much the same thing as
<br>
supergoals. Here's an article that explains the
<br>
idea well:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nlp-now.co.uk/nlp_and_values1.htm">http://www.nlp-now.co.uk/nlp_and_values1.htm</a>
<br>
Quote:
<br>
What is a 'Value'?
<br>
<p>A value is a 'hot button' that drives a
<br>
behaviour. Whatever you do is done in order to
<br>
fulfil a value - even though you are unlikely to
<br>
be consciously aware of that value.
<br>
<p>You swim to fulfil the value of improving your
<br>
health, benefiting from the relaxed state it
<br>
later produces, enjoying the warmth of the sun
<br>
and the sea, etc.
<br>
<p>You drink alcohol to fulfil the value of feeling
<br>
less inhibited, to enjoy the social scene
<br>
involved, to enjoy the taste of the drink, etc.
<br>
<p>You buy fashionable new clothes to fulfil the
<br>
value of looking good, looking right for work, or
<br>
not looking dowdy, etc.
<br>
<p>Pleasure and Pain 
<br>
<p>Everything you do is a means to an end and this
<br>
end is the fulfilment of a value. You do what you
<br>
do to either move towards pleasurable feelings or
<br>
values. Or to move away from or avoid painful
<br>
values or feelings. (In NLP the Pain values are
<br>
called Away From Values and the Pleasure values
<br>
are called Towards Values).&quot;
<br>
End Quote
<br>
<p>The article also states that many people are
<br>
unhappy because they don't really know what their
<br>
true values are, never really gave it much
<br>
thought, so they pursue things that aren't what
<br>
they really want! This is equivalent to an AI
<br>
researcher who hasn't done hir homework on the
<br>
supergoals. That's how you get paperclips.
<br>
<p>One thing I do not accept is that any real SAI
<br>
can possibly run on a 'diesel-sipping Pentium',
<br>
as has been suggested. Whatever the physical
<br>
substrate is, it will have to be closer to the
<br>
most powerful computers now extant than anything
<br>
much less powerful, even with maximally optimized
<br>
code. I say this because I can see a
<br>
diesel-sipping Pentium as a paperclip optimizer,
<br>
but not as a wise SAI. I agree with the
<br>
suggestion that Friendliness correlates with
<br>
intelligence far above human level, at least to
<br>
the extent that such SAI has the capacity to
<br>
examine its own thinking in ways that a weaker AI
<br>
can't. The AI has to have the capacity to sort
<br>
out its own supergoals in a timely manner, unless
<br>
we constrain it to obeying our preselected
<br>
supergoals (sure hope we chose them well!)
<br>
<p>I have to say, however, that even extreme
<br>
Friendliness may have its limits. Imagine
<br>
yourself the proprietor of an ant farm. Suppose
<br>
that you have named each of the hundreds of ants,
<br>
know them on sight, love them like they were your
<br>
own children. You weep bitterly whenever one of
<br>
them comes to harm. Even so, can you protect them
<br>
in all conceivable conditions? What if a tornado
<br>
hits your house? Maybe we expect things of FAI
<br>
that ve could not give us, no matter how
<br>
motivated ve is.
