Well, *my* interpretation of the &quot;hard problem&quot; is &quot;explaining how/why there
<br>
is a connection between subjective conscious experience, on the one hand,
<br>
and particular physical phenomena like electricity flowing in brains on the
<br>
other hand.&quot;
<br>
<p>Chalmers may have put it in an overly objective-reality-flavored way, but I
<br>
suppose this is the essence of what he was getting at.
<br>
<p>More later,
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: RE: Objective versus subjective reality: which is primary?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What you're pointing out is basically the (in)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; famous &quot;hard problem of consciousness&quot;, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's been a while since I read Chalmer's paper, but I seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall the hard problem being described in a way that presupposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the primacy of objective reality and placed the burden of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining the &quot;something extra&quot; of consciousness on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponents of the hard problem.  I feel that this emphasis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary and that an equally valid approach would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presuppose the existence of subjective reality and require that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any would-be physical explanation of reality provide for (or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least not preclude) the obvious fact of subjective experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems clear to me that subjective reality is primary from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective standpoint; whereas objective reality is primary from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an objective standpoint.  I think you hit the nail on the head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you said &quot;each has their own validity, and each gives rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the other in a certain sense.&quot;  There are clearly interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among them, but to posit one as more primary than the other (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sense that one subsumes and explains the other) would be unwarranted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, all of our observations, thoughts and logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments regarding reality originate from a subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective, relative to which objective reality is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deepest sense an unprovable hypothesis.  Relative to subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, objective reality is a construct of our own subjectivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - an abstraction on the horizon which can be approached but never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reached.  We can never &quot;know&quot; objective reality, but can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deduce it indirectly as a function of how it relates to patterns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within our own subjectivity.  Any understanding of the objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is necessarily incomplete and inextricably bound to our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective points-of-view.  In short, I think we are stuck with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that subjective reality is primary, at least from our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective, because we are bound to the subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point-of-view.  While we can build strong cases for the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of objective reality, in the end it would be begging the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to position objective reality as primary.  Any theor!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; y of reality that fails to explain subjective experience is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily incomplete.
