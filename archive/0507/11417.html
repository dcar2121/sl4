<p>
A few people have asked me why I haven't removed Marc Geddes from the list.
<br>
<p>First, he doesn't swear at people and he spells correctly.  This counts for *a 
<br>
lot* in whether someone stays on SL4.
<br>
<p>Second, when someone obeys basic netiquette, I am biased against rejecting 
<br>
them from the list because their opinions conflict with mine.  There's some 
<br>
known phenomena in social psychology that say:  Leave the outliers in!  Not 
<br>
because they are valuable in their own right, but their presence shows that 
<br>
dissent is tolerated, and mainstream people feel freer to express opinions 
<br>
that leave the mainstream.  If Geddes were not the list oddball, someone else 
<br>
would be, and then people would ask why that person was still on the list, and 
<br>
then when that person was gone, someone else would be the list oddball...
<br>
<p>Third, Geddes makes a good, *clear* example of how *not* to do things.  Fewer 
<br>
serious posters have appealed to intuition to support their statements on AI 
<br>
since Geddes made &quot;intuition&quot; look very silly, showing it could be used to 
<br>
support completely arbitrary assertions.  I still wish that people understood 
<br>
*why* &quot;intuition&quot; is a poor way of arguing, but failing that, it's better that 
<br>
they think the argument will make them look silly.  &quot;Not *looking* stupid&quot; is 
<br>
the closest thing most people have to a grasp on rationality, and Geddes helps 
<br>
make &quot;intuition&quot; *look* stupid.  Geddes has also helped show the folly of 
<br>
believing that you understand everything but not being able to express it 
<br>
mathematically, like those other guys can who are admittedly clever but alas 
<br>
not so intuitively gifted as Geddes; may this encourage us all to study the 
<br>
math.  I realized that I could not get away with calling Bayesian probability 
<br>
theory &quot;the Way of cutting through to the correct answer&quot;; it was nice poetry, 
<br>
but Geddes rapidly appropriated &quot;The Way&quot; and started turning it into his own 
<br>
gibberish, which tells me the effect nice poetry has on weak minds.  Think of 
<br>
Geddes as the SL4 List Canary.  His function is to fall over first when people 
<br>
start wandering into dangerous territory.
<br>
<p>However, I would emphasize that nobody needs to reply to Geddes's more 
<br>
incomprehensible screeds.  If Geddes doesn't have to work at being 
<br>
comprehensible to get a response - just like I or any other author has to work 
<br>
at being comprehensible - then he will only wander off farther into the far 
<br>
spaces, and that's not helping him.  When Geddes seems to be going completely 
<br>
nuts, just watch and learn what not to do.
