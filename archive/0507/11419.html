An axiom I hold for thinking about Interactive Storytelling is the importance 
<br>
of staying objectively subjective. For those lit buffs out there the work of 
<br>
William Burroughs and his cut-ups signify this notion, perception is 
<br>
inherently fragmented due to our finity so by remixing a work of art, for 
<br>
instance, this limit is made explicit. For cybernetics buffs (probably a much 
<br>
greater number) objective subjectivity means a system whose autopoiesis 
<br>
creates specific structures by which information is given epistemological 
<br>
meaning via the interaction of chunked data. Maybe the notion goes back to 
<br>
Socrates, who was only 100% certain of his own subjectivity. 
<br>
Objective-subjectivity can be seen as a cultural anecdote, a question with its 
<br>
own answer, a whishy-washy lecture topic for academics, but for our purposes 
<br>
it should be translated a bit for its relevance to be made clear. Creating 
<br>
general intelligence, friendly or not, is an engineering excersise in 
<br>
object-oriented subjectivity. If we think in terms of memetic objects 
<br>
interacting to form a subjective consciousness then the question of objective 
<br>
morality/reality or their relativistic counterpart is irrelevant.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: in terms of a cognitive implementation, Object-Oriented Subjectivity 
<br>
suggests a blurring of content and structure, a cognitive structure and 
<br>
cognitive data are encapsulated in an object all the same. All subjective 
<br>
objects are created equal, only their functional interaction differs.

<p><em>&gt;===== Original Message From Jef Allbright &lt;<a href="mailto:jef@jefallbright.net?Subject=RE:%20Objective%20versus%20subjective%20reality:%20which%20is%20primary?">jef@jefallbright.net</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How very strange it feels, to read an obviously intelligent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carefully thought out train of thought--and to have it seem so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inside-out.  I have been interested for many years in understanding how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to encompass both points of view in order to achieve more effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cooperation between the two camps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ben, I agree with you that an understanding of the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subjective and objective points of view is essential for a coherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding of the nature of consciousness (and &quot;self&quot;, &quot;qualia&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;free will&quot; and &quot;morality&quot;) and is therefore relevant to this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Your usage of the term &quot;primary&quot; may add some confusion to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion, but also may hint at the actual crux of the matter.  Saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something is &quot;primary&quot;, meaning first, is not necessarily the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying it is more /fundamental/ or that that it is more /encompassing/,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in terms of explanatory capability.  I would certainly agree though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that to any of us subjective selves, our subjective experience is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primary in terms of /immediacy/.  This would seem to make the awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of logical contradiction, as with awareness of any kind, &quot;primary&quot; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a subjective point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But when we consider which point of view provides the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explanatory capability (even for subjective concepts such as values), a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more objective view provides both the advantage of greater detail as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointed out, but similarly provides the advantage of the bigger picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where multiple subjective views combine to cancel out those observations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which don't match their external reality and to reinforce those parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual subjective models which more closely match their external
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment.  Overall, an increasingly bigger view of thing tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increasingly approximate what works and is thus considered more correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What more is there to say?
