<p>
This brief, informal philosophical essay (on the relative primacy of
<br>
objective vs. subjective reality) may serve to annoy objectivists and
<br>
empiricists on this list:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/blog/blog.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/blog/blog.htm</a>
<br>
<p>;-)
<br>
<p>Warning: the essay is not about technology hardly at all.  But I guess that
<br>
issues of the nature of reality are relevant to the Singularity.  Since one
<br>
of the key aspects of the Singularity is that reality as we know it may
<br>
cease to exist, it seems relevant and worthwhile to think about the extent
<br>
to which reality exists in the first place....  (And it turns out that, in
<br>
my experience, this kind of deep philosophical exploration is actually often
<br>
useful for guiding scientific thinking about concrete and important topics
<br>
in AI and cognitive psychology....)
