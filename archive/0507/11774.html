</em><br>
<p>Well, if one believes in both qualia and matter, there are at least three 
<br>
possibilities regarding their relationship:
<br>
<p>1) Some form of identity theory: qualia actually are material entities of 
<br>
some sort.
<br>
<p>2) Property dualism: qualia are material entities, but they are an aspect of 
<br>
matter not yet encompassed by physics.
<br>
<p>3) Substance dualism: qualia are not material entities, they belong to some 
<br>
other ontological category.
<br>
<p>So you can see what I'm driving at, I'm going to focus on visual qualia - 
<br>
visual sensations, if one prefers. First of all, we need a working 
<br>
description, so I will adopt a very crude one: the visual field consists of 
<br>
adjacent patches of color. I'm also adopting a substance-property ontology, 
<br>
in which color is a property of patches. So if I am satisfied that there are 
<br>
such things as colors, and patches of color, next I want to know, what are 
<br>
they? What is their relationship to my hypothesized physical ontology? Again 
<br>
for the purposes of argument, I will make the crude assumption that my 
<br>
physical ontology consists of colorless particles moving in space according 
<br>
to some dynamical laws.
<br>
<p>Now (1) I have already dismissed as impossible; there simply is no such 
<br>
thing as a patch of color in the physical ontology just defined. However, 
<br>
there are substances (&quot;things&quot;) with properties - the individual particles 
<br>
have their dynamical properties, and sets of particles have additional 
<br>
properties such as number of elements, average position, and so forth. So I 
<br>
might adopt (2), and propose that a color-patch is actually a set of 
<br>
particles in physical space, and that color is a new property it possesses, 
<br>
and perhaps that there are new laws relating the variation of the 
<br>
geometrico-algebraic properties of the sets of particles to the variation of 
<br>
this additional 'color' property. Alternatively, I might feel that the space 
<br>
inhabited by the color patches - the visual field - is obviously a different 
<br>
space to the physical space in which the fundamental particles move, and so 
<br>
I might go for (3) - a color-patch is a different sort of *thing*, whose 
<br>
properties include color. I am again free to postulate laws of correlation 
<br>
between particles and color-patches.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that most people in philosophy now want to believe some 
<br>
variation of (1). What was a law of correlation between two things, in 
<br>
hypotheses (2) and (3), becomes a statement of identity in the context of 
<br>
(1): a patch of color *is* a certain sort of set of particles in a certain 
<br>
sort of state. If you are a neuroscientist, you will propose something like: 
<br>
an assembly of neurons (i.e. a certain set of particles) spiking according 
<br>
to a code (i.e. in a certain state, or sequence of states). If you are a 
<br>
computer scientist, you may wish to say that the set of particles need only 
<br>
be an &quot;information processor&quot;, and that the relevant state need only have 
<br>
certain causal relations with the states of various neighboring systems (the 
<br>
environment, other information processors).
<br>
<p>But as I keep saying, assertions of outright identity between qualia and 
<br>
sets of particles are simply not viable. They at least ought to be 
<br>
recognized as highly exotic metaphysical propositions, on a par with 
<br>
asserting that this rock over here is 'actually' the number 2. There is, 
<br>
however, another problem that continues to exist, even if identity theories 
<br>
are modified so as to become dualist theories, and that is the vagueness 
<br>
(underdetermination, to be more precise) of the physical description. Recall 
<br>
that a law of phenomenal-physical correlation says: qualia like this occur 
<br>
always in conjunction with physical states of affairs like that. But as 
<br>
descriptions of physical states of affairs, neither &quot;neuron&quot; nor 
<br>
&quot;causal-functional state&quot; is exact, and fundamental laws need to be exact. 
<br>
(I take it as axiomatic that vagueness is only ever a property of 
<br>
descriptions, but not of the things described. A particle cannot have a 
<br>
position without having a particular position, for example.) A stock example 
<br>
of an inexact or vague predicate is baldness. You're not bald when you have 
<br>
a full head of hair; you are bald if you have none; but what if you have one 
<br>
hair, ten hairs, a thousand hairs; where is the dividing line between bald 
<br>
and not-bald? There is no reason to think that there is any way to answer 
<br>
that question without arbitrary stipulation that, say, 1000 hairs is the 
<br>
most you can have and still be bald.
<br>
<p>But the same consideration applies to the division of microphysical 
<br>
configuration space into &quot;neuron&quot; and &quot;not-neuron&quot;, or even to the division 
<br>
of possible states of a transistor into &quot;one&quot; and &quot;zero&quot;. Fundamentally, we 
<br>
are able to attribute semantic content to transistor states because of their 
<br>
predictable behavior: when we act so as to put it into a &quot;one&quot; state, it 
<br>
usually behaves subsequently as a &quot;one&quot; is supposed to behave. But if we 
<br>
consider all possible distributions of electrons throughout a transistor, 
<br>
there will clearly be marginal cases. These do not matter functionally if 
<br>
they never, or hardly ever, get physically realized in our computers; but 
<br>
they matter ontologically, if we are proposing a new universal law of 
<br>
psychophysical correlation which purports to describe the conditions under 
<br>
which qualia are realized. You have to draw an exact boundary in 
<br>
configuration space and say, these are the ones, these are the zeroes; these 
<br>
are the blue qualia, these are the green qualia; this is the thought of an 
<br>
apple, this is the thought of a red apple. And since neurons, just like 
<br>
transistors, are actually made of trillions of elementary particles, there 
<br>
will be functionally marginal states, and how you divide configuration space 
<br>
will have an element of arbitrariness to it.
<br>
<p>Now, unlike scenario (1), a law of psychophysical correlation of this sort 
<br>
is at least not logically absurd, but this strong element of inescapable 
<br>
arbitrariness, in the details of the coarse-graining of physical 
<br>
configuration space, make it very unattractive, to me at least. I think it 
<br>
would make more sense to suppose that qualia are to be correlated directly 
<br>
with individual exact microphysical states of something, since the laws of 
<br>
correlation are likely to be much cleaner (there will be less scope and less 
<br>
need for arbitrary divisions of configuration space). Thus one might look 
<br>
for low-quantum-number mesoscopic quantum states in the brain, for example.
<br>
<p>Returning to my original assertion that an AI designed according to a 
<br>
functionalist philosophy is unlikely to solve these problems for us, perhaps 
<br>
the key consideration is the nature of self-knowledge. I take it as given, 
<br>
not just that there are qualia, but that there is awareness of qualia, and 
<br>
an associated capacity to reason about their nature, and that this is what 
<br>
makes phenomenological reflection possible in human beings. The 
<br>
functionalist analysis of this situation involves mapping out the formal 
<br>
structure of the causal relationships involved, and a functionalist 
<br>
&quot;implementation&quot; of phenomenological reflection would involve instantiation 
<br>
of that causal structure in a computational medium. However, if the 
<br>
functionalist theory of *qualia* is wrong, then phenomenological reflection 
<br>
would not *actually* be occurring in that computational medium, any more 
<br>
than suffering occurs somewhere in the physical interior of a book, no 
<br>
matter how tragic the tales it tells. And if actual phenomenological 
<br>
reflection is necessary to make progress in the ontology of consciousness 
<br>
and in ontology in general, then that computational medium does not by 
<br>
itself have the capacity to make that progress. An &quot;artificial philosopher&quot; 
<br>
built according to functionalist principles might be able to generate the 
<br>
argument about arbitrariness that I made above, and a user might be able to 
<br>
read the argument and understand it; this &quot;self-reductio ad absurdum&quot; is the 
<br>
closest to philosophical progress that I can see coming from such a 
<br>
situation. But it looks far more likely that a philosophically functionalist 
<br>
AI will simply assist philosophically functionalist humans in devising new 
<br>
epicycles for functionalism.
