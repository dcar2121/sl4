<em>&gt;It would be nice to have an AGI which only offered suggestions of actions a set of human participants could take to realize optimal &gt;scenarios, instead of the AGI being an active player in forcing ver utopia.  Once this AGI is achieved, it would be nice if the actions &gt;proposed by ver excluded any further imput or activity from any AGI-ish entity in effecting each discreet suggestion.  Seems we'd be a &gt;little safer from being steamrolled by the AGI in this regard; us humans could decide what we'd specifically like to preserve at the risk &gt;of sacrificing some degree of efficiency in the grand scheme of things.  FAI needs to enact the &quot;Grandfathering Principle&quot; for it to be &gt;friendly towrds us.
</em><br>
<p>I think this suggestion might be offering a false sense of security; certainly only weak security.  Assuming we haven't come up with a good sequence of actions toward some end without the AGI's help, does implementing the AGI's steps A..Z ourselves really put us in a position of controlling the outcome?  I suppose we could require a strong proof that these steps accomplish *exactly* what we have asked, and nothing more, but how realistic is this?  
<br>
<p>The trade-off of efficiency you mention could be minor or extreme, depending on your standards of proof.  And it would seem to me that any trade-off in efficiency of implementing the &quot;solution&quot; necessarily limits the sphere of possible solutions, due to time dependencies in those actions.  And would break many solutions.  For example, what if the AGI pumps out a plan to avoid a pending planetkill projected in 3 days.  What do you do then?  Do you spend 2 days verifying the causality of the plan, and then spend 5 days implementing it?  Or do you let it out of the &quot;soft box&quot; to which it has been constrained.  And then your left with the same questions: Is it an FAI or not?  Can it be trusted?  Has it been built to be trusted?
<br>
<p>This idea does not give me warm fuzzies.
