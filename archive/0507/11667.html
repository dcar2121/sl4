<p><em>&gt; Has she learnt anything new about colour? If you accept that she has,

</em><br>
<p>Well, I read a good essay by Dennet examining this very experiment in
<br>
The Mind's I. Basically, his argument was that the intuition pump is
<br>
misleading because of the phrase &quot;learned everything about
<br>
vision/seeing red&quot;. We really don't know what knowing &quot;everything&quot;
<br>
about this subject would be like, so our intuitive idea of what this
<br>
amount of knowledge is, is approximately what a very accomplished Ph.D
<br>
or two or three would collectively know on the subject. But taken
<br>
literally, it implies almost infinite amounts of knowledge, most of it
<br>
mostly useless. But certainly we can't rule out the possibility that a
<br>
scientist living in a time where the science of the brain is mature
<br>
and mostly complete would be able to use all of the existing
<br>
scientific knowledge, and knowledge of how her own brain is wired, to
<br>
know exactly what visual impression she would receive from a red
<br>
object. In fact, the situation--knowing &quot;everything&quot; about
<br>
something--is so foreign to us that using it as a thought experiment
<br>
is practicing philosophy on rather shaky grounds.
<br>
<p>Actually, bringing this back to the original point (did this thought
<br>
experiment bear on that point?), I do lend some credence to the
<br>
existence of qualia, and still I have no trouble believing that they
<br>
could arise on purely non-quantum biological devices, or even
<br>
electronic, devices. Now, I have no reason to believe that they do,
<br>
except that most thought apparently does, and it would be quite an
<br>
exception, and a violation of Occam's Razor, to say that it requires a
<br>
fundamentally different kind of device to support them, and I just
<br>
don't see the evidence, nor the justification. The same way that
<br>
Occam's Razor seems to some to discount the possibility of qualia,
<br>
those who see their primary experience as lending evidence to qualia
<br>
ought to apply Occam's Razor to the idea that qualia are somehow
<br>
exceptional processes in the brain, ones that can't be modeled the
<br>
same way the rest of the brain can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't quite understand what kind of threat you could see concerning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an AI suddenly understanding a different ontology and going crazy. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely would this be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The quote marks indicate that you are replying to me, but in fact I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't suggest this.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't mean to imply this. But I believe pdugan did suggest, and I
<br>
could be wrong, that there is a danger in the possibility that an AI
<br>
would find some other universe, or some other mode of existing in this
<br>
one, that lends itself to different modalities and a different
<br>
ontology. I was just inquiring as to what he thinks the exact nature
<br>
of the threat that situation would pose is, besides being existential.
<br>
My first impression is that it's rather unlikely, but he didn't do
<br>
much explaining.
