<p>No, no no!  *Geddes pulls his hair out*  
<br>
<p>You've completely msinterpreted me again (Probably
<br>
because I'm banging out these posts on the fly without
<br>
much thought).
<br>
<p>I'm not suggesting anything non-scientific.  What I'm
<br>
saying is that there's a distinction between
<br>
*prediction* and *projection* , the implications of
<br>
which may not have been fully appreciated by AI
<br>
researchers yet.
<br>
<p>Prediction:  Calculations of determinstic outcomes
<br>
based on fixed initial conditions
<br>
<p>Projection:  Calculations of a *range* of possible
<br>
outcomes based on changing conditions.
<br>
<p>For instance imagine what *you* (Ben) do, when you're
<br>
thinking about your future.  Clearly calculation of
<br>
your future involves *projection*, because the choices
<br>
you make are going to affect the outcomes you
<br>
experience.  So you cannot treat yourself as a purely
<br>
deterministic object, since you cannot have perfect
<br>
knowledge of your own brain state.  On the other hand,
<br>
when you are trying to think about external objects,
<br>
you can in principle make *predictions*, since you
<br>
could in principle know the initial conditions fully
<br>
(to the limits allowed by physical law at least).
<br>
<p>So *projection* is a higher level form of prediction. 
<br>
Now...when trying to calculate the future, an AI would
<br>
have to do more than just simple *predicton*.  The AI
<br>
has to into account *the effects of its own actions*. 
<br>
So the AI cannot treat itself as a purely
<br>
deterministic object, since the AI cannot fully
<br>
predict its own actions (for the same reason you - Ben
<br>
- can't).
<br>
<p>So..the upshot is this... when we are trying to
<br>
predict the future, the effects of our own choices can
<br>
become intermingled with the effects of objects in the
<br>
external world.
<br>
<p>Now...Suppose unfriendly choices are the ones that
<br>
result in greater unpredictability when making future
<br>
projections?  Then unfriendly utilities might indeed
<br>
limit intelligence.
<br>
<p>To see how this could be so, remember that a
<br>
self-improving AI is recursive.  It's top-level system
<br>
includes as a utility - UTILITY ITSELF.  In other
<br>
words, the AI is seeking utilities which help it
<br>
achieve other utility.  Or...to put it another way..
<br>
the process of goal seeking is valued as a goal in
<br>
itself.  The top-level system also includes as a
<br>
utility - PROJECTION, the ability to calculate
<br>
possible outcomes involving CHOICES THE AI ITSELF
<br>
MAKES.
<br>
<p>So look:
<br>
<p>1st recursion:  
<br>
Utility = Utility + Projection
<br>
<p>2nd recursion: 
<br>
Utility = (Utility +Projection) + Projection
<br>
<p>3rd recursion:
<br>
Utility = ((Utility+Projection)+Projection)+Projection
<br>
<p>And so on.  So the projection of future outcomes is
<br>
coming to dominate the utility as the AI
<br>
self-improves, and further, the ability to project is
<br>
intimately tied to the initial utility.
<br>
<p>Now do you see what I'm getting at?
<br>
