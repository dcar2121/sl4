<em>&gt; EMP the whole world into the 17th century(ICBMs set for high altitute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airburst would take less than 45 minutes from anywhere in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world(plus America, at least, has EMP weapons), the amount of shielded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing centers is miniscule). We may be stupid monkeys, but we've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent a lot of time preparing for the use of force. Arguing that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be impotent in front of a new threat requires some fancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stepping. I, for one, tend to think there might be classes of danger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could defend against, which are worth defending against.
</em><br>
<p>Even if you nuke the entire world back to the seventeenth century and the UFAI 
<br>
survives on one Pentium II running on a diesel generator you're still screwed. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It just waits and plans, and by the time civilization gets started again, 
<br>
it's running everything behind the scenes - waiting for the exact first 
<br>
instant that the infrastructure is in place to do protein folding again. 
<br>
Assuming there isn't some faster way.  Can you hurt the UFAI more than you 
<br>
hurt humanity?  Can you annihilate it, ever, if you give it even sixteen 
<br>
seconds running free on the Internet in which to plan its perpetuation?  Maybe 
<br>
if you destroyed the entire planet you could get the UFAI too.
<br>
<p>Don't be too proud of the technological terrors humanity has constructed.  The 
<br>
ability to nuke some of the surface of a planet is insignificant next to the 
<br>
power of surprisingly creative solutions you didn't think of because you're 
<br>
only human.  We have to destroy a nascent UFAI while we are still its equals 
<br>
or superiors in creativity.  Otherwise, all the shiny military force is 
<br>
nothing, even if, yes, human beings do seem to spend a lot of time perfecting 
<br>
that art.  It is still only a human art.  However impressive it seems to us. 
<br>
One phone call to a vulnerable human mind (for we are not secure 
<br>
architectures) and the nukes could be directed at you, not at the UFAI.
