</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordered by their computed probability.  This is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first-order
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; prediction.  Oops, I mean &quot;projection&quot;.  Get as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fancy as you want with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your probability lists, it is a distinction without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a difference.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, the difference is a few lines of code in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is a difference not worth discussing here as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as I can tell.

<p>Hmm, it seems my last post completely passed every-one
<br>
by again *sigh*
<br>
<p>Let me try one last time to explain why I think the
<br>
distinction betwen *Projection* and *Prediction* is
<br>
important.  I will also sketch why I think the
<br>
Bayesian probability framework is seriously incomplete
<br>
(the two points are related).
<br>
<p>O.K, I want every-one on the SL4 list to try to
<br>
*project* their own futures - what do you think you'll
<br>
be doing in:
<br>
<p>(a)  1 hour from now?
<br>
(b)  1 day from now?
<br>
(c)  1 year from now?
<br>
(d)  10 years from now?
<br>
<p>To carry through this process, you have to include in
<br>
your projections the effects of possible courses of
<br>
action that YOU took at earlier times.  Projecting
<br>
forward your life is *not* like projecting forward
<br>
possible outcomes of a chess game for instance.  The
<br>
reason is that the world can exert feed-back on you. 
<br>
To project yourself forward in time to possible
<br>
outcomes, you have to extrapolate not only the results
<br>
of your possible actions on the world, but also THE
<br>
FEED-BACK RESULTING FROM THESE ACTIONS.  So the
<br>
possible futures you're projecting for yourself are
<br>
becoming more and more dependent on previous earlier
<br>
choices you made as you move the projection forward in
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>And this is what breaks Bayes.  It took me a long
<br>
time, but I finally pin-pointed the exact flaw that
<br>
smashes the Bayesian framework.  The flaw in Bayes is
<br>
that it assumes that the objective external things
<br>
being reasoned about can be completely isolated from
<br>
the internal *process of reasoning itself*.
<br>
<p>Is it possible to assign objective probabilities on
<br>
the signfigance of external observations without
<br>
reference to the internal procedures (cognitive
<br>
processes) used to make these observations?  Bayes
<br>
assumes that it is.  I say, it is not.  The same
<br>
external observation can result in a different
<br>
probability based on the *procedure* (cognitive
<br>
process) used to make the observations.
<br>
<p>Comprehende?
