Hi Ben, Joel,
<br>
<p>Ben:
<br>
<em>&gt; Again, the interpretation of the terms in these sentences requires a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of human context -- I wouldn't assume that nonhuman AGI's or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alients would interpret them the same way as us...    The definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is an &quot;other&quot; (i.e. what is a whole system -- a cell? a human? a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society?) isn't even an absolute given... 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed that there is a lot of ambiguity.  The best way for that to be avoided 
<br>
would be an ethic of sticking striclty to one's own planet/home location to 
<br>
minimise contact with anything an AGI could have trouble interpreting.  If 
<br>
AGIs are not rule bound not to leave their home ground (ie. are ethically free 
<br>
to move into the universe then they would have to deal with the 
<br>
ambiguity/uncertainty that you have identified.  All they can do is their very 
<br>
best - however inadeqauate that is.  The task for AGI designers is to create 
<br>
a set of goals/ethics that would ensure that 'the best that can be done' is 
<br>
really good.
<br>
<p>Joel:
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that these golden rules are not something I want to have alien
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species use in judging how they treat me. For instance - a species may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in life sacrifice and that it is the highest honour, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless I believe in their spirituality I don't want an FAI deeming it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; okay because it fits these golden rules (presumably any of the aliens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would volunteer and *want* to be the sacrificial individual)..... 
</em><br>
<p>I think the less common golden rule 2 would cover what you are concerned 
<br>
about:  &quot;don't do unto others what they would have you not do unto them&quot;  
<br>
This would require an AGI to find out your preferences.
<br>
<p>Joel:
<br>
<em>&gt; When other sentient beings actions *intentionally* put the primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests (i.e. existance) of other individuals at risk, then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be prevented from doing so. 
</em><br>
<p>This is basically a &quot;thou shalt not kill (another sentient)&quot; rule as a sort of 
<br>
minimum safeguard.
<br>
<p>It raises the point the Ben made about what does sentient mean in the 
<br>
context of non-Earth life (and there's just a bit of ambiguity about what it 
<br>
means on Earth too). And, are there sentient life forms somewhere out 
<br>
there in the (multi)universe for whom the notion of killing would be hard to 
<br>
interpret?  Could be.
<br>
<p>Which brings me back to the point that trying hard to be friendly seems like 
<br>
a desirable goal - even if mistakes could be made.  But to not try to be 
<br>
friendly increases the probabilty, scale and number of disasters.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
<br>
