Hi Jef,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But when we consider which point of view provides the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanatory capability (even for subjective concepts such as values), a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more objective view provides both the advantage of greater detail as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed out, but similarly provides the advantage of the bigger picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where multiple subjective views combine to cancel out those observations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which don't match their external reality and to reinforce those parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual subjective models which more closely match their external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.  Overall, an increasingly bigger view of thing tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly approximate what works and is thus considered more correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What more is there to say?
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....
<br>
<p>So basically, you're suggesting that objective reality is &quot;more correct&quot;
<br>
because it's &quot;bigger&quot;....
<br>
<p>But isn't it the case that this &quot;biggerness&quot; (of objective as compared to
<br>
subjective reality) only exists from the perspective of objective reality?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the subjective perspective, subjective reality is bigger than objective
</em><br>
reality, isn't it?  Because the former contains a whole bunch of funky
<br>
patterns in addition to the ones that are &quot;objectively real&quot;....
<br>
<p>It seems to me what which sort of reality is bigger, is also a matter of
<br>
perspective....  No?
<br>
<p>-- Ben
