Its intersting you all talk of strings to define subjectivity. Superstring 
<br>
theory talks about a supposedly objective reality which is composed of causal 
<br>
strings connecting particles. Both &quot;objective&quot; models and subjective 
<br>
understandings are comprised of causal associations, which one might describe 
<br>
as a great big string. Maybe we can all agreed that subjectivity and 
<br>
objectivity are just causal assocaitions with different degrees of certainty 
<br>
assigned to different associations. Greater certainty means greater objective 
<br>
reliability, e.g. modern science, while lower certainty means more 
<br>
subjectivity, examples being sociological analysis and poetry as a general 
<br>
description of the universe.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk of smallest (thus most efficient) Turing machine strikes me as 
<br>
highly reminescent of TOE speculations. What if an adequate description of 
<br>
reality was not Turing-compatable? What if reality is so real that any TOE 
<br>
would be unreal in the sense that its a string of characters on a piece of 
<br>
paper trying to describe a subjectivity rather than reality as it is?

<em>&gt;In addition, different observers would recieve different chunks of the

<em>&gt;Combine the strings, overlapping where appropriate, and you can
