<em>&gt;I have thought for some time it would be a good idea to have multi-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human/proto-AGI(s) in close collaboration - a sort of human/AGI complex -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as an early stage in AGI development.  That way humans and AGIs can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolve/grow up together - increasing the chances of mutal understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(A risk of this, if it is not handled well, is that the human/AGI compexes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could become dangerously competitive.  This risk needs to be managed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down to being unlikely)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The competitive nature you allude to, as seen in capitalism and the 
<br>
marginalization of people fallen behind the curve, is all dependant on an 
<br>
economics of scarcity (intellectual credit for this sentance goes to Charlie 
<br>
Stross). In a hyper-internet environment the primary commodity is information, 
<br>
with bandwidth being the secondary commodity. Information is exempt for the 
<br>
Adam Smith conjectures underlying modern capitalism, because it can be copied 
<br>
instantaneously and freely. Bandwidth stands to fall to scarcity value, but 
<br>
this isn't likely at the scale of the earth's surface. I would argue lists 
<br>
like SL4 and the transhuman movement in general is a precursor to the Global 
<br>
Brain, where risks are marginalized by interaction between minds. Of course 
<br>
&quot;Global Brain&quot; is something of a misnomer, since its really about lots of 
<br>
small brains communicating without limit to information abundance or spatial 
<br>
separation; its the discourse, not an actual brain, which is given heightened 
<br>
intelligence by the interaction between disparate minds. Goertzel and 
<br>
Yudkowsky, for instance, are not competitors any more than were Maturana and 
<br>
Varela; that is to say the competition resembles a wisdom tournament more than 
<br>
anything and does not marginalize one or the other.
