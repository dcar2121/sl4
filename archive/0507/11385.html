<p>
I've just read John Anderson's 'Language, Thought and Memory'; light reading
<br>
for a weekend break. It has the highest concentration of GOFAI fallacies I
<br>
have seen yet in a single book, which is pretty impressive after Newell's
<br>
'Unified Theories of Cognition'. There's a lot of black humour in retrospect,
<br>
but in particular I would like to share the following paragraph with you:
<br>
<p>'Despite the fact that it is largely lacking in demonstration programs,
<br>
Norman and Rumelhart assert that their computer system has great potential.
<br>
That is, the representation, parsing schemes, interpretative schemes, etc.
<br>
are so structured that, given sufficient investment of programming time, they
<br>
could form that basis for a very powerful language system. Such claims for a
<br>
system's potential rather than for a system's actual performance are
<br>
frequently made in the artificial intelligence (AI) and carry considerable
<br>
weight in the AI community. It is argued that it would be a waste of
<br>
artificial intelligence researcher's potential to require them to spend the
<br>
years of hack programming required to translate potential into reality. This
<br>
would be an eminently reasonable argument if there were objective criteria
<br>
for evaluating the potential of a system other than its actual performance as
<br>
a concrete system. But there are no such objective criteria.'
<br>
<p>Almost as relevant today as thirty years ago; while contemporary academics
<br>
are perhaps a little more prepared to actually build things, the fraction
<br>
that progresses beyond nontrivial toy examples is very small. While the
<br>
situation is perhaps rather better in the overall space of AGI projects, it
<br>
is unfortunate that while some have realised the importance of working 
<br>
implementations, virtually no-one has been working on the problem of
<br>
objective criteria for evaluating AGI theories. Anderson wastes a couple of
<br>
chapters formally analysing the Turing-equivalence of various models, and
<br>
seems to consider that chunk of logic (along with formal specification of his
<br>
program) adequate to permit the rest of his design characterisation to read
<br>
as a collection of hunches, guesses and wild extrapolations. Alas in this
<br>
regard his work is still compares quite favourably with most contemporary
<br>
efforts.
