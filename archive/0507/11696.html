<p>If you use non-radical techniques of human augmentation, you have serious 
<br>
trouble beating literally every other human in the world.  If you don't create 
<br>
literally the smartest human ever, then you've just wasted who knows how many 
<br>
years of research to accomplish something you could have done with decent 
<br>
recruiting.  Moreover, even if you can beat every other human in the world 
<br>
after ten years, you have to beat them by a fairly sizable amount if your 
<br>
nascent transhumans are to become true experts in less than the ten-year lead 
<br>
time that has been usually found for the training of genius.  No one makes a 
<br>
&quot;genius&quot; contribution without ten years of work, is the usual figure I hear. 
<br>
Let us say that my clock started ticking in 1996... how much faster are these 
<br>
non-radically-augmented transhumans than me, that they can learn in only a 
<br>
year or two how to use their intelligence for something other than defeating 
<br>
itself, and accumulate all the knowledge they need?  And how long did it take 
<br>
you to produce them?
<br>
<p>If you use radical techniques of human augmentation then who can guarantee 
<br>
that even an initially benevolent human would remain so?  The brain is very 
<br>
easy to disturb.  It has a balance, it grows up with a balance, and it has an 
<br>
even harder time repairing that balance after puberty.  Humans are not 
<br>
designed for radical modification.  Everything in the brain is adapted to work 
<br>
in the context of everything else in the brain working the way it does now. 
<br>
Even increasing the input from one area at the expense of others, can throw 
<br>
off the balance enough to result in what we regard as significant neurological 
<br>
damage.
