<em>&gt; I thought I was, but I checked Wikipedia and had got my definitions mixed up,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh, as they apply in the state of nature they're both equally cruel,
<br>
the question is the type of policies they imply. The r-strategist's
<br>
opponent is the inanimate environment; the K-strategist's opponents
<br>
are others of its own kind. Give an oak tree a chainsaw and the
<br>
ability to use it, and what will it do? Start killing as many other
<br>
oak trees as possible. A dandelion won't bother. The difference is
<br>
ratio of force to space: the world looks much more crowded to an oak
<br>
tree than a dandelion. The upshot is that _r-strategy, if implemented
<br>
as behavior, corresponds to the sort of behavior we call morally good;
<br>
K-strategy corresponds to the sort of behavior we call evil_.
<br>
<p>Now suppose you have a species that's basically K-strategist, but with
<br>
a flexible brain, that has encountered a variety of conditions
<br>
including those with low ratio of force to space (lots of sparsely
<br>
occupied territory, environmental hardship is the enemy), and high
<br>
ratio of force to space (you have to dominate or kill others of your
<br>
own kind to get resources), what would we expect to see? Scatter a
<br>
bunch of members of that species over a large landscape where they're
<br>
free to come into contact or avoid each other as they wish, and
<br>
they'll get along fine; lock them in a sealed box with no escape and
<br>
they'll turn on each other.
<br>
<p>CV locks all of humanity in a sealed box with no escape. (The problem
<br>
isn't the Volition part, it's the Collective part.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Starting with present human society, create a world government with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolute knowledge and absolute power, capable not only of seeing into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people's homes a la 1984, but into their very thoughts; with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Constitution (you don't want any hardwired protections, after all) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no escape, ever (nobody gets to opt out of CV). Don't you find it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all reasonable to suggest that society would turn utterly evil very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quickly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's plausible.  But I don't understand why you think this is what CEV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulates.
</em><br>
<p>CEV doesn't _simulate_ it, it _instantiates_ it. The RPOP is a world
<br>
government with absolute knowledge and absolute power.
