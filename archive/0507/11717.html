<p>Oh, I dunno. I think there are probably better thought experiments to

give a person an intuitive feel for what qualia might actually be. But

the experiment does serve that purpose, as long as &quot;knowing

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What new predictions can the scientist make once she actually sees a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She can make new qualitative predictions. Even if I were to accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which I don't), that minds are reducible to brains, perfect physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge could stil only make predictions at the physical level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without a qualitative understanding of &quot;how that feels&quot; to a person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scientist would be un-able to provide a proper description of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience / qualia.
</em><br>
<p>If you were to accept that minds are reducible to brains, I don't
<br>
think you have to throw qualia out the window. I think that an
<br>
ultimate knowledge of the workings of the brain would show a clear
<br>
cause-effect chain between any given neural pattern and the behavior
<br>
it gives rise to. To induce what the state of mind of the person might
<br>
be given these two (very large) pieces of information is a
<br>
straightforward next step. You see certain neural patterns, the person
<br>
is seeing red. Others, and the person is angry. Others, and the person
<br>
feels a slight sense of derealization combined with a bit of
<br>
hypnogogic imagry. A person that knows everything about the brain
<br>
would supposedly be able to read emotions and states of mind like this
<br>
from neural patterns.
<br>
<p>And supposedly, though I think you'll disagree here, they would be
<br>
able to imagine what it would feel like for /them/ to have those
<br>
states of mind, even if their experience with those  states of mind is
<br>
small. Much as a skilled musician can look at a sheet of music and
<br>
hear the melody without ever playing it or having heard it, a person
<br>
with enough skill reading maps or snapshots of neural activity would
<br>
be able to imagine the feeling. Perhaps such a feat would be beyond
<br>
human intelligence.
<br>
<p>OK, let's bring in a superintelligent alien race, and assume they have
<br>
their own inner life. They have a visual modality, but it's based only
<br>
on infrared and lower (?) frequencies. So could this alien race know
<br>
what it feels like to see blue simply by reading a neural map of a
<br>
human? Well, with enough information about the human's brain, (again,
<br>
assuming reductionism,) they could run in their own minds a simulation
<br>
of that human's brain at full speed. (They could probably connect some
<br>
sensory data to the inputs of the human, so that the brain wasn't
<br>
completely deprived of input.) This way they can intimately observe
<br>
every electrical pulse in the whole brain of a live, thinking,
<br>
simulated human. Just as the skilled human reader, except much more
<br>
skilled, they can read and understand the human's thoughts better than
<br>
the person could tell them.
<br>
<p>As the alien lets the human leech of a few of the alien's neurons,
<br>
time passes, and the alien becomes more familiar with the process of
<br>
reading the mind of the human, eventually the alien begins to develop
<br>
a sort of primitive skill in performing the task, as the human's mind
<br>
becomes more an extension of the alien's, the same way a keyboard or
<br>
stilts or a vehicle become an extension of a human's body when handled
<br>
with skill. I think we can call this sort of skill developing a new
<br>
sensory modality, if a layered one. It's something humans are good at.
<br>
If the alien becomes good enough at this, the alien will be able to
<br>
experience a qualia associated with the human's when the human
<br>
experiences the qualia of seeing blue. The alien's qualia will at
<br>
first be self-conscious--the experience of observing someone else
<br>
experience blue. But in the same way that a robotic hand with feedback
<br>
sensors letting a human control it from a distance will be experienced
<br>
as a literal extension of the human's qualitative experience, as part
<br>
of the human's body, eventually this extra layer will disappear with
<br>
the increasing skill of the alien. At this point, what's to say
<br>
there's any meaningful difference between the qualia the alien
<br>
experiences and that which the human does?
<br>
<p>I suppose one could view this as an argument against qualia, but I see
<br>
it only as an argument against non-reductionism. I think qualia are
<br>
only special in the same way that quantum particles (forgive me if
<br>
this terminology is wrong) are special--they're the extremely
<br>
primitive building blocks with which a certain kind of model of the
<br>
universe is constructed. A subjective model of the universe starts
<br>
with qualia and builds from there. In this model, quantum particles
<br>
are an extremely high-level phenomenon, being far removed from the
<br>
qualia, which are the building blocks. In an objective viewpoint,
<br>
however, these quantum particles are the extremely low-level phenomena
<br>
and the qualia are extremely high-level and invisible. Being objective
<br>
as they all are, hard reductionists assume that the qualia have to be
<br>
explained using objective terms, or else they don't exist in the
<br>
objective universe. That's a bit unfair, though. The physical
<br>
particles in the brain that appear to perfectly track qualia can (we
<br>
assume) be objectively observed and verified. But the objective
<br>
viewpoint can only offer an objective explanation, and qualia are, by
<br>
definition, the building blocks of the subjective viewpoint. Building
<br>
blocks in worldviews have no underlying principles, and as such,
<br>
nothing can explain them except as referred to from a different
<br>
viewpoint. We do this going from the subjective viewpoint to the
<br>
objective. We cobble together all of our subjective experience, and,
<br>
by trial-and-error, discover patterns and principles. This becomes the
<br>
scientific method. By careful application, we eventually come to
<br>
observe the existence of quantum particles, the building blocks of the
<br>
objective viewpoint. But our discovery doesn't lend these particles
<br>
any of the immediacy that qualia have for us, because we are bound to
<br>
our subjectivity. While the viewpoints contain each other, in a
<br>
circular fashion, nonetheless, the subjective is the beginning of the
<br>
circle, for us. And it seems that the main imbalance between the two,
<br>
and perhaps the thing that causes so much confusion, is that the human
<br>
neural architecture is capable of assimilating other viewpoints and
<br>
making them its main mode of thought, whereas the objective viewpoint
<br>
has no primary sentience that we know of.
<br>
<p>Sorry if none of this directly addresses your concerns, but I do think
<br>
it does provide evidence that qualia, (if they completely track
<br>
physical, neural processes,) can be experienced, and thus &quot;described&quot;
<br>
or &quot;predicted&quot; by other sentience with only a physical knowledge of
<br>
the brain processes giving rise to the qualia.
