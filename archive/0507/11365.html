<p>
Something I've not seen addressed, perhaps because I haven't been
<br>
looking, in all this speculation about the best supergoal for an seed
<br>
AI is whether we shouldn't really be worried about doing much more
<br>
than keeping the AI from failing after a takeoff. Here's my idea:
<br>
instead of trying to come up with a supergoal that will somehow do the
<br>
right thing in every circumstance, we just try to find the goal that
<br>
will allow the AI to become superintelligent without endangering
<br>
anyone, and that allows the AI some basic communication ability, and
<br>
then the AI can come up with a better goal system for an even better
<br>
AI.
<br>
<p>I would guess that limiting the scope thusly wouldn't really buy us
<br>
much, if anything, in the way of simplifying the task of making a
<br>
Friendly seed AI. Would it really? Or is that approach already the one
<br>
being taken?
<br>
<p>I think this means that domains (as an alternative to CV, if that
<br>
makes sense) are out of the scope of discussion--we don't want our
<br>
*first* iteration transhuman divvying up the universe first thing
<br>
after takeoff--but I think CV is probably worth thinking about,
<br>
because it might be directly crucial to the Friendliness of any AI
<br>
period. But perhaps it should be in a context where the AI is limited
<br>
to determining the collective volition of humans as concerning the
<br>
best behavior for the AI, and vis actions are explicitly limited to
<br>
interacting verbally with humans, or some other safeguard, until the
<br>
OK is given.
<br>
<p>Of course, the discussion in the past few days has been regarding
<br>
worst case scenarios, and no matter how many safeguards we put into a
<br>
seed AI--no matter how limited we make its scope of action--the real
<br>
risks involved with takeoff are unchanged, and this discussion is
<br>
justified.
