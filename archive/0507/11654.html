hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You have to demonstrate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; qualia can be detected from outside the system.  They can't be.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Interestingly, my reaction to this statement of yours is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your initial reaction to my paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In other words, in these sentences, you seem to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stringing together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words in a completely meaningless, empty and useless way ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Empty and useless?  Then I guess the entire scientific method is empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and useless.  My statement reformulated the same clear premise.
</em><br>
<p>The scientific method is not nearly as simple as you suggest, see my
<br>
thoughts on that in
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/PhilosophyOfScience_v2.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/PhilosophyOfScience_v2.htm</a>
<br>
<p>-- an essay I *am* pretty happy with...
<br>
<p>Science often involves the introduction of explanatory concepts as part of
<br>
overarching theoretical frameworks, even when these concepts are hard to
<br>
rigorously define or measure.  An example is &quot;force&quot; in classical physics.
<br>
What is &quot;force&quot;, actually?  It's a totally unnecessary concept in classical
<br>
physics, yet it has a great heuristic power, so it's convenient to think of
<br>
it as &quot;real&quot;....  But in the end it's just a crutch for allowing us to infer
<br>
new patterns from old....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Basically, what you do here is to implicitly define &quot;exist&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rules out qualia, and then say qualia don't exist.  Big deal!  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interesting question is: what is the right definition of &quot;exist&quot; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it also rules out invisible pink unicorns.  And until you can put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth a reasoned and recurrently verifiable way to distinguish between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two from an objective perspective, I can continue to treat them as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same kind of thing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as a moderately relevant side point, the hypothesis of invisible pink
<br>
unicorns (like the hypothesis of aether) seems not to lead to useful
<br>
verifiable hypotheses.  The hypothesis of qualia (much like &quot;force&quot;) does
<br>
seem to...
