Same problem though.  Wherever our verification latency exceeds the time constraints on executing a particular action path, we need to be able to implicitly trust the AI to act.  The planetkill need not be a deception; but how would we know one way or the other?  An FAI would be informing us on a real threat, and a UFAI would be exploiting a race condition against us.

This doesn't sound like an FAI to me.  From above, it sounds like you agree that if we fail at FAI, it's game over.  
<br>
<p>I once thought I was pretty good at chess.  Then I played against a 2200 rated opponent, who happened to be taking a class with me.  We played about 17 moves to checkmate, but it was game over after the first 6!  I just didn't know it yet.  In retrospect, every move I made after that was compelled by my friend.  
<br>
<p>We'd better get our first moves right.
