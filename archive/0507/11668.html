<p>
Am I missing something, or is this conversation about an exact retread
<br>
of old conversations on AI boxing? If I'm missing something, could
<br>
someone point out what it is? If not, could both the infidels and the
<br>
true believers please lay off?
<br>
<p>Everyone is arguing against the other's subjective estimation of the
<br>
probability that a superhuman intelligence (something we have exactly
<br>
no experience with) could invoke unknown physics or advanced
<br>
psychology (something we have exactly no experience and a little
<br>
experience with, respectively) to escape a human-created box. Arguing
<br>
one's subjective impressions of the world against another's rarely
<br>
produces anything productive, except where anecdotes and thought
<br>
experiments can be useful. But in this case, no convincing thought
<br>
experiments can be made, because the point of the anti-box side is
<br>
that there are unknowns that we should be cautious about, and the
<br>
point of the pro-box side is that the unknowns aren't likely enough.
<br>
Anecdotes about unknowns are particularly poor in playing upon
<br>
people's beliefs.
<br>
<p>This kind of thing has little chance of producing anything productive,
<br>
except perhaps that sometimes another person might be convinced by the
<br>
right side of the argument (whatever that is). Rarely are the people
<br>
arguing convinced, though. (I've never seen it.) When people keep
<br>
retreading old ground like this, it seems like the forum is broken.
<br>
<p>I thought I'd get this in before the killthread, as I've never seen a
<br>
meta-discussion on AI-boxing, and it might be more fruitful than the
<br>
actual discussion.
