<em>&gt; &gt; What you're pointing out is basically the (in)famous &quot;hard problem of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness&quot;, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I addressed this in an essay a while back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow, I thought I was reading Marc Geddes there.  :)  But seriously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've presented a lot of ideas without any method of verification.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, that is not really true...
<br>
<p>It's true that I don't describe specific experiments in that essay -- but
<br>
that essay contains a combination of purely philosophical content
<br>
(unverifiable like all pure philosophy is) and philosophy-guided scientific
<br>
hypothesis.
<br>
<p>For instance, that essay contains the hypothesis
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
that the brain processes associated with consciousness will be the brain
<br>
processes associated with representing newly perceived or conceived
<br>
patterns, enacting new patterns, or taking pattern-codes out of memory and
<br>
reassembling them into patterns once again.
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>If you want to make this into a scientific hypothesis that will please the
<br>
Dennett-oid hypermaterialist consciousness-deniers of the world, just
<br>
rephrase it as:
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
that the brain processes associated with [verbal reports of] consciousness
<br>
will be the brain processes associated with representing newly perceived or
<br>
conceived patterns, enacting new patterns, or taking pattern-codes out of
<br>
memory and reassembling them into patterns once again.
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>Then you can think of this as a scientific hypothesis about *verbal reports
<br>
of consciousness* among humans, and you can dodge the question of whether
<br>
&quot;verbal reports of consciousness&quot; relate to any kind of &quot;real qualia.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, if the hypothesis of qualia is found to consistently suggest
<br>
scientific hypotheses that wind up to be validated by experiment [and I know
<br>
this hasn't happened yet, but the science of consciousness is still very
<br>
young], then this would seem to be some sort of justification for the
<br>
hypothesis, no?
<br>
<p>This latter sentence is in fact an argument that qualia may be roughly as
<br>
&quot;real&quot; as electrons, or trees, are.  The electron is a fictitious entity --
<br>
it's a way of organizing data from various instruments, and assuming it
<br>
exists helps us to generate a lot of valid hypotheses.  So we talk as if
<br>
electrons are real when in fact all there are, are patterns.  The same
<br>
argument in fact applies to trees.  Electrons, trees and qualia are all
<br>
concepts that we create in order to organize the patterns we experience.
<br>
