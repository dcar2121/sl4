On 7/19/05, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Universalising%20an%20AGI's%20duty%20of%20care">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; That would explain the Fermi Paradox.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so - however few or many inhabited star systems there
<br>
may be in our past light cone, it is certain that the vast majority
<br>
did not give rise to intelligent life; each of those stars is simply
<br>
wasting energy at the rate of thousands to billions of tons per
<br>
second; letting resources go to waste like that wouldn't be very
<br>
intelligent (unless one follows the 'well, _really_ advanced
<br>
civilizations emigrate to hyperspace' style of argument, which as you
<br>
observe makes no further predictions even if true).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But would you really want aliens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permit the Holocaust?
</em><br>
<p>No, but that isn't the relevant question. Of course when considering
<br>
alien help, we choose an event that is horrific to _us_ and say, well
<br>
we'd have liked intervention to stop it. What if the aliens think the
<br>
Holocaust is an artistic performance noble in its tragic beauty, and
<br>
their dilemma is whether to intervene against the Allies?
<br>
<p>(Of course, the whole &quot;noble in its tragic beauty&quot; idea, while
<br>
deliberately perverse, is _humanly_ perverse. I imagine if we really
<br>
meet aliens, they'll be surprisingly like us in some ways, while
<br>
strange in some ways it had never occurred to us there could be
<br>
variation on.)
<br>
<p>For a less strange idea, suppose the choice is between the Holocaust
<br>
and Prime Intellect - which would you choose? Or for another take,
<br>
read Iain Banks' Culture short story about the Contact Section survey
<br>
of Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you let it occur on some alien world, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could see, and knew, and had the power to stop it?
</em><br>
<p>In the extremely unlikely event that I'm ever called upon to make that
<br>
decision, while my emotional reaction would be that I want to stop it,
<br>
I'm going to have to think very carefully about all the consequences,
<br>
not just the immediate ones, before I decide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If third parties stepped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in to help those who wished help, would you fight to stop them?
</em><br>
<p>No. There's a difference between &quot;I am not confident enough to
<br>
intervene&quot; and &quot;I am confident enough to stop other people
<br>
intervening&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any force that interdicts our world, preventing even others from helping us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would wish to be helped, then I cannot consider them as friends.
</em><br>
<p>If it turns out that is the case, I'll reserve judgement until I'm in
<br>
possession of more of the facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back to the disturbing question of aliens with alien motives successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructing FAI, a useless hypothesis that explains anything and everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and makes no further predictions even if it's true.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if you follow the logic of the interdiction hypothesis far
<br>
enough, it ends up being equivalent to the simulation hypothesis; my
<br>
reaction to which is to say &quot;oh, cool&quot; and go about my business as
<br>
before.
<br>
