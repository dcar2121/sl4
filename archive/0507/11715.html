<em>&gt;Theorem: The two sets of meta-properties (Efficiency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Predictive power) and (Goals promoting expansion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of complexity in goal system and goals promoting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduction in goal clashes with other agents) are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correlated IF AND ONLY IF it is possible to fully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convert the descriptions of computational functions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into descriptions of cognitive agents and visa versa.
</em><br>
<p><p><p><em>  &gt;Damn, now we're getting somewhere. Maybe. 
</em><br>
<p><p><em>  &gt;I read this as suggesting the correlation between
</em><br>
low-level logic 
<br>
<em>&gt;(functions) and high-level volition (agents) is real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only if Friendliness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(reduced volitional clashing) is dependant on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prediction and intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(extrapolating complexity) is dependant on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficiency. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt; He earlier suggested a deeper, perhaps quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computative nessecity for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendliness which goes beyond deterministic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prediction, he called it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projection. I'd say this theorem is obvious to most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people on the list, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Geddes himself doesn't believe it. How very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;devious.

<p>Nah, you've totally misinterpreted me.  I'm sure you
<br>
meant well.  I was simply putting forward another
<br>
formulation of the 'Objective Morality' conjecture.
<br>
<p>I pointed out that there are two different levels of
<br>
organization for programming languages:
<br>
<p>*Agent languages (dealing with concepts about
<br>
'agents')
<br>
<p>*Ordinary programming languages
<br>
<p>I was pointing out that there has to be a way to
<br>
translate between these two types of languages, and
<br>
suggested that Friendliness naturally falls out as a
<br>
logical consequence of the fact that you *can*
<br>
translate between the two levels of organzation ie 
<br>
Intelligence imples Friendliness and visa versa i.e
<br>
Objective Morality.
<br>
<p>No one is listening to me any more, so best leave the
<br>
dead horse alone O.K?  Thanks man.
<br>
<p>Just to clarify, I also don't think there's anything
<br>
mystical about intelligence or consciousness.  I think
<br>
consciousness is entirely dependent on physical
<br>
proccesses and that intelligence is completely
<br>
computational.  No mysticism required.
<br>
<p><p><p>A short point on Intuition:
<br>
<p>Whilst I made many silly wild guesses on list, I've
<br>
been totally consistent about my main 'intuitions'
<br>
ever since I first came to SL4.  Main points:
<br>
<p><p>*There is an objective (universal) value system
<br>
<p>*General intelligence without qualia is impossible
<br>
<p>*The Bayesian probability framework is seriously
<br>
incomplete
<br>
<p>I added some another big consistent 'intuitional'
<br>
assertion a while back when I started repeatibly
<br>
saying:
<br>
<p>*There are 7 universal knowledge domains
<br>
<p>Just to clarify what I mean by this:
<br>
<p>*There are 7 fundamentally different ways to
<br>
mathematically represent objective reality.  Each of
<br>
these 7 different mathematical formulations provides a
<br>
different but equally valid perspective.    None the
<br>
less, these 7 different mathematical view-points all
<br>
map to each other.  By 'map to each other', I meant
<br>
all 7 view-points are logically equivalent....almost
<br>
;) 
<br>
<p><p>So far I haven't heard a single logical argument which
<br>
proves me wrong.  Surely if I'm 'nuts' it should be
<br>
easy to prove me wrong.
<br>
<p>I certainly look forward to finding out just who among
<br>
us on SL4 was 'stupid' , once the full theory of FAI
<br>
is completed.
