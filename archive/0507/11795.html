<p>
It it trivial to prove that experience is not descriptively reducible
<br>
to physics for humans. The thought experiment that I put shows that.
<br>
<p>Materialists are given to reducing this to their own position: that
<br>
all experiential descriptions are equivalent to a materialist
<br>
description.
<br>
<p>Their claim is rooted in faith that there is no difference between the
<br>
material brain and mind, other perhaps that a purely nominative debate
<br>
what what names to give to what things.
<br>
<p>There is no way to prove this claim other without begging the question
<br>
given current physics and theory of mind. It is nothing more than a
<br>
leap of faith to believe a materialist position, because we have a
<br>
significant lack in both our theory and our empirical abilities in
<br>
this area. There is no true science which establishes either position.
<br>
<p>The suggestion is that the mind is capable of producing experience,
<br>
which is essentially a dualist position if pure materialism is taken
<br>
to be the thruth - viz. matter is the only existing thing.
<br>
<p>It is certainly unclear that the resolution to this problem could not
<br>
be an expansion of materialism to include new kinds of non-matter
<br>
materials, or matter of a fundamentally different quality to that
<br>
which constitutes unconscious objects.
<br>
<p>One could pose a positions whereby qualia are not a necessity of
<br>
consciousness, but allow me to proceed as though they were : there is
<br>
an analogous argument even if this is not accepted.
<br>
<p>Humans are conscious. We know this from &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; and
<br>
extent this by analogy to other similar organisms. This is not
<br>
philosophically necessitated by our knowledge of our own
<br>
consciousness, but is an acceptable epistemological risk.
<br>
<p>We can distinguish our consciousness from our materialist knowledge
<br>
precisely because, as has already been put, &quot;learning to do something&quot;
<br>
is different from &quot;knowing how to do something&quot;.
<br>
<p>It is not possible, given current states of science, to proceed either
<br>
in our own minds or purely in terms of prediction of the actions of
<br>
others, from a materialist world-description to a description of
<br>
qualia. In a very real sense, the names given to qualia are primitive
<br>
in the sense that they are not made up of other, composite entities.
<br>
They are &quot;simples&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hatred&quot; for example, is not intuitively deemed to describe anything
<br>
which can be broken into parts.
<br>
<p>If hatred is truly reducible to a materialist description, there
<br>
should be something about hatred which is in conflict -- it should not
<br>
be true that it is a &quot;simple&quot;.
<br>
<p>Even if you accept a matter-based description of brains, it is
<br>
impossible to reduce the meaning of the word hatred to any definition
<br>
which is made up purely of other components. Hatred is neither complex
<br>
nor describable in terms of other things.
<br>
<p>The position of the materialist is that this, while true, is a
<br>
function of our minds rather than something which is genuinely true.
<br>
The problem with the materialist position is that they provide no
<br>
justification for truth other than positions which are entirely
<br>
confined to the materialist positions.
<br>
<p>How is it that materialists can justify their truths? Is it practical
<br>
verifiability of predictions? If so, then we can clearly not come to a
<br>
good conclusion about minds and brains - it is simple *bad science* to
<br>
conclude from our current state of knowledge that minds are reducible
<br>
to predictable models in terms of our existing physics. If it is the
<br>
in-principle verifiability of predictions, then we clearly have
<br>
excellent reasons to doubt the quality of our existing physics.
<br>
<p>Adopting a materialist position which denies the value of qualia seems
<br>
to me to be simple stupidity, or perhaps at best gullibility.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
-T
