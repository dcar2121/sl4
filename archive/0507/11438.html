Well, not really.  I intended to avoid the well-known recursive trap of 
<br>
saying that any subjective POV can be proved to be &quot;correct.&quot;  Also, 
<br>
using the simple adjective &quot;bigger&quot; blurs the meaning I intended with 
<br>
&quot;encompassing&quot;.  My key point, which has relevance to this group, was 
<br>
eliminated with the simplification.
<br>
<p>My intended meaning was as follows:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* All agents necessarily operate from a subjective point of view--an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internal model of themselves within their environment.  All
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessment of value or meaning is within the context of this model
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knowable (to self or others) only via the behavior (internal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and external physical changes) of the agent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Ultimately, to say that something is &quot;correct&quot; means only to say
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it works (achieves the expected outcome) within the given
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;context.  Even the &quot;truths&quot; of mathematics are subject to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reassessment upon new discoveries which increase the scope of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model doing the assessment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* We observe that there is a kind of universal &quot;ratchet effect&quot; such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that some systems have relatively greater fitness within their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment and these systems tend to persist and grow in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complexity.  We (subjective observers) will tend to agree that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what persists and grows is what &quot;works&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* This universal ratchet effect applies as well to us subjective
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agents.  As we expand our context of awareness (our internal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model) from the limited subjective to more encompassing shared
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intersubjective awareness, this more encompassing model of reality
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will have been tested within a larger competitive environment and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the result will tend toward greater fitness, meaning a more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accurate model (within that environment.)
<br>
<p><p>Bottom line:  There is strong asymmetry between subjective and objective 
<br>
point of view, and there is a universal tendency toward increasingly 
<br>
objective models.
<br>
<p>That said, I have taken the red pill, traveled down the rabbit hole, and 
<br>
have been reminded that there is no effective way to convince any 
<br>
subjective agent, without meta-engineering them from outside their 
<br>
subjective context, that their point of view is other than what they 
<br>
think it is.

<p><em>&gt;But isn't it the case that this &quot;biggerness&quot; (of objective as compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subjective reality) only exists from the perspective of objective reality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From the subjective perspective, subjective reality is bigger than objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality, isn't it?  Because the former contains a whole bunch of funky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patterns in addition to the ones that are &quot;objectively real&quot;....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems to me what which sort of reality is bigger, is also a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective....  No?
