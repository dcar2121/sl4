In my view MNT is essential if we are to get to a truly Abundant world
<br>
on multilple levels congruent with our benevolent goals and perhaps
<br>
essential to human survival.  Many of the current global tensisions
<br>
that threaten devastation play off of actual or assumed scarcity. 
<br>
Ecological dangers are much easier to diffuse given MNT.  Life
<br>
exntension and ending aging and more or less ending unwanted death are
<br>
greatly enabled by MNT.  Yes, MNT may be used for ill but the good it
<br>
enables is the very essence of what keeps me firmly in the
<br>
transhumanist camp.  It is the veritable substance of many dreams long
<br>
hoped for.
<br>
<p>The idea that a true AGI can be brute forced by more computational
<br>
power has had various times been touted as a near truism and as bunk
<br>
by many of the same voices.  The notion that lack of tht much power
<br>
will make it more likely that those brighter folk into FAI will create
<br>
AGI faster than other bright people perhaps less interested in
<br>
Friendliness is questionable at best.  A more worrisome question is
<br>
whether we can afford to wait for that slower development. 
<br>
Relinquishment is not an option when it comes to MNT for reasons
<br>
capably discussed elsewhere.
<br>
<p>I do not believe that the world can continue without one or both of
<br>
AGI (friendly or at least not decidedly unfriendly) and MNT much
<br>
longer (say as little as 5-10 years) without a major economic and/or
<br>
military catastrophe sufficient to put most of our dreams out of reach
<br>
for at least a generation.  It could be a LOT worse than that.
<br>
<p>We can't stand still and the paths forward are  fraught with peril. 
<br>
It is not obvious that getting MNT first will doom us.  It not obvious
<br>
that SAI  will be created any time soon even with MNT.   FAI is less
<br>
obvious still.
