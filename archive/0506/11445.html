<p><em>&gt; Control isn't a valid measure of intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>That's right; earlier I called it a signal characteristic. I mean
<br>
to say that it's highly correlated with intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is a valid measure of intelligence is optimization. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that best optimize their desires are truly the most intelligent.
</em><br>
<p>Well, be wary of definitions yourself. It runs into trouble with
<br>
what you say below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example... Those that make significant progress towards a safe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity or towards molecular nanotechnology are the most intelligent, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they are actually working to change their environment to optimally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy their desires.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that this is a good inference. Suppose that another person
<br>
judges that it's all hopeless and an evil AI will take over, or he
<br>
estimates that it won't happen until he's frozen, or (despite his
<br>
intelligence) figures that his own talents won't help all that much,
<br>
or figures that galactic contact is imminent, or... any number
<br>
of things. This person *could* turn out to be right even though the
<br>
majority here wouldn't bet on it. In any case, we really can't draw
<br>
valid conclusions about his intelligence.
<br>
<p>Of course, one may rightly say that those working on these goals we
<br>
admire are, other things being equal, more intelligent than those
<br>
who are not. But it's just a statistical relationship.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd speculate that lower organisms probably optimize their desires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even better than we do,  but have simpler, more transient desires.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is where your statement above runs into trouble. Few
<br>
will follow you in concluding that those lower organisms are more
<br>
intelligent than humans.
<br>
