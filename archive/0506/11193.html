<em>&gt; In hindsight this list probably wasn't the best place to post to when

</em><br>
<p>*nods* I understand where you're coming from; we've had Extropy-chat
<br>
flooded with an acrimonious debate on abortion for the last few weeks,
<br>
and can probably do without having SL4 flooded with an acrimonious
<br>
debate on criminal justice for the next few weeks, so I'll refrain
<br>
from further comment on that topic other than to express my sympathy
<br>
to the person involved, and hope they recover okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So this got me thinking once we are able to read minds and an FAI can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload us while also examining our memories, what should happen when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes that have never been revealed or had justice done come to light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'm talking about major offenses like murder, rape, assault)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should individuals memories be off limits for examination by FAI or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any information found just ignored?
</em><br>
<p>My opinion on this is that the objective of Singularity strategy
<br>
should be to preserve the human race and the potential of sentient
<br>
life. We should _not_ expect FAI to be a magic genie for solving all
<br>
the world's problems - if it can stop evolution moving past the region
<br>
of state space in which sentience exists, that'll be more than enough.
<br>
<p>Now, trying to use it to solve all unsolved crimes strikes me as
<br>
dangerous - sure, it would be nice to catch murderers that way as far
<br>
as it goes; then what happens if the RIAA chip in their desire to use
<br>
it to catch everyone who's ever copied music? This gets very messy and
<br>
very dangerous very quickly. I'm inclined to think we should
<br>
concentrate on using FAI to save the world and leave criminal justice
<br>
to the mechanisms that have been established to handle it, however
<br>
imperfect those mechanisms may at times be.
