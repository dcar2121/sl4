<p>I have not previously attacked you in this forum.
<br>
However, if you actually believe what you are
<br>
saying right now, and are not saying it under
<br>
duress (are you?) then you are a fool. The United
<br>
States government is no longer democratically
<br>
elected, and 'working within the system' has in
<br>
the last generation only worked for those who
<br>
were subverting it, and they don't care about
<br>
future generations. If you want proof, I can
<br>
inundate you with it offlist.
<br>
<p>For this and other reasons, what is being
<br>
discussed here is of existential importance to
<br>
the human race, and nobody knows for sure how to
<br>
handle it.
<br>
<p>Me, I only respond when I think I can say
<br>
something useful that perhaps nobody else will.
<br>
This is rare, so I speak little.
<br>
<p>Thus I don't object if you stick your neck out on
<br>
arcana; it's your affair, and if others get hot
<br>
and bothered over it, that is their affair. Hey,
<br>
it's a tough room. Says so right on the door. To
<br>
assert, however, that A:) 'it's not that
<br>
important' and B:) 'the proper authorities will
<br>
handle it', then I must shout wrong! and wrong
<br>
again!, and on the most basic Futurism 101
<br>
questions. Rather a thousand good-natured wild
<br>
guesses than one whiff of such fatal complacency.
<br>
Courage, man!
<br>
