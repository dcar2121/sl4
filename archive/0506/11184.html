<p>
Joel,
<br>
<p>Well, we've all had that feeling from time to time -- but one obvious 
<br>
problem with making this sort of judgment is that one person's hero is 
<br>
another person's &quot;asshole.&quot;  I think I'm a pretty good guy but I've been 
<br>
called a &quot;complete asshole&quot; and worse before -- and I'm really glad the 
<br>
people who did so lacked the will and/or power to annihilate me....  For 
<br>
instance, I once supported a girlfriend's choice to abort; which in the view 
<br>
of some makes me an accomplice to murder....
<br>
<p>Another point is that, within one's own mind, it seems to cultivate 
<br>
emotional health better to feel COMPASSION toward those one feels are 
<br>
&quot;complete assholes&quot; rather than to feel anger.  Anger creates rampant 
<br>
illusions and all sorts of emotional problems; compassion -- if it's 
<br>
experienced genuinely along with an acknowledgement of others' faults as 
<br>
well as one's own -- creates a more happy and productive internal landscape. 
<br>
Of course, this is basically Buddhism 101.  I'm highly anti-religious, but 
<br>
when I was experiencing a lot of anger a couple years ago (divorce-related) 
<br>
I started practicing the variant of Buddhist meditation practice described 
<br>
in this funny little book:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0877739544/103-1818509-4402262?v=glance">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0877739544/103-1818509-4402262?v=glance</a>
<br>
<p>It was quite helpful to me, although I've drifted away from the practice now 
<br>
due to over-busyness....  In fact, I'd probably be better off at the moment 
<br>
if I'd stuck with it....  I didn't view it as a belief system, not at all, 
<br>
just as a set of mental and physical practices for optimizing human 
<br>
emotional/philosophical/cognitive functioning....
<br>
<p>Anyway as my basic ethical principles I have chosen &quot;freedom, joy and 
<br>
growth&quot; ... &quot;joy&quot; being interpreted universally having the implication of 
<br>
compassion; freedom implying that the complete-assholes-from-my-perspective 
<br>
still get the right to exist ... although our mutual joy will be greater if 
<br>
we don't have to live in the same region of the universe...
<br>
<p>I admit that human life sucks sometime, but in trying to resolve this 
<br>
suckiness, I find it more productive to
<br>
<p>a) look at how my own cognitive/emotional systems prevent me from 
<br>
experiencing maximum joy and doing the maximum amount of interesting 
<br>
things... and then try to fix these internal problems
<br>
<p>b) work on upgrading humanity ...
<br>
<p>rather than think about taking revenge on &quot;evil&quot; people...
<br>
<p>Also, if we want to preserve *humanity* past the Singularity, we're going to 
<br>
be preserving the shitty aspects as well as the ones we like better. 
<br>
Personally I don't think that preserving humanity as-is has very much value. 
<br>
But I do think that if there's a friendly Singularity then afterwards there 
<br>
will be ample options for humans to live in custom universes with other 
<br>
humans of their choosing -- so the complete-assholes-to-me (who also mostly 
<br>
think I'm a complete asshole, an accomplice to murder or whatever) will be 
<br>
in the mini-verse nextdoor and won't be pestering me or vice versa...
<br>
<p>-- Ben

Subject: Humans are not equal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to start a large argument, but how does one manage to continue to want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone to become immortal when they are complete assholes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously speaking from personal experience, but I found that certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have done things that don't respect a person's right such as who to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be physically close to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am at a cross roads as to whether to forgive and forget.. working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards singularity goals, or to become a vigilanty and bring people to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate justice and removal of life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm trying to remain sane, but why should these people who don't respect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other's rights remain in existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joel
</em><br>
