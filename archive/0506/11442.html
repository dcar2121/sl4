<em>&gt; The degree to which an entity is able to establish control over its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment is a signal characteristic of its level of intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, humans are the most intelligent of Earth's present species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as is indicated by the control that groups of humans are able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exert over their surroundings. On this measure, of course, people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fail to show really exalted intelligence: were a person suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleported to the bottom of the ocean or into deep space, he or she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't last long. Not even that, but even under ideal conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are done for in less than a century.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the relative amounts of control exerted by organisms on
<br>
their environments are probably less to do with intelligence and more
<br>
to do with the desire to exert control. A bacterium is (assumedly)
<br>
perfectly happy controlling the environment by turning substrates into
<br>
waste products and asexually reproducing.
<br>
<p>Besides, I think as humans we have very little control. We know we
<br>
have to make major changes to the way we are living if we are going to
<br>
remain in existance over the next century, but can we do anything
<br>
about it? We have as much control as a bacterium in a sea of other
<br>
bacteria churning through resources.
<br>
<p>Also, if control was some indication of intelligence, then assumably
<br>
the people in the most powerful positions would be the most
<br>
intelligent? (And I *really* doubt this to be true).
