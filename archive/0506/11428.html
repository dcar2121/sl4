</em><br>
<p>Maybe not, but I'm not sure attacking creationism head on is the most
<br>
effective strategy. It might be better to seek its roots.
<br>
<p>What's the motive for creationism in the first place? It's not general
<br>
luddism or antirationalism, or its advocates would also be attacking
<br>
astronomy, physics and chemistry; they'd be trying to persuade people
<br>
the planets are mounted on crystal spheres turned by angels, and life
<br>
works by mystic protoplasm rather than molecular machinery. Granted,
<br>
there are a handful of people who make such claims, but everyone
<br>
recognizes them as being a handful of fruitcakes; evolution is the one
<br>
scientific theory on which religiously motivated attacks receive
<br>
significant mainstream support. Why?
<br>
<p>I think what it boils down to is that evolution is seen to be linked
<br>
with nihilism; and frankly, if you look at today's writings on
<br>
evolution, it's understandable why people make that mistake. And if
<br>
it's a choice between throwing out a scientific theory (even a true
<br>
one) and throwing out the moral fabric that holds civilization
<br>
together and gives meaning to life, choosing the first option is
<br>
arguably the _right_ thing to do.
<br>
<p>So there's no point in just throwing scientific arguments in people's
<br>
faces when the issue, as far as they're concerned, is a moral one. If
<br>
you want to make headway against creationism, I think the most
<br>
effective way to do it is to decouple evolution from nihilism; to
<br>
explain why there is no contradiction between the propositions &quot;humans
<br>
evolved from apes&quot; and &quot;the universe has a good purpose&quot;.
