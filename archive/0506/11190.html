In hindsight this list probably wasn't the best place to post to when
<br>
I was so emotionally charged. I've slept on it and the person is the
<br>
actual victim of the crime has convinced me to let it go.
<br>
<p>The worst thing about it however is that these people, formally
<br>
refered to as assholes, will never be brought to justice for a variety
<br>
of reasons. So they may even perpertrate the same crime on other
<br>
victims.
<br>
<p>So this got me thinking once we are able to read minds and an FAI can
<br>
upload us while also examining our memories, what should happen when
<br>
crimes that have never been revealed or had justice done come to light
<br>
(I'm talking about major offenses like murder, rape, assault)?
<br>
<p>Should individuals memories be off limits for examination by FAI or
<br>
any information found just ignored?

<em>&gt; Well, there are several different questions being rolled into one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, only some of which are on topic for SL4; let me separate a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them out:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Abstract moral philosophy. We could debate that until oblivion comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us and neither would move the other's opinion so much as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanometer, so I will refrain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity strategy. That would actually be on topic, but as far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm concerned the Singularity has far bigger issues to worry about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not that we have agreement on those either!) so I will let that pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Justice. Now, here I will comment: If a man murders a member of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family, and you decide to forgive him, that represents, to steal a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrase from Terry Pratchett, the flipside of the coin of which good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and evil are on the same side; no further comment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, however, it is someone else's family and you deny the family of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the victim their right to justice - if you advocate preserving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderer's life regardless of their wishes, take his side against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theirs - then you fall into the same category as the murderer; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy and your actions are evil, plain and simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
