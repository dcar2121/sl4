That this was the case was noted online within an hour of those polling numbers being 
<br>
released, and reasonable analysis at that time gave numbers that matched the final results 
<br>
just fine.  The outcome was fairly certain to the quants before the election even started and 
<br>
only self-deluded political groupies thought otherwise.  My own publicly stated quant 
<br>
analysis in early 2003 for the popular vote (51.5 +/- 1.0 for Bush IIRC) was surprisingly 
<br>
accurate.  The strongly Democrat leaning audience thought the prediction was mad without 
<br>
any regard for how I arrived at it because they found the result uncomfortable.  Denial about 
<br>
reality is not healthy; much better see reality as it is and  work from that assumption. 
<br>
<p>Conspiracy theories are fun, but reality is calling and I have work to do.  This is off-topic 
<br>
anyway.
