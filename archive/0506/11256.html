</em><br>
<p>This is disingenous. No matter what intelligence is based on, if it
<br>
has a physical basis, you could experimentally control it with a dial.
<br>
<p>It's also not true that powerful people simply have more options.
<br>
They're also exercising more options, which means a host of other
<br>
things, like owning good tools, getting better information, continuing
<br>
education, and possibly having underlings to assist them. These things
<br>
all have an effect on demonstrated intelligence, but perhaps not in a
<br>
static IQ test.
<br>
<p>It's also important to note that intelligent behavior is affected by
<br>
good feedback and emotional reinforcement, both of which powerful
<br>
people get much more readily.
<br>
<p>I suppose that puts me in weak agreement with your second
<br>
interpretation of Lee's statement. Powerful people have more
<br>
opportunity to be intelligent, and thus more of them are intelligent,
<br>
because of being powerful.
<br>
<p>You could experimentally confirm this by testing or looking at the
<br>
tests of people who became powerful via no action of their own, like
<br>
hereditary wealth, random lottery, or battlefield promotion.
<br>
<p>in active experimentation, you could just make random people powerful
<br>
for varying periods at varying levels and test before and after, if
<br>
there's a state lottery that would be willing to cooperate.
