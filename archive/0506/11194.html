<em>&gt; &gt; So this got me thinking once we are able to read minds and an FAI can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upload us while also examining our memories, what should happen when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crimes that have never been revealed or had justice done come to light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (I'm talking about major offenses like murder, rape, assault)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should individuals memories be off limits for examination by FAI or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any information found just ignored?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My opinion on this is that the objective of Singularity strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be to preserve the human race and the potential of sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. We should _not_ expect FAI to be a magic genie for solving all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world's problems - if it can stop evolution moving past the region
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of state space in which sentience exists, that'll be more than enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, trying to use it to solve all unsolved crimes strikes me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous - sure, it would be nice to catch murderers that way as far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it goes; then what happens if the RIAA chip in their desire to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to catch everyone who's ever copied music? This gets very messy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very dangerous very quickly. I'm inclined to think we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrate on using FAI to save the world and leave criminal justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the mechanisms that have been established to handle it, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperfect those mechanisms may at times be.
</em><br>
<p>And I'm inclined to think that our current justice systems are
<br>
incredibly primitive. With a good solid system of filtering and
<br>
combining the thoughts and opinions, the dialectic, of large numbers
<br>
of intelligent people, we have the potential to create, even with our
<br>
current limited intelligence, solutions to problems like criminal
<br>
justice that are many times better than what we can come up with and
<br>
implement nowadays. And this is stuff that doesn't even require
<br>
transhuman ideas. Before AI, before augmented intelligence. Simply
<br>
taking advantage of better communication channels made possible by
<br>
applying collaborative filtering and classification to discussions.
<br>
<p>So if we bring an superintelligence into the picture, I think that the
<br>
least I'd want from vim would be some sort of impetus for the
<br>
world-wide installation of a truly effective system of human
<br>
self-government. And possibilities like that are only what I can
<br>
imagine. An AI could probably do much better.
<br>
<p>Petting squabbles instigated by dying monopolies cynically
<br>
manipulating broken intellectual property law will be the furthest
<br>
thing from our minds. Trivialities like those will be the first things
<br>
to be solved.
<br>
<p>Moving the topic along a bit, let me make the observation that most
<br>
political problems in stable, reasonably open governments seem to be
<br>
made possible by an incredibly large amount of apathy in the general
<br>
populace. Would it be moral for a superintelligence to cause people to
<br>
realize the significance they could play in the political process?
<br>
To--I don't want to say &quot;force&quot;--people to wake up to the issues of
<br>
governance they ought to be aware of?
<br>
<p>Hmm. Is that very off-topic?
