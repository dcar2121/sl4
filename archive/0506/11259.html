<p>Yes.

<p><em>&gt; That is backed by the data.  But do you mean that people in more

</em><br>
<p>:-)  Far be it from me to venture such an amazing definition!

</em><br>
<p>I guess you mean disingenuous: lacking in candor; also : giving a
<br>
false appearance of simple frankness : CALCULATING (Websters)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No matter what intelligence is based on, if it has a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis, you could experimentally control it with a dial.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that if are speaking of intelligence as a characteristic
<br>
or attribute of a entity, then you can in principle experimentally
<br>
control it. But probably it was meant that by means of a dial one
<br>
could control the *options* available to a fixed entity, and so
<br>
affect its intelligence; which I find to be an unusual meaning of
<br>
the term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's also important to note that intelligent behavior is affected by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good feedback and emotional reinforcement, both of which powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people get much more readily.
</em><br>
<p>Now we are sliding into intelligence being merely a behavior
<br>
trait, which I think is subtly different, though, yes an entity
<br>
in circumstance A may behave with abnormally high intelligence
<br>
while in circumstance B behave with amazingly little. But I
<br>
originally meant to discuss intelligence as a general attribute
<br>
of an entity or system, and asserted that a strong indicator
<br>
of it is the degree to which the entity has the wherewithal to
<br>
control its environment.
