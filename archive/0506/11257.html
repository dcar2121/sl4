If you are incredibly rich and aren't trying to optimize your situation- ie. 
<br>
life extension, MNT, Singularity, etc. then you aren't intelligent. You are 
<br>
just powerful.
<br>
<p>Also, people in general (including the rich) tend to make decisions and 
<br>
structure their beliefs on irrational, emotional bases (instead of a logical 
<br>
optimization process).
<br>
<p>You can't control the desire for optimization in someone (aka their 
<br>
intelligence) with a dial, unless that dial is operating some mysterious 
<br>
fundmantal process in their brain.

<em>&gt; &gt; That's an odd thing to say.  Do you mean that all else being equal, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that people in more powerful positions are probably more intelligent?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; backed by the data.  But do you mean that people in more powerful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are by definition more intelligent?  That in virtue of having more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;options,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are smarter?  This would mean that I could stand outside an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and control someone's intelligence with a dial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is disingenous. No matter what intelligence is based on, if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has a physical basis, you could experimentally control it with a dial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's also not true that powerful people simply have more options.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They're also exercising more options, which means a host of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things, like owning good tools, getting better information, continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, and possibly having underlings to assist them. These things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all have an effect on demonstrated intelligence, but perhaps not in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;static IQ test.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's also important to note that intelligent behavior is affected by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good feedback and emotional reinforcement, both of which powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people get much more readily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suppose that puts me in weak agreement with your second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation of Lee's statement. Powerful people have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity to be intelligent, and thus more of them are intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of being powerful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You could experimentally confirm this by testing or looking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tests of people who became powerful via no action of their own, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hereditary wealth, random lottery, or battlefield promotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in active experimentation, you could just make random people powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for varying periods at varying levels and test before and after, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there's a state lottery that would be willing to cooperate.
