<em>&gt; This is disingenous. No matter what intelligence is based on, if it

</em><br>
<p>That was disingenous.  It's not surprising if a dial that controls people's 
<br>
serotonin levels can make them more or less intelligent.  It is surprising if 
<br>
a dial that has no direct effect on people's brains can make them immediately 
<br>
more or less intelligent.  If you expose people to different experiences they 
<br>
might become more intelligent after the passage of time, as you point out. 
<br>
The problem with a definition of intelligence that depends so sensitively on 
<br>
environmental availability of options, is that it doesn't seem to capture a 
<br>
concept of individual intelligence.  Rather it seems to be talking about some 
<br>
property of the whole system which is interesting but not a measure of 
<br>
individual intelligence per se.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's also not true that powerful people simply have more options.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're also exercising more options, which means a host of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, like owning good tools, getting better information, continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education, and possibly having underlings to assist them. These things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all have an effect on demonstrated intelligence, but perhaps not in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; static IQ test.
</em><br>
<p>These things have delayed effects on intelligence, not immediate effects for 
<br>
twisting a dial.
