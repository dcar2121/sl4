<em>&gt; What if we build a key?( or a bridge based on nanotech)  I have a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas and would love to see what we could collaboratively think of.

<p>This would be even mildly funny if you didn't miss the point of the message. 
<br>
The point was that I *didn't* think that preventing grey goo required 
<br>
building FAI, yet I thought this was exactly what Eliezer meant by his 
<br>
resolve to finish building FAI before arrival of nanotechnology. I couldn't 
<br>
understand why he would offer such a poor argument to justify building FAI. 
<br>
It turns out that I initially misinterpreted what he meant by, &quot;we need to 
<br>
finish FAI before nanotech,&quot; as, &quot;we need to finish FAI before grey goo,&quot; 
<br>
rather than, &quot;we need to finish FAI before nanotech-era computers.&quot;
<br>
<p>(Actually, my opinion has always been that only necessity of preventing UAI 
<br>
threat warrants an attempt to create FAI, considering huge amount of 
<br>
existential risk associated with building recursively self-improving AI.)

<em>&gt; For the last 3 years I've been under impression that SIAI was building

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; introductory material to avoid misinterpretation of the main reason why
