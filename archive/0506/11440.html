Damien points to
<br>
<p><em>&gt; reading list, circa 2000:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~stefanm/generals/generals_context.pdf">http://web.media.mit.edu/~stefanm/generals/generals_context.pdf</a> 
</em><br>
<p>I was struck by the synopsis of Donald Norman's 1994 book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first problems to face is that of the person's feeling of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control. An important psychological aspect of people's comfort with 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their activities--all of their activities, from social relations, to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs, to their interaction with technology--is the feeling of control 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have over these activities and their personal lives.
<br>
<p>This is very true and suggests springboards for discussion in a broader
<br>
context. There should not be in our culture any misgivings about wishing
<br>
for control, short of wishing for control over other people. Genesis
<br>
had it right, in my opinion, when it suggested that humankind has
<br>
dominion over the Earth.
<br>
<p>The degree to which an entity is able to establish control over its
<br>
environment is a signal characteristic of its level of intelligence.
<br>
Indeed, humans are the most intelligent of Earth's present species
<br>
as is indicated by the control that groups of humans are able to
<br>
exert over their surroundings. On this measure, of course, people
<br>
fail to show really exalted intelligence: were a person suddenly
<br>
teleported to the bottom of the ocean or into deep space, he or she
<br>
wouldn't last long. Not even that, but even under ideal conditions
<br>
humans are done for in less than a century.
<br>
<p>But we should expect that physical systems evolving in the 2000's or
<br>
2100's will be much more &quot;intelligent&quot; by the measure of ensuring
<br>
their own permanence and by their adaptability to new physical
<br>
environments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's bad enough when people are intimidated by their home appliances:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what will happen when automatic systems select the articles they should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read, determine the importance and priority of their daily mail, and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automatically answer mail, send messages, and schedule appointments?
<br>
<p>The solution is obvious: my will-less and obedient servants will order
<br>
my email if I ask them to, and will act as did traditional secretaries
<br>
in times past.  (It didn't used to occur to anyone that he might
<br>
experience angst by having a secretary and delegating certain tasks!)
