Control isn't a valid measure of intelligence.
<br>
<p>What is a valid measure of intelligence is optimization. Those that best 
<br>
optimize their desires are truly the most intelligent.
<br>
<p>For example... Those that make significant progress towards a safe 
<br>
Singularity or towards molecular nanotechnology are the most intelligent, 
<br>
because they are actually working to change their environment to optimally 
<br>
satisfy their desires.
<br>
<p>I'd speculate that lower organisms probably optimize their desires even 
<br>
better than we do,  but have simpler, more transient desires.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The degree to which an entity is able to establish control over its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment is a signal characteristic of its level of intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed, humans are the most intelligent of Earth's present species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as is indicated by the control that groups of humans are able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exert over their surroundings. On this measure, of course, people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fail to show really exalted intelligence: were a person suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teleported to the bottom of the ocean or into deep space, he or she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't last long. Not even that, but even under ideal conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans are done for in less than a century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that the relative amounts of control exerted by organisms on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their environments are probably less to do with intelligence and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do with the desire to exert control. A bacterium is (assumedly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perfectly happy controlling the environment by turning substrates into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;waste products and asexually reproducing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Besides, I think as humans we have very little control. We know we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to make major changes to the way we are living if we are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remain in existance over the next century, but can we do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it? We have as much control as a bacterium in a sea of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bacteria churning through resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, if control was some indication of intelligence, then assumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the people in the most powerful positions would be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent? (And I *really* doubt this to be true).
</em><br>
