<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The degree to which an entity is able to establish control over its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment is a signal characteristic of its level of intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed, humans are the most intelligent of Earth's present species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as is indicated by the control that groups of humans are able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exert over their surroundings. On this measure, of course, people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fail to show really exalted intelligence: were a person suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teleported to the bottom of the ocean or into deep space, he or she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't last long. Not even that, but even under ideal conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans are done for in less than a century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the relative amounts of control exerted by organisms on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their environments are probably less to do with intelligence and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the desire to exert control.
</em><br>
<p>All other things being equal, an urge to control one's environment
<br>
indeed results in better control. I hope you are comfortable with
<br>
the temperature of the room you're in; if not, turn up the heat or
<br>
turn on the air conditioner. But just don't sit there and take it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides, I think as humans we have very little control. We know we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to make major changes to the way we are living if we are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain in existence over the next century, but can we do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it? We have as much control as a bacterium in a sea of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bacteria churning through resources.
</em><br>
<p>Humans are sentient, and historically have shown that they have
<br>
much more control of their environment than do bacteria. As for
<br>
whether &quot;we&quot; have to make changes, we will be changing all right,
<br>
one way or another. Provided we don't war against each other, or
<br>
succumb to a GAI with an entirely different agenda from ours, we
<br>
ought to exert more control of Earth and nearby space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, if control was some indication of intelligence, then assumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people in the most powerful positions would be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent? (And I *really* doubt this to be true).
</em><br>
<p>Everything else being equal, people in more powerful positions
<br>
are more intelligent than people in less powerful positions.
