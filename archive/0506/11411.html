<p>
I read Stross's stories as they were published in ASIMOV'S and I look
<br>
forward to having them gathered into a single volume.
<br>
<p>IMO, these ACCELERANDO stories are head-and-shoulders superior to Stross's
<br>
otherwise fine novels, SINGULARITY SKY and IRON SUNRISE.
<br>
<p>Recently, Stross mused online about the literary problems that come with
<br>
writing about the Singularity. I include the URL and opening text below.
<br>
<p>Regards,

<p>Chekhov's Gun
<br>
01/06/2005 . Source: Charles Stross
<br>
<p>Chekhov's gun is a literary weapon, says science fiction author Charles
<br>
Stross; &quot;If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the
<br>
following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm a jobbing storyteller, who's just mailed in the manuscript of his eighth
<br>
novel. I do this stuff because (a) I enjoy the process, and (b) it's better
<br>
than working for a living. I'm more of an artisan than a theoretician; in
<br>
this respect I'm not atypical among my peers, for while it's normal for
<br>
authors to examine their own working processes, if you spend too much time
<br>
in navel-gazing you'll never actually write anything.
<br>
<p>There's a foggy borderland between working entirely by rule of thumb, and
<br>
developing a theory to guide the process; I'm wandering around somewhere in
<br>
the middle of this wasteland, squinting into the mists and trying to work
<br>
out if there's a better way to do what I'm trying to do. And at present I'm
<br>
thinking hard about Chekhov's gun -- because this literary conceit is
<br>
sitting on the wall mocking me, stopping me from coming up with a sequel to
<br>
a couple of reasonably popular novels.
<br>
<p>Except the weapon on my particular wall isn't a pistol. It's a neutron bomb.
<br>
<p>Back in 1995, I suffered a cynical rush of blood to the head and decided
<br>
that I was going to write a space opera. To cut a long story short, the book
<br>
that eventually emerged was published under the title &quot;Singularity Sky&quot; in
<br>
2003 (2004 in the UK). A sequel, &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot;, was finished in 2001 and
<br>
published in 2004 (2005 over here). I should like to note, parenthetically,
<br>
that the title &quot;Singularity Sky&quot; bears no relationship to the content of the
<br>
first book -- it was pinned on it after the event in order to avoid a
<br>
namespace collision in Ace's list, and I've regretted the premature
<br>
deployment of the &quot;S&quot; word ever since. These novels aren't brilliant and
<br>
they suffer from a number of flaws, but most readers seem to like them well
<br>
enough and it would be a comfort to my bank manager (not to mention my
<br>
editor, and the fans who want me to write more of the same) were I to write
<br>
a third one in the series. ....
