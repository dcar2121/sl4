</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please explain why highly automated macroscale
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an example of highly automated, the computer chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company AMD is proposing building a 3rd factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near Dresden, Germany with an investment of 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and an output of 30,000 cpus per worker per year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This chip factory, by the way, is expected to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce CPUs with 45 nm feature size.  One could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say this _is_ boderline nanotech, since you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost as close to nanometer scale as micrometer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'll jump in and mention some things that occurred to me:
<br>
<p>1. Samantha may be after a more personalized form of abundance. In your AMD case 
<br>
for instance, the customer can have any kind of CPU they want for relatively 
<br>
little money, as long as it is one of the few AMD designs. If they want 
<br>
something custom though then they have to go elsewhere. Now, you can argue that 
<br>
eventually advanced macroscale automation could provide extensive customization 
<br>
on a one-off basis very cheaply, but I'm not sure I would buy that argument. For 
<br>
one example, in many current manufacturing processes there are very expensive 
<br>
molds (or litho masks in the example of chips) that have to be created for any 
<br>
given design. Some of this expense could be reduced through automation, but some 
<br>
of it would seem to be driven purely by macroscale manufacturing process 
<br>
inefficiency, and therefore will always cause one-off things to be significantly 
<br>
more expensive.
<br>
<p>2. AMD's proposed fab is estimated in the $3 billion region of cost. This trend 
<br>
of increasing cost of manufacturing /facilities/ seems to be continuing even as 
<br>
more automation is used. Will a complete end-to-end automated manufacturing 
<br>
system for cars, including all their parts, cost more or less than current car 
<br>
manufacturing plants? If it costs quite a bit more, what does this mean for a 
<br>
smaller company or entrepreneur who wants to create a competing but different 
<br>
product? And will even the big companies really be able to sell goods that much 
<br>
more cheaply if they have to be constantly repaying large debts they incurred 
<br>
for their factories? Sure, costs charged to customers will probably drop 
<br>
somewhat, but how much really?
<br>
<p>3. Degrees of abundance. So I think there are clearly different degrees here 
<br>
that can be imagined. Samantha is probably envisioning a &quot;higher&quot; degree both in 
<br>
even cheaper costs (free or nearly, rather than just cutting my yearly living 
<br>
expense by some percentage), and in even more personalization of products than 
<br>
you may be. She also seems to mention things like aging which may literally 
<br>
require MNT, and may not be solvable using macroscale therapies/products.
