I don't think that creationism/ID and evolution are mutually
<br>
exclusive. As I see it I would be much more impressed by a
<br>
&quot;god&quot;/&quot;pan-dimensional hypergalactic FAI&quot; that could create the
<br>
universe with all the possibilities (seemingly) inherent in it and
<br>
still produce intelligent life through competition and natural
<br>
selection.
<br>
<p>And as it is, it seems most of the contention comes from assuming
<br>
molecules just formed into self-replicating units instead of being
<br>
created by a higher power. Of course there are plenty of theoretical
<br>
simulations to suggest this *can* be spontaneous.
<br>
<p>Of course I believe in no such god. But I do believe in the
<br>
universe... so maybe I'm no better than religious freaks since the
<br>
universe existing isn't a falsifiable theory.
<br>
<p>(I think this conversation is heading down non-SL4 territory)

<em>&gt; &gt; The word theory is used in science to mean a model or framework

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Intelligent Design, like every flavor of creationism, provides no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alternative model or framework, but is a claim that the phenomenon

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe not, but I'm not sure attacking creationism head on is the most

<em>&gt; effective strategy. It might be better to seek its roots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the motive for creationism in the first place? It's not general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; luddism or antirationalism, or its advocates would also be attacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomy, physics and chemistry; they'd be trying to persuade people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planets are mounted on crystal spheres turned by angels, and life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works by mystic protoplasm rather than molecular machinery. Granted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are a handful of people who make such claims, but everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognizes them as being a handful of fruitcakes; evolution is the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific theory on which religiously motivated attacks receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant mainstream support. Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think what it boils down to is that evolution is seen to be linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with nihilism; and frankly, if you look at today's writings on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution, it's understandable why people make that mistake. And if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's a choice between throwing out a scientific theory (even a true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one) and throwing out the moral fabric that holds civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together and gives meaning to life, choosing the first option is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguably the _right_ thing to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So there's no point in just throwing scientific arguments in people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faces when the issue, as far as they're concerned, is a moral one. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to make headway against creationism, I think the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective way to do it is to decouple evolution from nihilism; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why there is no contradiction between the propositions &quot;humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved from apes&quot; and &quot;the universe has a good purpose&quot;.
