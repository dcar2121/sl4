On Mon, 30 Nov 2009 15:49:40 -0500, &quot;Luke&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wlgriffiths@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20goals%20of%20AI">wlgriffiths@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If hormones have a &quot;very small informational content&quot; then so do motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuron impulses coming from the brain.  
</em><br>
<p>I see nothing sacred in hormones, I don't see the slightest reason why
<br>
they or any neurotransmitter would be especially difficult to simulate
<br>
through computation, because chemical 
<br>
messengers are not a sign of sophisticated design on nature's part,
<br>
rather it's an example of Evolution's bungling. If you need to inhibit a
<br>
nearby neuron there are better ways of sending that signal then
<br>
launching a GABA molecule like a message in a bottle thrown into the sea
<br>
and waiting ages for it to diffuse to its random target.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I'm not interested in chemicals only the information they contain, I
<br>
want the information to get transmitted from cell to cell by best method
<br>
and few would send smoke signals if they had a fiber optic cable. The
<br>
information content in each molecular message must be tiny, just a few
<br>
bits because only about 60 neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine,
<br>
norepinephrine and GABA are known, even if the true number is 100 times
<br>
greater (or a million times for that matter) the information content of
<br>
each signal must be tiny. Also, for the long range stuff, exactly
<br>
which neuron receives the signal can not be specified because it relies
<br>
on a random process, diffusion. The fact that it's slow as molasses in
<br>
February does not add to its charm.                                     
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small
<br>
and your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the
<br>
correct continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work
<br>
done, then you don't have a very difficult profession. I see no reason
<br>
why simulating that anachronism  would present the slightest difficulty.
<br>
Artificial neurons could be made to release neurotransmitters as
<br>
inefficiently 
<br>
as natural ones if anybody really wanted to, but it would be pointless
<br>
when
<br>
there are much faster ways.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Electronics is inherently fast because its electrical signals are sent
<br>
by fast light electrons. The brain also uses some electrical signals,
<br>
but it doesn't use electrons, it uses ions to send signals, the most
<br>
important are chlorine and potassium. A chlorine ion is 65 thousand
<br>
times as heavy as an electron, a potassium ion is even heavier, if you
<br>
want to talk about gap junctions, the ions they use are millions of
<br>
times more massive than
<br>
electrons. There is no way to get around it, according to the
<br>
fundamental laws of physics, something that has a large mass will be
<br>
slow,
<br>
very, very, slow.
<br>
<p>The great strength biology has over present day electronics is in the
<br>
ability of one neuron to make thousands of connections of various
<br>
strengths with other neurons. However, I see absolutely nothing in the
<br>
fundamental laws of physics that prevents nano machines from doing the
<br>
same thing, or better and MUCH faster.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What's your opinion on &quot;gut feelings&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>It's a subroutine that makes use of Stochastic and Heuristic ideas, at
<br>
least that's my gut feeling.
