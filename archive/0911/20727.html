This thread is getting derailed on (in my opinon) useless debate on the
<br>
definition of &quot;physical&quot;. Let's look at the actual message that started it.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is the intelligence that has advanced humanity actually able to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; recreated in a machine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- you say obviously, but it seems much less than obvious to me. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are aspects of our &quot;intelligence&quot; that I think may not truly be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical, not a neurochemical process, not a logic system that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematically represented.
</em><br>
<p><p>Here, Matt Paul is asserting that human intelligence is not necessarily
<br>
recreatable in a machine.
<br>
<p>He posits the existence of one or more particular aspects of human
<br>
intelligence that cannot be mechanized, and names three specific
<br>
characteristics of those aspects:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- nonphysical;
<br>
&nbsp;- nonneurochemical;
<br>
&nbsp;- nonlogical; cannot be mathematically represented.
<br>
<p><p>Each of these three attributes may or may not be necessary and/or
<br>
sufficient in order to infer mechanical irreproducibility, but before
<br>
this can be evaluated, it is first necessary to clarify what Mr. Paul
<br>
means by &quot;recreated in a machine&quot;.
<br>
<p>By what criterion does the original -- naturally-occurring human
<br>
intelligence -- not fulfill this? Does a human being fail Mr. Paul's
<br>
definition of a &quot;machine&quot;? Or does Mr. Paul allow any system as a
<br>
&quot;machine&quot;, but require that the behavior be &quot;recreated&quot; by humans? How
<br>
then does he define &quot;human&quot;? Can a human use mechanical aid, such as a
<br>
screwdriver? How about a computerized CAD/CAM? How about a (possibly
<br>
nonsentient or whatever) Jupiter-sized AI brain grown from a seed AI
<br>
written in three lines of Python, with all further human agency reduced
<br>
to once pressing the large red &quot;yes&quot; button?
<br>
<p>Until this is cleared up, I see no further point in continuing debate,
<br>
least of all debate over definitions.
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;NONPHYSICAL
<br>
<p>The proper meaning of &quot;physical&quot; has, as noted, been debated at some
<br>
length; but for the present purpose of reading Matt's message, the only
<br>
relevant definition is the one he had in mind when writing. If, when
<br>
writing the word &quot;physical&quot; he was thinking of the concept &quot;made of
<br>
banana cream pies&quot;, then that is the definition we must use when reading
<br>
his message.
<br>
<p>He gives his meaning here:
