<em>&gt; How do you figure, when the human brain needs years of this kind of data?
</em><br>
<p>Good point, however this is a bit apples and oranges because you're talking
<br>
about how long it takes to EVOLVE (no, I don't mean genetic*) the &quot;correct&quot;
<br>
patterns and I'm talking about how long it takes to RECORD the &quot;correct&quot;
<br>
patterns.  I'm talking about grabbing a set of training data to feed the
<br>
neural net with; training itself may take a long, long, long time.
<br>
<p>However, even the training/evolution may not take as long as child
<br>
development, because the feedback loop is much tighter.  Instead of
<br>
presenting training as:
<br>
<p>&quot;Here, I'm going to give you some sensory data and then you do some
<br>
mechanical motions and then later we can reference the memory of this
<br>
stimulus-response pair and compare to expectations based on our model of
<br>
reality and our goals and pleasure, and we'll decide whether and how to
<br>
update weights.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Here, I'm going to give you a specific vector of data, V1, and I expect an
<br>
output vector O1 on these neurons here.  If you don't give me O1, you get
<br>
scrambled.  I will repeat this until you give me O1.  Then I'll move on to
<br>
V2, checking back with V1 from time to time.&quot;
<br>
<p>What I'm doing here is assuming that the behavior of an entire neural system
<br>
must be &quot;understood&quot;**, i.e. encoded, in order to predict the behavior of a
<br>
subset of that neural system.  By logic, then,
<br>
<p>IF you can predict the behavior of a subset of that neural system
<br>
THEN you have &quot;encoded/understood&quot; the behavior of the larger neural system.
<br>
<p>Even if the specific set of weightings &quot;behind the scenes&quot; is different, the
<br>
behavior's the same where it matters to us (connections to sensory input,
<br>
connection to motor/glandular output).
<br>
<p>However, my conjecture that an hour's worth of data would suffice is
<br>
completely a guess.  I'm just thinking it must be less than infinite time.
<br>
&nbsp;It might be a second.  Who knows?
<br>
<p>Thoughts?  Additions/Deletions/Modifications/Critique?
<br>
&nbsp;- Luke
<br>
<p><p>* That felt so wrong, to have to specify that I mean the more general
<br>
&quot;evolution [of some system] by [some kind of] successive selection&quot;, but I
<br>
didn't want to be misread.
<br>
<p>** I'm ALL ABOUT letting go of understanding.  I think it's critical for
<br>
progress.

<em>&gt; I'm sure if you wanted to obtain training data you could just measure a set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of, say, 1,000,000 neurons in the brain for a few hours.  Preferably these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be pulled from places where the brain connects with the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body (instead of, for instance, neurons which are connected only to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain neurons).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Picking neurons in the motor cortex, amygdala, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part-that-processes-visual-data, etc would essentially give you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface that we care about.  To suggest a mutated version of the Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test, we'd be convinced that we'd simulated a human brain when we couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell which set of neurons was the human motor cortex and which was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated neural net.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;totally unrelated&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, does anyone know of a good hardware implementation of neural networks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. no code, no memory, no pointers, no arrays, just circuits that behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as neural nets)?  Are these cheap?  Where can I learn to design these?  Are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Opterons, 299 TB of DDR2-800 memory, and 10,000 TB of disk. Peak speed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2332 teraflops. Memory bandwidth is 478 GB/s. Interconnect bandwidth is 378
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; GB/s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A human brain sized neural network can be roughly modeled by a 10^11 by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 10^11 sparse weight matrix with 10^15 nonzero weights. An array would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; require 10^10 TB, which would not fit on disk. The weight matrix could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; represented instead as a list of pointers using 4 x 10^15 bytes = 4000 TB.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A simulation would require matrix addition and multiplication operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on the order of tens of milliseconds. (I am assuming that the signal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interest is the firing rate and not individual spikes.) Unfortunately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; memory is optimized for serial access. Random access time is on the order of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 50 ns. Thus, one matrix operation would take 10^8 seconds, or 10^9 slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than real time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Weights are not uniformly distributed. Rather, neurons that are closer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; together are more likely to be connected. This suggests a more efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; implementation. The brain has a volume of about 1000 cm^3. Axons have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diameter of 10^-6 m. Suppose that 10^6 processors each simulated 1 mm^3 of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brain tissue. Each cube would have 10^5 neurons, 10^9 synapses and 10^6 I/O
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at 10 to 100 bits per second each. The internal weight matrix would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dense. It could be represented as an array of 10^10 elements with 10^11 to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 10^12 operations per second. This is not unreasonable for one processor. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it seems that a human brain could be simulated by a million off the shelf
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; processors or a few hundred Jaguars. Furthermore, if a few fail then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simulation will degrade gracefully because the human brain is fault
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tolerant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Of course this is a different problem than writing the software or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; obtaining appropriate training data.
