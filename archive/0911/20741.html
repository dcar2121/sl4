<p>
Given:
<br>
(1) a class of machines called &quot;all machines&quot;, of which any human is a
<br>
member
<br>
(2) a class of machines called &quot;machines buildable by conscious human
<br>
processes&quot;
<br>
<p>It may be that humans are not part of the second class.  &quot;We&quot; can build
<br>
other humans, but I put &quot;we&quot; in quotes because it's not really us, but our
<br>
bodies which do the trick.
<br>
<p>&quot;Noncomputable&quot; is probably a better term than &quot;nonlogical&quot;, and I posit
<br>
that is what was meant.
<br>
<p>But if we want to talk about a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, we could posit that
<br>
higher-dimensional signals which are too small to be measured except by a
<br>
chaotic process could be significant determinants of the outputs of human
<br>
brain processes.
<br>
<p>Final point:  people here talk about reproducing the brain, and I think the
<br>
term &quot;gross viscera&quot; was used to refer to the rest of the body.  I don't
<br>
know about y'all, but my intelligence and behavior is very largely driven by
<br>
the activities of those &quot;gross viscera&quot;.  Adrenaline, myofascial tensegrity
<br>
patterns, ganglia large and small, HGH, you name it:  if you want to
<br>
reproduce human behavior, you have to represent the whole body.
<br>
<p>In other words.  If you take Jim's brain out of his body and hook it into a
<br>
robot body, that robot is NOT going to act like Jim unless you get the robot
<br>
body to feed it the same patterns of hormones.  How would you do that,
<br>
unless the robot body was a recreation of his human body?  Then in what
<br>
sense is it a robot?
<br>
<p>That being said, there's about 3.4 bbp in the genome of a human cell.
<br>
&nbsp;Assuming that mutations don't matter (which they do - cancer anyone?), that
<br>
gives about a 6.4 gig file to represent a human starting point.  That's the
<br>
code.  Every interaction with the &quot;environment&quot;, i.e. right down to the
<br>
water molecules jiggling in the nucleus of every cell and your mother's mood
<br>
at the moment your first neurons form, represent the data that the code acts
<br>
on.
<br>
<p><p>Just some thoughts.  Tie these together as necessary.
<br>
