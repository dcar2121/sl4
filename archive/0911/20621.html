What if the artist does not draw at all?  What if s/he creates interactive
<br>
games, programs Ai-robotics, clones cells, or writes theory?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Putting that aside, to answer your question, it seems it would depend on the
<br>
emotional state of the artist and whether s/he works will under pressure.
<br>
Motivation is a meaningful partner when trying to survive. I suppose that
<br>
most folks would improve their skill level to survive - drawing
<br>
(metaphorically) from their knowledge base and bringing forth forgotten
<br>
skills, or ideas, of how others have done it (most artists study the masters
<br>
in undergraduate school and would remember what da Vinci's images looked
<br>
like), and then try to implement that style.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But the myth of &quot;starving artist&quot; is really a bit of a turn-off because it
<br>
suggests that artists are at the mercy of a church, an institution, or a
<br>
patron and not clever enough to build a sound business.  The Van Gough
<br>
syndrome has been damaging to the arts because one expects genius to foster
<br>
insanity (not to mention the fact that Van Gough put his chemically-fueled
<br>
paintbrushes in his mouth and thereby actually ate metals - which most
<br>
likely caused or added to his mental confusion).  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'll quickly mention another myth -- that artists have to wait to become
<br>
famous until after they die.  Equally as disparaging - so we suffer and die
<br>
and then collectors make their bucks.  Thumbs down on this old-world
<br>
nonsense.

Subject: [sl4] The Starving Artist Experiment
<br>
<p><p>Suppose I were to take a willing participant in captivity, who does not know
<br>
how to draw art very well, and deprive him of food for a day or two.
<br>
Thereafter I would put in front of him his favorite food, and tell him that
<br>
unless he draws me a decent picture of something, the food will be given
<br>
away to somebody else.  For this thought experiment, I would like you to
<br>
assume that the effects of hunger on the human mind and body are not
<br>
significantly inhibiting in any way his &quot;regular&quot; ability to think or draw.
<br>
<p>The question is, will he then draw greatly above his previous skill level?
<br>
What implications does this have for intelligence, and has there been any
<br>
research into intelligence or psychology using this type of approach or
<br>
concept?  Keep in mind that there are also other potential motivators other
<br>
than hunger.
