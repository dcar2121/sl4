<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't know why you insist that everyone is stuck in some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; medival way of thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're talking about something that the scientific method cannot  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is nevertheless of enormous importance, just like the soul. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't care if these vital signals that make us be us come from  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heaven or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the eleventh dimension the idea is indistinguishable from a soul.
</em><br>
<p>It is very distinguishable, that's why I tried to use a science/math  
<br>
perspective to illustrate. What I call a soul would not fit into the  
<br>
concept of dimensions necessarily, and if it did, I would probably  
<br>
have to stop calling it a soul. That's why I have NOT been talking  
<br>
about a soul, because it doesn't fit into science. Dimensions do,  
<br>
dimensions can be observed, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the worse crime of all is that your idea explains absolutely NOTHING,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not one goddamn thing, it just pushes the problem upstairs just as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soul idea does. A dimension is just another direction, how in hell  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction that I happen to have not experienced before explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysteries of existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
How does 2 dimensions explain area? How does 3 explain volume?
<br>
Why do you assume that the only things that are key to your existence  
<br>
are the things you have up to this point experienced consciously?
<br>
One day I think these will be observed, measured, and brought  
<br>
comfortably into the realm of science?
<br>
<p>Before anyone saw blood, was there blood in a body?
<br>
If anyone here is stuck in a medival mindset it seems to be you.
<br>
<p>Do you doubt quantum mechanics?
<br>
Was everyone an idiot that thought about it before it was observable?
<br>
Do you think we have discovered everything already?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If everything you can't currently measure or detect is just a soul,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then why pursue science at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are postulating something that cannot be measure or detected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain something that we're already doing a fine job of explaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without it, and to add insult to injury your addition doesn't explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything, you just add another useless layer of complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Ok, Occam's razor. Sure. But we aren't doing a fine job of explaining  
<br>
it.
<br>
Explain imagination, explain art.
<br>
Do that with the tools we already have, build me a machine that  
<br>
imagines and I'll shut up.
<br>
<em>&gt; If you are a fan of the soul let me offer you an alternative,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soul and still remain within the scientific method. Consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarities:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The soul is non material and so is information. It's difficult to pin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down a unique physical location for the soul, and the same is true for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. The soul is the essential, must have, part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, exactly the same situation is true for information. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there are also important differences too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A soul is unique but information can be duplicated. The soul is and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always remain unfathomable, but information is understandable, in  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is the ONLY thing that is understandable. Information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that, but if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soul exists it will never be proven scientifically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Once again, not talking about soul.
<br>
I never said any of this was unfathomable, you did. I believe it is  
<br>
only a matter of time.
<br>
<p>Does dark matter exist? Has anyone produced a single particle of it?  
<br>
Nobody can prove it does other than to say it must because mass is  
<br>
missing. Non-existence of one thing doesn't prove the existence of  
<br>
another.
<br>
So does it exist? Are physicists just wasting grant money? What about  
<br>
the so-called god-particle quest. Are the scientists at CERN just  
<br>
chasing a soul or something like that, or are they looking for  
<br>
something that they are having to figure out how to find?
<br>
So those who pursued dark matter were fools chasing some unfathomable  
<br>
concept? Come on John.
<br>
You are being an ass just to be an ass.
