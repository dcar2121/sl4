It would depend on MANY variables of course.  The point I am trying to get
<br>
at is that I have been pondering the possibility of a biofeedback device
<br>
which can produce a similar effect, if carefully controlled.  The
<br>
fundamentals of the psychology behind the &quot;Starving Artist&quot; are more
<br>
important than the variables of the experiment itself.

<p><em>&gt;  What if the artist does not draw at all?  What if s/he creates

<em>&gt; interactive games, programs Ai-robotics, clones cells, or writes theory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Putting that aside, to answer your question, it seems it would depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the emotional state of the artist and whether s/he works will under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure.  Motivation is a meaningful partner when trying to survive. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose that most folks would improve their skill level to survive - drawing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (metaphorically) from their knowledge base and bringing forth forgotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills, or ideas, of how others have done it (most artists study the masters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in undergraduate school and would remember what da Vinci's images looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like), and then try to implement that style.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the myth of &quot;starving artist&quot; is really a bit of a turn-off because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that artists are at the mercy of a church, an institution, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patron and not clever enough to build a sound business.  The Van Gough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; syndrome has been damaging to the arts because one expects genius to foster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insanity (not to mention the fact that Van Gough put his chemically-fueled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paintbrushes in his mouth and thereby actually ate metals - which most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely caused or added to his mental confusion).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll quickly mention another myth -- that artists have to wait to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; famous until after they die.  Equally as disparaging - so we suffer and die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then collectors make their bucks.  Thumbs down on this old-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense.

<em>&gt; Suppose I were to take a willing participant in captivity, who does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how to draw art very well, and deprive him of food for a day or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thereafter I would put in front of him his favorite food, and tell him that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless he draws me a decent picture of something, the food will be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away to somebody else.  For this thought experiment, I would like you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that the effects of hunger on the human mind and body are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly inhibiting in any way his &quot;regular&quot; ability to think or draw.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is, will he then draw greatly above his previous skill level?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What implications does this have for intelligence, and has there been any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research into intelligence or psychology using this type of approach or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept?  Keep in mind that there are also other potential motivators other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than hunger.
