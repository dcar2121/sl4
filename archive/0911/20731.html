If your memories were different, you wouldn't know. People don't remember what they forget. If you had memories of growing up in a different culture and language, knowing different people and even a different body with perhaps a different sex at a different time in history, you would not be aware of any difference. So it should not matter if you were a different person. I know for a fact that there are different people already in existence. (At least that is what I believe according to the model my mind has of the outside world that enables me to predict what bits will next be input to my mind. Although for all I know, my mind might actually be a simulation run in a world so strange that space, time, and matter are meaningless, abstract concepts, and that no other people exist).
<br>
<p>But to answer your question, I would want to preserve my memories regardless of what they were. It's not rational. It's just the way I'm programmed. All of the people that were programmed differently have already died.

<p>So is this &quot;you&quot;? Knowing you have a realistic copy, perhaps in a younger, stronger, and healthier body and perhaps with a more intelligent but artificial brain, how do you feel about shooting yourself?
