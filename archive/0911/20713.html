<p>Let me ask another way. Suppose that in the future we solve the hard problems of AI like language, vision, mobility, and modeling human behavior. Furthermore we develop the technology to build lifelike human robots, or to clone human bodies without brains and insert computers with AI connected to all the sensory and motor nerves so that nobody can distinguish them from living humans. Suppose we also live in a society of pervasive public surveillance, where everything you say and do is published on the internet for all to see. So after years of watching you and knowing every detail about your life, it is possible to make a copy of you that nobody can distinguish from the original. It knows everything you do and has all the same skills. Any question that you can answer, the robot answers the same way. We call this robot an &quot;upload&quot;.
<br>
<p>So is this &quot;you&quot;? Knowing you have a realistic copy, perhaps in a younger, stronger, and healthier body and perhaps with a more intelligent but artificial brain, how do you feel about shooting yourself?

<em>&gt; Ok, I see a problem arising here. I used the term &quot;non-physical&quot; and I think that I should clarify that this is because I struggle to find another term for it. I don't think it is the best term and I hope we don't get too hung up on it. By non-physical I am trying to label that which is real but cannot currently be measured or detected.
