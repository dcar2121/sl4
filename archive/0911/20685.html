<em>&gt; -- you say obviously, but it seems much less than obvious to me. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of our &quot;intelligence&quot; that I think may not truly be physical, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurochemical process, not a logic system that can be mathematically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented.
</em><br>
<p>Let's say that your asking whether there's a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;,
<br>
something beyond what can be captured from a simple algorithm. It's a
<br>
very natural question to ask, especially seeing our genetic and
<br>
cultural baggage.
<br>
<p>But it's also the wrong question to ask, along the lines of &quot;is there
<br>
an invisible dragon whom no-one can detect in my garage?&quot;.
<br>
<p>What you're asking is essentially:
<br>
There is something, which I can't really define, that prevents
<br>
intelligent AI's from being built. Prove to me that this something
<br>
doesn't exist.
<br>
<p>The onus is unfortunately on you to define this thing, and say why
<br>
AI's are precluded by it. No-go theorem (things that say you can't do
<br>
something) normally require very strong justifications to be credible,
<br>
because they're not saying &quot;this happens if we do this&quot; or &quot;this won't
<br>
work&quot;, but &quot;of all the possible ways of doing this, most of which are
<br>
unimaginable to me or to anyone alive, NONE of them will work&quot;.
<br>
<p>Compare what you need to justify &quot;the moon moves according to Newton's
<br>
laws, with great probability&quot; (a series of simple observations) and
<br>
&quot;heavier than air flight can never happen, with great probability&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What about motivations such as compassion, comfort, hate, love, fear of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to defeat an enemy, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These motivations are what drive us to &quot;advance&quot; and they color the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions we create. I think they are worthy of examination to see how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integral they might be.
</em><br>
<p>Some version of these will no doubt be useful in AI - you wouldn't
<br>
want to build an intelligent machine with no motivations at all, would
<br>
you? Most probably, you couldn't.
<br>
