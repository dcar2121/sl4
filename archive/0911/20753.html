On Mon, 30 Nov 2009  &quot;Matt Paul&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lizardblue@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20goals%20of%20AI">lizardblue@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are stuck on this damn soul thing. It's aggravating.
</em><br>
<p>The truth can be painful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know why you insist that everyone is stuck in some sort of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medival way of thinking.
</em><br>
<p>You're talking about something that the scientific method cannot detect
<br>
that is nevertheless of enormous importance, just like the soul. And I
<br>
don't care if these vital signals that make us be us come from heaven or
<br>
the eleventh dimension the idea is indistinguishable from a soul. And
<br>
the worse crime of all is that your idea explains absolutely NOTHING,
<br>
not one goddamn thing, it just pushes the problem upstairs just as the
<br>
soul idea does. A dimension is just another direction, how in hell can a
<br>
direction that I happen to have not experienced before explain the
<br>
mysteries of existence?       
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If everything you can't currently measure or detect is just a soul,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then why pursue science at all. 
</em><br>
<p>You are postulating something that cannot be measure or detected to
<br>
explain something that we're already doing a fine job of explaining
<br>
without it, and to add insult to injury your addition doesn't explain
<br>
anything, you just add another useless layer of complexity. 
<br>
<p>If you are a fan of the soul let me offer you an alternative,
<br>
information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the
<br>
soul and still remain within the scientific method. Consider the
<br>
similarities:
<br>
<p>The soul is non material and so is information. It's difficult to pin
<br>
down a unique physical location for the soul, and the same is true for
<br>
information. The soul is the essential, must have, part of
<br>
consciousness, exactly the same situation is true for information. The
<br>
soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.                
<br>
<p>But there are also important differences too.
<br>
<p>A soul is unique but information can be duplicated. The soul is and will
<br>
always remain unfathomable, but information is understandable, in fact,
<br>
information is the ONLY thing that is understandable. Information    
<br>
unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that, but if the
<br>
soul exists it will never be proven scientifically. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you are pretty damn closed minded 
</em><br>
<p>It's good to be open minded, but not so open all your brains fall out.
