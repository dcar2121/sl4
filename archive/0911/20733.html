A nonexistent thing that we want to preserve.

<em>&gt;If your memories were different, you wouldn't know. People don't remember what they forget. If you had memories of growing up in a different culture and language, knowing different people and even a different body with perhaps a different sex at a different time in history, you would not be aware of any difference. So it should not matter if you were a different person. I know for a fact that there are different people already in existence.

<em>&gt;But to answer your question, I would want to preserve my memories regardless of what they were. It's not rational. It's just the way I'm programmed. All of the people that were programmed differently have already died.

<em>&gt;So is this &quot;you&quot;? Knowing you have a realistic copy, perhaps in a younger, stronger, and healthier body and perhaps with a more intelligent but artificial brain, how do you feel about shooting yourself?
