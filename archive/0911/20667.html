<em>&gt; Where does this 10**9 (10**15) come from again?  Is that the full storage capacity of the brain? 
</em><br>
<p>As John Clark noted, there are 10^15 synapses. In a Hopfield net (a vast simplification of the brain), associative memory recall degrades around 0.15 bits per synapse, or 0.3 bits per free parameter because a Hopfield net is symmetric [1].
<br>
<p>10^9 bits comes from Landauer's study of human long term memory. It is based on recall tests of spoken and written words, pictures, numbers, and music [2].
<br>
<p>I can't explain all of this discrepancy. Some possibilities:
<br>
<p>- Redundancy for fault tolerance.
<br>
- Landauer's experiments don't account for low level perceptual learning. A lot of neurons and synapses are used in the visual cortex to detect movement, lines, edges, simple shapes, etc. The brain does this in parallel even though a computer could use a much smaller sliding window of filter coefficients.
<br>
- Lots of neurons are needed to get a smooth response from on-off signals. For example, each muscle fiber can only be on or off. You need thousands of neurons, each controlling one fiber, to get a smooth movement. Likewise for perceptions. You can distinguish a shift from musical C from C-sharp even though sensory cells in the cochlea have a broad response spanning a couple of octaves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; what do you think of the conjecture that one could (&quot;sufficiently&quot;) characterize a neural network by a set of input/output that would be far smaller than the total storage capacity of the network?
</em><br>
<p>If the information capacity of the brain is 10^9 bits, then you need at least 10^9 bits of compressed training data to characterize it.

<p>@Mu In Taiwain:
<br>
<p>re: 1) When I said &quot;hogwash&quot;, I was referring to the statement &quot;IBM simulated a cat cortex&quot;.  I wasn't referring to you, or them, or anyone else who might have said it.  I was referring to the statement itself.  I recognized your uncertainty because you used the word &quot;asserts&quot;, which marks the statement as coming from the third-person.  You continue to have my respect.
<br>
<p>re: 2) What I described would definitely be a particular brain.  What about being a &quot;useful human&quot; might not be captured if you were able to capture the behavior of that particular brain?
<br>
<p><p>@Matt Mahoney: Where does this 10**9 (10**15) come from again?  Is that the full storage capacity of the brain?  Something like (num_synapses * num_possible_weights_per_synapse)?  If it is, what do you think of the conjecture that one could (&quot;sufficiently&quot;) characterize a neural network by a set of input/output that would be far smaller than the total storage capacity of the network?
<br>
<p>Thanks
