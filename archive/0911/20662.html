@BillK:  points as follows:
<br>
<p>1.  Intelligence has a lot to do with knowledge.  So I don't think an insect
<br>
could be as &quot;intelligent&quot; as a human, precisely because it cannot store as
<br>
much information.
<br>
<p>2.  FTA: &quot;Computer modelling shows that even consciousness can be generated
<br>
with very small neural circuits, which could in theory easily fit into an
<br>
insect brain.&quot;  Wait a second ... computer scientists have explained
<br>
consciousness?  When did that happen??
<br>
<p>@John K Clark:  As far as I know, there are at least three states of
<br>
relationship between an upstream neuron and a downstream neuron:
<br>
&nbsp;excitatory, inhibitory, or not-connected.  I have also assumed for a long
<br>
time that the first two states could exist to varying degrees.  So that's
<br>
more than a bit.
<br>
<p>Finally, there are over 100 neurotransmitters, any combination of which can
<br>
act at a particular synapse.
<br>
<p>@Adam (friend of mine who's studied the brain more than me):  do you know
<br>
the answer to this?  What can we know about the information capacity of a
<br>
synapse?  Do you know of any resources?

<em>&gt; Bigger not necessarily better, when it comes to brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; November 17, 2009
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tiny insects could be as intelligent as much bigger animals, despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only having a brain the size of a pinhead, say scientists at Queen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mary, University of London.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Animals with bigger brains are not necessarily more intelligent,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to Lars Chittka, Professor of Sensory and Behavioural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ecology at Queen Mary's Research Centre for Psychology and University
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Cambridge colleague, Jeremy Niven. This begs the important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question: what are they for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Research repeatedly shows how insects are capable of some intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviours scientists previously thought was unique to larger animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Honeybees, for example, can count, categorise similar objects like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogs or human faces, understand 'same' and 'different', and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differentiate between shapes that are symmetrical and asymmetrical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chittka says: &quot;In bigger brains we often don't find more complexity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just an endless repetition of the same neural circuits over and over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This might add detail to remembered images or sounds, but not add any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of complexity. To use a computer analogy, bigger brains might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many cases be bigger hard drives, not necessarily better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processors.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This must mean that much 'advanced' thinking can actually be done with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very limited neuron numbers. Computer modelling shows that even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness can be generated with very small neural circuits, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could in theory easily fit into an insect brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, the models suggest that counting could be achieved with only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few hundred nerve cells and only a few thousand could be enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate consciousness.
