<p><p>Most codes can never be LINPACK-like, and hence why LINPACK is not considered a useful system metric for most HPC purposes. It is intrinsic to the algorithms being run. Almost the entire class of nominal AGI models do not describe a LINPACK-like code. The single exception might be whole-brain modeling and similar, since that obviously could be implemented as a molecular simulation. LINPACK is for cache-friendly numerical codes, which most codes are not.
<br>
<p><p>AGI, regardless of model, is generally a graph-like code. These are the polar opposite of LINPACK-like codes and are bound by architectural aspects that would be irrelevant for LINPACK. Supercomputers optimized for graph-like codes look nothing like the XT5, and generally employ sub-gigahertz processors. The engineering reason sub-gigahertz processors are optimal for large-scale graph-friendly architectures is left as an exercise to the reader.
<br>
<p>A graph-like code running on Jaguar will very likely be *slower* than a graph-like code running on a large desktop that uses a graph-friendly architecture despite the vast differences in nominal computing power. At the same time, graph-friendly systems are going to show very mediocre performance with LINPACK-like codes because they are optimized for the intrinsic operation rate of graph-like codes.  
<br>
<p><p>For Top 500 to be relevant to AGI, you would have to demonstrate that AGI does not employ any graph-like algorithms. I cannot think of an AGI model proposed on any AGI-related mailing list that has not been intrinsically graph-like.
