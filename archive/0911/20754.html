<p>
But what I really meant was that you can't assume a system is easy to
<br>
simulate merely because its interface has a low bandwidth.  Sure, you can
<br>
model the release of a hormone very simply.  But how much hormone, and when
<br>
is it released?  To answer those questions you have to have a human body, or
<br>
a system with the same complexity.
<br>
<p>To give a rough (but perfectly appropriate) analogy, think of windspeed at
<br>
the airport.  They've got one monitoring point, so to model the wind all
<br>
you'd need is a direction and speed, i.e. two numbers, right?  Well, no.
<br>
&nbsp;You need to know how those two numbers vary with time.  And that function's
<br>
horribly complex.
<br>
<p>Or let's say you pick a random point in some fiberoptic cable somewhere.
<br>
&nbsp;There all you need to &quot;simulate&quot; it would be a string of ones and zeros,
<br>
each time-indexed, right?  No, because you have no way of knowing whether
<br>
the next bit will be a one or a zero, without knowing the computer that's
<br>
connected to it.  Or if that computer's a router, then the computer
<br>
connected to that.  And so on, until you're simulating the internet.  But
<br>
then that's not enough because ... well you see it goes on and on.
<br>
<p>So sure, you could have your simulated brain and just throw random hormones
<br>
at it.  But then your simulated Jim would be Jim-on-random-drugs.
<br>
<p>Finally, hormones aren't the only means of the body's communicating with the
<br>
brain.  To give a simple counterexample, we have neurons which measure the
<br>
stretch of the stomach lining and send neural (non-hormone) signals about
<br>
hunger to the brain.
<br>
<p>To take it further, we have all sort of proprioceptive neurons that are in
<br>
constant unconscious communication with the brain.  That's why you're more
<br>
apt to make good decisions after a nice massage, because billions of muscle
<br>
fibers are each sending different signals than they would be otherwise.
<br>
<p>My thesis, in a nutshell:  the body thinks.
