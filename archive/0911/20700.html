<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not talking about a soul.
</em><br>
<p>BULLSHIT!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm speaking on components ofconsciousness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may not reside in a physical manifestation.
</em><br>
<p>I see, so you're talking about a aspect of being alive that can not be
<br>
detected by the scientific method that is nevertheless of enormous
<br>
importance. And that differs from the medieval dogma of the soul
<br>
precisely how? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't know if you see the distinction here
</em><br>
<p>Nope, I don't see the distinction here, I don't even see a shade of
<br>
distinction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is experimentally provable that there is some sort of non-local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspect to our access to information.
</em><br>
<p>Bell's inequality has been proven experimentally to be violated, and
<br>
that is a stunning fact, but what has that got to do with what we were
<br>
talking about? There is absolutely no evidence that meat computers make
<br>
use of this fact, but if they do I see no reason silicon computers
<br>
couldn't too.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I take it you don't believe morphogenetic field theory
</em><br>
<p>I can't imagine where you got that idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; even though experimentally it seems to be valid...
</em><br>
<p>BULLSHIT! Rupert Sheldrake had that brain fart about 30 years ago but in
<br>
all that time his idea has not advanced one inch, not one nanometer, not
<br>
one Plank length. This doesn't need a multi billion dollar accelerator,
<br>
if it were true high School students could prove the existence of
<br>
morphogenetic fields in their science fair exhibits, but they haven't.
<br>
The scientists at CERN haven't demonstrated the existence of this thing
<br>
either, not even with their billion dollar budgets and boiling water
<br>
IQ's. Don't you find that a little bit strange if the thing actually
<br>
existed?
