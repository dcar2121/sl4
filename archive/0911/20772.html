On Mon, 30 Nov 2009 &quot;Matt Paul&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lizardblue@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20goals%20of%20AI">lizardblue@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; idea is indistinguishable from a soul.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is very distinguishable
</em><br>
<p>How? I can't see any difference from what you are saying and what the
<br>
bible thumpers are saying, or at least no more difference from what the
<br>
Catholics say as opposed to the Protestants, its all complete shit.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt;that's why I tried to use a science/math perspective to illustrate.
</em><br>
<p>All you've done is add a layer of pseudo-scientific sounding techno
<br>
babel that helps us not one bit in explaining how the world works.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have NOT been talking about a soul, because it doesn't fit into science. Dimensions do
</em><br>
<p>So how does a new direction help us understand the nature of
<br>
intelligence? Zero nada zilch goose egg. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How does 2 dimensions explain area? How does 3 explain volume?
</em><br>
<p>How does 5, 6, 7 or 999 dimensions explain intelligence? What the hell
<br>
has dimensions got to do with it and why do you even bring it up? You
<br>
don't even hint at what the connection could be. It's as big a load of
<br>
crap as religion, hell it is religion. You don't like the word &quot;soul&quot;
<br>
but you're fine with the idea of a soul, as is almost everybody on this
<br>
list. I'm not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, Occam's razor. Sure. But we aren't doing a fine job of explaining it.
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit. The reason AI seems to make so little progress is that as soon
<br>
as a computer can do something it is decided that thing is not really
<br>
intelligent after all. Fifty years ago people thought solving equations
<br>
or playing a great game of Chess required intelligence. No more. Fifteen
<br>
years ago people thought it would take a great deal of intelligence for
<br>
a librarian to do what Google does. No more. Intelligence is whatever a
<br>
computer can't do YET.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Explain imagination, explain art.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry could you repeat the question, I was distracted by playing a sad
<br>
tune on my violin while looking at a beautiful Hallmark greeting card
<br>
showing dogs playing poker. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never said any of this was unfathomable, you did. 
</em><br>
<p>But you never explained anything about your idea, not one thing, all you
<br>
did was kick the problem upstairs, exactly what religion does. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about the so-called god-particle 
</em><br>
<p>God is real unless defined as an integer.
