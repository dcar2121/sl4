Luke:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sure, you can model the release of a hormone very simply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But how much hormone, and when is it released?
</em><br>
<p>John:
<br>
<em>&gt;The important thing is not how much hormone is released but how much is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detected and which cells are able to do it
</em><br>
<p>:::Luke slaps his own forehead:::
<br>
<p>You MUST be deliberately misinterpreting me, consciously or unconsciously.
<br>
&nbsp;If you are not consciously doing so I recommend you take a breather and
<br>
come back later and pretend YOU wrote some of the words in my posts, and
<br>
read them from that point of view.
<br>
<p>What I'm SAYING is that it is not the bandwidth that matters, but the signal
<br>
that comes down whatever pipeline has that bandwidth.
<br>
<p>Human behavior is determined in part by hormones.  These hormones are
<br>
sending signals.  Yes, electronics can, or should be able to, simulate the
<br>
system that generates these signals.
<br>
<p>My original point is that you cannot simulate merely the brain and hope to
<br>
get human behavior.  You must simulate the entire body.
<br>
<p>This was in response to a statement that only a portion of the genome codes
<br>
for human behavior, and the rest codes for the &quot;gross viscera&quot;.
<br>
<p>To make my point even simpler, you could simulate a hormone channel with a
<br>
single resistor.  At any given moment T, there will be a certain current Y
<br>
through that resistor.  However, to know WHAT hormone level should be there,
<br>
you need much more complicated electronics BEHIND that resistor.
<br>
<p>That's all I'm saying.
<br>
<p>Therefore, you need to simulate the information processing that takes place
<br>
in the rest of the body, outside of the skull.  Information processing
<br>
happens there, and it determines human behavior, so you need to simulate it
<br>
to get human behavior.  Simple point.  And a point which has nothing to do
<br>
with the limitations of electronics.
<br>

<em>&gt; The important thing is not how much hormone is released but how much is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to diffuse to the next galaxy, sorry I mean cell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please explain why electronics is incapable of simulating such a SLOW
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals in the age of the internet. It's a perfect analogy, smoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals work by diffusion, just like hormones. And both suck.
