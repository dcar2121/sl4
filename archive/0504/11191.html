<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or not. Depends on what he means. 
</em><br>
<p>He defined the 'inflection point' as the midpoint
<br>
of an 'S' shaped growth curve.  At that point growth
<br>
is linear.  Prior to that point it was accelerating,
<br>
and after it is decelerating to an asymptote.
<br>
<p>Human population from about 1600 to 1960 is best
<br>
described as a hyperbolic.  If you graph 1/population
<br>
you get a nearly straight line.  The growth rate
<br>
peaked in the 1960's at just over 2% per year.  The
<br>
absolute change in population per year is what peaked
<br>
in the late 1980's at about 87 million per year.
<br>
At that point population growth was linear.  Today
<br>
it is about 74 million per year, so we are now
<br>
sub-linear, i.e. slowing down.  The census bureau
<br>
projects the world will reach replacement fertility
<br>
in 2050.  That means just enough babies (2.1 per
<br>
woman) to replace the previous generation.  Zero
<br>
population growth would occur about 2090.
<br>
<p>I expect the census bureau's projections will turn
<br>
out wrong for any of a number of reasons:
<br>
<p>(1) A singularity of the type we mean on this list
<br>
could occur before 2090.  In that case any number
<br>
between zero and 10^50 could be right.  
<br>
(2) A major war or pandemic could occur in this time
<br>
period.  That includes AIDS remaining out of control.
<br>
(3) The undeveloped world will catch up economically
<br>
with the developed world in the next 50 years, which
<br>
would likely have a downward effect on population.
<br>
(4) Some ecological or resource limits (for example
<br>
today's high oil price affecting fertilizer and
<br>
tractor operating costs) causing problems.  These
<br>
problems will eventually be overcome, given human
<br>
inventiveness and economic forces, but if it takes
<br>
decades for things to adapt, there could be large
<br>
impacts during the transition.
<br>
(5) Sufficiently cheap space transport bleeds some
<br>
population off planet.
<br>
(6) Perfect robotic or virtual reality playmates
<br>
replacing real sex.
<br>
<p>One of the definitions of the Singularity is that
<br>
time in the future beyond which you can't make
<br>
useful predictions because too much has changed.
<br>
In population projections, the uncertainties reach
<br>
a factor of 2 range from high to low in about 50
<br>
years.  That's projections by sober demographers
<br>
at the census bureau and the UN, not including
<br>
items like the ones I listed above.  Allowing for
<br>
some measure of the unexpected, I would put the
<br>
useful prediction limit in this field at 50 years.
<br>
<p>In semiconductors, the useful prediction limit
<br>
may be as short as 10 years - we don't know enough
<br>
to say if we will hit a limit on silicon based
<br>
semiconductors in that time, or whether any
<br>
alternatives will work out.
