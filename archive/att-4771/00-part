Sure. But in fact - it would be a finite list. Not a big deal, to sort it.

The list of all medical situationa is huge. But finite. Let say it has M members.

The list of all possible first aid actions is also finite. Let say it has A members.

M x A is the number of the combined list.

What is on the top of the sorted list? Heimlich, or something even better?
