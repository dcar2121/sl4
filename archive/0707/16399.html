<p>
Yeah.
<br>
<p>So.
<br>
<p>Um.
<br>
<p>You ever have one of those days where you're, like, checking 
<br>
Technorati to see if anyone has linked to intelligence.org recently, and 
<br>
you come across a blog post which mentions that -
<br>
<p>- and as Buddha and Belldandy and the Flying Spaghetti Monster are my 
<br>
witnesses, I swear that I am not making any of this up and moreover it 
<br>
checks out and doesn't look like a joke -
<br>
<p>- where was I?  Right.  So apparently there's this guy in New York 
<br>
whose name I can't remember ever hearing, and who doesn't seem to have 
<br>
ever emailed me, who's written and directed a play called:
<br>
<p>_Yudkowski Returns: The Rise And Fall And Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer 
<br>
Yudkowski_
<br>
<p>&quot;In a seemingly deserted island, Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski and his 
<br>
artificial intelligence drones and cohorts wage a war to keep their 
<br>
circular narrative from ending.  Their only weapon?  The hope that 
<br>
humanity can finally evolve. (90 min)&quot;
<br>
<p>Written and directed by Bob Saietta (possibly a.k.a. Bobby Silverman).
<br>
<p>This has already had one run and is being brought back for another, at 
<br>
something called &quot;The Pretentious Festival&quot; at the Brick Theater in 
<br>
Brooklyn, NY:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.bricktheater.com/pretentious/">http://www.bricktheater.com/pretentious/</a>
<br>
<p>If you're going to be in New York on:
<br>
<p>Tue 7/24 8pm
<br>
Tue 7/26 7:30pm
<br>
Sat 7/28 3pm
<br>
Sat 7/28 9pm
<br>
Sun 7/29 3pm
<br>
<p>You can buy tickets for $10:

<br>
<p>Yudkowski Returns!
<br>
reviewed by Robert Weinstein
<br>
<p>Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski, the lead character in Yudkowski Returns (The 
<br>
Rise And Fall And Rise Again Of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski) wishes he were 
<br>
Japanese. He sits at a desk scattered with seemingly random 
<br>
paraphernalia, downloads episodes of Lost and analyzes the homoerotic 
<br>
subtext of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He orders Chinese food. He puts 
<br>
on his Psycho-Sociological Hat, dances around the theatre and leaps 
<br>
into the narcissistic void of his psyche created by a recent breakup. 
<br>
He restages significant moments while putting others in newfound 
<br>
contexts depending on his ability to understand them. And he is not alone.
<br>
<p>He has the audience, whom he addresses frequently and with a 
<br>
plastered-on smile, and he has The Assistant, a friendly, disheveled, 
<br>
and increasingly confused woman who is at different times his 
<br>
girlfriend, his girlfriend-as-ex, his confidante, and his conscience. 
<br>
Is she real? I'm not confident Dr. Yudkowski knows. But their 
<br>
isolation—his voluntary, hers more problematic—creates an incredibly 
<br>
complex relationship which plays out as they wait on the appearance of 
<br>
The Singularity, an Artificial Intelligence technology that can solve 
<br>
all of life's unsolvable problems. It makes sense of the nonsensical 
<br>
and will bring an end to all of humanity's conflicts as well as Dr. 
<br>
Yudkowski's isolation and, quite possibly, The Assistant's existence.
<br>

<br>
<p>Apparently I'm played by Patrick McCaffrey:
<br>
<p>&quot;A charming assistant introduces the entrance of (cue the cheesy 
<br>
music...) Doctor Yudkowski, played by Patrick, who exudes all the 
<br>
charisma and appeal that Tom Cruise should have had in _Magnolia_.&quot;
<br>
<p>That was from the original blog post I found, at:
<br>
<a href="http://tba-ny.blogspot.com/2007/07/bobby-silverman-my-nemesis-where-has.html">http://tba-ny.blogspot.com/2007/07/bobby-silverman-my-nemesis-where-has.html</a>
<br>
<p>I know what you're all wondering:  &quot;How does Eliezer look in the 
<br>
director's vision of what his life *should* be like?&quot;  Apparently I 
<br>
look like this:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amrep.org/people/patrick.html">http://www.amrep.org/people/patrick.html</a>
<br>
<p>*
<br>
<p>Since no one had the courtesy to notify me that a play had been 
<br>
produced about my life - and possibly Erin's, though I don't know if 
<br>
The Assistant is based on her - if anyone in New York goes to this, do 
<br>
please bring back some photos.  Though it would probably appeal more 
<br>
to the taste of my enemies than my friends, unless you have a very 
<br>
liberal sense of humor.
<br>
<p>I used to describe myself as a D-list celebrity.  But I guess that 
<br>
when they produce a play about your life, with your name in the title, 
<br>
and they don't bother to tell you, it means you've officially been 
<br>
promoted to a C-list celebrity.  I think next I'm supposed to release 
<br>
a sex tape of myself or something - no wait, that's how you go from 
<br>
the B-list to the A-list.
<br>
<p>It's been a very surreal day.
