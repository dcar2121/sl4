Neat.
<br>
<p>Anyone want to catch a showing and have an SL4 meetup?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You ever have one of those days where you're, like, checking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technorati to see if anyone has linked to intelligence.org recently, and
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose name I can't remember ever hearing, and who doesn't seem to have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Yudkowski Returns: The Rise And Fall And Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yudkowski_
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In a seemingly deserted island, Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial intelligence drones and cohorts wage a war to keep their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circular narrative from ending.  Their only weapon?  The hope that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity can finally evolve. (90 min)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Written and directed by Bob Saietta (possibly a.k.a. Bobby Silverman).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has already had one run and is being brought back for another, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something called &quot;The Pretentious Festival&quot; at the Brick Theater in

<em>&gt; Yudkowski Returns!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reviewed by Robert Weinstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski, the lead character in Yudkowski Returns (The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rise And Fall And Rise Again Of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski) wishes he were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japanese. He sits at a desk scattered with seemingly random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paraphernalia, downloads episodes of Lost and analyzes the homoerotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtext of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He orders Chinese food. He puts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on his Psycho-Sociological Hat, dances around the theatre and leaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the narcissistic void of his psyche created by a recent breakup.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He restages significant moments while putting others in newfound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contexts depending on his ability to understand them. And he is not alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has the audience, whom he addresses frequently and with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plastered-on smile, and he has The Assistant, a friendly, disheveled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and increasingly confused woman who is at different times his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girlfriend, his girlfriend-as-ex, his confidante, and his conscience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is she real? I'm not confident Dr. Yudkowski knows. But their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolation—his voluntary, hers more problematic—creates an incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex relationship which plays out as they wait on the appearance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity, an Artificial Intelligence technology that can solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of life's unsolvable problems. It makes sense of the nonsensical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and will bring an end to all of humanity's conflicts as well as Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yudkowski's isolation and, quite possibly, The Assistant's existence.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Apparently I'm played by Patrick McCaffrey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;A charming assistant introduces the entrance of (cue the cheesy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music...) Doctor Yudkowski, played by Patrick, who exudes all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charisma and appeal that Tom Cruise should have had in _Magnolia_.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That was from the original blog post I found, at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://tba-ny.blogspot.com/2007/07/bobby-silverman-my-nemesis-where-has.html">http://tba-ny.blogspot.com/2007/07/bobby-silverman-my-nemesis-where-has.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know what you're all wondering:  &quot;How does Eliezer look in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; director's vision of what his life *should* be like?&quot;  Apparently I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look like this:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since no one had the courtesy to notify me that a play had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced about my life - and possibly Erin's, though I don't know if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Assistant is based on her - if anyone in New York goes to this, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please bring back some photos.  Though it would probably appeal more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the taste of my enemies than my friends, unless you have a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal sense of humor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used to describe myself as a D-list celebrity.  But I guess that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they produce a play about your life, with your name in the title,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they don't bother to tell you, it means you've officially been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoted to a C-list celebrity.  I think next I'm supposed to release
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sex tape of myself or something - no wait, that's how you go from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the B-list to the A-list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's been a very surreal day.
