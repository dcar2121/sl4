That IS surreal!!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Even if someone were to borrow from your life for material for the play you'd think they'd have the decency to change the name or something.  People don't pick real life persons and make plays about their lives do they?  I mean to go so far as to use your name and then talk of AI drones and hope of a singularity... there's no room for coincidence.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You have to go check it out... or at least get in touch with the writer... I mean, wtf?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If it turns out he's someone with a grudge for whatever reason and he wrote this out of malice, you might have a case of libel here... who knows, this writer may become an unwitting financial contributor to the cause!  :D

<br>
Keep us posted!

Right. So apparently there's this guy in New York &gt; whose name I can't remember ever hearing, and who doesn't seem to have &gt; ever emailed me, who's written and directed a play called:&gt; &gt; _Yudkowski Returns: The Rise And Fall And Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer &gt; Yudkowski_&gt; &gt; &quot;In a seemingly deserted island, Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski and his &gt; artificial intelligence drones and cohorts wage a war to keep their &gt; circular narrative from ending. Their only weapon? The hope that &gt; humanity can finally evolve. (90 min)&quot;&gt; &gt; Written and directed by Bob Saietta (possibly a.k.a. Bobby Silverman).&gt; &gt; This has already had one run and is being brought back for another, at &gt; something called &quot;The Pretentious Festival&quot; at the Brick Theater in &gt; Brooklyn, NY:&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.bricktheater.com/pretentious/">http://www.bricktheater.com/pretentious/</a>&gt; &gt; If you're going to be in New York on:&gt; &gt; Tue 7/24 8pm&gt; Tue 7/26 7:30pm&gt; Sat 7/28 3pm&gt; Sat 7/28 9pm&gt; Sun 7/29 3pm&gt; &gt; You can buy tickets for $10:&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/section/synopsis/show/133057">http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/section/synopsis/show/133057</a>&gt; &gt; *&gt; &gt; Yudkowski Returns!&gt; reviewed by Robert Weinstein&gt; &gt; Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski, the lead character in Yudkowski Returns (The &gt; Rise And Fall And Rise Again Of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski) wishes he were &gt; Japanese. He sits at a desk scattered with seemingly random &gt; paraphernalia, downloads episodes of Lost and analyzes the homoerotic &gt; subtext of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He orders Chinese food. He puts &gt; on his Psycho-Sociological Hat, dances around the theatre and leaps &gt; into the narcissistic void of his psyche created by a recent breakup. &gt; He restages significant moments while putting others in newfound &gt; contexts depending on his ability to understand them. And he is not alone.&gt; &gt; He has the audience, whom he addresses frequently and with a &gt; plastered-on smile, and he has The Assistant, a friendly, disheveled, &gt; and increasingly confused woman who is at different times his &gt; girlfriend, his girlfriend-as-ex, his confidante, and his conscience. &gt; Is she real? I'm not confident Dr. Yudkowski knows. But their &gt; isolation—his voluntary, hers more problematic—creates an incredibly &gt; complex relationship which plays out as they wait on the appearance of &gt; The Singularity, an Artificial Intelligence technology that can solve &gt; all of life's unsolvable problems. It makes sense of the nonsensical &gt; and will bring an end to all of humanity's conflicts as well as Dr. &gt; Yudkowski's isolation and, quite possibly, The Assistant's existence.&gt; &gt; [ Continued at:&gt; <a href="http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/P07rev_02.htm#400">http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/P07rev_02.htm#400</a>&gt; &gt; *&gt; &gt; Apparently I'm played by Patrick McCaffrey:&gt; &gt; &quot;A charming assistant introduces the entrance of (cue the cheesy &gt; music...) Doctor Yudkowski, played by Patrick, who exudes all the &gt; charisma and appeal that Tom Cruise should have had in _Magnolia_.&quot;&gt; &gt; That was from the original blog post I found, at:&gt; <a href="http://tba-ny.blogspot.com/2007/07/bobby-silverman-my-nemesis-where-has.html">http://tba-ny.blogspot.com/2007/07/bobby-silverman-my-nemesis-where-has.html</a>&gt; &gt; I know what you're all wondering: &quot;How does Eliezer look in the &gt; director's vision of what his life *should* be like?&quot; Apparently I &gt; look like this:&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.amrep.org/people/patrick.html">http://www.amrep.org/people/patrick.html</a>&gt; &gt; *&gt; &gt; Since no one had the courtesy to notify me that a play had been &gt; produced about my life - and possibly Erin's, though I don't know if &gt; The Assistant is based on her - if anyone in New York goes to this, do &gt; please bring back some photos. Though it would probably appeal more &gt; to the taste of my enemies than my friends, unless you have a very &gt; liberal sense of humor.&gt; &gt; I used to describe myself as a D-list celebrity. But I guess that &gt; when they produce a play about your life, with your name in the title, &gt; and they don't bother to tell you, it means you've officially been &gt; promoted to a C-list celebrity. I think next I'm supposed to release &gt; a sex tape of myself or something - no wait, that's how you go from &gt; the B-list to the A-list.&gt; &gt; It's been a very surreal day.&gt; &gt; -- &gt; Eliezer S.
