</em><br>
<p>I think this is funny, because I am the last person to
<br>
advocate lying to people!  :-)  Just ask Michael
<br>
Anissimov, who I just had a rather long and heated
<br>
debate over this issue at Imminst.org
<br>
<p>Quite the contrary, I think these ideas need to gain
<br>
greater currency... and the misunderstanding, even
<br>
among transhumanists, should be the first clue that
<br>
these ideas are not coming across accurately to
<br>
people.  Michael set me straight regarding the mission
<br>
of the Singularity Institute, this despite the fact
<br>
that I have read most of Eli's work, and have been an
<br>
active member of the Transhumanist community since
<br>
1991.
<br>
<p>Michael himself admitted that he had to read some of
<br>
the Eli's work 4 times before having an adequate grasp
<br>
of the concepts.  So if Michael, who is clearly
<br>
brilliant, had to read the Singulatarian principles
<br>
that many times, imagine how difficult it will be for
<br>
most everyone else.  No, what I'm saying is
<br>
considerable effort need to made to translate Eli's
<br>
work into a more easily digestible form that gets
<br>
people clued in to what we're advocating, and why. 
<br>
Clear communication is an art, not a science, and it
<br>
must be done with a deep respect and understanding of
<br>
your audience.
