<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>I could and have argued that the reductionists have
<br>
not forwarded the discussion either.   It seems to me
<br>
that Dennett and other reductionist have tried to
<br>
&quot;explain away&quot; the hard problem.  I'm seeing the same
<br>
mistake here, and I don't think I should apologize for
<br>
pointing it out.  To me it seems that people in the
<br>
reductionist camp refuse to acknowledge that the hard
<br>
problem even exists, and continue to place the problem
<br>
within the domain of the easy problem.   I am not
<br>
speaking of something &quot;mysterious&quot;, as much as it may
<br>
seem to you from a reductionist perspective.  I agree,
<br>
from a reductionist perspective the hard problem
<br>
appears mysterious.  
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that

</em><br>
<p>Change?  Since when?  This debate has been raging for
<br>
centuries.  Again, I would say and have said that
<br>
reductionist are guilty of the same.  And their
<br>
oversight in acknoweldging the &quot;inner experience&quot; has
<br>
been equally unhelpful.  If anything it has been the
<br>
reductionist who are trying to change the definition
<br>
of the hard problem in order for it to fit the model
<br>
(reductionism).  This is unhelpful, as it places the
<br>
problem within premature constraints.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different?  And can you tell us why the change is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed?
</em><br>
<p>The question that each of these camps is asking is
<br>
different.  Can you explain to me why I should stick
<br>
with your question rather than mine?  I know you think
<br>
you are correct, and I think I am.  So we each ask a
<br>
different question, but we are in the same
<br>
predicament.
<br>
<p>So here's coming back at you.  :-)
<br>
<p>Warmly,
<br>
<p>Paul
<br>
<p>P.S. Like Jef, I'm taking a breather on this one for now.
