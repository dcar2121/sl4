<p><p>Because they can keep their processors fed with data.  That's all

memory latency really measures, how many objects can be referenced per 
<br>
second.  A human brain typically references roughly three orders of 
<br>
magnitude more objects per second than our fastest processors.  For 
<br>
large fine-grained data structures (like the brain), memory latency (or 
<br>
if you prefer, object reference throughput) *is* the computational 
<br>
limit, not IPC and clock speed.
<br>
<p>People are not used to thinking of things this way, but memory latency 
<br>
pretty much defines the computational limits of our universe.  It isn't 
<br>
as obvious as Instructions Per Second or the amount of memory you have, 
<br>
but it is a lot more important if you have to confine yourself to 
<br>
finite time horizons.
<br>
<p>Study the consequences of finite information propagation speeds (of 
<br>
which memory latency is an example) on computational theory.  It is the 
<br>
gravest restriction on intelligence that this universe appears to have. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not insignificantly, it is the only computational parameter in 
<br>
which the brain *clearly* is orders of magnitude superior to the 
<br>
silicon we can manufacture today.
