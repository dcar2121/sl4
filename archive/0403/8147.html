<p>
I think it would be good to explore the issue of whether there are ethics 
<br>
in the cosmos (that should be conformed to) a bit further.
<br>
<p>Quite a few people on the list have been happy to dismiss the 
<br>
existance of a god (or gods!), but have moved straight on to suggest 
<br>
that there is an intrinsic ethic in the cosmos AND that we should try to 
<br>
conform with it. I must say this has a feeling to me of &quot;the king is dead, 
<br>
long live the king&quot;.
<br>
<p>Even if we adopted the idea that the cosmos is like a super 
<br>
computation (welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy!) and 
<br>
that this system has a goal and that a goal system is a sort of ethical 
<br>
system (if things are abstracted to the limit)...this notion doesn't take 
<br>
account of the fact that *we* are *in the middle of the computation* and 
<br>
that the computation is not finished and we haven't got the foggiest 
<br>
idea of where it's going to end up over the next few billion years across 
<br>
billions of galaxy clusters, with billions of galaxies with billions of stars 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>If the universal computation is still in process then all we can claim to 
<br>
have a glimpse of is an extrapolation of where we think we are now.  
<br>
Once you throw sentients and later super-intellgences into the mix the 
<br>
dynamics of the universal computation *must* change.
<br>
<p>If someone could stand outside time and space and look at our 
<br>
universe they might be able to say something about it's end state 
<br>
(assuming there is one) but we are in the belly of the beast and we 
<br>
can't do that.
<br>
<p>For us and any other sentients all we can do is shape our lives 
<br>
according to what we think is a worthwhile thing to do.  No matter what 
<br>
the universal computation looks like to an external observer free from 
<br>
space and time, for us it will look like evolution where every moment 
<br>
we and all the other constitutuent elelments of the universe shape our 
<br>
future (and the unfolding universe) by the choices we make.
<br>
<p>If we all decided that Ben was right and that &quot;voluntary joyous growth&quot; 
<br>
is what we (and all/most of the other sentients across the universe!) 
<br>
should go for then that's the sort of universe that we will evolve (at least 
<br>
for a while).  If a lot of other (effective/powerful) sentients decide that 
<br>
some other ethical structure or goal structure is what should be aimed 
<br>
for then some other future state of the universe will unfold (at least for 
<br>
a time).
<br>
<p>So to my mind the issue is not to second-guess our ethics or morality 
<br>
from what we divine in the entrails of the universe but to make 
<br>
decisions based on what we think would create a better universe from 
<br>
where we stand now.  In other words I think our challenge is not to try to 
<br>
guess what the universe wants or demands and then try to conform to 
<br>
that (or be forced to conform to some actual sentients view of what they 
<br>
think the universe is telling them) but to engage in an act of invention 
<br>
or creation (bounded by by practicalities dictated by our present 
<br>
circumstances).
<br>
<p>And for me when I do that, I feel attracted by the possibilities of a world 
<br>
with compassion and respect for others that Samantha has talked about 
<br>
and also a world with curiosity and delight in the unfolding of 
<br>
complexity that Ben has talked about.  And it seems to me that we 
<br>
could pursue both these goals simultaneously.
<br>
<p>But the reality is that not everyone will agree with my preferred goal set 
<br>
or anyone else's goal set for that matter - in its entirety.  However, my 
<br>
guess is that most sentients, if asked would like to be treated with 
<br>
respect and to have a say in shaping their future and so for as long as 
<br>
there is still freedom of choice this ethic is likely to emerge as a partial 
<br>
or near consensus from most groups of sentients.
<br>
<p>After that, I reckon it's up to everyone to find enough kindred spirits to 
<br>
create the other charaterisitics of the universe that they desire.  So I 
<br>
would imagine a whole bunch of &quot;voluntary joyous growthists&quot; 
<br>
beavering away creating that in the universe and there will be a bunch 
<br>
of &quot;nostalgists&quot; working away at keeping things going from the past into 
<br>
the future, and other groups, and yet more groups of sentients doing all 
<br>
kinds of stuff under a zillion different goal structures.  And should Ben 
<br>
live forever he'll find his joyous growth *emerging* from the diverse 
<br>
interplay of zillions of sentients persuing zillions of goal structures - but 
<br>
in the main NOT arising because these sentients consciously pursued 
<br>
&quot;voluntary joyous growth&quot; as Ben has formulated the goal.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
