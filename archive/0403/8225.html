Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also I think there's a lot the US (and other countries) could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do to reduce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the risk of terrorist attacks on US citizens or US allies by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way the US (and other countries) relates to the rest of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist attacks don't come out of thin air - there is a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of history 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind them.
</em><br>
<p>Well, current US policy has many flaws, but it's worth noting that a
<br>
Luddite attitude underlies part of what pisses off bin Laden and crew.
<br>
These guys hate modern technology and the cultural and psychological
<br>
changes it has caused.  The US is hated for some of its specific acts,
<br>
but also because it's a conveninent symbol for modern technology and
<br>
culture (which has led humanity away from the True Path, i.e. the
<br>
fundamentalist incarnation of Muslim religion...)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; By the way, can you explain exactly how you can escape the 'system' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via the singularity?  My guess is that, for those entities that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escalating post-human brain power, the singularity won't feel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different to business as usual with a high innovation rate - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be able to keep up mentally with the speed of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes.  So if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think you'll be in there amongst the mentally enhanced what makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think you won't find 'the system' in there with you?
</em><br>
<p>Philip, there will be no BUSINESS AS USUAL in an environment of such
<br>
rapid change -- the concept of &quot;as usual&quot; doesn't apply!!  Having minds
<br>
that are able keep up with highly rapid change is NOT the same as having
<br>
minds that are adapted to stasis or slow change...
<br>
<p>As for &quot;the system&quot;, I think he was referring to the current
<br>
psychological/social/cultural/political/economic system, which
<br>
absolutely will NOT retain its current position of power
<br>
post-Singularity.  Though it may have power over select subdomains,
<br>
consisting of being who have chosen (or potentially are forced) to live
<br>
in a simulacrum of pre-Singularity reality.
<br>
<p>The fact that there will be *some* system, doesn't mean that it will be
<br>
the same one....
<br>
<p>-- Ben G.
