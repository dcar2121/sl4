I made some seraches on Amazon.com and found very few general books on AI.
<br>
The best I found to have a general view on the subject was &quot;Artificial
<br>
Minds&quot; by Stan Franklin
<br>
Also &quot;The Society of Mind&quot; by Marvin Minsky ,but than again this late one
<br>
seems that hans't lead to anywhere in the last 20 years or so.
<br>
I bought also &quot;Reinforcement Learning, an introduction&quot; by Stton and Barto
<br>
and found it very deep and difficult to undertsand.
<br>
Also, there is Roger Penrose, which doesn't insterest me at all: intelectual
<br>
balooney.
<br>
And the classic &quot;Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach&quot; by Stuart J.
<br>
Russell
<br>
In my WISHLIST , I have &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Guide to Intelligent
<br>
Systems&quot; by Michael Negnevitsky.
<br>
Anyway, we can always search for specific themes like: agents, neural
<br>
networks and so on but the reality is that there are very few books on AI.
<br>
<p>What are your hints and comments?
