Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, for an analogy to the Manhattan project to hold would require 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the government is  at least as clear on what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievable and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely way to get there as we were on producing an atomic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bomb.   I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not at all sure that this is the case.  Do you believe this much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarity exists?  If it does not then similar levels of resource and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort focus would not necessarily be successful.   It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt it qualifies as &quot;quite possible&quot; yet.   But you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closer (to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say the least) to the state of general understanding and focus on AGI.
</em><br>
<p>I think that there's a lot better understanding of AGI now than there
<br>
was 5 years ago.
<br>
<p>To name just a couple contributions: Marcus Hutter's work has clarified
<br>
the theoretical-computer-science basis of AGI work, and Eric Baum's
<br>
conceptual work in &quot;What Is Thought?&quot; has made valuable connections
<br>
between Hutter/Solomonoff style AGI theory and contemporary cognitive
<br>
science.  Frankly, their work is along the same lines as a lot of stuff
<br>
I published in the early 1990's, but they have developed the ideas with
<br>
more rigor and reached a larger audience.
<br>
<p>So, I think there is a growing community who understands *what kind of
<br>
problem* AGI is, and a handful of groups proposing *plausible solutions*
<br>
to the problem.  Next comes a phase of experimentation to find out how
<br>
workable these plausible solutions are.  Theory will develop along with
<br>
this experimentation.  
<br>
<p>Among individuals on this list, I count my own work and that of Peter
<br>
Voss and James Rogers as among the apparently plausible solutions.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I believe that that level of funding of some of the existing projects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that do have a pretty good idea of what they are about could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeed in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that timeframe.  But I don't believe that government 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involvement would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in the resources going to such groups at this time.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, due to politics-of-the-science-establishment issues...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
