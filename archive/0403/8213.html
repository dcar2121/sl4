<p>So why not bypass the &quot;major funding bodies&quot; and the NSF entirely?   I 
<br>
don't see why a strong memetic push could not garner enough angel

investment to fund a $20 million effort, especially spread over a few 
<br>
years.   It is even conceivable that a strong push among thousands of 
<br>
interested less well-heeled persons could do the trick.    This just 
<br>
isn't that terribly much money for the potentially huge return.
<br>
<p>I imagine this has already been tried.  What was in the way there?
