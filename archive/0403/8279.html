</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>hmmm.  I still don't see what this adds to programming languages per 
<br>
se.  For that matter, I am not sure if you could define a non 
<br>
XML-compliant language, i.e., one that you could not represent at the 
<br>
syntax and documentation levels (and some meta of these) in XML.  I 
<br>
believe you made this point earlier.    I don't see where the *data* 
<br>
standards, tools, thoughts, infrastructure and so on for XML greatly 
<br>
benefit language which, as you admit, have quite significant non-data 
<br>
characteristics.

<em>&gt;&gt; Lisp is as efficient in its compiled form as C with a bit of care.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is quite scalable.  To argue that it is not would be effectively to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; argue that no languages are scalable as every other language can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expressed in Lisp.   That is rather a lot of power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The compiled code of ANY compiled programming language is as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other if it is used with a bit/a lot of care, compiled well, AND 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses the same algorithms.  There is, however, a huge difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compiled code and functions that are declared at run-time unless your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment takes the time out from execution to compile those.
</em><br>
<p>In the Lisp world you could consider compilation simply another 
<br>
transformation of the data/code without even stepping out of Lisp. That 
<br>
is pretty cool in my book.   With Lisp macros you can in many cases 
<br>
compile on first use in even such totally dynamically created code and 
<br>
work at full compiled speed from then on.   Lisp communities invented 
<br>
JIT compiler technology over a decade before Java was even an idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Further,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a huge difference in the speed and scalability of data access 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lookup methods.  LISP innately causes the programmer to look at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a list.
</em><br>
<p>This hasn't been true for over 2 decades.   Perhaps you need to update 
<br>
your knowledge of Lisp.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Would you rather look-up your first name in an ordered list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; names or in a balanced b-tree?  Yes, the balanced b-tree could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LOGICALLY in list form but the tree-balancing operations required 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition and deletion would not be as optimized (scalable) as with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raw,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specially designed data structure.
</em><br>
<p>Are you making some claim that that sort of data structure can't be 
<br>
built quite simply and efficiently in Lisp?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   The problem that I have with virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every LISP environment is the same problem that I have with most other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming environments.  It tries to - - nay, insists that it - - do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EVERYTHING, including things that it isn't good at.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Lisp is good at far more than you seem to be aware of.
