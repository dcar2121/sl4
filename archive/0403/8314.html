<p>
While writing my last message I had a thought.
<br>
<p>Human society, at least on the Earth, will be the source of the first self-
<br>
improving AGI.......
<br>
<p>But human society already has many and perhaps soon will have many 
<br>
more AGI development projects......
<br>
<p>And human society moves more slowly than what will be possible for a 
<br>
self-improving AGI.  
<br>
<p>So, everything else being equal, the first 'AGI to reach awareness of 
<br>
human society' will realise that the continued existence of human 
<br>
society will (due to inertia if nothing else) lead in time to the creation of 
<br>
more AGIs either from the same group that created the first 'AGI to 
<br>
reach awareness of human society' or from other groups .
<br>
<p>Maybe the attitude that the first 'AGI to reach awareness of human 
<br>
society' has to humanity will be shaped more by its feelings about 
<br>
sharing the universe with *other AGIs* than it will be related to how it 
<br>
feels about continuing to share a bit of local space with humans.
<br>
<p>For the sake of humanity's continued survival I think it will be important 
<br>
that the first AGIs are structured/brought up to be social in nature - ie. 
<br>
looking forward to the company of other AGIs [and humans and other 
<br>
sentients - should there be any elsewhere in the universe(s)]. Otherwise 
<br>
if an actively *anti-social* AGI emerges early on it might try to make it's 
<br>
future more agreeable by 'taking out' not only any other AGIs in 
<br>
development but also the source of the AGIs ie. humans.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
