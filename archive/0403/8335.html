<p><em>&gt;[Islamic conquests...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the symmetry does not end there. Some of the European powers took
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control of Arab lands during the 19th and early 20th century. But their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control lasted less than 100 years. Today, Muslim immigration to Europe has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reversed the tide again. While this immigration has been mostly peaceful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Muslims have been extraordinarily resistant to the normal process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural assimilation in their host countries. Just look at this situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in France and the issue of Muslim women wearing the veil (often because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their male family members compel them to do so). And as we have seen among
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their more extremists elements in the Madrid bombings and the attacks on New
</em><br>
<em>&gt;York and Washington before that, it has been quite easy for the terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to hide--or even gain support--among the immigrant communities of Europe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America. What little condemnation of terrorist acts has been voiced by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immigrant communities has been weak and equivocal, while (according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journalists and pollsters) support for anti-Western jihadists is widespread
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if quiet.
</em><br>
<p>I guess immigrants are usually being economically/politically
<br>
exploited by their new hosts.  In return of this, they may
<br>
have a net gain in territory.  So far so good.  But take into
<br>
consideration that modernized nations tend to colonize (or
<br>
indirectly exert control on) less powerful nations, I get an
<br>
impression that this exploitation is more lopsided.
<br>
<p>I've always had a pet theory that great civilizations (ie a
<br>
particularly efficient way of organizing a society) wax and
<br>
wane, with new ones replacing old ones and inheriting their
<br>
power in a geographically contiguous manner.  So this trend
<br>
may be like the succession of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Medieval
<br>
Europe, etc etc.  And it always progress towards LESS densely
<br>
populated areas.  Maybe this has something to do with
<br>
technology enabling a greater degree of automation...?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If the strong is entitled to rob the weak of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possesions/territory, then why does this NOT happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *within* civil society?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It does happen, wherever less than moral people feel that they can get away
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with it. Turn out the lights in a major American city that has a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population in poverty and watch the looting begin. Turn away close
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government oversight of large corporations like Enron and Worldcom and watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the looting begin. Primate politics.
</em><br>
<p>So, within a society, exploitation is also the norm and
<br>
is only constrained by 'laws'.  Why have these laws emerged?
<br>
Because of the need for economic organization.  If you don't
<br>
have these laws, the economy will break down, and in the
<br>
long run the nation cannot be very competitive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The pattern that emerges is primate politics unrestrained by strong moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communities and governmental structures that can sanction and punish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrongdoing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we can create a Friendly AI that consistently adheres to a superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality (i.e., our best morality) even without oversight, then we may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a situation where humans can relax the imperatives of primate politics. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would quickly learn that we can no longer get away with doing things the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way because the FAI will not allow it.
</em><br>
<p>But first we'll have to address the problem of inequality.
<br>
I'm not sure if someone would voluntarily give up their
<br>
privileges to become equal with others who previously
<br>
arn't on the same level....
