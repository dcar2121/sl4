Stockholm Syndrome, more descriptively capture-bonding, is a conditionally 
<br>
switched on evolved psychological trait humans have.  See 
<br>
<a href="http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/cults.html">http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/cults.html</a> for discussion re this 
<br>
trait and the attention-reward mechanism (awkward terms, I know).
<br>
<p>I need suggestions for what to call the psychological mechanism(s) that 
<br>
induce humans (and chimps) into making organized war on other groups either 
<br>
as a result of being attacked or due to xenophobic memes amplified by 
<br>
privation/looming privation.  Shorter terms based on Greek or Latin roots 
<br>
for war or war gods would probably be better.
<br>
<p>I am not far from having the first draft of this article done.  If any are 
<br>
interested in reviewing the draft, send me a note.

<p>Evolutionary Psychology, Memes, The Origin of War, and Empowering Women 
<br>
(Tentative title)
<br>
<p>By H. Keith Henson
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT.  (DRAFT)
<br>
<p>Our ancestors always lived close to their ecological limit, an unstable 
<br>
upper bound for how many hominids (or lions or tigers or bears) an 
<br>
environment can support.  When reproduction pushes populations over the 
<br>
limit or the limit fluctuates down because conditions vary, part of the 
<br>
population will die, typically by starvation.  Humans have evolved a 
<br>
psychological response to looming starvation; a mechanism that induced 
<br>
tribes to make war on nearby tribes.  The psychological response increases 
<br>
the circulation of xenophobic memes among groups facing 
<br>
privation.  Xenophobic memes break down the normal reluctance of humans to 
<br>
attacking other humans and synchronize warriors of one tribe to attack 
<br>
another.  Genes inducing suicidal behavior in the (male) members of a weak 
<br>
tribe attacking a strong tribe had a selective advantage because the losing 
<br>
tribe's young females (carriers of those genes) were usually incorporated 
<br>
into the winning tribe.  From a gene's perspective this was better than 
<br>
starvation.   In war situations self-preserving (rational) behavior has not 
<br>
been favored by selection.  I.e., &quot;stupid&quot; decisions should be expected.
<br>
<p>Being attacked turns on a related psychological response, rapidly inducing 
<br>
xenophobia and a fighting response even in groups not facing starvation.
<br>
<p>With appropriate mapping (looming starvation/privation into expected or 
<br>
actual declining income per capita) this evolved psychological mechanism 
<br>
accounts for the origin of most (if not all) historical wars.  While war 
<br>
was adaptive for hunter-gatherer level societies, war is poorly adapted for 
<br>
human societies above that level.
<br>
<p>Inherent in this model is a prescription for avoiding wars: keep income per 
<br>
capita rising or at least not falling for *all* human groups.  Population 
<br>
growth itself does not lead to wars, but population growth in excess of 
<br>
economic growth does.  Empowering women to limit births to a level below 
<br>
economic growth appears to be a key to avoiding wars or ending long running 
<br>
conflicts.
