<p>
I think that some level of moderation is essential for any well run list. 
<br>
And ensuring that posts to a list are relevant to a list's purpose is 
<br>
critical.  But how can this be achieved most effectively?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that we can approach the issue from two quite distinct 
<br>
perspectives:
<br>
- a boundaries approach
<br>
- a focus/repulsion approach
<br>
<p>If we use the boundaries approach we have a strict application of rules 
<br>
about what's in and what's not in.  But in any complex issue there are 
<br>
usually not sharp dividing lines between what's relevant and what's not.  
<br>
Also using a strict boundaries approach dicussion can go on for ages 
<br>
within the approved boundary but without really advancing the 
<br>
purposes of the list, while another conversation that might be making a 
<br>
contribution might be cut off at the socks because it triggers a boundary 
<br>
rule.
<br>
<p>Another way to go is to use a focus/repulsion approach.  Someone 
<br>
needs to define the core purpose of the list (the focus) and 
<br>
topics/modes of dicussion that are generally considered to be not 
<br>
relevent or appropriate and then contributions can be encouraged or 
<br>
reined in depending on how well they contribute to the core purpose(s) 
<br>
of the list or how bably they stray into repulsion topics/modes. If 
<br>
contributions are straying too far off the focus of the list or too far 
<br>
towards the repulsion topics/modes then the moderators can publicly or 
<br>
privately caution contributors. When there is no sharp boundary there is 
<br>
obviously room for interpretation about how off-topic a discussion is.  
<br>
But at the end of the day the moderator has to make a final judgement.
<br>
<p>My own feeling is that the SL4 list moderation process is too much 
<br>
based on sharp boundaries and would benefit from using the 
<br>
focus/repulsion approach.
<br>
<p>An additional approach might be to ask discussants to take a topic off 
<br>
the list and continue it privately (possibly via a temporary list) until the 
<br>
thinking is developed far enough to bring the issue back to the SL4 list 
<br>
in a way that is contributing strongly to the purpose of the list and that 
<br>
avoids the repulsion modes.
<br>
<p>Rather than either simply accepting or rejecting my suggestion, it might 
<br>
be worth running an experiment for a short while using the 
<br>
focus/repulsion approach to see how well it can work for the SL4 list 
<br>
modertors and list participants.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
