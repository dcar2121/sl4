Hi Marc,  
<br>
<p>In my experience most people are really quite nice until they get really 
<br>
scared.  I don't think it helps to build pictures in our mind of 'everyone' 
<br>
out there being out to get 'us'.  That sort of paranoia can actually trigger 
<br>
scary actions that make things worse.
<br>
<p>Sure there are terrorists around, but they are a vanishingly small % of 
<br>
the population.  So I don't think it helps to start hating or despising too 
<br>
widely because of the barbaric actions of a small handfull of people.
<br>
<p>Also I think there's a lot the US (and other countries) could do to reduce 
<br>
the risk of terrorist attacks on US citizens or US allies by changing the 
<br>
way the US (and other countries) relates to the rest of the world.  The 
<br>
terrorist attacks don't come out of thin air - there is a lot of history 
<br>
behind them.
<br>
<p>By the way, can you explain exactly how you can escape the 'system' 
<br>
via the singularity?  My guess is that, for those entities that have 
<br>
escalating post-human brain power, the singularity won't feel that much 
<br>
different to business as usual with a high innovation rate - because they 
<br>
will be able to keep up mentally with the speed of the changes.  So if 
<br>
you think you'll be in there amongst the mentally enhanced what makes 
<br>
you think you won't find 'the system' in there with you?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
