<em>&gt; &gt;The problem is that win or lose war was adaptive for your genes when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lived as hunter-gatherers.  Thus we have evolved psychological mechanisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that lead to tribes (or nations) going to war based on economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;issues--currently income per capita though the origin of the mechanism was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;game and berries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Aggressiveness probably evolved much earlier in phylogeny.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but aggressiveness is *not* war.  War is an emergent phenomena 
<br>
where one social group attacks another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure how much new genetic traits have accumulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific to primates or hominids.
</em><br>
<p>It is clear from Jane Goodall's work (and related studies) that wars 
<br>
resulting in genocide of neighboring groups is something chimpanzees 
<br>
do.   That makes it likely, though not certain, that wars between groups of 
<br>
hominids dates back to the time of the split.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Humans who are not facing looming privation/starvation don't start wars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;though they can still be attacked by those with the root cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then how do you account for imperialism where it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;powerful nations that initiate wars?
</em><br>
<p>First, be specific, *which* war?  Second, evolutionary adaptions made when 
<br>
our ancestors lived as hunter-gatherers can't be expected to be 
<br>
particularly adaptive in world so far removed from the Environment of 
<br>
Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)

<p>I used &quot;looming privation&quot; above.  Because humans (and animals in general) 
<br>
respond to differences, you can soak one hand in hot water and one in cold, 
<br>
then put them both in warm water.  The hand that was in the hot water will 
<br>
find the warm cold and the one that was in the cold will find the same 
<br>
water hot.  Thus you don't need actual starvation; gloomy economic outlooks 
<br>
for a people that had been doing well are enough to trip xenophobic meme 
<br>
buildups leading to war or related social disruptions.
<br>
<p>Robert Cialdini talks about *relative* economics in _Influence_ as a cause 
<br>
for wars and related social unrest such as riots.  He cites James C. Davis 
<br>
on this topic:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The idea that newly experienced scarcity is the more powerful kind 
<br>
applies to situations well beyond the bounds of the cookie study. For 
<br>
example, social scientists have determined that such scarcity is a primary 
<br>
cause of political turmoil and violence. Perhaps the most prominent 
<br>
proponent of this argument is James C. Davies, who states that we are most 
<br>
likely to find revolutions where a period of improving economic and social 
<br>
conditions is followed by a short, sharp reversal in those conditions. Thus 
<br>
it is not the traditionally most downtrodden people-who have come to see 
<br>
their deprivation as part of the natural order of things who are especially 
<br>
liable to revolt. Instead, revolutionaries are more likely to be those who 
<br>
have been given at least some taste of a better life. When the economic and 
<br>
social improvements they have experienced and come to expect suddenly 
<br>
become less available, they desire them more than ever and often rise up 
<br>
violently to secure them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Davies has gathered persuasive evidence for his novel thesis from a 
<br>
range of revolutions, revolts, and internal wars, including the French, 
<br>
Russian, and Egyptian revolutions as well as such domestic uprisings as 
<br>
Dorr's Rebellion in nineteenth-century Rhode Island, the American Civil 
<br>
War, and the urban black riots of the 1960s. In each case, a time of 
<br>
increasing well-being preceded a tight cluster of reversals that burst into 
<br>
violence.&quot;
<br>
<p>This response is exactly what you would expect to have evolved in 
<br>
hunter-gatherers faced with a periodic requirement to reduce their 
<br>
population in the face of ecological fluctuations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The economic connection to wars is *very old* information.  But it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;first time I know about that the evolutionary psychology origin of wars has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;been understood.  It leads to obvious solutions, but they are slow to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Here's a question for you.  If the population simply *had* to be cut way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;back (say due to an ice age starting) would war or disease be the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;choice?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't understand what you're trying to imply, but if I die
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of disease then my 'kinsman' (people genetically related to me)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be most likely to inherit what I've left over.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, though if your shared genes were part of the reason they were 
<br>
killed by an epidemic, there might not be anyone related to 
<br>
inherit.  That's what happened when European diseases (such as measles) 
<br>
wiped out the Mound Builders in the Mississippi Valley.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.artsmia.org/surrounded-by-beauty/curriculum/Mississippi.pdf">http://www.artsmia.org/surrounded-by-beauty/curriculum/Mississippi.pdf</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a war and if I lose then my assets will be taken by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enemy, resulting in loss of territory.  It would be a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strange theory if you're saying people start wars unconsciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hoping to lose and to have their women marry off the winners.
</em><br>
<p>That's an incorrect oversimplification of what I am saying.  Economic 
<br>
reasons (originally access to food resources) are the deep gene based 
<br>
reasons people start wars.
<br>
<p>Wars were *conditionally* advantageous to genes.  In good times with plenty 
<br>
to eat, your genes were much better off raising kids with copies of those 
<br>
genes than getting in group fights with hostile neighbors where you and 
<br>
your genes may both come to a sorry end.  So genes build human with a 
<br>
normal thinking bias we call &quot;rational&quot; and we stay out of such fights most 
<br>
of the time.
<br>
<p>But when enough people are successful in raising those kids, the 
<br>
environment eventually becomes overloaded and/or there is a glitch in the 
<br>
weather.  Now these brains built by genes have to switch to an alternate 
<br>
behavior, move to new lands (normally impossible in a filled up world) or 
<br>
fight neighbors for their resources.  This is necessary but it is (using a 
<br>
rational mind state) obviously dangerous.
<br>
<p>The genes overcome the normal rational bias against putting yourself in 
<br>
danger of being killed by creating brains with the psychological trait of 
<br>
responding to and spreading xenophobic memes when times start looking 
<br>
bad.  Indeed, the word I coined back in 1985 of &quot;memeoid,&quot; is 
<br>
appropriate.  (&quot;. . .  victims that have been taken over by a meme to the 
<br>
extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Groups who start wars--especially where they people they are fighting are 
<br>
more numerous--are optimistic over their prospects to prevail.  Outsiders 
<br>
would call a lot of them deluded.
<br>
<p>Where the young women come in is through Hamilton's inclusive fitness 
<br>
criteria.  They have copies of the genes of the warriors who go off to 
<br>
glory or death.  In tribal days (when all this selection happened) the 
<br>
winning tribe usually killed the males of the losers and took the women, 
<br>
thus preserving genes that build brains capable of spreading xenophobic 
<br>
memes and entering the deluded state needed to go to war.
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
<br>
<p>PS  Writing came along toward the end of the tribal era so some of our 
<br>
early written records discuss this common practice.  For example Numbers 
<br>
31:18.  &quot;But all the female children who have had no sex relations with 
<br>
men, you may keep for yourselves.&quot; and
<br>
Deuteronomy 20:13-14  When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill 
<br>
every man in the town.  But you may keep for yourselves all the women, 
<br>
children, livestock, and other plunder.
