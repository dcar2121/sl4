Hi Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BG: Basically, what this reply says to me is that you don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be a Singularity in the same sense that many of us do.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is more in the spirit of the more mild-mannered of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil's statements.  In my view, the Singularity will be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomparably larger change than any of these previous changes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're describing. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; BG: You don't seem to accept the possibility of truly fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in the nature of reality and/or mind. ........ your vision of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future seems SL3 not SL4 
</em><br>
<p>I went back to Eliezer's reference that you quoted and read some of the 
<br>
links from that document to get a better feel for whether I'm thinking 
<br>
more in the SL3 or the SL4 mode. 
<br>
(<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/sing/shocklevels.html">http://yudkowsky.net/sing/shocklevels.html</a>).
<br>
<p>I agree with you that, post-singularity, we cannot know what things will 
<br>
be like in terms of the nature of reality and/or mind.  So in that sense I 
<br>
think it's fair to say that, at least, intellectually I can glimpse the SL4 
<br>
discontiuity. But it's hard to come to terms with it (a) because it's 
<br>
fundamentally unknowable and yet (b) what can be imagined vaguely 
<br>
could shake up the status quo in every direction so strongly. 
<br>
<p>Maybe what I've been trying to say can be better understood as being 
<br>
relevant to the *lead up* to the singularity proper.  I think the lead up 
<br>
will not be 'just' the time between pre- and post-singularity but will be a 
<br>
significant time in its own right (perhaps with the power to send 
<br>
significant reverberations into what follows the singularity).
<br>
<p>Whether or not there is ever more than one AGI I think the introduction 
<br>
of one or more AGIs into the universe will add massively to the 
<br>
complexity of the universe (or the parts of the universe where AGI/AGIs 
<br>
have not been before).  AGIs will be capable of faster and faster 
<br>
thought for any given level of complexity of thinking.  But it may well be 
<br>
that AGIs choose sometimes or often to expand the complexity of their 
<br>
thought rather than simply shrinking the absolute amount of time taken 
<br>
to reach conclusions.  So it's not a foregone conclusion that subjective 
<br>
time will shrink for all issues, and at all times, in the dramatic way that 
<br>
some people have speculated.  AGIs when first emerging with have a 
<br>
prodigeous amount to learn and assimilate.  And developing new deep 
<br>
knowledge and insights will, I imagine, continue to be, at times, a non-
<br>
trivial task.  Maybe a measure of wisdom of new self-improving AGIs 
<br>
will be the extent to which they take advantage of the acceleration of 
<br>
subjective time to enable better-thought-out actions in absolute time.
<br>
<p>I still feel that a super AGI or populations of AGIs will still be faced with 
<br>
key questions like:
<br>
- what to learn and what not to learn?
<br>
- what to invent and what not to?
<br>
- what to change and what not to change?
<br>
- when to change things and when not to?
<br>
- what to build on and what to abandon?
<br>
- what to keep from the present/past and what not to keep?
<br>
<p>Ben, do you think these questions will become obsolete?  Surely 
<br>
evolution is unlikely to become obsolete and if that is the case wouldn't 
<br>
these questions remain relevant?
<br>
<p>I can't see that raising issues like these is a sign of a failure to move 
<br>
from shock level 3 to shock level 4 thinking/mind sets??
<br>
<p>The model of the approach to the singularity where we have life more 
<br>
or less as we have known it and then in a flash we have the post 
<br>
singularity world seems to me to be almost designed to wish away the 
<br>
hard thinking about how to move up to or make the transition to the 
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>It reminds me of the early Bolsheviks who refused to speculate on the 
<br>
future post-revolution because the world would be remade.  And look 
<br>
where that got us!  :)
<br>
<p>If we can assume that evolution is not abolished as a meta-process by 
<br>
the singularity then we can assume that history still counts as a shaper 
<br>
of the future.  If that's true then the lead up to the singularity is very 
<br>
important - so I think we need to expand our thinking about this phase.  
<br>
And as workable AGIs develop (not super AGIs initially) they can be 
<br>
recruited to work on the issue of understanding options for the lead-up 
<br>
to the singularity.  This joint working process automatically then makes 
<br>
the lead up to the singularity even more complex and interesting.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
