</em><br>
<p>Xanada hypertext took a similar approach for similar reasons.
<br>
<p>About 80% of the code was written in Smalltalk and autoconverted to 
<br>
C++.  The rest was raw C++.
<br>
<p>The version I worked on had fixed size pointers but the general design had 
<br>
been worked out in variable sized numbers they called &quot;tumblers.&quot;
<br>
<p>A high fraction of the design effort had been put into &quot;log scaling&quot; where 
<br>
access slowed as the log of the absolute size of the data store.  The fan 
<br>
out in the (7? 8?) dimension tree was about one additional disk read for 
<br>
each factor of a hundred.  I.e., an 8k disk block contained about 100 
<br>
pointers, most reduced to &quot;stubs&quot; that pointed to other disk blocks.  The 
<br>
really active parts of the tree maintaining code were involved in packing 
<br>
and unpacking these disk blocks and cleaning up the mess this made of memory.
<br>
<p>This was a long time ago in computer terms, but the general problem of 
<br>
expensive, fast memory vs low cost slow memory is still with us.
<br>
<p>There are people who understand the Xanadu details much better than I 
<br>
do.  The problem is that they developed a large number of special terms 
<br>
that make discussion nearly impossible to follow.
