<p>I am reminded of Xanadu hypertext, a project I was around for more than a 
<br>
decade and involved with at the programming details level at the very end.
<br>
<p>In spite of involving some really smart guys (including Eric Drexler) for a 
<br>
number of years, they never did solve all the problems of building a 
<br>
perfect hypertext engine.  It is possible that the full set of problems as 
<br>
they stated them were impossible instead of just being very, very hard.
<br>
<p>But, as it turned out, it didn't matter.  The Internet and the World Wide 
<br>
Web came along.  With URL links and search engines they did most of what 
<br>
Xanadu was trying to do *without* solving the hard problems.
<br>
<p>Does this have application to the FAI problem?  Darned if I know.
