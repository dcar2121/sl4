<p>might be interesting, but he will go floating off into stuff like:
<br>
<p>&lt; But there is a new birth coming, a new form erupting into being.  And we, 
<br>
as the folks focused on the future, who broaden our minds in every 
<br>
conceivable way ­ by reading about the future and doing the work of 
<br>
creating new culture, with everything that entails, be it esoteric 
<br>
spiritual practices or taking psychedelics - we may be among the few who 
<br>
can take stock of the entirety of the transformation, because we have 
<br>
occasionally been thrust into spaces where what is to be permanently true 
<br>
for everyone else has become temporarily true for us.
<br>
<p>Because we have been there, we know we need not be afraid, or give in to 
<br>
amazement, and can avoid being hypnotized by speed or pretty blinking 
<br>
lights.  Talking to aliens?  Been there.  The end of history?  Been there, 
<br>
too.  Maybe all the bizarre trips that we’ve all had are just what we need, 
<br>
even as humanity enters its last, strange trip.
<br>
<p>Just a few months before he died, I went to visit Terence in Hawai’i.  I 
<br>
asked him to sign my copy of The Invisible Landscape, which he did.  He 
<br>
wrote: “Properly understood, this book is a map to the stone.  As above, so 
<br>
below.”
<br>
<p>The stone he referred to is the Philosopher’s Stone, which could raise base 
<br>
materials to their highest, transcendent state.  He knew that at best he’d 
<br>
constructed a metaphor, a way to conceive something inconceivable.  &gt;
<br>
<p>Yada yada, alas. IMHO.
