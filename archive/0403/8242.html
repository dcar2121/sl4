<p>
Based on some readings I've done recently I've come
<br>
acress a new context to understand the singulairty. 
<br>
<p>I think it can be stated without much argument that
<br>
the history of our universe has been a continuous
<br>
ingression of intelligence into matter.  From lesser
<br>
complexity to greater complexity.  If this is not
<br>
apparent, then I suggest reading either Stephen
<br>
Wolfram’s or Stuart Kaufmann’s work.
<br>
<p>Even though this acceleration of intelligence seems
<br>
continuous there is at least a few punctuated periods
<br>
of more rapid acceleration.  I think the singularity
<br>
represents a punctuated rupture with at least one
<br>
historical precedent - the birth of language, the jump
<br>
from genetic to epi-genetic information transfer.
<br>
<p>Until Modern Humans emerged on the scene, all
<br>
evolution was happening via DNA information transfer –
<br>
a very slow glacial process of evolution.  At some
<br>
point in Homo sapiens evolution we developed symbolic
<br>
manipulation ability.
<br>
<p>Here is some snippits about the Singularity (a bit
<br>
long but interesting) from Mark Pesce, inventor of
<br>
VRML.
<br>
<p>~~~
<br>
<p>The thing that separates us from the Neanderthal isn’t
<br>
brain size, or brute strength, but a symbolic
<br>
manipulation capability.
<br>
<p>In order to have symbols, you need to have a
<br>
consciousness capable of symbolic manipulation, that
<br>
is to say a linguistic consciousness. While
<br>
paleoanthropologists believe that the Neanderthal had
<br>
some very basic linguistic capabilities, it is
<br>
believed that these abilities were very limited –
<br>
perhaps similar in nature to those of a year-old
<br>
child, capable of identifying objects or actions, but
<br>
little more.
<br>
<p>What we see with homo sapiens is that this linguistic
<br>
ability overflowed into the entirety of consciousness.
<br>
The first benefit of this was the emergence of what we
<br>
understand as language: nearly every human being has
<br>
an innate capability to take a few symbols and
<br>
manipulate them infinitely.
<br>
<p>For example, although few of us ever use more than
<br>
about 2000 English words, we can describe just about
<br>
anything with those words, because we can
<br>
instantaneously recombine them in any sensible order
<br>
to create new forms of expression.
<br>
<p>For 4 billion years, DNA was the recording mechanism
<br>
of history, the memory of biology. As soon as we
<br>
developed language, we no longer needed the slower
<br>
form of DNA for memory; we could use the much faster
<br>
form of language, which produced with it a deep sense
<br>
of memory within the individual – since the linguistic
<br>
symbols could be contained within the human mind.
<br>
<p>Since we became a symbol-manipulating species, our
<br>
forward evolution, in DNA terms, has come to a dead
<br>
stop. (This has recently been proposed by reputable
<br>
scientists.) However, our linguistic capabilities
<br>
allow us to perform acts of memory much faster than
<br>
DNA, probably at least 10 million times faster!
<br>
So, suddenly, homo sapiens is not just a biological
<br>
entity working within the matrix of DNA and its slow
<br>
historical recording, but now bursts through and
<br>
starts processing its interactions within the
<br>
environment 10 million times faster than ever before.
<br>
<p>For all of evolutionary time, information had to
<br>
travel the slow route through biology – through the
<br>
bios - before it would be coded into our DNA. Now we
<br>
had this additional process – which we call the logos,
<br>
the Word – which was a completely new thing, and not
<br>
something that the bios had any time prepare for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From its first recognizable moment, humanity
</em><br>
demonstrates an entirely new relationship between bios
<br>
and logos. Information, freed from its need to be
<br>
embedded in the slow, dense vehicle of our DNA, speeds
<br>
up 10-million-fold.
<br>
<p>However – and this is the second most important point
<br>
I want to make today – the logos has its own
<br>
teleology, its own entelechy, its own drive to some
<br>
final dwell-state.
<br>
<p>We assume that we are masters of language, of word and
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>I disagree.
<br>
<p>The situation is exactly reversed. We are not in
<br>
control of words, they control us.
<br>
<p>Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins got it entirely
<br>
right when he invented the concept of “memes,” which
<br>
can be thought of as the linguistic equivalent of
<br>
genes. Rather than being part of the bios, memes are
<br>
the carriers of the logos.
<br>
<p>OK, so we’ve covered the emergence of the bios, some 4
<br>
billion years ago, and the emergence of the logos,
<br>
perhaps as much as 150 thousand years ago. 
<br>
We, as a species, have been driven by memes for the
<br>
last hundred thousand years, and this has forced us
<br>
further and further away from any direct connection
<br>
with the natural world.
<br>
<p>We’re being hollowed-out by our memes. That is to say
<br>
that our interiority, which is an artifact of the
<br>
slow, quiet progression of the bios, is rapidly
<br>
vanishing.
<br>
<p>The modern conception of interiority is really a
<br>
creation of the Enlightenment in Western Europe, and
<br>
was only noted by philosophers as it was beginning to
<br>
vanish utterly.
<br>
<p>So here’s the central point of what I wanted say: the
<br>
singularity is absolutely inevitable, and absolutely
<br>
meaningless. The closest analogy we could make would
<br>
be the whine of feedback you get when you place a
<br>
microphone too close to an amplifier. The screech
<br>
drowns everything else out, just as what we are – as
<br>
individuals and culture – are being replaced by a
<br>
rising form of activity dedicated to a single goal:
<br>
making a clear path for the transmission of the logos.
<br>
We’re improving the fidelity of meme swapping until it
<br>
asymptotically approaches its theoretical limits.
<br>
<p>The transmission of facts and ideas is already
<br>
becoming instantaneous, and the speed of the
<br>
development of novelty followed. When ideas move
<br>
faster, there’s a greater capacity for them to
<br>
interact, to produce concrescence.
<br>
<p>The history of the 20th century could accurately be
<br>
described as a series of advancements in
<br>
communication, beginning with radio and ending with
<br>
the Internet, each technology successively colonizing
<br>
the world, and each more rapidly than the technology
<br>
before.
<br>
<p>Technological artifacts are concretized language; that
<br>
is, any technology is a bit of language that has been
<br>
turned into a physical object.
<br>
<p>The first technology that was turned into a physical
<br>
object was the linguistic technology itself. Writing
<br>
is the first real technology of importance, because it
<br>
freed linguistics from their oral substrate, and made
<br>
the carrier medium much more durable. We have an idea
<br>
of history from 3500 BCE forward because of the
<br>
invention of writing, which has created a continuity
<br>
in humanity.
<br>
<p>All other technologies, are, each in their way, the
<br>
descendants of writing. Writing was the
<br>
exteriorization of our drive to communicate.
<br>
We’ve seen the linguistic acceleration of DNA as
<br>
codes, and the linguistic acceleration of
<br>
communication as telecommunication, but we’re only now
<br>
on the threshold of the acceleration of technology. 
<br>
<p>Things may look as though they’re going fast now, but
<br>
this is nothing – literally, absolutely nothing – next
<br>
to what’s about to happen, because (and now we have
<br>
precedent for it) we’re about to see a technological
<br>
acceleration on a similar order to the acceleration we
<br>
saw when the logos separated from the bios. In this
<br>
case, techne, our ability, is about to be freed from
<br>
logos, our ability to describe it.
<br>
What do I mean when I say this?
<br>
<p>There’s an emerging science, known as nanotechnology,
<br>
which will, before the next few years have passed by,
<br>
give us a very fine-grained control over the material
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>With nanotechnology we should be able to precisely
<br>
design molecules to order, for whatever purpose we
<br>
might desire.
<br>
<p>This is the coming linguistic revolution in
<br>
technology, because, at this point, the entire fabric
<br>
of the material world becomes linguistically pliable.
<br>
Anything you see, anywhere, animate, or inanimate,
<br>
will have within it the capacity to be entirely
<br>
transformed by a rearrangement of its atoms into
<br>
another form, a form which obeys the dictates of
<br>
linguistic intent.
<br>
<p>It’s very hard for us to conceptualize such a world,
<br>
and I have continuously been forced to draw on the
<br>
metaphors of world of magic for any near analogies.
<br>
It will be as if we have acquired the ability to cast
<br>
spells upon the material world to achieve particular
<br>
effects.
<br>
<p>This isn’t to say that we’re about to acquire the
<br>
omnipotence we normally ascribe to God, but that our
<br>
abilities will be so far beyond anything we’re
<br>
familiar with today that we have no language to
<br>
conceptualize them. No language at all.
<br>
<p>And that search for a language to describe the world
<br>
we’re entering is, I think, the grand project of the
<br>
present civilization. We know that something new is
<br>
approaching.
<br>
<p>So we have three waves, biological, linguistic, and
<br>
technological, which are rapidly moving to
<br>
concrescence, and on their way, as they interact,
<br>
produce such a tsunami of novelty as has never before
<br>
been experienced in the history of this planet.
