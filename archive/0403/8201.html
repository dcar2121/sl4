<p>&quot;I am now able to perceive magnetic fields in ways not naturally
<br>
possible. The sensation is different than holding a magnet, as the
<br>
neurons are stimulated with a higher resolution. With the implant I can
<br>
detect subtle changes in polarity and strength that I cannot when
<br>
equipped with a magnet in the conventional manner. Yet the most
<br>
significant observations have come from another property of implants,
<br>
their relative permanence to exogenous artifacts. Being able to perceive
<br>
magnetic fields has expanded my conscious perception of magnetic fields
<br>
‘in the wild’.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many 'transhumanists' have long been in favor of artifically enhanced
<br>
senses. What do you think of this example? Crude, but interesting. I also
<br>
wonder exactly how it works. He says he can perceive polarity and detect
<br>
subtle differences in the fields, but I'm not sure how his neurons can
<br>
interpret the information from magnet and transform that into sensations
<br>
his brain experiences.
