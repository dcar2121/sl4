<p>
Has anyone been tracking the implications of the recently introduced 
<br>
(US) Constitution Restoration Bill of 2004?   
<br>
<p>I gather a Bill has been introduced into both houses for The 
<br>
Constitution Restoration Act of 2004 (House version: H.R. 3799; 
<br>
Senate version: S. 2082).  If passed, the Act would bar the U.S. 
<br>
Supreme Court and federal courts from hearing cases challenging 
<br>
“expressions of religious faith by elected or appointed officials”.  The 
<br>
surface issue looks pretty trivial eg. preventing Supreme Court 
<br>
reviewing decisions by government officials to display the ten 
<br>
commandments and other religious references. However these may not 
<br>
be the only expressions of religious faith by elected or appointed 
<br>
government officials as the Bill expressly includes a reference to God 
<br>
being the *sovereign source of law* by an official in his capacity of 
<br>
executing his office - rather than the sovereign source of the law being 
<br>
the people of the United States. Perhaps government officials could 
<br>
make other much more important executive decisions claiming imunity 
<br>
from court review on the grounds that they were expressions of 
<br>
religious faith based on the law of God.

<br>
<p>The third report suggests that the the religious Right is the source of the 
<br>
Constitution Restoration Bill of 2004 and that the Bill is meant to have 
<br>
much more than cosmetic efect.
<br>
<p>I'm too unfamiliar with the US body politic to be able to evaluate this 
<br>
issue adequately but it could perhaps have a direct bearing on activities 
<br>
in the US that the religious Right feel challenge the supremacy of God 
<br>
in US society.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
