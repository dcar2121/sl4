<p>Thank you Yan for making this point.  A lot of the discussion we see on 
<br>
ethics is laying the groundwork for an understanding that there are no 
<br>
set answers to specific moral questions.  The best choice in any given 
<br>
situation *always* depends on apprehended context.
<br>
<p>Happily, it appears that no matter what your starting point, as 
<br>
awareness increases, separate contexts tend to converge.  This is 
<br>
directly related to the non-zero sumness of the cooperation game we are 
<br>
all a part of.
<br>
<p>As society moves toward an understanding of the fruitlessness of seeking 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;specific moral answers in an ever-broadening context, then we can make 
<br>
progress toward understanding and applying a science of how 
<br>
organizations at various scales can co-evolve most effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From an abstract perspective, I think the central question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is between evolutionary theory and the doctrine that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings are equal. Evolution implies that 'unfit'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals are displaced by fitter ones, sometimes whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species may go extinct. On the other hand much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonsense view of morality is based on equality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reciprocity. The idea that all humans are equal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problematic because it cannot be extended to other life-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -forms such as primates. So one of the first ('politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect') things we must admit is that inequality exists.
</em><br>
<p>Inequality is axiomatic and essential to growth.  Reciprocity is key to 
<br>
effective long term interactions.  What is not generally well understood 
<br>
is the importance of Other in the growth of Self.  We still have people 
<br>
and organizations in some positions of power who think the key to long 
<br>
term success involves demolishes their opponents.  The Japanese word 
<br>
aite means both opponent and partner and there's a lot of wisdom in that.
