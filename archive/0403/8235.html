Hi,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I agree that it's important to think about the period leading up to the
<br>
Singularity, as well as the Singularity itself.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As for what impact the things we do prior to the Singularity will have
<br>
on post-Singluarity reality, we really can't know that, but ideas like
<br>
Friendly AI are based on the idea that &quot;Well, if we ARE going to have an
<br>
impact, which is at least plausible, then let's be sure it's a good
<br>
one.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As for the list of questions you cite, it's not clear to me which of
<br>
these issues will face a superhuman AI post-Singularity.  As an example,
<br>
you pose the question &quot;What to keep from the present/past and what not
<br>
to keep?&quot; but of course it's possible that there will be an effectively
<br>
infinite abundance of resources so that this question won't even be
<br>
worth asking anymore...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What makes me think you don't &quot;get&quot; the Singularity fully is partly that
<br>
you keep using analogies from human history.  This is not much like
<br>
anything else in human history.  The Bolsheviks are not a good analogy
<br>
-- nothing in human history is a good analogy.  Because human history is
<br>
about HUMANS and the Singularity is largely not about humans (though
<br>
humans are an important part of it of course)
<br>

Subject: Shock level 3 or 4 thinking?
<br>
<p><p>Hi Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BG: Basically, what this reply says to me is that you don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be a Singularity in the same sense that many of us do.
</em><br>
Your
<br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is more in the spirit of the more mild-mannered of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil's statements.  In my view, the Singularity will be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomparably larger change than any of these previous changes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're describing. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; BG: You don't seem to accept the possibility of truly fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in the nature of reality and/or mind. ........ your vision of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future seems SL3 not SL4 
</em><br>
<p>I went back to Eliezer's reference that you quoted and read some of the
<br>
links from that document to get a better feel for whether I'm thinking
<br>
more in the SL3 or the SL4 mode.
<br>
(<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/sing/shocklevels.html">http://yudkowsky.net/sing/shocklevels.html</a>).
<br>
<p>I agree with you that, post-singularity, we cannot know what things will
<br>
be like in terms of the nature of reality and/or mind.  So in that sense
<br>
I think it's fair to say that, at least, intellectually I can glimpse
<br>
the SL4 discontiuity. But it's hard to come to terms with it (a) because
<br>
it's fundamentally unknowable and yet (b) what can be imagined vaguely
<br>
could shake up the status quo in every direction so strongly. 
<br>
<p><p>Maybe what I've been trying to say can be better understood as being
<br>
relevant to the *lead up* to the singularity proper.  I think the lead
<br>
up will not be 'just' the time between pre- and post-singularity but
<br>
will be a significant time in its own right (perhaps with the power to
<br>
send significant reverberations into what follows the singularity).
<br>
<p>Whether or not there is ever more than one AGI I think the introduction
<br>
of one or more AGIs into the universe will add massively to the
<br>
complexity of the universe (or the parts of the universe where AGI/AGIs
<br>
have not been before).  AGIs will be capable of faster and faster
<br>
thought for any given level of complexity of thinking.  But it may well
<br>
be that AGIs choose sometimes or often to expand the complexity of their
<br>
thought rather than simply shrinking the absolute amount of time taken
<br>
to reach conclusions.  So it's not a foregone conclusion that subjective
<br>
time will shrink for all issues, and at all times, in the dramatic way
<br>
that some people have speculated.  AGIs when first emerging with have a
<br>
prodigeous amount to learn and assimilate.  And developing new deep
<br>
knowledge and insights will, I imagine, continue to be, at times, a non-
<br>
trivial task.  Maybe a measure of wisdom of new self-improving AGIs will
<br>
be the extent to which they take advantage of the acceleration of
<br>
subjective time to enable better-thought-out actions in absolute time.
<br>
<p>I still feel that a super AGI or populations of AGIs will still be faced
<br>
with key questions like:
<br>
- what to learn and what not to learn?
<br>
- what to invent and what not to?
<br>
- what to change and what not to change?
<br>
- when to change things and when not to?
<br>
- what to build on and what to abandon?
<br>
- what to keep from the present/past and what not to keep?
<br>
<p>Ben, do you think these questions will become obsolete?  Surely
<br>
evolution is unlikely to become obsolete and if that is the case
<br>
wouldn't these questions remain relevant?
<br>
<p>I can't see that raising issues like these is a sign of a failure to
<br>
move from shock level 3 to shock level 4 thinking/mind sets??
<br>
<p>The model of the approach to the singularity where we have life more or
<br>
less as we have known it and then in a flash we have the post
<br>
singularity world seems to me to be almost designed to wish away the
<br>
hard thinking about how to move up to or make the transition to the
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>It reminds me of the early Bolsheviks who refused to speculate on the
<br>
future post-revolution because the world would be remade.  And look
<br>
where that got us!  :)
<br>
<p>If we can assume that evolution is not abolished as a meta-process by
<br>
the singularity then we can assume that history still counts as a shaper
<br>
of the future.  If that's true then the lead up to the singularity is
<br>
very important - so I think we need to expand our thinking about this
<br>
phase. And as workable AGIs develop (not super AGIs initially) they can
<br>
be recruited to work on the issue of understanding options for the
<br>
lead-up to the singularity.  This joint working process automatically
<br>
then makes the lead up to the singularity even more complex and
<br>
interesting.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
