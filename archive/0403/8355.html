<br>
<p>For a detailed consideration of the argument that we are living in a

simulation, see Nick Bostrom's page with essays by various contributors at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose the SI never finds any evidence that it is living in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less-than-perfect simulation. It still cannot rule out the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is living in a perfect simulation. Whether or not it continues to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the a priori probability that it assigns to the possibility of being in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. But where does this prior come from? I'm curious if anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else has thought about this problem.
</em><br>
<p>The simulation argument is actually just a contemporary version of
<br>
Descartes', in which he considered the possibility that all the evidence of
<br>
his senses had been implanted by a &quot;demon.&quot; He realized that there was no
<br>
way he could disprove that such a situation was actually the case, beyond
<br>
simply assuming that the all-powerful God would not allow it. (Descartes was
<br>
extremely careful not to write anything so skeptical that the Church would
<br>
do to him what it had done to Galileo.) In the final analysis, Descartes
<br>
concluded that the only claim he could not doubt was that he himself was
<br>
thinking all these thoughts, hence he existed: &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; [&quot;I think,
<br>
therefore I am&quot;].
<br>
<p>Modern science fiction is, of course, fully loaded with stories about living
<br>
in simulations. In some of these tales, one or more persons (characters?)
<br>
escapes into reality. In others, the ones responsible for creating the
<br>
simulation ensure that none of their creature can escape, even if those poor
<br>
entities strongly suspect the truth of their condition.
<br>
<p>If we are living in simulation, we probably cannot leave it for reality --
<br>
or, more precisely, leave it for a lower level of implementation within a
<br>
hierarchy with an unknown number of such levels. If ultimate reality is the
<br>
lowest level of implementation, we may or may not ever discover what that it
<br>
is and then somehow reach it.
<br>
<p>But as for me, I live and work on the assumption that I am already living in
<br>
reality, but that my perception and conception of what reality is altogether
<br>
has yet to be fully developed.
<br>
