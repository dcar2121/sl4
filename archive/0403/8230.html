Philip,

<br>
&nbsp;I personally think that the singularity would have the greatest chance
<br>
for a smooth ride if, on this side of the transition, we set out to make
<br>
sure (as far as one can given the uncertainties of life) that the
<br>
benefits of the change are directed substantially and sufficiently to
<br>
making sure that the world is a better place for all people.  And to get
<br>
things moving in that direction we have to start out with an attitude of
<br>
understanding and sympathy for the vast majority of people.  And while
<br>
acts of terrorism and brutality are not excusable at all, I think it is
<br>
important that we understand how society throws up such people and
<br>
behaviours.   
<br>
***
<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, the average Muslim fundamentalist does not want our
<br>
technology to make their lives better in any way.  They want to be left
<br>
alone at a minimum; and would be happier if we did not exist.
<br>
Personally, I find it hard to empathize with people who want me dead
<br>
when I have done them no wrong of any kind.  I can &quot;understand&quot; them
<br>
intellectually to an extent, of course, but that's different.  I don't
<br>
want *them* dead, but I do want to be in a position where they have less
<br>
power to kill me than they do right now.  I'm sure I feel this issue
<br>
more acutely than you due to being located in Washington DC, a prime
<br>
terrorist attack target.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Note that I am not a Bush-ite -- just because I take the terrorism
<br>
problem very seriously, doesn't mean I agree with most of the steps he's
<br>
proposed as remedies...
<br>

<em> &gt; there will be no BUSINESS AS USUAL in an environment of such rapid 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; change -- the concept of &quot;as usual&quot; doesn't apply!!   
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;But this has been the case in bursts ever since the move from hunter
<br>
gathering to agricutlure-supported urbanism - and it's certainly been
<br>
the case since the industrial revolution.  These days 'business as
<br>
usual' never stays the same for long because 'business as usual'
<br>
includes technological and social invention and innovation as an
<br>
endogenous element.    
<br>
***
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Basically, what this reply says to me is that you don't believe there
<br>
will be a Singularity in the same sense that many of us do.  Your
<br>
Singularity is more in the spirit of the more mild-mannered of
<br>
Kurzweil's statements.  In my view, the Singularity will be an
<br>
incomparably larger change than any of these previous changes that
<br>
you're describing.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;***
<br>
<em> &gt; The fact that there will be *some* system, doesn't mean that it will
</em><br>
b e
<br>
<em> &gt; the same one....  
</em><br>
&nbsp;This point you are making IS the point I'm trying to make too.  While
<br>
the 'system' might be different there is bound to be a 'system' of some
<br>
sort.  So if a techno-libertarian seeks the singularity as a espace from
<br>
the (any) 'system' they are likely to be sorely disappointed by the
<br>
final result.   
<br>

Well, if they upload and improve their mind, they will likely grow to a
<br>
point beyond all human emotions including &quot;disappointment&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*** 
<br>
The funny thing about a lot of this discussion is that many people are
<br>
attracted to technology because its a domain of fun and power where you
<br>
can get away with not engaging with people (read that as advanced
<br>
general intelligences).   
<br>
***
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm not sure this cliche' holds true very often anymore.  Personally,
<br>
most of what I do all day is engage with people --- the Novamente team,
<br>
customers for our businesses, my wife &amp; kids, etc.  I don't love tech
<br>
because I need to escape from people.  Perhaps some people do, but there
<br>
are lots of asocial non-techies as well....  Perhaps this cliche' of
<br>
techies is no longer applicable?
<br>
