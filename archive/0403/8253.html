<p><em>&gt;&gt;The thing that separates us from the Neanderthal

isn’t

<em>&gt;&gt;manipulation capability.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This may be true, but I don't think you can prove it
</em><br>
<p>I think the evidence is on our side.  We are the only
<br>
species who has left behind any significant artifacts
<br>
of any kind.  Whether they be cave paintings, or
<br>
sophisticated tools.  All of which we developed before
<br>
writing.  I think the evidence is pretty strong that
<br>
the Neanderthals did not have general purpose symbolic
<br>
manipulation ability.  There is no evidence that they
<br>
did, but the evidence for Homo Sapiens is abundant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Even chimps have a certain degree of culture that
</em><br>
varies from place to place.  It is hard to say just
<br>
exactly when people became critically 
<br>
dependant on culture.  It could have been carrying
<br>
unworked stones to drive off major predators.  If you
<br>
decide worked stone to be the boundary, then we are
<br>
talking about 2.6 million years ago.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>I think you missed his point.  He is talking about a
<br>
first level of abstraction (i.e. logos) - a symbol, a
<br>
grunt, a word, or picture, *representing* something. 
<br>
Basic survival knowledge is not abstraction, it is
<br>
visceral experience that happens with every species,
<br>
even the amoeba on some level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;We, as a species, have been driven by memes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;last hundred thousand years, and this has forced us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;further and further away from any direct connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with the natural world.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Until we can live on electric power, this is a bit
</em><br>
overstated.
<br>
<p>How is it overstated?  Right now, sitting at your
<br>
computer in your house or apartment, your are
<br>
surrounded by artificiality, lights, tools, batteries,
<br>
kitchen knives, oven, roof, walls, windows, glass,
<br>
cars, telephone polls, the spoken word, TV,
<br>
newspapers, soda pop, running water, pipes, etc, etc. 
<br>
We are practically drowning in logos!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;So we have three waves, biological, linguistic, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technological, which are rapidly moving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;concrescence, and on their way, as they interact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;produce such a tsunami of novelty as has never
</em><br>
before
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;been experienced in the history of this planet.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The real question is &quot;does anything interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survive&quot;?  (Where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entities able to tame wild galaxies &gt;are
</em><br>
&quot;interesting.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Yes, that would be a very desirable outcome! :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;*If* technophilic life is common then the answer is
</em><br>
*no.*  Our chances are really rotten if the last 10 or
<br>
100 million species to reach this state were eaten by
<br>
gray goo or unfriendly AIs.  If species that reach our
<br>
stage are so rare that there are none in our light
<br>
cone, then the future is unknown.  Scary perhaps, but
<br>
not a death sentence.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Of course, but as you pointed out, “as far as we know,
<br>
this process has [only] been centered on a certain
<br>
small planet.”
