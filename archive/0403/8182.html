<p>I can't parse this.  It seems likely that you have something here that is 
<br>
worth understanding.  Can you try again from a bit lower level?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the brain storage mechanism is far more efficient in an

</em><br>
<p>I hope you are right, because I don't like the conclusions of Thomas 
<br>
Landauer's research.  But I really don't see how to refute him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm actually working on a short paper on this (for the website), because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've done a lot of really interesting tangential work on data compression 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;related to the AGI work I do.  In short, it is possible to do lossless,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithmic structure that looks very similar to neural structures.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't got the slightest idea of how you map a mathematical structure 
<br>
into a physical one or compare them.  Perhaps you could expand on this and 
<br>
give an example?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is even more interesting, and what I actually am working on writing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up, is that if you modulate the encoding process on the front-end with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple &quot;transition detection&quot; signaling mechanism (e.g. edge detection), I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can get effective compression ratios that on average exceed the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compression algorithms out there.
</em><br>
<p>That's an awesome claim.  It is of considerable interest to me in a 
<br>
business sense because of the badge camera.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps ironically, it isn't terribly useful for many generic data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compression applications because most hardware storage mediums are purely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sequential access beasts, and sequential or semi-sequential compression 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithms are much better suited for such things.
</em><br>
<p>I really don't understand this.  Any n-dimentional data set can be turned 
<br>
into a linear string.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But generally, I think that our noggins encode far more information than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;casual analysis of bits suggests.
</em><br>
<p>You should read the original paper, it was anything but casual being a meta 
<br>
analysis of a bunch of previous studies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The &quot;bits&quot; should be bits in more of a Kolmogorov complexity sense than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the naive sequential storage format sense, and there is a very large chasm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the two in effective capacity.  Filtering out low-value bits (i.e. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making it lossy) greatly extends to the useful storage range even further.
</em><br>
<p>If you are talking about remembering a phone number, it is clear that lossy 
<br>
is not useful.
