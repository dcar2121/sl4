Metaqualia -
<br>
<p>I'm going to try to approach this from what I see as your point of view:
<br>
<p>Qualia, the direct experience of consciousness, is the most real (and 
<br>
best) measure of the choices we make.  Good choices are those that 
<br>
produce more enjoyable qualia, for more sentient beings, for longer 
<br>
durations.
<br>
<p>We can evaluate qualia by simulating or imagining what they would be for 
<br>
us (empathy), and thereby make useful judgments about the the goodness 
<br>
(morality) of the choices that led to these qualia.
<br>
<p>Am I doing okay so far?
<br>
<p>Now, how would one achieve this goal of maximizing qualia?
<br>
<p>I'm assuming you would quickly rule out the straw man of simply creating 
<br>
as many sentient beings as possible, and using drugs or neurostimulation 
<br>
to induce maximum euphoria for as long as they could survive on 
<br>
artificial life support.
<br>
<p>The immediate difficulty with this (as you have probably considered) is 
<br>
that resources must be committed to developing ways to increase the 
<br>
population, increase the intensity of the enjoyable qualia, and increase 
<br>
longevity -- all with the goal of maximizing ooverall long term 
<br>
enjoyable qualia.
<br>
<p>Additional resources dedicated to research and development, maintenance, 
<br>
energy and life-support requirements, defense from outside threats, 
<br>
etc., will detract from immediately maximizing enjoyable qualia, but 
<br>
will tend to *increase* the future intensity and sustainability of 
<br>
enjoyable qualia. The correct balance of resources here will maximize 
<br>
the area under the enjoyable qualia curve.
<br>
<p>Are we in agreement so far?  If not, it may be that we should go back to 
<br>
the previous paragraph and consider the economic reality that there 
<br>
ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
<br>
<p>Assuming that we are in agreement so far, then you may notice that the 
<br>
more fundamental process underlying maximizing qualia is Growth.
<br>
