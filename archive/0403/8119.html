<p>
To conclude that the jobs that are disappearing are those of people who
<br>
don't need them, wouldn't you also have to take into consideration other
<br>
data, such as how many people are receiving unemployment, welfare, and
<br>
foodstamps?  If those numbers have increased as the population has
<br>
increased, that might give you a different conclusion.  Of course, that
<br>
data is skewed, since public assistance benefits are given out for a
<br>
limited time, after which the recipients are simply cut off.  So then,
<br>
you'd want to look at the numbers of people staying in shelters for the
<br>
homeless, except many of the shelters are filled to capacity and you'd
<br>
miss the numbers of people who sleep on the street.
<br>
<p>Then there's the number of UNDERemployed people, who have a college
<br>
degree or other qualifications, yet get to say &quot;Would you like fries
<br>
with that?&quot; on a routine basis.  Yet these people aren't counted as
<br>
unemployed.
<br>
<p>I could go on, but I think you'd have to agree that more data is
<br>
required to come to any serious conclusion, particularly the conclusion
<br>
that the people who don't have a job simply don't need it.
<br>
<p>And what does any of this have to do with SL4 anyway?

<em>&gt; It _may_ be, that this data shows us, that jobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappearing mostly on the rich side of the population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which doesn't need them anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the data isn't fake, that's the only logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion, I can see.
