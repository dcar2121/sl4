<p>I hope this is a poor joke or sarcasm.  The majority of those effected 
<br>
are middle class at best, not rich.  Much of the middle class is a few 
<br>
paychecks away from bankruptcy.   I have friends in the millions of 
<br>
techies, to single out one group, out of work.  Good bright hard 
<br>
working people all.  Not one of them &quot;doesn't need a job.&quot;
<br>
<p>I find it rather cruel and heartless to assume the data does not need 
<br>
to be considered or at least not without lots of study one personally 
<br>
may not have time for,  or that if it is taken seriously it is ok 
<br>
because it is not really hurting anyone probably.    Personally I find 
<br>
losing  a large part of the tech workforce in the US a disaster that we 
<br>
will not see the end of in this decade.    How many promising ventures 
<br>
folded or never started?  How many would be innovators are now 
<br>
wondering how to keep a roof over their heads?   How many companies are 
<br>
in rock bottom survival mode?    How many left technology or stopped 
<br>
investing in it?
<br>
<p>And these are only one set of people effected.
<br>
<p>How would it be possible that we would not expect massive economic 
<br>
dislocation and millions of people left in the lurch as the pace of 
<br>
change accelerates and overtakes the relatively slow change of cultural 
<br>
values and practices?    How could such not occur for sometime before 
<br>
any sort of hard take off?  I can scarcely imagine a scenario where 
<br>
these sorts of effects would not be the case.   If so, then perhaps we 
<br>
should simply assume this is a likely outcome and prepare as best we 
<br>
can.  While we are at it we might consider a bit of compassion.
