Not a terrible idea, but I'm not having a problem with
<br>
that. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it is morally IRRESPONSIBLE

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already. Even as I type, people are getting killed

</em><br>

</em><br>
There are those who do analyze conflicts
<br>
scientifically (a good author to look up is James
<br>
Dunnigan)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the strong is entitled to rob the weak of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possesions/territory, then why does this NOT happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *within* civil society?
</em><br>
It DOES, within whatever limits are imposed within a
<br>
given society. Some are so overtly corrupt that, for
<br>
example, a Palestinian who complains to a PA official
<br>
of low-level shakedowns is apt to get shaken down by
<br>
that official too. Other societies are better
<br>
governed, but theft by the strong from the weak is
<br>
still in evidence (example: President Bush, some years
<br>
ago, used poltical connections to secure eminent
<br>
domain over farm property from unwilling sellers to
<br>
build a new ballpark for his Texas Rangers baseball
<br>
team). Notice that more covert corruption requires
<br>
more legal camouflage. (I can offer many, many more
<br>
examples. If you buy a new car, the salesman will do
<br>
everything he can to get you to pay too much. But the
<br>
real octopus is the guy who owns the lot. The sales
<br>
staff live in fear of getting fired, and the lot owner
<br>
may pocket the sales person's commission, saying &quot;If
<br>
you don't like it, there's the door.&quot; This really
<br>
happens).
<br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, local patterns of morality do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to hold in the evolutionary picture where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit other animals and there doesn't seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retributions (negative effects) from it.
</em><br>
There are tradeoffs. Example: crossover from
<br>
domesticated animals is the major source of new
<br>
infectious diseases.
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't know the answer. What is the pattern that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerging in this? I think analyzing this is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important than speculating on the distant future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you may be quite sure you'll be among the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'survivors'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YKY
</em><br>
Einstein said the atom bomb changed everything, except
<br>
how we think. Saddam, Hitler and their like are best
<br>
seen as a continuation of past conquerors. The
<br>
Mongols, for example, killed everyone in one kingdom
<br>
(Khwarezm, I think): men, women, children, dogs and
<br>
cats. Lopez of Paraguay, in the 1860's, got 2/3 of his
<br>
country killed in the War of the Triple Alliance
<br>
(himself included). Seems humans can't stop fighting,
<br>
and since we just keep getting stronger weapons, we
<br>
are absolutely our most dangerous enemy. In 1983 we
<br>
almost had a nuclear war with the Soviets, who were
<br>
panicked by a big military exercise called Able Archer
<br>
(they thought we might be up to something real!)
<br>
Since those in the know expect a Singularity within 40
<br>
years or so, it's hardly a distant future; and since
<br>
unenhanced humans apparently cannot solve their
<br>
disputes without bloodshed, superhuman intelligence
<br>
looks more and more like the only way there might be
<br>
any survivors at all.
