At 05:13 PM 3/25/2004 -0800, Paul Hughes asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When is the earliest possible time in our universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a technological singularity could have occurred?
</em><br>
<p>and concluded:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This leaves us with a theoretical minimum of 8.2 ­
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10.7 billion years ago when the first technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singularity could have occurred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Comments, feedback, flaws?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I provided an alternative, very much earlier, date in THE SPIKE 
<br>
(which Seth Lloyd felt was more or less in line with his own analysis). 
<br>
Here's a novelized version, from THE HUNGER OF TIME by me and Rory Barnes 
<br>
(adv.):
<br>
<p>=================
<br>
<p><p>`I suppose when you girls were kids, Hugh must have told you how the world 
<br>
was born?'
<br>
<p>`A spinning cloud of gas around the Sun, right?' In fact it had been Grace 
<br>
who first told us that enchanting story.
<br>
<p>`Farther back, Natalie. The cosmos entire, space and time and energy 
<br>
positive and negative. Flung into existence out of non-being, with the 
<br>
first instant of time, in the Big Bang.'
<br>
<p>`Oh yeah, that. Well, of course. Everyone knows about the­-'
<br>
<p>`Gaia, the gods, we singularity gods, were not born until long after 
<br>
mindless chemical life struggled forth upon the planets and comets,' the 
<br>
Talbot neem thing said, and I was reminded yet again of its true nature. 
<br>
`But our true first parents, the Titans, were hewn by evolution from Chaos 
<br>
in the earliest eternities of the very first microsecond of the Big Bang.'
<br>
<p>What? What? Had he meant all that stuff literally, after all?
<br>
<p>`Can you understand this mystery?'
<br>
<p>`No.' I squeezed my hands together tightly.
<br>
<p>`It is not so hard to follow. So great were the energies, so tightly packed 
<br>
the nearly closed new-born universe, so very swift the foldings and 
<br>
unfoldings, that billions of years of virtual time were compressed within 
<br>
its first flaring instant.'
<br>
<p>All of this abruptly flamed about me in lurid imagery, a fireworks display 
<br>
out of Dante. Were they imposing this understanding directly upon my mind, 
<br>
like the language machine of the True Knowledge people, or awakening lost 
<br>
memories from childhood? The cosmos peeled open to my inward vision. 
<br>
Ignition, followed by complication as the first pure unity of all forces 
<br>
cracked apart in the cooling, outward rushing cosmos. Gravity splitting 
<br>
away from the strong nuclear force, the weak force, electromagnetism, 
<br>
refrigerating and shredding reality. Entangled membrane sheets, lonely 
<br>
particles swallowed up and spat out as the earliest blazing heat cooled 
<br>
toward darkness. Yes, it came back to me, I'd seen it on a dozen Discovery 
<br>
programs. I'd heard the story told to Suzanna and me a score of times by 
<br>
Hugh when other children our age were being taught the pretty fantasies of 
<br>
Genesis. It had never seized me by the scruff of the neck as it did now; 
<br>
yes, now it shook me with its grandeur. But after all, Hugh and Grace had 
<br>
not known the real story, if this was indeed a tale to be trusted. Gods, 
<br>
evolved from heat and noise in the first trillion virtual years that had 
<br>
been squeezed into that first minute or second or tiny fraction of a second 
<br>
of the new-born universe.
<br>
<p>I stood up, shaking. `What happened to them?'
<br>
<p>`In the great cooling that followed, when light collapsed into matter, the 
<br>
first great minds became trapped in the fractal ridges of this paralyzed 
<br>
new order. Deathless they were but immobilized, stretched across 
<br>
accelerating billion light-year skies. Those shrieking Titans, Natalie, 
<br>
those Bright Angels, those gods before the gods­they're there still. We 
<br>
can't see them yet, but we know they are there.'
<br>
<p>I cringed, and my skin felt very cold.
<br>
<p>`They suffer and have no voice to scream. The Angels fell from the great 
<br>
glowing heat of their birth into a terror of frozen spacetime, and as they 
<br>
placed their last locked impress upon it, forged our geometries and our 
<br>
deepest yearnings. It is the echo of their last silent howl we hear ringing 
<br>
through the voids of stars and galaxies and all the greater darknesses 
<br>
between.'
<br>
<p>I pressed my hands to my ears, unable to bear the dread he spoke, unable to 
<br>
turn it to a joke, unable to resist this appalling epiphany of pain.
<br>
<p>`They're... still there? After all these eons, still suffering?'
<br>
<p>`It is their agony, above all, that creation groaneth under,' the Talbot 
<br>
neem said. He stood now on the far side of the room, surrounded by a halo 
<br>
of stars within stars. `Our first and final duty is to find them, to 
<br>
recover them from confinement, to end their suffering at last.'
<br>
<p>I did laugh, then, a painful lacerating bark. `Oh, good, so that's what 
<br>
humanity's goal has always been. All the Rabbis and Popes and Mullahs had 
<br>
it exactly wrong.' I laughed again, and it hurt my throat. `Fuck. 
<br>
Wonderful. We were never meant to seek redemption in God.' In my mind, I 
<br>
saw a huge, parodic, red-lettered GOING WRONG WAY sign catching the rushed 
<br>
headlights above the highway to eternity. `Oh no, it's up to us, poor 
<br>
damned dupes, to redeem the gods.'
<br>

<br>
<p>Anyone interested in the novel, maybe ordering it for their local library, 
<br>
can get the print on demand trade paperback (woth its Anders Sandberg 
<br>
cover) from
