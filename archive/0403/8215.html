Nuts to this Bcc nonsense -- mail them individually.  It only took me
<br>
15 minutes.  Something with the person's name at the top will be far
<br>
more powerful, plus you can specifically tell Stump to withdraw the
<br>
bill rather than vote against it.
<br>
<p>What time is the hearing?
<br>
<p>Here's my text:
<br>
<p>Dear Rep. Aguirre,
<br>
<p>I have just learned, to my very great surprise and consternation, that
<br>
the Arizona House of Representatives will be considering bill HB2637
<br>
(embalmers; funeral establishments; storing remains) today (Thursday).
<br>
I strongly urge you to vote &quot;NO&quot; to this bill, which is potentially a
<br>
desirable piece of legislation but which in it current form will do
<br>
untold harm to an industry that will play a huge part in the future
<br>
of humanity and in which Arizona enjoys a unique leadership position.
<br>
No other organisation in the world is remotely in Alcor's league in
<br>
terms of the ability to lower human tissues to very low temperature
<br>
without damage; hence, any legislation that hinders their work is a
<br>
blow to this technology worldwide, whereas legislation that assists
<br>
this industry by delineating appropriate regulation and oversight is
<br>
potentially of great benefit.  Your vote today is therefore of huge
<br>
significance.
<br>
<p>I am a research scientist working on the biology of mammalian aging
<br>
at the University of Cambridge in England.  My specific focus is on
<br>
the development of techniques to repair and reverse the age-related
<br>
degenerative changes that accumulate during life and eventually kill
<br>
us.  As you may recall, I travelled specially to Phoenix to testify
<br>
to the House Health Committee on this matter on February 26th and was
<br>
most gratified at the apparently universal appreciation by Committee
<br>
members of the importance of Alcor's work, not only for current Alcor
<br>
members but for the vast numbers of people who will undoubtedly opt
<br>
for cryonic suspension in the period -- which is not far away -- when
<br>
a genuine cure for aging is clearly foreseeable but not yet actually
<br>
available.  Depending on the pace of progress by me and my fellow
<br>
gerontologists, you may well be among those people.  If the pace is
<br>
slower, your children may be.  Either way, the work that Alcor is
<br>
spearheading will very probably save tens of millions of lives.  That
<br>
is not an exaggeration.
<br>
<p>For your convenience, I will summarise here the reasons I gave to the
<br>
Health Committee why it is so imperative that Arizona get this piece
<br>
of legislation right.  Alcor preserves people in a state that is very
<br>
similar, from a recoverability point of view, to someone who has been
<br>
immersed in cold water for several minutes to an hour and whose heart
<br>
has stopped for most of that time.  Such people are clinically dead,
<br>
which means that they could have been pronounced legally dead, but in
<br>
fact they can in many cases be resuscitated.  Thus, hundreds of people
<br>
are walking around today in perfect health who have at some time in
<br>
the past been clinically dead.  Cryogenic preservation involves doing
<br>
a modest amount of further damage to someone who has recently become
<br>
clinically dead, but at the same time placing them in a state (very
<br>
low temperature) in which no further deterioration can occur.  Thus,
<br>
in decades to come, when techniques to repair molecular and cellular
<br>
damage to all tissues (including the brain) have been developed by
<br>
me and my colleagues around the world, those same techniques will be
<br>
applicable to people in cryonic suspension.  The tissue damage that
<br>
caused them to become clinically dead, plus the extra damage that was
<br>
associated with suspoension, will be reversed and the individual will
<br>
be restored to complete health.
<br>
<p>It is therefore imperative that legislation which regulates cryonics
<br>
be drafted in a manner that reflects the fact that cryonic patients
<br>
are potentially resuscitatable, despite being clinically and legally
<br>
dead.  In the first instance, the use of the term &quot;remains&quot; in many
<br>
places in the legislation is clearly unacceptable.  &quot;Remains&quot; are
<br>
what human bodies become when they are incontrovertibly beyond the
<br>
reach of medical science, something which (as I have explained above)
<br>
is not the case for cryonics patients.  Secondly, it is absolutely
<br>
essential that this legislation include a clear definition of what
<br>
cryonics is and an oversight structure that clearly distinguishes
<br>
cryonics from embalming and other purely cosmetic procedures that
<br>
are used to preserve (briefly) the appearance of bodies by actively
<br>
eliminating the possibility of resuscitation, including provisions
<br>
for becoming licensed as a cryonics provider.  Third, the current
<br>
legislation ignores the fact that Alcor and the Funeral Board have
<br>
reached a clear accord with regard to the way in which cryonics
<br>
should and should not be regulated, which can undoubtedly be
<br>
translated into good legislation given the extra time that seemed,
<br>
on February 26th, to have been permitted.
<br>
<p>In summary, I strongly urge you to vote against HB2637 in its current
<br>
inadequate form, and instead to work with the interested parties to
<br>
craft appropriate legislation that will bring credit to Arizona and
<br>
cement its leadership role in both the short-term (Kronos) and long
<br>
term (Alcor) scientific battle against the ravages of old age.
<br>
