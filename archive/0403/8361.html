<em>&gt; One appealing answer to this question of the prior is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define the prior probability of a possible universe being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; base reality as the inverse of the complexity of its laws of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics. This could be formalized as P(X) =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; n^-K(X) where X is a possible universe, n is the size of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alphabet of the language of a formal set theory, and K(X) is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; length of the shortest definition in this language of a set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isomorphic to X. (Those of you familiar with algorithmic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity theory might notice that K(X) is just a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generalization of algorithmic complexity, to sets, and to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-constructive descriptions. The reason for this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generalization is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid assuming that base reality must be discrete and computable.)
</em><br>
<p>But of course, using this method, for each formal set theory, you can
<br>
only distinguish countably many different possible universes -- even
<br>
though some of these may be &quot;uncomputable&quot; according to the
<br>
computational model adopted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The lack of a objective criteria for choosing a formal set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory for this purpose leads me to wonder if perhaps the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice of a prior is a subjective one, similar to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;choice&quot; of a supergoal in the presumed absence of objective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality. In case it is, shouldn't we try to answer this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question before building an SI?
</em><br>
<p>Clearly, the notion of &quot;base reality&quot; as an objective entity is
<br>
ill-formes.
<br>
<p>Rather, all we have is &quot;apparently base reality, based on the
<br>
perceptions and cognitions of mind M, or of minds in class M.&quot;
<br>
<p>A mind M-1 with greater capability may be able to detect that M's &quot;base
<br>
reality&quot; isn't really a &quot;base reality&quot; at all.
<br>
<p>One could surely prove that, for any mind, there are some possible
<br>
simulations it could be living in, where it could never detect it was in
<br>
a simulation -- yet an abler mind could.  This would be yet another
<br>
Godel theorem varient.
<br>
<p>I agree that there is no way to &quot;objectively&quot; choose a prior over the
<br>
space of possible universes.  This is essentially the problem at the
<br>
heart of the Bayesian approach to induction (in the general, Hume-ean
<br>
sense).  You need a prior distribution on hypothesis space (in this
<br>
case, hypotheses about which universe exists).  
<br>
<p>One approach that's been discussed on this list a lot is algorithmic
<br>
information, the Solomonoff-Levin measure, etc.  However, this depends
<br>
on the base computational model. 
<br>
<p>One approach here, following Hume, is to take &quot;human nature&quot; as a base
<br>
computational model -- so that prior probability becomes &quot;simplicity to
<br>
the human mind.&quot;  Or, taking a page from Eliezer's notion of
<br>
humane-ness, perhaps &quot;simplicity to some sort of idealized collective
<br>
human mind.&quot;  But I don't find this very satisfactory.  
<br>
<p>I'm happier applying the human intuition for simplicity to the *choice
<br>
of computational model*.  Hence, I prefer a base computational model
<br>
involving very simple computational operations, such as the S and K
<br>
combinator.... See e.g.
<br>
<p><a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~tromp/cl/CL.pdf">http://homepages.cwi.nl/~tromp/cl/CL.pdf</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
for an apparently very-close-to-minimal formulation of universal
<br>
computation.
<br>
<p>As it happens, this ties in with Novamente AI, since our system uses
<br>
combinatory logic as part of its knowledge representation.
