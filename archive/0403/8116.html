</em><br>
<p>The replacement of human _labor_ has been going on
<br>
since antiquity - sails replacing oars, water
<br>
powered mills replacing hand grinding of grain,
<br>
up to the more recent introduction of tractors
<br>
in farming which allows 2% (and still decreasing)
<br>
of the workforce to feed us all.
<br>
<p>My local supermarket has replaced half the
<br>
checkout counters with self-scan stations, cutting
<br>
the number of cashiers from four to one.  
<br>
<p>The largest machine tool maker in the US, Haas,
<br>
operates it's factory three shifts a day, but only
<br>
one is manned.  The other two run on robots and
<br>
automation:
<br>
<a href="http://www.haascnc.com/discover/haasway.asp">http://www.haascnc.com/discover/haasway.asp</a>
<br>
<p>So the issue is not whether human labor will be
<br>
displaced by artificial labor.  That's been an
<br>
ongoing development throughout history and there
<br>
is every reason to believe it will continue.
<br>
<p>One issue is whether people can adapt fast
<br>
enough as the nature of a &quot;job&quot; changes.  My
<br>
father was a machinist, but he never worked
<br>
with computerized machine tools.  So the skills
<br>
he was taught in trade school in the late 1940's
<br>
were useful his whole working career.
<br>
<p>In my own career, I've had to learn new skills
<br>
on a continuing basis to stay current.  If we
<br>
reach a point where people have to spend most
<br>
of their time training for new skills, there won't
<br>
be much time to actually do work.
<br>
<p>Another issue is how to distribute products if
<br>
you only need a small number of highly skilled and
<br>
highly paid people to make the stuff.  I don't 
<br>
know how best to do that.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If capitalism isn't fast enough to deal with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces set loose by  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI, a successor will emerge which is.
</em><br>
<p>You don't need AI of the type we discuss on this
<br>
list to create social disruption.  Automation and
<br>
robotics of the type already available is sufficient,
<br>
it's a question of how fast it will be introduced.
<br>
If fast food restaurants and retail stores 
<br>
rapidly replace their human staff with robots
<br>
because the economics reaches a turning point,
<br>
you might have a big problem domestically.
<br>
<p>If automation and robotics can do work cheaper
<br>
than the cheapest human labor in the poorest
<br>
countries in the world, you might have a huge
<br>
problem worldwide.
<br>
<p>Charitable organizations may take to distributing
<br>
replicating robotic factories rather than food
<br>
to 3rd world countries to alleviate destitution.
