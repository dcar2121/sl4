<em>&gt; So, for a moment, I invite you to stop thinking about morality with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural and semantic burden and just think about reality without 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That morality seems to mean different things to different people may 
<br>
largely be an artifact of different people having relatively imprecise 
<br>
and weak methods of justifying moral standards.  This in part reflects 
<br>
the multi-faceted origin of morality in evolved creatures such as 
<br>
ourselves, in part reflects various limitations of our philosophical 
<br>
acumen, and in part comes from it being a generally slippery subject.   
<br>
But it does not in my view justify more or less writing off morality as 
<br>
such as devoid of real meaning.
<br>
<p>Why on earth would I consider any situation without it context?  How 
<br>
exactly am I to think without the use of words and the concepts that 
<br>
they label?  What does such &quot;thinking&quot; look like?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pick your favourite victim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take North Korean prisoners. Their guilt by association system has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrown in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor camps entire families, people come out at age 20 and reveal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent their entire childhood in a labor camp treated like trash, seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their relatives beaten to death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, tell me what is the REAL reason why this shouldn't happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it because it is a system that won't be accepted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it because it limits growth of patterns in the universe?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If not why is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It should not happen because it is a maltreatment of human being such 
<br>
as ourselves and a waste of human lives and potential.  Maltreatment 
<br>
means that it is treatment contrary to the needs of human beings for 
<br>
optimal live and well-being.
<br>
<p>I am nonplussed that it have some significance to the entire universe 
<br>
in order for it to be judged immoral.
<br>
<p>To answer any question about morality you need to say what morality is. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In main part it is a set of standards for how sentient beings treat 
<br>
one another.  It leads to consideration of what are generally optimal 
<br>
ways of treating one another.  This leads to questions about the nature 
<br>
of the entities whose interaction we are attempting to generally 
<br>
optimize and what their &quot;good&quot; consists of.  It is within the context 
<br>
of our answers, even approximate ones, to these questions that morality 
<br>
can be meaningfully discussed and moral judgments meaningfully made.
