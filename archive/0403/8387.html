<p><p>Could you elucidate on your use of &quot;pattern theory&quot;?
<br>
<p>I don't recall ever seeing it mentioned on this list by anyone, and I'm 
<br>
almost surprised to see you mention it here though I suppose I 
<br>
shouldn't be.
<br>
<p>One of the many things in the hierarchy of issues that I felt needed to 
<br>
be addressed along the way to AGI was a fully functional computational 
<br>
model that fundamentally operates on &quot;patterns&quot; -- a universal Bayesian 
<br>
pattern calculus.  I ignored it for a long time because there were 
<br>
other more pressing problems that needed to be solved first (like truly 
<br>
adequate representation), but over the last year or so I've started to 
<br>
spend a lot more time on it as I moved past other obstacles and it has 
<br>
proven to be both difficult and interesting.  &quot;Pattern Theory&quot; is a bit 
<br>
of an overloaded term; there is a lot of vague and/or unrelated stuff 
<br>
on the 'net that uses that term, which is partially why I'm asking the 
<br>
question.  In fact, &quot;pattern calculus&quot; in the context of computational 
<br>
models brings up a lot of papers that are a bit less novel inside than 
<br>
they sometimes sound on the surface.
<br>
<p>Most of the hard part for me has been reducing it to the simplest 
<br>
possible complete model, and it is definitely a work-in-progress in my 
<br>
own pursuits at this point.  (I solve many things by applying a skill 
<br>
learned through many years of chemical engineering discipline, taking 
<br>
obscenely complex systems of arbitrary size and systematically reducing 
<br>
them to something elegant -- chemical engineering in a nutshell.  A 
<br>
general heuristic as a ChemE is that more is better; the more equations 
<br>
and models you can throw into the pot, the easier systematic reduction 
<br>
will be.)  It isn't theoretically hard, just tricky to think about 
<br>
sometimes, and I've only recently started putting significant effort 
<br>
into it.
<br>
<p>Completely aside from the AGI issue, I am pretty much of the opinion 
<br>
that developing a proper pattern calculus (and the representation 
<br>
system to exploit it) will help address a great many outstanding issues 
<br>
in basic programming theory, issues such as brittleness.
<br>
<p>In my list of things to discuss, but which I hadn't gotten around to.
