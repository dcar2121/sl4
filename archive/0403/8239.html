Hi Ben,  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What makes me think you don't &quot;get&quot; the Singularity fully is partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you keep using analogies from human history.  This is not much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like anything else in human history.  The Bolsheviks are not a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy -- nothing in human history is a good analogy.  Because human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history is about HUMANS and the Singularity is largely not about humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (though humans are an important part of it of course) 
</em><br>
<p>Of course human history is not going to be a good guide to the 
<br>
subjectively 'distant' future (any time from the singularity on).  But it is a 
<br>
useful addtion to our thinking for the lead up to the singularity and we 
<br>
will discover, after the event, that some patterns persist  for some time 
<br>
after (which one's? I don't know, nor does anyone else).  
<br>
<p>BUT it is NOT good reasoning to say that (human) history is not 
<br>
relevant *at all*.  Ben, you have been drawing on 'history' when you say 
<br>
you think that &quot;voluntary joyous growth' accords with the nature of the 
<br>
universe (in this case the history is the history of various aspects of the 
<br>
cosmos translated into scientific 'laws' then translated into your 
<br>
intuitions).
<br>
<p>In the context of the singularity both of our speculations about the 
<br>
nature of the universe/reality are equally valid/invalid.
<br>
<p>You didn't answer my question in the previous post.....do you think that 
<br>
evolution as a meta-process will continue after the singularity?  If you 
<br>
expect that it will continue then that suggests that you think that 'history' 
<br>
is still important - because any complex evolving system is a deeply 
<br>
historical process - where every step along the way shapes the 
<br>
possibilities that come next and later - whether those possibilities create 
<br>
temporary continuities or major discontinuities.
<br>
<p>So if every step along the way helps to create the proximal future then 
<br>
we need to pay attention to what we do in every moment of now.  In 
<br>
that context it is still relevant to learn from human history - even in the 
<br>
face of the singularity - because the now we are in right now has a lot of 
<br>
recognisable humans in it and they will help shape the proximal future 
<br>
in important ways (for good or ill or neither).
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
