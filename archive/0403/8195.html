Tommy McCabe said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Second of all, the material in the brain isn't &quot;protoplasm&quot;- the supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence of such material, which was thought to give life to beings, was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disproven centuries ago.
</em><br>
<p>When people speak of &quot;protoplasm&quot; today, they just
<br>
mean living matter. It's not an assertion of vitalism.
<br>
With words like &quot;cytoplasm&quot; and &quot;nucleoplasm&quot; still
<br>
perfectly current among biologists, I find it hard to
<br>
object to the admittedly old-fashioned &quot;protoplasm&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Third of all, this completely ignores any kind of ultratechnology or even a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity happening. Fourth, the Singularity could prevent, or at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;postpone, the universe winding up in such a state.
</em><br>
<p>Well, these points boil down to, &quot;The physical and
<br>
cosmological theories behind these predictions could
<br>
be wrong.&quot; All these scenarios involve positing that
<br>
the laws of nature are a certain way, from the beginning
<br>
to the end of time, and GIVEN SUCH ASSUMPTIONS,
<br>
you can calculate constraints that will remain true no
<br>
matter how ultra your technology is. The &quot;light-heartedness&quot;
<br>
of the cosmic eschatologists probably comes from
<br>
the knowledge that many of the assumptions behind
<br>
these extrapolations are rather arbitrary. We are at a
<br>
point in cosmological model-building where we know
<br>
how to get the model to do just about anything -
<br>
expand faster and faster forever, go from accelerating
<br>
expansion to decelerating expansion and then to collapse,
<br>
bounce after collapse - but it all depends on having the
<br>
right recipe of fundamental fields, and we only have
<br>
low-energy information about what sort of fields there
<br>
actually are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Fifth, there is no communication mechanism specified. Interstellar dust 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't have an electric or magnetic charge.
</em><br>
<p>How do you draw that conclusion? Ions can exist in
<br>
interstellar space, just like anywhere else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sixth, unless some form of FTL travel is assumed, the entity would take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trillions of years to think a thought.
</em><br>
<p>Who cares? It has forever!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Seventh, the particles would have to know exactly where the other particles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were in order to relay signals (at least to relay signals efficiently- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;omnidirectional transmissions waste huge amounts of energy). Eighth, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given a workaround to seven, the particles are likely to be moving and so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have to keep constant track of each other (sounds like a lot for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little bit of dust!).
</em><br>
<p>This *is* something I'd like to hear more about.
<br>
There are no rigid bodies in these dust clouds
<br>
(apart from the dust grains themselves) - where
<br>
is the structure? What are the functional components
<br>
(receivers, processors, transmitters; damage detectors,
<br>
repair mechanisms)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ninth, although we of course don't fully understand the brain, it isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true the we have &quot;no idea&quot; how it works. Just ask a neurologist.
</em><br>
<p>I think he's talking about consciousness (the &quot;hard
<br>
problem&quot;, why it feels like something to be a brain,
<br>
etc.), not cognition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Tenth, this organism would still consume quite a lot of energy, and no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy source is given. Eleventh, given the time frame (10^36 years in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future), and given current theories about cosmic expansion, who says there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would even be dust?
</em><br>
<p>Expansion isn't relevant to whether there's dust.
<br>
If the universe starts with galaxies of dust and expands
<br>
forever, the dust will still be there. The expansion of
<br>
the universe (at least, the non-accelerating sort that
<br>
is understood) only takes place in intergalactic space,
<br>
where the cosmological &quot;Friedmann geometry&quot; dominates.
<br>
Inside the gravitational well of an individual galaxy, there's
<br>
no such expansion. So, if galaxies were indefinitely stable
<br>
objects, the long-term future of the universe's geometry
<br>
would consist of galactic gravitational wells of constant
<br>
size, dimpling the homogeneous curve of smoothly
<br>
expanding intergalactic space, and increasingly remote
<br>
from each other. If the fate of galaxies is to end up
<br>
as galactic-mass black holes which then Hawking-evaporate,
<br>
then the ex-galaxies will constantly be losing energy
<br>
in the form of Hawking radiation, and the gravitational
<br>
dimples on the expanding universe will shrink to nothing,
<br>
replaced by a gas of radiation too tenuous to ever
<br>
re-condense into a new generation of localized objects.
<br>
If there's proton decay, a fatal leakage of galactic mass
<br>
into intergalactic space might even occur long before
<br>
black hole evaporation becomes relevant.
<br>
<p>You should read Dyson's paper, &quot;Life Without End&quot;.
