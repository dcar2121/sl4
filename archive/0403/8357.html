<p>
It's a kind of figure/ground illusion.  Follow along below.  Likely your 
<br>
mind will &quot;blink&quot; and switch perspectives just before or at the conclusion.
<br>
<p>Imagine looking in from the outside on a completely natural universe, 
<br>
where evolution led to the development of increasingly complex life 
<br>
forms, and eventually to life forms that had developed the fitness 
<br>
adaptation of being able to form an internal model of their experiential 
<br>
world and to perform complex reasoning about it using a string of 
<br>
symbols and memory of past reasoning.  So far so good -- most of us can 
<br>
conceive of this in a purely mechanistic sense. [Read this paragraph 
<br>
again and let it sink in.]
<br>
<p>Now, these organisms also developed the fitness adaptation of being able 
<br>
to exchange symbols with each other and thus share their models of the 
<br>
world.  They achieved this by speaking of their thoughts and experiences...
<br>
<p>Did you shift perspective right about there?  Why?
<br>
<p>A purely mechanistic third person account of conscious experience has 
<br>
all the observable attributes and characteristics of a first person 
<br>
account.  But the third-person account is simpler and more consistent, 
<br>
therefore preferable as an explanation.  There is no reason to 
<br>
hypothesize some mysterious state to explain our first-person experience 
<br>
of consciousness.  Of course it *feels* the way it does.
<br>
