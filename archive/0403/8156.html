Hi,
<br>
<p>It's certainly not true that experts are always overoptimistic about
<br>
progress.
<br>
<p>Rather, what history shows is that progress is damn hard to predict,
<br>
even for experts.  Some things go much faster than projected, other
<br>
things go much slower.
<br>
<p>Marc, you seem to make the assumption that we need to understand 100%
<br>
about mind/brain in order to create an AGI.  This seems like a poor
<br>
assumption.  We have made many useful devices utilizing quantum
<br>
phenomena, yet we certainly do not have a good understanding of these
<br>
phenomena yet.  Creating an AGI requires a particular sort of partial
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>My own feeling is, I agree with you that visions of a Singularity in 5
<br>
years are basically fantasy.  5 years is close enough that it's
<br>
reasonable to make projections based on current technology.  We could
<br>
potentially have a roughly human-level AGI in 5 years, if research goes
<br>
very well -- but even if we get there that fast, solving the issues of
<br>
Friendliness and reasonably-predictable self-modification is going to
<br>
take some time.
<br>
<p>But regarding the state of the world 20 years out or even 10 years out,
<br>
I think it's much harder to say anything definite.  
<br>
<p>Kurzweil's projections of a Singularity in 2030-2060 seem reasonable and
<br>
conservative to me.  A breakthrough could make things happen sooner ...
<br>
though almost certainly not within 5 years ... and a turn for the worse
<br>
in the world political/economic situation could make things happen
<br>
later...
<br>
<p>I'll make a more controversial statement, though: I think that if the
<br>
world WANTED a Singularity in, say, 5-8 years, it could quite possibly
<br>
get it.  A Manhattan-project-style attack on the AGI problem could
<br>
potentially yield dramatic results in a 2-3 year period....  However,
<br>
the powers that be do not seem to have a belief-system oriented in this
<br>
direction at all, so this statement of mine is basically irrelevant in a
<br>
practical sense.
