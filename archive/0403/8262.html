<em>&gt; That a language can map into XML and is arguably a good language does

<p>Of course not.
<br>
<p>&lt;Argh! break for many hours while composing and re-composing my answer . .
<br>
&nbsp;.  :-&gt;
<br>
&lt;let me try it this way . . . . &gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;Note: there are a couple of important points for Ben at the bottom&gt;
<br>
<p>The short answer - I want an environment where a program is also data so
<br>
that automatic program generation and manipulation is facilitated.  Making
<br>
a programming language XML-compliant pretty much guarantees this and also
<br>
gives access to a large existing infrastructure that already
<br>
manipulates/supports XML.  More importantly, I want the programs running
<br>
in that environment to be efficient and scalable through the use of native
<br>
data
<br>
space partitioning and compilation of programs/functions which are swappable
<br>
via package/program/function specifications.  There is no existing
<br>
combination of language and environment that does all of this but I believe
<br>
that given the popularity and current specification and infrastructure of
<br>
XML, it could be done most quickly if the language were XML-compliant.  In
<br>
LISP, a program is also data but efficiency and scalability (particularly
<br>
swappable modularity with compilation) are not built into the environment
<br>
and LISP doesn't have nearly the audience or the infrastructure that XML has
<br>
to support new development.
<br>
= = = = =
<br>
The long answer
<br>
<p>Any procedural computer program/function can be represented by recursive
<br>
data structure composed of a series (list) of statements that are themselves
<br>
programs/functions.  XML has no problem representing this as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;function name=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;vars&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;var name = &quot;inString&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/var&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;list&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;function name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;function name=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;var name = &quot;secondvar1&quot; type=&quot;integer&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;var name = &quot;secondvar2&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; referent=&quot;inString&quot;/&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/function&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;function name=&quot;third'&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/list&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/function&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, actually, there are A LOT of decisions to be made as to how all sorts
<br>
of things should be represented . . . . .
<br>
<p>My point, though, is that any procedural language program COULD be
<br>
represented in XML syntax fairly easily.
<br>
<p>ASIDE:  If one wants to go down the functional programming path, programs
<br>
are even more easily be represented by hierarchical tree structures and XML.
<br>
Also note that procedural programs can be transformed into functional
<br>
programs simply by realizing that series/lists are themselves composed of
<br>
and can be replaced by functions)
<br>
<p>Now, what does all this buy us?
<br>
<p>First, there already exists substantial infrastructure for parsing XML,
<br>
moving it in and out of various datastructures, etc., etc.
<br>
<p>Second, now that our programs already exist in a DATA format, we already
<br>
have a lot of the tools that we need to be able to modify them.
<br>
<p>Now, if I were Samantha, I would argue that all of these things could be
<br>
done in LISP and I would be correct.  But what's generally missing in LISP
<br>
is a lot of what's required for true SPEED and SCALABILITY or, as Ben puts
<br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; Separate *efficiency of implementation* from *logical structure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs*.  In other words, have a language with two layers: one layer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is more like a formal specification, and the other layer that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformed to be efficiently executable.  It's the first layer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can usefully be represented in XML, and potentially manipulated using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML-manipulation tools.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, what I envision when I talk about an XML-based language is more
<br>
like XML.NET i.e. a system where I can write a description of a program or a
<br>
function in my language but compile it down to or replace it with an
<br>
implementation-efficient version.
<br>
<p>IMPORTANT POINT:  If I were Ben and working on Novamente, I would be
<br>
making sure that my freezing and thawing (storage and retrieval) of schemas,
<br>
atomspaces, etc. was available through XML and that Sasha 2's syntax was XML
<br>
compliant.
<br>
<p>The whole point to this is to try to make a very modular, swappable
<br>
programming environment that lends itself to both very high levels of
<br>
abstraction and drilling down to the lowest detail when necessary.
<br>
<p>Note to Ben:  A couple of things that I would hope for but don't yet see in
<br>
Novamente are a) ways to take recognize and advantage of the scale
<br>
invariance of many activities through encapsulation and b) a way to compile
<br>
specific time-critical schemas from more general schemas (and the reverse,
<br>
allowing for subsequent description of currently compiled code, like
<br>
CIM-dynamics, WITHOUT affecting the system).
