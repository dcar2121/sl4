<em>&gt; The problem is that unless this XML/prog-lang mapping is done in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple, manageable, compact way, it's not of any practical use...
</em><br>
<p>Agreed but I don't actually see much complexity here.  Fundamentally, most
<br>
programming languages are actually very small.  It's only when you consider
<br>
functions and function libraries as a part of the language that they seem
<br>
large.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Honestly, I think what you want is Refal.NET (which doesn't exist of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, but would be a fun port to make.  Some friends of mine have now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ported OCaML, another weird functional language, to .NET ... The port is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called Nemerle)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Sasha2(the XML version).NET would be pretty cool if you added a
<br>
couple of the features discussed below to Novamente.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, we use XML as one option for saving/loading.  However, it's very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very slow to load large XML files into Novamente, so for repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loading the same data we load it in from XML *once* and then save a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binary &quot;net image&quot; file, which can be loaded and reloaded much faster.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  For &quot;internal use only&quot; saving and retrieving, using a binary &quot;net
<br>
image&quot; file makes the same sense that using compiled code rather than the
<br>
original XML schema makes.  For transferring knowledge to somewhere else,
<br>
XML is probably what is needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are processes for &quot;encapsulation&quot; but none that specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address scale-invariance; I'm not sure what you mean...
</em><br>
<p>The encapsulation that I'd like to see first is the ability to represent the
<br>
specification of a schema (as opposed to it's entire operation) merely by
<br>
it's signature and functionality so that it can be more easily analyzed and
<br>
operated on by higher level schema and also so that it can easily be
<br>
replaced by other versions as discussed in the next paragraph.
<br>
<p>Scale invariance is probably a long discussion but I'll try to hit a few
<br>
high points to give a general idea.  In nature, there are a lot of
<br>
fundamental equations (like the power law) that occur at all scale levels.
<br>
Similarly, there are functions and operations that do the same fundamentally
<br>
similar things at wildly different scale levels OR in wildly different
<br>
domains.  In the real world, we tend to recognize these things because they
<br>
have the same names and often serve as metaphors for each other (side
<br>
comment - it is probably worthwhile to look further into the importance of
<br>
naming in concept mapping, metaphor recognition, etc. as a way for Novamente
<br>
to better utilize learning and concept formation that was done in the real
<br>
world).  I think that there is a lot of information that can be leveraged
<br>
for learning from this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;and b) a way to compile specific time-critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; schemas from more general schemas (and the reverse, allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for subsequent description of currently compiled code, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; CIM-dynamics, WITHOUT affecting the system).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is something that we know we need, but have not yet thought about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in detail.  This would take the form of specific &quot;graph rewriting&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms acting on CombinatorTrees and CombinatorDAGs ... Comparable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to what exists inside some functional language interpreters.  But this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a good discussion for SL4, I suppose -- too narrowly technical...
</em><br>
<p>Graph rewriting is awfully vague, generic, and covers a lot of ground.  I
<br>
think that one important trick (that will take a long time) is recognizing
<br>
when you have a generic function that can be generalized, compiled and added
<br>
to your toolbox.  Another trick (that should happen sooner) is recognizing
<br>
when all that is needed is a subset of a slow algorithm and when you can
<br>
constrain the algorithm and use variable folding to transform an overly
<br>
time-intensive algorithm into a supportable one.  Another trick (that you've
<br>
already used) is to be willing to replace whole graph sections with
<br>
human-created code where appropriate.  Actually, an example is probably
<br>
appropriate here since this also feeds into the encapsulation/scale
<br>
discussion.  For example, sorting/sorted is a generic operation/concept that
<br>
CAN be represented in combinatorial logic - - but I would prefer to have it
<br>
generally encapsulated as a description with the actual code being compiled
<br>
from some nice hand-crafted C++.  Your CIM-dynamics are clearly already this
<br>
type of code but you want to be able to, eventually, also allow the system
<br>
to see the Combinator version of the algorithms.  At some point, the full
<br>
transition from Combinator to compiled code should be possible . . . .
