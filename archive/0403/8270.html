<em>&gt; In order for the system to self-modify programming, Sasha 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be (as you state below) in the form of the basic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente data structures.  These Novamente data structures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should easily translate into XML.
</em><br>
<p>Right
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once the program is interpreted into a combinator tree, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code is irrelevant.  For parsing to get it into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tree, for storage and, particularly for retrieval, it could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be VERY useful to use a lot of the standards and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure already developed for XML.  
</em><br>
<p>The reason we use XML is for interoperability between Novamente and
<br>
other databases and software programs.
<br>
<p>For instance, when the NM core loads in information from a biology
<br>
database, it does so using XML as an intermediary (i.e., we first map
<br>
the bio-db into XML in a Novamente-appropriate way, then have Novamente
<br>
load the XML)
<br>
<p>And, when the NM core sends information to a user interface, it does so
<br>
via XML ... (a different DTD for each different type of user interface)
<br>
<p>But all this is just using XML as a *data language*, not using it to
<br>
store procedures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One thing which I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't seen yet in Novamente that I'm sure will be necessary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ways to partition an atom space, label the pieces, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide efficient and scalable directed access to specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces (and only those pieces) when you need them.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we have not built that stuff yet.  We had stuff like that in
<br>
Webmind (Novamente's predecessor system) and will definitely need it for
<br>
Novamente as well.  In Webmind we used an Oracle DB for this purpose,
<br>
but our solution now will be XML-based.  
<br>
<p>Still, this is using XML for data storage.  While Atoms defining
<br>
procedures may be stored in this way, they're being manipulated on a
<br>
very coarse level (i.e. being categorized according to general qualities
<br>
like topic area, period of time in which they were used, etc.).  They're
<br>
not being manipulated &quot;as procedures&quot;, used to generate new procedures,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>XML is, in my view, a pain in the butt for this purpose.
<br>
<p>I don't share Samantha's LISP evangelism -- I like LISP in principle,
<br>
but personally I find it a bit annoying.  I prefer Haskell if I'm going
<br>
to use a functional language.  And I love Refal in principle, though I
<br>
haven't done much coding in it.  For Novamente, we chose C++ because we
<br>
were paranoid about scalability to deal effectively with massive amounts
<br>
of memory....  
<br>
