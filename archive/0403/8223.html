<p>
Samantha,
<br>
<p>Rememeber these lines from 'The Matrix'?
<br>
<p>&quot;The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our
<br>
enemy. Look around, what do you see. Business men,
<br>
lawyers, carpenters... the very minds of the people we
<br>
are trying to save, but until we do, they are still
<br>
part of the system...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Most of these people are not ready to be unplugged
<br>
and many of them are so inered, so hopelessly
<br>
dependent on the system that they will fight to
<br>
protect it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Don't make the mistake of assuming other people are
<br>
anywhere near as beningn or rational as we are.  Did
<br>
you just catch the news about the huge terror blasts
<br>
in Spain?  Over 1000 wounded, hundreds dead.  These
<br>
people are trying to kill us.  The world is still
<br>
filled with people just like that , who unfortunately,
<br>
don't respect reason and are quite prepared to impose
<br>
their own views on those they disagree with through
<br>
violence.
<br>
<p>Sooner or later (probably sooner) the shit is going to
<br>
hit the fan  (9/11 was just a small sneak preview of
<br>
how fast the shit can hit the fan without warning). 
<br>
As we get closer and closer to the Singularity we can
<br>
expect the social and political situation to become
<br>
ever more dangerous and unstable ('phase transitions'
<br>
are chaotic).  I wouldn't be surprised to see the
<br>
United States Federal Government collapse well before
<br>
the Singularity occurs.  Betting markets are offering
<br>
odds as high as 25% that the U.S Federal government
<br>
will collapse within the next 25 years.  What Eliezer
<br>
seems to have overlooked in 'Creating Friendly AI' are
<br>
all the ways social chaos could stop a successful
<br>
Singularity from occuring.  Imagine that at some point
<br>
in the future Sing Inst is established at a physical
<br>
location, working away, and then suddenly social chaos
<br>
erupts.  I wouldn't want to be in any state outside
<br>
New Hampshire when it happens.  In fact, I'd be scared
<br>
of being the States at all. 
<br>
<p>Don't make the mistake of thinking that people are
<br>
more benign than they really are.  People who are not
<br>
Libertarian-Transhumanists are NOT our friends. 
<br>
They're a part of the 'System' we are tring to escape.
<br>
&nbsp;Don't forget it.
