Yan King Yin raises some important issues. But he needs to deepen his
<br>
knowledge of history.

</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; 1. European ancestors invaded Islam/Arab during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crusades. Some of the territories converted to Christianity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were later 'recovered' but I'm not aware of any reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invasion of Europe by Islam/Arabs on a similar scale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is asymmetrical.
</em><br>
<p>Islam appeared in the early 600s of the Common Era and quickly spread BY
<br>
MILITARY CONQUEST, not voluntary conversion. The power vacuum that had
<br>
resulted from the fall of the Roman Empire made this possible. Arab armies
<br>
soon spread the new faith -- at the point of a sword -- as far east as
<br>
India, and as far west as Spain, and as far north as the Balkans and Central
<br>
Asia. Only when the French (or their predecessors, the Franks) stopped the
<br>
Islamic armies in the West, and when the Austrians stopped them literally at
<br>
the gates of Vienna, did their military expansion in Europe stop. So in fact
<br>
the historical situation has been quite symmetrical.
<br>
<p>But the symmetry does not end there. Some of the European powers took
<br>
control of Arab lands during the 19th and early 20th century. But their
<br>
control lasted less than 100 years. Today, Muslim immigration to Europe has
<br>
reversed the tide again. While this immigration has been mostly peaceful,
<br>
the Muslims have been extraordinarily resistant to the normal process of
<br>
cultural assimilation in their host countries. Just look at this situation
<br>
in France and the issue of Muslim women wearing the veil (often because
<br>
their male family members compel them to do so). And as we have seen among
<br>
their more extremists elements in the Madrid bombings and the attacks on New
<br>
York and Washington before that, it has been quite easy for the terrorists
<br>
to hide--or even gain support--among the immigrant communities of Europe and
<br>
America. What little condemnation of terrorist acts has been voiced by those
<br>
immigrant communities has been weak and equivocal, while (according to
<br>
journalists and pollsters) support for anti-Western jihadists is widespread
<br>
if quiet.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2. The modern Israel state is founded by Jewish people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at least some of them) are genetically quite closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to Palestinian Arabs. The point is, if they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descended from the same (or similar) ancestral population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then both of them should have some claim to the territory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on ancestry.
</em><br>
<p>Only some of the Jews of Israel are genetically close to the Arabs. The
<br>
Zionists who pushed for the creation of the modern state of Israel are
<br>
mostly European Jews (Ashkenazim). Within Israel itself, as in any other
<br>
communities, there is considerable diversity. Non-European Jews (Sephardim)
<br>
are mostly closer to the Arabs genetically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. In Gulf War I &amp; II, Saddam Hussein was depicted as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; villian because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocide of Kurds. But hundreds of years ago Europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically did the same to the original populations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America. The point: If my dad robbed a bank and died
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards, am I entitled to the wealth he left over?
</em><br>
<p>Why stop your examination at just a few hundred years ago? Push it back
<br>
further and further as far as we have any records or archeological evidence
<br>
and you will see that what the Europeans did in America is the same as every
<br>
other powerful group has done whenever it has had the chance. How did the
<br>
Han Chinese come to dominate the territories of modern China? How did China
<br>
come to rule Tibet in 1950? This is nothing new. It's certainly not
<br>
good--but it's not new. Primate politics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If the strong is entitled to rob the weak of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possesions/territory, then why does this NOT happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *within* civil society?
</em><br>
<p>It does happen, wherever less than moral people feel that they can get away
<br>
with it. Turn out the lights in a major American city that has a large
<br>
population in poverty and watch the looting begin. Turn away close
<br>
government oversight of large corporations like Enron and Worldcom and watch
<br>
the looting begin. Primate politics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; On the other hand, local patterns of morality do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to hold in the evolutionary picture where humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit other animals and there doesn't seem to be any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retributions (negative effects) from it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know the answer. What is the pattern that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerging in this? I think analyzing this is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important than speculating on the distant future, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you may be quite sure you'll be among the 'survivors'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YKY
</em><br>
<p>The pattern that emerges is primate politics unrestrained by strong moral
<br>
communities and governmental structures that can sanction and punish
<br>
wrongdoing.
<br>
<p>If we can create a Friendly AI that consistently adheres to a superior
<br>
morality (i.e., our best morality) even without oversight, then we may have
<br>
a situation where humans can relax the imperatives of primate politics. We
<br>
would quickly learn that we can no longer get away with doing things the old
<br>
way because the FAI will not allow it.
<br>
