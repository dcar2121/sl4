&quot;choices that are more in harmony with the intrinsic nature of the universe, are more likely to be actualizable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Based on what I read in Tegmark's Sci Am article on alternate universes last year, all possibilities do, it would seem , exist. For example there is an exact clone of you somewhere within about three Hubble volumes.
<br>
Where can 'God' and 'morality' fit into a reality of this sort?
<br>
The only sane interpretations I can find among major religions are in Buddhist and other Eastern literature; here we find sohpisticated ideas about figure/ground relationships, cycles of creation and destruction, personal choice and integration into a whole that is somehow mind and more than mind. Personal responsibility, yes. But no angry bearded Nobodaddy hurling bolts at sinners.
<br>
<p>Morality then becomes &quot;What path do I choose from those that seem possible?&quot; &quot;What kind of world do I choose to create/embody/seek?&quot; &quot;What kind of person do I have to be to exist in that sort of world?&quot;
<br>
If the cosmos as a whole has an ethic, it might well be &quot;Here's stuff. You break it, you buy it.&quot;
<br>
But, as the I Ching says, no blame.
<br>
<p>Question: do some paths inevitably end well, others not? How much choice do we actually have?
<br>
If dead and buried = 0% free will
<br>
and God-like powers = 100% free will
<br>
the we must be somewhere in between (can't fly unassisted, etc.)
<br>
and even old Nobodaddy (Wm. Blake's coinage) can't violate logic (cf. the old Catholic-school question &quot;Faddah, can God make a rock so big he can't lift it?&quot;)
<br>
I just can't get away from the idea that we are only choosing pathways that always existed (yep, Permutation City...)
