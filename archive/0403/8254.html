Damien wrote, about Terrence McKenna and others with a similar attitude
<br>
<p>*************
<br>
Because we have been there, we know we need not be afraid, or give in to
<br>
<p>amazement, and can avoid being hypnotized by speed or pretty blinking 
<br>
lights.  Talking to aliens?  Been there.  The end of history?  Been
<br>
there, 
<br>
too.  Maybe all the bizarre trips that we've all had are just what we
<br>
need, 
<br>
even as humanity enters its last, strange trip.
<br>
<p>Just a few months before he died, I went to visit Terence in Hawai'i.  I
<br>
<p>asked him to sign my copy of The Invisible Landscape, which he did.  He 
<br>
wrote: &quot;Properly understood, this book is a map to the stone.  As above,
<br>
so 
<br>
below.&quot;
<br>
<p>The stone he referred to is the Philosopher's Stone, which could raise
<br>
base 
<br>
materials to their highest, transcendent state.  He knew that at best
<br>
he'd 
<br>
constructed a metaphor, a way to conceive something inconceivable.  &gt;
<br>
<p>Yada yada, alas. IMHO.

*****************
<br>
<p><p>In my view, psychedelic experiences CAN be valuable in preparing the
<br>
mind to understand the Singularity.
<br>
<p>But NOT because the details of what's experienced in psychedelic
<br>
experiences is similar to the details of what will happen after the
<br>
Singularity.  This seems unlikely.
<br>
<p>Rather, because, psychedelic experience compels you to appreciate the
<br>
relative and insubstantial nature of human thought and reality, in a
<br>
very visceral rather than purely intellectual way.
<br>
<p>Getting outside of the human mind, and seeing how the human mind
<br>
constructs itself and constructs an &quot;apparently solid&quot; reality for
<br>
itself -- seeing that there's actually a much bigger universe out there,
<br>
beyond anything our minds or our science is capable of comprehending ...
<br>
&quot;seeing&quot;/perceiving this as intensely as one ordinarily perceives one's
<br>
stomach or a fork in one's hand ... This kind of &quot;view of human reality
<br>
from the outside&quot; definitely one of the gifts of the psychedelic
<br>
experience.... 
<br>
<p>After having had this kind of experience, it's pretty EASY to believe
<br>
that a techno-Singularity could reveal some part of this trans-human
<br>
universe that one has glimpsed
<br>
<p>However, it is very foolish to think that psychedelics let one see even
<br>
a tiny fraction of what exists outside consensus human reality.  There's
<br>
a lot of possibility out there in pattern-space....  
<br>
<p>The sorts of things one should take back-to-reality from psychedelic
<br>
experiences are messages like
<br>
<p>* there's a lot of reality beyond human reality, which we can't even
<br>
come close to understanding
<br>
* everything is connected, everything is continually manufactured by
<br>
everything else
<br>
* there's awareness and mind inside everythign
<br>
<p>Note, these are PLATITUDES, but the significant thing about the
<br>
psychedelic experience is DEEPLY AND VISCERALLY EXPERIENCING these
<br>
platitudes rather than just realizing them intellectually
<br>
<p>Trying to seize specific facts from psychedelic experiences -- like &quot;the
<br>
world will end in 2012&quot; (one of Terrence McKenna's favorites) is just
<br>
silly.  It's embarrassing.
<br>
<p>One of the peculiarities of the human mind on psychedelic drugs is a
<br>
breakdown of the distinction between symbol and signifier.  Specifics
<br>
are brought into play to represent generalities, and then the mind is so
<br>
screwed by the drug that it totally confuses the specifics with the
<br>
generalities.  For example (in McKenna's case), a deep and valid general
<br>
insight that human reality is bringing itself to an end is symbolized by
<br>
a specific idea that the end will occur in 2012 because that's when the
<br>
Mayan calendar ends -- and then the specific idea comes to take over the
<br>
role of the general insight (erroneously).  McKenna's thinking is full
<br>
of this kind of confusion between the symbol and the signified ... Which
<br>
is very reminiscent of the shamanic traditions that he so respected ...
<br>
And probably occurred because he took psychedelics pretty much every
<br>
day, rather than letting himself get back to &quot;consensus reality&quot; and
<br>
reintegrate his insights into a coherent mind-state and world-view...
