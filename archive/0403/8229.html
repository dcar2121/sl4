Hi Ben,   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's worth noting that a Luddite attitude underlies part of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pisses off bin Laden and crew. These guys hate modern technology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cultural and psychological changes it has caused. 
</em><br>
<p>I'd be supprised if an anti-*technology* orientation is what's at the core 
<br>
of fundamentalist Muslim concerns.  I think it's the cultural and 
<br>
psychological issues that are central.  
<br>
<p>But Islam (as with Christianity and Judaism and Hinduism etc. etc.) has 
<br>
many tendencies - many of which are moderate and modernist.  An 
<br>
interesting question is why the Fundamentalist versions appear to be 
<br>
gaining ascendency over the moderate or modernist versions.  In the 
<br>
case of the Middle East the heavy handedness of first British 
<br>
Imperialism (before the British Empire collapsed) and then the US (and 
<br>
to a lesser extent current European) interests must play a key part 
<br>
since most of the Middle Eastern regimes are quite undemocratic and 
<br>
hence moderate and modern views have less scope to develop.  But 
<br>
also oil and the non-democratic nature of the regimes has put very 
<br>
large amounts of money into the hands of some quite fundamentalist 
<br>
people enabling them to bank roll extremist hate-based schools in the 
<br>
region and in Pakistan etc. and terrorist networks. 
<br>
<p>In Australia some years ago we had a surge of support for an ultra-right 
<br>
Party that were attacking modernity and globalisation etc. and whose 
<br>
politics were dominated by disgruntlement and a chip on the shoulder.  
<br>
Fortunately this party has now had a collapse in support.  But the one 
<br>
good thing its rise accomplish was to make (at least some) people 
<br>
aware that if modernity rides roughshod over people then the people 
<br>
who are hurt will lash back.  It's not really a terribly startling insight but 
<br>
it is an important one.  If modernity is going to be seen as a blessing 
<br>
then the benefits need to be shared around universally.  We can't just 
<br>
work on averages - it how it affect each individual and community that 
<br>
matters.  
<br>
<p>This has central relevance to the singuarity.  If the singuarity is to be 
<br>
embraced and not fought bitterly then it will have to be managed so 
<br>
that the benefits are spread widely - in fact universally.  
<br>
<p>The real risk with the singularity is that it will be a very lop-side affair 
<br>
where humans and transhumans and AGIs etc. become cleverer and 
<br>
cleverer technically but fail to become cleverer and cleverer in terms of 
<br>
social competence.  I think this becomes a recipe for either vast conflict 
<br>
or for a control-based society that stops backlash by main force or 
<br>
manipulation.  
<br>
<p>I personally think that the singularity would have the greatest chance 
<br>
for a smooth ride if, on this side of the transition, we set out to make 
<br>
sure (as far as one can given the uncertainties of life) that the benefits 
<br>
of the change are directed substantially and sufficiently to making sure 
<br>
that the world is a better place for all people.  And to get things moving 
<br>
in that direction we have to start out with an attitude of understanding 
<br>
and sympathy for the vast majority of people.  And while acts of 
<br>
terrorism and brutality are not excusable at all, I think it is important 
<br>
that we understand how society throws up such people and behaviours.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there will be no BUSINESS AS USUAL in an environment of such rapid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change -- the concept of &quot;as usual&quot; doesn't apply!!  
</em><br>
<p>But this has been the case in bursts ever since the move from hunter 
<br>
gathering to agricutlure-supported urbanism - and it's certainly been the 
<br>
case since the industrial revolution.  These days 'business as usual' 
<br>
never stays the same for long because 'business as usual' includes 
<br>
technological and social invention and innovation as an endogenous 
<br>
element.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having minds that are able keep up with highly rapid change is NOT the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same as having minds that are adapted to stasis or slow change... 
</em><br>
<p>Human minds seem to be able to cope with BOTH highly rapid change 
<br>
and stasis or slow change.  It's been a characteristic that has emerged 
<br>
progressively over the last 2 million years (argued well in &quot;A Brain for 
<br>
All Seasons: Human Evolution and Abrupt Climate Change by William 
<br>
H. Calvin, 2003). The sofware side of people's brains (experience &amp; 
<br>
training) can lead to minds attuned to either rapid change OR 
<br>
stasis/slow change - but the hardware has potential to deal with both. 
<br>
My guess is that AGIs could be like this too depending on how they are 
<br>
trained and the goal structures they have.
<br>
<p>So it still seems plausible to me that if one's mind can keep up with the 
<br>
speed of the singularity that day-to-day business will still involve issues 
<br>
of what to change, how to adapt, what to retain, how to integrate the old 
<br>
and new, how to manage seen and unseen side effects of change.  
<br>
<p>I agree that we can't predict from this side of the singularity what the 
<br>
actual changes will be - but the dilemmas of managing change (at 
<br>
hyperspeed and accelerating) still seem to me to much the same?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for &quot;the system&quot;, I think he was referring to the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological/social/cultural/political/economic system, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely will NOT retain its current position of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-Singularity. 
</em><br>
<p>Sure - as it has not remained static over the last few centuries either.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that there will be *some* system, doesn't mean that it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same one.... 
</em><br>
<p>This point you are making IS the point I'm trying to make too.  While 
<br>
the 'system' might be different there is bound to be a 'system' of some 
<br>
sort.  So if a techno-libertarian seeks the singularity as a espace from 
<br>
the (any) 'system' they are likely to be sorely disappointed by the final 
<br>
result.  
<br>
<p>Furthermore since we can't tell at this point in time what the 
<br>
'system'/'system' will be like post-singularity will be it's a breathtaking 
<br>
leap of faith for an anti-system person to embrace the 'singularity' as an 
<br>
escape hatch to get away from 'systems'!  
<br>
<p>The funny thing about a lot of this discussion is that many people are 
<br>
attracted to technology because its a domain of fun and power where 
<br>
you can get away with not engaging with people (read that as advanced 
<br>
general intelligences).  But one of the critical outputs from this 
<br>
technological system will be (eventually) super-artificial general 
<br>
intelligences.  One of the things that these entities will be really good at 
<br>
(if they choose to turn their mind in this direction) is managing hugely 
<br>
complex nets of relationship.  Human societies are much more 
<br>
complex than other primate societies, I suspect, because we have the 
<br>
grey matter to manage a much more complex social system.  So my 
<br>
guess is that if the singularity is driven by more than one AGI then the 
<br>
future that emerges will be one of even *more* complex social 
<br>
systems.  So a person trying to escape the complexities of engagement 
<br>
and relationships by going into the singularity is going in precisely the 
<br>
wrong direction, unless they are hoping that that the new powers that 
<br>
be will allow them (uploaded or not) to live a life of a disengaged 
<br>
recluse on the preifery of the new society.   
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
