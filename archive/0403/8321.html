<p>The problem is that win or lose war was adaptive for your genes when we 
<br>
lived as hunter-gatherers.  Thus we have evolved psychological mechanisms 
<br>
that lead to tribes (or nations) going to war based on economic 
<br>
issues--currently income per capita though the origin of the mechanism was 
<br>
game and berries.
<br>
<p>Humans who are not facing looming privation/starvation don't start wars, 
<br>
though they can still be attacked by those with the root cause.
<br>
<p>The economic connection to wars is *very old* information.  But it is the 
<br>
first time I know about that the evolutionary psychology origin of wars has 
<br>
been understood.  It leads to obvious solutions, but they are slow to take 
<br>
effect.
<br>
<p>Here's a question for you.  If the population simply *had* to be cut way 
<br>
back (say due to an ice age starting) would war or disease be the better 
<br>
choice?
