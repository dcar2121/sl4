<p><p>You made a point for my position.  XML is a &quot;data language&quot;.  
<br>
Attempting to build a general purpose language on top of it is an 
<br>
attempt to make it what it was never intended to be.  A language is 
<br>
trivially an arrangement of data but not in any very interesting way.  
<br>
The types of graphs of inter-relationships in computer programs do not 
<br>
lend themselves well to the basically hierarchical nature of XML.   
<br>
Real computer languages are much richer than that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  An XML-based programming language,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Lisp did not &quot;fall off the map&quot;.  It is still a quite good language and 
<br>
has the advantage of already being well-developed with working 
<br>
optimizing compilers.  Any new language has quite a curve of 
<br>
development before it can come close to what lisp offered over a decade 
<br>
(some would say two decades) ago.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     Someone once said that the level of civilization is determined by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; HUGE
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, it will not.  It will be an abomination if it every gets off the 
<br>
ground.
