<p>
I'm glad to see that Sing Inst finally has an
<br>
executive director.  Good luck!
<br>
<p>Some thoughts on the future:  If you're commited to
<br>
the task of Creating FAI, you need to realize that
<br>
you're in it for the long haul.  Utopian visions of a
<br>
Singularity in only 5-20 years are almost certainly
<br>
fantasy (although I'd love to be proved wrong). 
<br>
People at the forefront of research are almost always
<br>
far too over optimistic about how long it would take
<br>
to achieve major breakthroughs.  Fundamental knowledge
<br>
about general intelligence is still missing. It is
<br>
estimated that only about 2% of everything there is to
<br>
know about cognitive science is known.  Even with
<br>
exponential progress, 100% knowledge wouldn't be
<br>
reached for another 40-50 years.
<br>
<p>The first design and coding effort of a major AGI is
<br>
not likely to succeed.  Although it will be progress,
<br>
and lessons will be learned.  The second generation
<br>
effort won't succeed either, although again it will
<br>
advance the field.  The third generation effort...
<br>
might be closing on it.  And the fourth generation
<br>
effort... that's the one that will get there ;)
<br>
<p>I would say that a 40-60 time frame for success is
<br>
realistic.  That's what I would call 'Singularity
<br>
Realism'.  You have to be in it for the long haul.
<br>
<p>Once success starts to look even remotely likely, you
<br>
will come to the attention of the government and the
<br>
public in a big way.  You run the risk of regulators
<br>
coming down on you.  
<br>
<p>If Sing Inst is going to have an actual physical
<br>
location at some point, I would recommend moving to a
<br>
Libertarian oriented State, where you will be
<br>
surrounded with allies.  Consider especially the state
<br>
of New Hampshire, where transhumanists and
<br>
Libertarians are gathering to form a revolutionary
<br>
base. There would be strength in numbers there. 
<br>
Isolated as we are now we're sitting ducks.
<br>
<p>I also wonder just how much Information on AGI should
<br>
be shared with the general public whilst the projects
<br>
are going on?  I see that Ben is publishing quite a
<br>
lot about his project, and Eliezer has publically 
<br>
published quite a lot as well.  Be aware that anyone
<br>
with net access can read all that.  Dictators in China
<br>
and North Korea, the odd pychopath... is it wise to
<br>
provide too much information about how to create AGI? 
<br>
On the one hand, sharing can advance research, on the
<br>
other, the risk of someone creating Unfriendly A.I is
<br>
increased.  And of course, shorter term A.I results
<br>
could have substantial proprietary value.
<br>
<p>To tell you the truth, I was slightly uneasy even
<br>
posting those few very general ideas to sl4 you see in
<br>
my last couple of posts.  
<br>
<p>Most of the people working in A.I probably visit sl4
<br>
and copy everything down.  They're probably ripping
<br>
off all our ideas without a second thought. 
<br>
<p>The marketing side of it needs to be a lot more
<br>
careful as well.  Some things (like the Sys Op idea)
<br>
will just cause people to go ballistic.  Other things,
<br>
like wild speculation about life after the
<br>
Singularity, will just cause people to dismiss it all
<br>
as sci-fi fantasy.  I would never have talked about
<br>
the Singularity at all.  And for God's sake don't talk
<br>
about life after the Singularity!  Most people just
<br>
don't believe a word of this stuff.  There is too much
<br>
hype and far too many 'slip ups' on the marketing
<br>
side.  And the few non-scientifc people in the general
<br>
population who do believe this stuff are scared
<br>
shitless by it.  AI will upset religious and social
<br>
norms.  
<br>
<p>All of this may sound a bit paranoid, but really Sing
<br>
Inst needs to start thinking about these things.  It's
<br>
just 'Singularity Realism'.  
<br>
<p>Cheers!
