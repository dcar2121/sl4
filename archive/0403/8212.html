<p>Well, for an analogy to the Manhattan project to hold would require 
<br>
that the government is  at least as clear on what is achievable and the 
<br>
likely way to get there as we were on producing an atomic bomb.   I am 
<br>
not at all sure that this is the case.  Do you believe this much 
<br>
clarity exists?  If it does not then similar levels of resource and 
<br>
effort focus would not necessarily be successful.   It is possible but 
<br>
I doubt it qualifies as &quot;quite possible&quot; yet.   But you are closer (to 
<br>
say the least) to the state of general understanding and focus on AGI.
<br>
<p>I believe that that level of funding of some of the existing projects 
<br>
that do have a pretty good idea of what they are about could succeed in 
<br>
that timeframe.  But I don't believe that government involvement would 
<br>
result in the resources going to such groups at this time.
