[ I suggest we put [SL4] in the subject, makes it
<br>
easier to spot posts from spam ]
<br>
<p><p>If Friendly AI tries to physically create a version of
<br>
morality, then it must address complex political issues.
<br>
The Singularity (in the form of a superintelligence) has to
<br>
resolve these issues. Theories such as &quot;joyous growth&quot;, or
<br>
&quot;positive qualia&quot;, do not seem to be able to resolve these
<br>
issues at all. Therefore it is morally IRRESPONSIBLE to
<br>
claim that the Singularity will sort everything out *without*
<br>
giving the details of how that can be achieved. This is a
<br>
lie and is worse than saying nothing, which is bad enough
<br>
already. Even as I type, people are getting killed in
<br>
various wars and it seems that no one is really applying
<br>
a scientific view to analyse the conflicts.
<br>
<p>[ But I also want to point out that I'm not being unfriendly
<br>
to proponents of the above theories and indeed I highly
<br>
esteem their expertise in their fields].
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From an abstract perspective, I think the central question
</em><br>
is between evolutionary theory and the doctrine that all
<br>
human beings are equal. Evolution implies that 'unfit'
<br>
individuals are displaced by fitter ones, sometimes whole
<br>
species may go extinct. On the other hand much of the
<br>
commonsense view of morality is based on equality and
<br>
reciprocity. The idea that all humans are equal is
<br>
problematic because it cannot be extended to other life-
<br>
-forms such as primates. So one of the first ('politically
<br>
incorrect') things we must admit is that inequality exists.
<br>
<p>Secondly let's look at some historical facts. I think it's
<br>
important to look at some facts squarely despite that they
<br>
may be very unpleasant.
<br>
<p>1. European ancestors invaded Islam/Arab during the
<br>
Crusades. Some of the territories converted to Christianity
<br>
were later 'recovered' but I'm not aware of any reverse
<br>
invasion of Europe by Islam/Arabs on a similar scale.
<br>
This is asymmetrical.
<br>
<p>2. The modern Israel state is founded by Jewish people who
<br>
(at least some of them) are genetically quite closely
<br>
related to Palestinian Arabs. The point is, if they have
<br>
descended from the same (or similar) ancestral population,
<br>
then both of them should have some claim to the territory
<br>
based on ancestry.
<br>
<p>3. In Gulf War I &amp; II, Saddam Hussein was depicted as the
<br>
villian because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and of their
<br>
genocide of Kurds. But hundreds of years ago Europeans
<br>
basically did the same to the original populations in
<br>
America. The point: If my dad robbed a bank and died
<br>
afterwards, am I entitled to the wealth he left over?
<br>
<p>If the strong is entitled to rob the weak of their
<br>
possesions/territory, then why does this NOT happen
<br>
*within* civil society?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, local patterns of morality do not
<br>
seem to hold in the evolutionary picture where humans
<br>
exploit other animals and there doesn't seem to be any
<br>
retributions (negative effects) from it.
<br>
<p>I don't know the answer. What is the pattern that is
<br>
emerging in this? I think analyzing this is much more
<br>
important than speculating on the distant future, even
<br>
if you may be quite sure you'll be among the 'survivors'.
<br>
