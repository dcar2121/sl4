Paul,

&quot;I'm seeing the same mistake here, and I don't think I should apologize for
<br>
pointing it out.&quot;
<br>
<p>--- Apologize?  Oh, absolutely not!  Nothing to be sorry about, just
<br>
throwing around ideas :)  We are both seeing the other's POV and thinking
<br>
&quot;that is not quite right&quot;.  At this point we need more data... and building
<br>
and experimenting with other minds appears to me to be an excellent way of
<br>
obtaining more data.
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
&quot;To me it seems that people in the reductionist camp refuse to acknowledge
<br>
that the hard problem even exists, and continue to place the problem within
<br>
the domain of the easy problem.&quot;
<br>
<p>--- Indeed, I think this is true.  I have no ego-based stake in either
<br>
camp... I would just like to know the correct answers to *both* questions.
<br>
Perhaps, as has often been the case, the correct answers contain elements of
<br>
both POVs.  I look forward to the &quot;resolution&quot; of the debate in the coming
<br>
years ;^)
<br>
<p>Agreeing to disagree in spades...
