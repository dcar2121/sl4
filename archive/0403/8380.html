<p>
Paul,
<br>
<p>Your reply does not address the issue.  It is all very well to suggest
<br>
reading Chalmers, but if one doesn't buy his view of &quot;conscious experience
<br>
as an entity&quot; then it does not forward the discussion.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that Chalmers and those who follow in the same line of
<br>
thinking have changed the definition of 'the hard problem' into a something
<br>
else, perhaps in order to preserve the 'mystery' of the self.  Those that
<br>
hold to the reductionist viewpoint (me included) consider such a change in
<br>
definition to be unhelpful.  Chalmer's ideas are interesting, but they seem
<br>
to ask and answer a different question.  Can you see how the question is
<br>
different?  And can you tell us why the change is needed?
<br>
<p>Yours in friendship,
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames

<p><em>&gt; The core of the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness is

<p>Actually this is mistaken.  This is not the assumption
<br>
of the hard problem, as those who think about it know
<br>
that the &quot;self&quot; is mutable and transcendable.  The
<br>
so-called &quot;ego&quot; is a fiction, entirely the fabrication
<br>
of arbitrary neural imprints.  Anyone who has done a
<br>
sufficient amount of psychedelics also knows of the
<br>
fragility, the illusion of a coherent &quot;self&quot;.  This
<br>
mutability, IS part of the easy problem of
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>IMHO, this continues to be your mistake.  All manner
<br>
of brain change, describing the function and innner
<br>
perception of experience falls under this easy
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>The hard problem is why is their an inner experience
<br>
at all.  For some this is obvious, for those that it
<br>
is not, I suggest reading Chalmers (again if
<br>
necessary) to really understand what the hard problem
<br>
is.
