<em>&gt; I've read that paper, but my question is different from the one he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addresses.  Bostrom focuses on the possibility that we're living in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancester-simulation run by posthumans. This doesn't really apply to an SI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who I think would be much more interested in the possibility that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living in a universe simulation running in a computationally much richer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; base reality.
</em><br>
<p>The SI might consider this possibility from more than one perspective. From
<br>
its own perspective as an intelligent entity, the SI would want to know the
<br>
truth about reality, whatever that might be. But the SI might also run some
<br>
simulations of its own, in order to understand why a simulation of the type
<br>
it could be existing within, might have been constructed in the first place.
<br>
By trying to consider the motivations of its purported simulation creators,
<br>
the SI might find that a simulation is a useful way of trying out various
<br>
alternatives (including the parameters of the simulation itself, as well as
<br>
the strategies developed and employed by the simulated beings within it).
<br>
<em>&gt;From this, the SI might conclude that if it is living in a simulation, and
</em><br>
if that simulation is not hellish, the motivations of the purported
<br>
simulation creators are benign and should be respected. Thus, without ever
<br>
having determined conclusively that it is in fact living in a simulation,
<br>
the SI would continue doing whatever it deems essential, enjoyable or
<br>
interesting, confident that the results it obtains may be useful to those
<br>
who created the simulation.
