complexity for time complexity, but not the other way around.
<br>
<p>I think the brain storage mechanism is far more efficient in an 
<br>
information theoretic sense than I think a lot of people think it is.  
<br>
I'm actually working on a short paper on this (for the website), 
<br>
because I've done a lot of really interesting tangential work on data 
<br>
compression related to the AGI work I do.  In short, it is possible to 
<br>
do lossless, random-access, high-compression information representation 
<br>
in an algorithmic structure that looks very similar to neural 
<br>
structures.
<br>
<p>What is even more interesting, and what I actually am working on 
<br>
writing up, is that if you modulate the encoding process on the 
<br>
front-end with a simple &quot;transition detection&quot; signaling mechanism 
<br>
(e.g. edge detection), I can get effective compression ratios that on 
<br>
average exceed the best compression algorithms out there.  Perhaps 
<br>
ironically, it isn't terribly useful for many generic data compression 
<br>
applications because most hardware storage mediums are purely 
<br>
sequential access beasts, and sequential or semi-sequential compression 
<br>
algorithms are much better suited for such things.
<br>
<p>But generally, I think that our noggins encode far more information 
<br>
than a casual analysis of bits suggests.  The &quot;bits&quot; should be bits in 
<br>
more of a Kolmogorov complexity sense than the naive sequential storage 
<br>
format sense, and there is a very large chasm between the two in 
<br>
effective capacity.  Filtering out low-value bits (i.e. making it 
<br>
lossy) greatly extends to the useful storage range even further.
