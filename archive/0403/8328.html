A nice essay there Paul, you seem to know quite a bit about the history of 
<br>
the universe and our galaxy specifically.  If your numbers are accurate and 
<br>
that technological progress was setback by things like ecological disasters 
<br>
during the pre-cambrian era than perhaps a technolocgical singularity, as 
<br>
you define it as the advent of technology, could have indeed happened in the 
<br>
time frame you provide.
<br>
<p>&quot;With the Cambrian Explosion soon after, all the major
<br>
<em>&gt;phyla of life we see today emerged on to the scene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Between the Cambrian explosion and today, there have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been 5 great extinctions, the last of which was 65
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million years ago, when 90% life including all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dinosaurs were wiped out by a comet. From this lowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10% that was left emerged almost all the complex life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we see today.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is assuming that again the 10% figure is right and that there weren't 
<br>
other forms of subspecies that we have yet to uncover that survived, 
<br>
paleontolgy like all science, does not assume 100% knoweldge and or 
<br>
understanding of all species of animals that were roaming the earth at that 
<br>
time, can you speak for even more adaptive species that could have feasibly 
<br>
avoided such disaster?    In fact your guess is as good as mine since fossil 
<br>
records are still scarce from that pivitol period.
<br>
<p>&quot;Since we know both the earth and sun are each 4.5
<br>
<em>&gt;billion years old, the earliest possible earth like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planets could have appeared as early as 1 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years after the big bang.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Just because our planet is 4.5 billion years old as no correlation with the 
<br>
births of other earlier planets and stars &quot;couldve' is a conjecture based 
<br>
upon merely the known age of our galaxy...what about othrer big bangs 
<br>
occuring and other times previous to our big bang?
<br>
<p>I think most of this period’s stagnation was the
<br>
<em>&gt;result of  bad luck.  Perhaps the correct mutations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary for the emergence of multi-cellular life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply have a very low probability of occurring.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that quadrillions of bacteria were spread out all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the earth, and only after 3.4 billion years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random mutations and conditions eventually gave rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the first multi-cellular organisms.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this,,, as evolution itself is mostly due to probabiltiies and 
<br>
the slow process of evolution which has to do with  'luck' who knows how 
<br>
many years this could've taken had slight eco conditions have been 
<br>
different?  The rare earth hypothesis seem to be in keeping with your line 
<br>
of thinking...being how could such random mutation have occurred in the 
<br>
first place or we the exception to the rule?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Since we know that the first planets were forming as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early as 12.7 billion years ago, and using earth’s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history as our example, this means that the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological singularity could have occurred as early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as 10.7 billion years ago, or 3 billion years after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Big Bang.   If we take out my conjectured time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compression of evolution, we add an additional 2.5
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years, then we get 5.5 billion years after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big bang, or 8.2 billion years ago.
</em><br>
<p>I see what your saying...but fail to grasp your computations...why 10.7 
<br>
billion?  if the big bang as you say happened 12.7 plus 3 billion totaling 
<br>
in 15.7 billion years ago that would make your conjecture of the  tech 
<br>
singularity by your calculations to be 12.7 billion years ago. taking out 
<br>
your compression this would make it 7.2 billion years ago that a potential 
<br>
technological singularity could have occured.
<br>
<p>But what do you mean by a singularity in terms of technology?  Do you mean 
<br>
the advent of such basic hunter gatherer tools created by homo-sapiens or 
<br>
rather whatever came before Sapiens?  Or are you referring to some explosion 
<br>
in technolgoy that feasibly could have happened had things gone differently?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When is the earliest possible time in our universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a technological singularity could have occurred?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let’s examine the evidence and make some conjectures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In order to determine the theoretical earliest time we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to know what the necessary precursors are for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological singularity is.  Since the Earth and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emergence of our own civilization is the only example
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we have, we’ll assume that life and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological civilization requires a planet as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary prerequisite for a technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So when were the first planets formed? Since planets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;require heavy elements, the earliest possible time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would’ve been after the supernova explosion of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first-generation star. The first generation of stars
</em><br>
<em>&gt;started forming approximately 160 million years after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Big Bang. The most short-lived of these stars were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the blue giants.  All first generation stars were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;composed entirely of hydrogen and helium and no heavy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elements.  Thanks to nucleosynthesis in the cores of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these stars, all the heavier elements through Uranium
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were first created during this time. After the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of these blue stars exploded, all it’s material
</em><br>
<em>&gt;including the heavy metals, formed the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions for birthing stars with proto-planetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to this story,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/science/space/10CND-PLAN.html?ex=1080277200&amp;en=01f45dab7c7c1289&amp;ei=5070">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/science/space/10CND-PLAN.html?ex=1080277200&amp;en=01f45dab7c7c1289&amp;ei=5070</a>=</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope found tantalizing evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that planets first appeared much earlier in cosmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history, around 12.7 billion years ago, and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may be more abundant than previously suspected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since we know both the earth and sun are each 4.5
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years old, the earliest possible earth like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planets could have appeared as early as 1 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years after the big bang.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So from here we look at Earth’s history to ascertain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our final figure.  This is where a bit of guesswork is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For now, lets examine the historical record of life on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our planet. There is now observational evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;archaebacteria, the first type of life, were around as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early as 3.97 billion years ago.  For the next 2.2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years life on Earth consisted of nothing more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anaerobic bacteria and archaeans.  Then about 1.8
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years ago eukaryotic cells appeared as fossils
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too.  With the beginning of the Middle Proterozoic 1.8
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years ago, comes the first evidence of oxygen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;build-up in the atmosphere. This global catastrophe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spelled doom for many bacterial groups, but made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible the explosion of eukaryotic forms. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;include multicellular algae, and toward the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Proterozoic, the first animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With the Cambrian Explosion soon after, all the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phyla of life we see today emerged on to the scene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Between the Cambrian explosion and today, there have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been 5 great extinctions, the last of which was 65
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million years ago, when 90% life including all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dinosaurs were wiped out by a comet. From this lowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10% that was left emerged almost all the complex life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we see today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So the real question now is could this 3.97 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year history of life have evolved quicker?  We know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the first 2.2 billion years of life consisted of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing more than simple anaerobic bacteria and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;archae, and the next 1.2 billion years single-celled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eukaryotic oxygen-breathing bacteria.  So for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first 3.4 billion years the degree of evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change was almost non-existent. There is no reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspect the emergence of eukaryotic cells couldn’t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have happened sooner, perhaps as earlier as a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million years after the first bacteria.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanisms underlying these punctuated periods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution are still largely unknown, so it’s mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conjecture.  But lets take a crack at it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think most of this period’s stagnation was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result bad luck.  Perhaps the correct mutations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary for the emergence of multi-cellular life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply have a very low probability of occurring.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that quadrillions of bacteria were spread out all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the earth, and only after 3.4 billion years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random mutations and conditions eventually gave rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the first multi-cellular organisms.  If the result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is largely by chance, then life multi-cellular life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could have occurred shortly after life first appeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all.  Then again, mutli-cellular life could be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rare, that only 1 out of a million bacteria bearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planets gives rise to multi-cellular life during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lifetime of its parent star.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It’s quite possible that multi-cellular organisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could have emerged as early as 3 billion years ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;giving rise to the equivalent of the Cambrian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explosion 2.5 billion years earlier than it did.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leaves the last 543 million years after the Cambrian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Explosion until now.  Perhaps if we had a larger gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;giant in a orbit closer than Jupiter’s, there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have also been less asteroid and cometary impacts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during this period, further accelerating the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinds of conditions for life to occur.   In the scheme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of things, this time frame is small enough that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won’t compress it any further for the sake of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essay, and assume that 500 million years is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimum time necessary for complex technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilization to evolve from the first appearance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multi-cellular life forms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So assuming my 2.5 billion year compression of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history of life is possible in a planetary system with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the right conditions, this means technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilization on the Earth could have occurred as early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as 2 billion years after the formation of Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since we know that the first planets were forming as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early as 12.7 billion years ago, and using earth’s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history as our example, this means that the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological singularity could have occurred as early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as 10.7 billion years ago, or 3 billion years after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Big Bang.   If we take out my conjectured time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compression of evolution, we add an additional 2.5
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years, then we get 5.5 billion years after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big bang, or 8.2 billion years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This leaves us with a theoretical minimum of 8.2 –
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10.7 billion years ago when the first technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singularity could have occurred.
