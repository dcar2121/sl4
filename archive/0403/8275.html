Ah good.  I think we're getting somewhere . . . .
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Write me a function that returns a function in XML alone (no external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code allowed).   For that matter, write me a function that does any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation at all in XML alone.    This is why I find this discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so amazingly strange.
</em><br>
<p>Clearly this can't be done.  XML is a data-definition language.  I'm not
<br>
making XML a programming language.  I'm making a programming language which
<br>
is XML-compliant.  My point is that if you make a language XML-compliant
<br>
there is a large set of standards, tools, thought, infrastructure, and
<br>
excitement that you could benefit from.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is an argument that a language that can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encapsulate data is somehow better than real programming languages.
</em><br>
<p>No, it's an argument that a language that causes programmers to think of a
<br>
program as data as well as program is better than a language that, ALL OTHER
<br>
THINGS BEING EQUAL, doesn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is an argument stuck at the level of language syntax.  If you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to write the text of programs in XML I will think you rather strange.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Most people do . . . .  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But please do not confuse text with actual functionality or utility or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressive power.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm not making that confusion.  What I'm saying is that if you take ANY
<br>
language and make it's syntax XML-compliant, there a benefits that you will
<br>
reap.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;= = = = =
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Lisp is as efficient in its compiled form as C with a bit of care.   It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is quite scalable.  To argue that it is not would be effectively to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that no languages are scalable as every other language can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed in Lisp.   That is rather a lot of power.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The compiled code of ANY compiled programming language is as efficient as
<br>
any other if it is used with a bit/a lot of care, compiled well, AND if it
<br>
uses the same algorithms.  There is, however, a huge difference between
<br>
compiled code and functions that are declared at run-time unless your
<br>
environment takes the time out from execution to compile those.  Further,
<br>
there is a huge difference in the speed and scalability of data access and
<br>
lookup methods.  LISP innately causes the programmer to look at everything
<br>
as a list.  Would you rather look-up your first name in an ordered list of
<br>
names or in a balanced b-tree?  Yes, the balanced b-tree could be expressed
<br>
LOGICALLY in list form but the tree-balancing operations required during
<br>
addition and deletion would not be as optimized (scalable) as with a raw,
<br>
specially designed data structure.  The problem that I have with virtually
<br>
every LISP environment is the same problem that I have with most other
<br>
programming environments.  It tries to - - nay, insists that it - - do
<br>
EVERYTHING, including things that it isn't good at.
<br>
<p>= = = = =
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Clearly, a lot of our disagreement is because you're just envisioning the
<br>
raw XML spec and I'm envisioning my dream language and environment that,
<br>
among other things, happens to be both XML-compliant and capable of some of
<br>
the things it is capable of BECAUSE it is XML-compliant.  Most of these
<br>
additional things are not due to XML itself, in particular, as much as what
<br>
can be leveraged from developing a new language to exploit the social
<br>
environment surrounding XML.  The answer to your question
<br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, I know you could write XML that looked sort of like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the syntactic structure of functional programs.  But so what?
</em><br>
is that I believe that it could lead to a pretty open environment where
<br>
program pieces are modular and swappable and where program design could be
<br>
machine-assisted and eventually fully automated.  The .NET framework has
<br>
created an environment where programs written in different languages are
<br>
more modular and swappable but there's a lot further to go.  Regarding
<br>
programs as data - - with a wider variety of data structures/operations to
<br>
allow for more efficient, scalable operations than the current single
<br>
data-structure/method data languages like LISP, PROLOG, etc. - - will open
<br>
the door for all sorts of things.  I'm not saying that XML is the best, I'm
<br>
saying that I think that the most probable path to where I'd like to get to
<br>
is through XML.
