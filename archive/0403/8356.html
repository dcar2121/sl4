<p>There's a very serious error, based on an assumption in Descartes 
<br>
thinking, and it's promulgated widely even today.  It assumes the 
<br>
existence of some sort of coherent Self making the observation. 
<br>
Actually, the only valid deduction to be made is that *something* exists.
<br>
<p>This error goes right to the heart of the so-called &quot;hard problem&quot; of 
<br>
consciousness and the confusion over the meaning of qualia, all based on 
<br>
the assumption of some kind of supervisory self that exists in relation 
<br>
to the observed world.
