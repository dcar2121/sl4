<em>&gt;Based on some readings I've done recently I've come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acress a new context to understand the singulairty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think it can be stated without much argument that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the history of our universe has been a continuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ingression of intelligence into matter.
</em><br>
<p>To date, and as far as we know, this process has been centered on a certain 
<br>
small planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From lesser
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexity to greater complexity.  If this is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apparent, then I suggest reading either Stephen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wolfram’s or Stuart Kaufmann’s work.
</em><br>
<p>Robert Wright's Non-Zero supports this view as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even though this acceleration of intelligence seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continuous there is at least a few punctuated periods
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of more rapid acceleration.  I think the singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represents a punctuated rupture with at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical precedent - the birth of language, the jump
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from genetic to epi-genetic information transfer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Until Modern Humans emerged on the scene, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution was happening via DNA information transfer ­
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a very slow glacial process of evolution.  At some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point in Homo sapiens evolution we developed symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation ability.
</em><br>
<p>Well, at least at some point along the line of evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here is some snippits about the Singularity (a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long but interesting) from Mark Pesce, inventor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;VRML.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;~~~
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The thing that separates us from the Neanderthal isn’t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain size, or brute strength, but a symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation capability.
</em><br>
<p>This may be true, but I don't think you can prove it.  Oh well, not long 
<br>
from now we will have the ability to either analyze Neanderthal DNA with 
<br>
computers that can simulate embryogenesis, or we will just construct some 
<br>
and see how good they are at symbolic manipulation.  (It isn't a good idea 
<br>
to take a hard line on something that can be subjected to actual 
<br>
investigation.)
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We assume that we are masters of language, of word and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The situation is exactly reversed. We are not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control of words, they control us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins got it entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right when he invented the concept of “memes,” which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be thought of as the linguistic equivalent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genes.
</em><br>
<p>This is not exactly on target.  Memes are best seen as elements of 
<br>
culture.  Culture, the meme pool, has an analogy to the gene pool of a 
<br>
species.  Linguistics operates on a slightly different level, coding 
<br>
memes.  (It would be hard to make a case that the meme for a pot or a shoe 
<br>
is different just because the people cooking in pots or wearing shoes spoke 
<br>
a different language.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Rather than being part of the bios, memes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the carriers of the logos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OK, so we’ve covered the emergence of the bios, some 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years ago, and the emergence of the logos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps as much as 150 thousand years ago.
</em><br>
<p>Even chimps have a certain degree of culture that varies from place to 
<br>
place.  It is hard to say just exactly when people became critically 
<br>
dependant on culture.  It could have been carrying unworked stones to drive 
<br>
off major predators.  If you decide worked stone to be the boundary, then 
<br>
we are talking about 2.6 million years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We, as a species, have been driven by memes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last hundred thousand years, and this has forced us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further and further away from any direct connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the natural world.
</em><br>
<p>Until we can live on electric power, this is a bit overstated.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So we have three waves, biological, linguistic, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological, which are rapidly moving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concrescence, and on their way, as they interact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce such a tsunami of novelty as has never before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been experienced in the history of this planet.
</em><br>
<p>The real question is &quot;does anything interesting survive&quot;?  (Where entities 
<br>
able to tame wild galaxies are &quot;interesting.&quot;)
<br>
<p>*If* technophilic life is common then the answer is *no.*  Our chances are 
<br>
really rotten if the last 10 or 100 million species to reach this state 
<br>
were eaten by gray goo or unfriendly AIs.  If species that reach our stage 
<br>
are so rare that there are none in our light cone, then the future is 
<br>
unknown.  Scary perhaps, but not a death sentence.
