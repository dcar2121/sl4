<p>I disagree at least in part.  I think the &quot;average Muslim 
<br>
fundamentalist&quot;  would be most happy if we would leave their countries 
<br>
alone or at least not continue our history of supporting major 
<br>
oppression and overthrows of their societies.   I think it is rather 
<br>
disingenuous for us to only look at what appears to be unreasoning 
<br>
hatred and ignore the many reasons people in this part of the world 
<br>
might have for hating the US.   Hint, it is not simply because they are 
<br>
&quot;luddites&quot; or fundamentalist.   Millions of very modernized 
<br>
non-fundamentalists in the area also have more than a little anger 
<br>
toward the US and with good reason.  It is very important and a real 
<br>
part of rationality to understand how our (or our government's) actions 
<br>
have directly contributed to and inflamed the violence and terrorism we 
<br>
deplore.   It is crucial we understand this if we really want to cure 
<br>
the problem.  If we do not then it is too easy to fall into the trap of 
<br>
believing we should just kill them as long as they attack or even hate 
<br>
us.   This is not the way to any future I think we really want.
<br>
<p>Also, we do need to consider how we will allow for (live and let live) 
<br>
those people who want no real part of a high-tech future, much less a 
<br>
Singularity if our compassion or &quot;Friendliness&quot; is going to mean much.
<br>
<p>Our government has done the people of the Middle East a great deal of 
<br>
harm and continues to do so.   As a responsible citizen some of the 
<br>
blame for those actions does fall on you and I.  Some in the US blamed 
<br>
the Iraqi people for not rising up and overthrowing Saddam.  Yet the 
<br>
same folks don't seem to understand why people elsewhere might blame 
<br>
them for the actions of a government we supposedly voluntarily have 
<br>
chosen and support monetarily and otherwise.
