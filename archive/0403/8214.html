<em>&gt; Creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a new workable language and proving its viability is hard.   I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe FLARE ever gained enough momentum to achieve this.   I for one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw nothing terribly compelling or necessary about the language.   It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not some huge boon to AI programming in general.  IMHO, it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needless distraction.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree.  XML is now pretty much THE premiere data language with a
<br>
lot of programming infrastructure, utilities, and, very importantly,
<br>
standards already created to support it.  An XML-based programming language,
<br>
which allows programs to be EASILY treated as data and which would build on
<br>
all of the XML infrastructure already in place, would be a HUGE boon to
<br>
programs that look to analyze and improve their own programming.  AI lost a
<br>
lot when LISP, etc. pretty much fell off of the map.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone once said that the level of civilization is determined by what
<br>
you can do without thinking (i.e. the level of infrastructure and common
<br>
standards).  A well-accepted XML-based programming language will be a HUGE
<br>
increase to the existing infrastructure.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M$ will eventually fill the gap with their proposed X# programming
<br>
language unless someone else beats them to the punch (but I consider that
<br>
HIGHLY unlikely at this point unless FLARE is still alive as a stealth
<br>
project and near release).  I, personally, am looking forward to the day
<br>
with great anticipation and dread.
<br>
