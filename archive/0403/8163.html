<em>&gt; &gt;Of course, if I speak from my gut, I must admit don't even think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would take a Manhattan Project style effort.  I think I could get
</em><br>
there
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in 2-3 years with an investment of $20 million for staff and
</em><br>
hardware.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can make a strong case I think it could be funded without much
</em><br>
of a
<br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<p>Keith, I am curious what funding sources you're thinking of.  
<br>
<p>The major science and technology funding bodies in the US are very
<br>
tightly tied into the &quot;narrow AI&quot; research programme and very skeptical
<br>
of radical approaches to AGI.  This is in spite of the fact that they've
<br>
spent hundreds of millions of dollars on narrow AI programs (Cyc being
<br>
the flagship example ;-) without obtaining dramatic returns either
<br>
scientifically or economically.
<br>
<p>So, if by a &quot;strong case&quot; you mean a case that will convince AGI
<br>
skeptics such as the folks at the National Science Foundation -- I guess
<br>
this essentially means &quot;something like young-child-level human
<br>
intelligence has been achieved and what remains is teaching of the
<br>
system and refinement of the algorithms.&quot;  I have no doubt that once we
<br>
get to this point, ample funding will be available.  Also, by this
<br>
point, the political issues associated with AGI will become important --
<br>
the Luddites will start paying attention....
<br>
<p>The problem is doing the work to get our AGI design (Novamente)
<br>
implemented and tested and tuned to the point of skeptic-convincing,
<br>
young-child-level human intelligence.  Getting the funding for this work
<br>
is the problem.  
<br>
<p>Fortunately, the Novamente project *is* funded; however, the funding is
<br>
for commercial applications of the partially-complete codebase, which
<br>
allows us to do some fascinating and important application work, and to
<br>
push the AGI project along slowly, but not to proceed rapidly toward AGI
<br>
in the way that we would attempt if we had pure AGI research funding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I don't think anyone right now has a clear idea of what it would
</em><br>
take
<br>
<em>&gt; to build an AI by other means than a simulation of a human brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me and send pointers if someone *does* know.)
</em><br>
<p>Obviously, I think I do have a clear idea in this regard.  However, our
<br>
AI design has not been published or presented on the Internet.  We plan
<br>
to publish a lot of material on Novamente sometime in the not too
<br>
distant future, probably early 2005 it looks like.  Writing up stuff
<br>
like this in a quality way is time-consuming, and time spent writing
<br>
needs to be balanced against time spent doing.
<br>
