<p>
It seems that morality means different things to different people.
<br>
So, for a moment, I invite you to stop thinking about morality with all its
<br>
cultural and semantic burden and just think about reality without words.
<br>
<p>Pick your favourite victim.
<br>
Take North Korean prisoners. Their guilt by association system has thrown in
<br>
labor camps entire families, people come out at age 20 and reveal having
<br>
spent their entire childhood in a labor camp treated like trash, seeing
<br>
their relatives beaten to death.
<br>
<p>Now, tell me what is the REAL reason why this shouldn't happen.
<br>
Is it because it is a system that won't be accepted?
<br>
Is it because it limits growth of patterns in the universe?
<br>
If not why is it?
<br>
<p>I think there can be personal differences at this stage. The fact that the
<br>
average human confronted with senseless cruelty has an empathic response and
<br>
usually raises objections does not vary greatly (although there are some
<br>
very relevant exceptions). But, the shape this empathic response takes, and
<br>
the way it is rationalized, these vary greatly.
<br>
<p>To me in the most direct sense being empathic means putting myself in
<br>
others' shoes.
<br>
It means I can simulate, though not precisely, what people in these
<br>
miserable conditions are feeling. I can say qualia stream because that is
<br>
the way I have learned to dissociate the material events in the brain and
<br>
the actual first person perspective, but let's let go of these things for a
<br>
second. The reason labor camps are not fair, is because the way it feels to
<br>
be in labor camps is self-explanatorily evil. There is no need to justify
<br>
this and whoever wants to argue can try to go to a labor camp. Now, if the
<br>
people in labor camps didn't +feel+ anything, who would care? Cut them into
<br>
pieces, burn them alive, do whatever! They feel nothing! You could never
<br>
been in their shoes because there is nobody in their shoes. But if there is
<br>
an equivalent to &lt;self&gt; instanced in those people, then labor camps are
<br>
evil.
<br>
<p>So my particular response to conditions of agony is
<br>
<p>1. simulation of the other's first person experience
<br>
2. evaluation of the experience as immediately evil or good
<br>
<p>You can argue that (1) is a result of imperfectly deceptive neural
<br>
architecture, but I still can find logical ways of justifying needing to do
<br>
this (as I did in my previous message) which would be accepted in a purely
<br>
logical framework. It is not what I am trying to prove here though. I also
<br>
can show that if we make the assumption that a very intelligent AI will have
<br>
qualia, then it should get to the same kind of morality and empathic
<br>
evaluation. Though I am not trying to prove it here because there are some
<br>
fundamental points to be agreed on first.
<br>
<p>If we can all agree that 1. and 2. are what brings us to say &quot;labor camps
<br>
are not moral&quot; then we are getting somewhere. But if you tell me that your
<br>
response is
<br>
<p>x. looks like people in the camp are going to rebel any time now
<br>
y. free people wouldn't stay in labor camps
<br>
z. therefore labor camps are evil
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>j. people in labor camps do not become scientists
<br>
k. therefore seed AIs are not built
<br>
l. so the production of information patterns is limited
<br>
<p>then I don't think we can discuss &quot;morality&quot; since we are using the same
<br>
word to mean different things. We can still discuss these things
<br>
individually, let's call them 1-2 and x-y-z and j-k-l, but calling them
<br>
morality only makes the problem harder since we're arguing about different
<br>
things with common elements and quasi-same effects.
