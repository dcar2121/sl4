<p>
Mark,
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is not an SL4-ish thread, but it's interesting.
<br>
<p>I'm curious what sorts of things you want to do by treating &quot;programs as
<br>
data&quot; using an XML representation.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the problem with treating complex programs as data
<br>
in an XML sense is that the semantics of complex programs is, well,
<br>
complex....
<br>
<p>We have designed, but not implemented, a programming language for
<br>
Novamente, named Sasha (after the late extropian Sasha Chislenko).
<br>
Sasha will compile into Novamente nodes and links, which can be saved as
<br>
XML, hence it will be an XML-based programming language.  More comments
<br>
on this below.
<br>
<p>LISP treats programs as data, in a way that is elegant and workable for
<br>
small programs, but never seemed to scale very well for large-scale
<br>
software engineering.
<br>
<p>FLARE, in my view, had profound usability problems as a programming
<br>
language.  It had some cool features but needed a huge amount of work to
<br>
be turned into something potentially usable. 
<br>
<p>Another comment is that an XML representation of a program will need to
<br>
be translated into some far more compact binary representation to enable
<br>
execution anyway.
<br>
<p>I see two approaches for XML-ization of programs:
<br>
<p>1) 
<br>
Simply map a program into XML, in a direct way.  This will result in
<br>
hideously complex XML that cannot be pragmatically  manipulated.
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
Separate *efficiency of implementation* from *logical structure of
<br>
programs*.  In other words, have a language with two layers: one layer
<br>
that is more like a formal specification, and the other layer that is
<br>
transformed to be efficiently executiable.  It's the first layer that
<br>
can usefully be represented in XML, and potentially manipulated using
<br>
XML-manipulation tools.
<br>
<p>Sasha takes this second approach, but weakly.  Its syntax is very
<br>
high-level, and then for efficient execution, it would require massive
<br>
graph rewriting on the back end, in the manner of all functional
<br>
languages.
<br>
<p>The most easily XML-izable programming language is Refal, developed by
<br>
Val Turchin in the 1950's.  This is the Russian LISP, sort of, and its
<br>
syntax is more similar to XML syntax than to anything else in the West.
<br>
Val tried to get Refal adopted by the XML community as a scripting
<br>
language, but it was too weird, and no one got interested.
<br>
<p>Refal is tied in with supercompilation, which produces an efficiently
<br>
executable program from a compact, easily XML-izable Refal program.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a new workable language and proving its viability is hard.   I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe FLARE ever gained enough momentum to achieve this.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I for one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saw nothing terribly compelling or necessary about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language.   It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was not some huge boon to AI programming in general.  IMHO, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needless distraction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I disagree.  XML is now pretty much THE premiere data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language with a lot of programming infrastructure, utilities, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, very importantly, standards already created to support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  An XML-based programming language, which allows programs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be EASILY treated as data and which would build on all of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the XML infrastructure already in place, would be a HUGE boon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to programs that look to analyze and improve their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming.  AI lost a lot when LISP, etc. pretty much fell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off of the map.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Someone once said that the level of civilization is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by what you can do without thinking (i.e. the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of infrastructure and common standards).  A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-accepted XML-based programming language will be a HUGE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase to the existing infrastructure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     M$ will eventually fill the gap with their proposed X# 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming language unless someone else beats them to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punch (but I consider that HIGHLY unlikely at this point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless FLARE is still alive as a stealth project and near 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; release).  I, personally, am looking forward to the day with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great anticipation and dread.
</em><br>
