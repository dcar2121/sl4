I think the tense is wrong.  It should be &quot;is starting to break down&quot;, 
<br>
or possibly even &quot;is continuing to break down&quot;.  This is something 
<br>
progressive.  Early attempts to handle it are in part responsible for 
<br>
the vast increase of government bureaucracy.  Jobs that weren't valuable 
<br>
enough to do, are getting done because of the additional value of 
<br>
keeping people employed.  And our metaphysic doesn't allow the hoi 
<br>
polloi any other way to earn their livelihood.  (This is new... the 
<br>
independant yeomanry [and it's analogous descendants] were the backbone 
<br>
of anglo/american civilization, until around the early 1900's...possibly 
<br>
into the 1940's.)
<br>
<p>Civilizations don't have experience with rapid changes at a basic level 
<br>
that aren't destructively traumatic.  E.g., the reformed-Russian 
<br>
government seems to be turning into what the Duma might have evolved 
<br>
into, had Lenin not intervened.  Civilizations try to be conservative.  
<br>
Cheap labor isn't new...slavery is old.  But robots are new.  Sweat of 
<br>
your brow won't pay for either food or shelter, much less both.  Not 
<br>
when the competition is a robot.  (C.f.:  John Henry and the Steam 
<br>
Drill).  But things that only affect small fractions of the populace can 
<br>
be dealt with by suppressing the disaffected by main force.  Have you 
<br>
noticed that the govt. is increasingly monitoring the populace for signs 
<br>
of unrest...to suppress them, not to solve the problem that causes the 
<br>
unrest. This is the traditional conservative approach.  It's what's 
<br>
always worked before.  But as the disaffected proportion of the populace 
<br>
grows...you need more and more police and troops.  That supplies jobs 
<br>
for some..but if the only job is being a agent of suppression, what kind 
<br>
of government do you have?
<br>
<p>The exporting of jobs can be considered a form of &quot;pre-adaptation&quot;.  
<br>
This can only be done if you can sufficiently well define the interface 
<br>
that the job requires.  And if you can do that, then it becomes a 
<br>
candidate for automation.
<br>
<p>But each job that has the interface well-defined, also defines its 
<br>
interfaces with the jobs it interacts with.  And this leads to other 
<br>
jobs being candidates for automation.
<br>
<p>As another problem:  In Athens, at the time democracy was being defined, 
<br>
the spread in income between the richest citizen and the poorest was 
<br>
about a factor of fifty.  Even so, the rich ended up with more than 
<br>
fifty times as much influence in the government.  In the US today, I 
<br>
don't know what it is, but it's at least several thousand.  And the tiny 
<br>
fraction at the top of the pyramid make the decisions that coerce what 
<br>
everyone is supposed to do.  Calling this a democracy doesn't make it 
<br>
one.  Oligarchy is closer.  This has advantages, as oligarchies *can* 
<br>
react more quickly to new trends.  But first they must notice them, and 
<br>
they only notice the ones that affect them directly.  If one were to 
<br>
take the &quot;eye in the pyramid&quot; as the symbol for this, the eye at the top 
<br>
would represent those who decided what was good and bad for everyone 
<br>
else to live by.  One might call this &quot;the burden of omniscience&quot;, as 
<br>
they must know what's important at every level.  And the rest are 
<br>
supposed to ignore what they are really experiencing, and accept what 
<br>
they are told as good and bad.  One might call this the &quot;burden of 
<br>
nessience&quot;.  But neither of these accurately describes what's going on, 
<br>
they just describe what the society is expecting to work.  When the 
<br>
cognitive dissonance becomes too great, the pyramid collapses under it's 
<br>
own fictions.  (Appologies to R.A. Wilson, &quot;Illuminatus&quot;)
<br>
<p>Now this is too dangerous a set-up to be allowed to exist, so multiple 
<br>
levels of checks and balances are put into place.  Courts relatively 
<br>
independent of the executive, e.g.  And multiple levels of government 
<br>
operating relatively independently.  Unfortunately two things are 
<br>
happening.  The first is that this is a relatively clumsy system, with a 
<br>
lot of built-in time delays.  When things start changing quickly, it 
<br>
can't adapt quickly enough.  But the second problem is worse.  It's to 
<br>
the advantage of the people at the top to corrupt the checks and 
<br>
balences, so that they can coerce decisions in the directions that they 
<br>
feel to be proper.  And the people at the top have considerably more 
<br>
leverage on the internal workings of government than those nearer the 
<br>
bottom.  So the checks and balences not only stop working well, the 
<br>
become corrupted with a bias in favor of the top.  This tends to cause 
<br>
increasing disaffection in the lower part of the pyramid, where the bulk 
<br>
of the power resides.  (The power at the top is concentrated, and easy 
<br>
to bring into play.  The power at the bottom is diffuse, and difficult 
<br>
to control.)  And as the corruption increased, the layer of the pyramid 
<br>
at which the disaffection is occuring gets higher.  At some point, it 
<br>
will collapse.  Having lots of government troops doesn't help much if 
<br>
what breaks out is a civil war, as that just means that there are larger 
<br>
armies fighting back and forth.
<br>
<p>So there needs to be a new organization created before the disaffection 
<br>
increases too greatly.  But one can't expect the government to notice 
<br>
that disaffection has increased to dangerous levels until after it is 
<br>
far beyond merely dangerous.  And the government *does* appear to have 
<br>
noticed that disaffection is increasing.  So either the levels of 
<br>
disaffection are much higher than is obvious, or the government intends 
<br>
to intentionally make it much worse.  Recent statements about cutting 
<br>
out Social Security seem to point towards the second choice. 
<br>
<p>I've said this in other contexts, but *I* think it bears repeating.  If 
<br>
it weren't for the actions taken by persons in power, I would feel that 
<br>
all reasonable steps should be taken to slow the onset of the 
<br>
singularity.  As it is, I feel the singularity may represent our only 
<br>
hope for survival, dangerous though it is.
