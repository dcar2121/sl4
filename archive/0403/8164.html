<em>&gt; How Will the Universe End?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A cosmic detective story about the demise of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, in three parts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Jim Holt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What could our descendants possibly look like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion trillion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion years from now, when the stars have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappeared and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is dark and freezing and so diffuse that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's practically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empty? What will they be made of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The most plausible answer,&quot; Dyson said, &quot;is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious life will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the form of interstellar dust clouds.&quot; He was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alluding to the kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of inorganic life forms imagined by the late
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in his 1957 science fiction novel, The Black Cloud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;An ever-expanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network of charged dust particles, communicating by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electromagnetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces, has all the complexity necessary for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking an infinite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of novel thoughts.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How, I objected, can we really imagine such a wispy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, spread out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over billions of light-years of space, being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;how do you imagine a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kilograms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protoplasm in someone's skull being conscious? We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no idea how that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works either.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm personally surprised you didn't snipe yourself.
<br>
First of all, this article is from Microsoft, one of
<br>
the worst companies of all time (I could go in to a
<br>
big long discussion of why that is, but that would be
<br>
irrelevant to SL4. Google is your friend). Second of
<br>
all, the material in the brain isn't &quot;protoplasm&quot;- the
<br>
supposed existence of such material, which was thought
<br>
to give life to beings, was disproven centuries ago.
<br>
Third of all, this completely ignores any kind of
<br>
ultratechnology or even a Singularity happening.
<br>
Fourth, the Singularity could prevent, or at least
<br>
postpone, the universe winding up in such a state.
<br>
Fifth, there is no communication mechanism specified.
<br>
Interstellar dust doesn't have an electric or magnetic
<br>
charge. Sixth, unless some form of FTL travel is
<br>
assumed, the entity would take trillions of years to
<br>
think a thought. Seventh, the particles would have to
<br>
know exactly where the other particles were in order
<br>
to relay signals (at least to relay signals
<br>
efficiently- omnidirectional transmissions waste huge
<br>
amounts of energy). Eighth, even given a workaround to
<br>
seven, the particles are likely to be moving and so
<br>
would have to keep constant track of each other
<br>
(sounds like a lot for a little bit of dust!). Ninth,
<br>
although we of course don't fully understand the
<br>
brain, it isn't true the we have &quot;no idea&quot; how it
<br>
works. Just ask a neurologist. Tenth, this organism
<br>
would still consume quite a lot of energy, and no
<br>
energy source is given. Eleventh, given the time frame
<br>
(10^36 years in the future), and given current
<br>
theories about cosmic expansion, who says there would
<br>
even be dust? The human brain can easily get around
<br>
these.
<br>
<p>1. The human brain was designed by Darwinian
<br>
evolution, which, although stupid, isn't actively
<br>
malicious like Microsoft.
<br>
<p>2. N/A
<br>
<p>3. The human brain was developed when there was no
<br>
good reason to expect any sort of a Singularity- now
<br>
there is good reason o expect one in this century.
<br>
<p>4. N/A
<br>
<p>5. The communication mechanism in the brain is well
<br>
known and doesn't have to cover vast distances.
<br>
<p>6. The brain is extremely small compared to the
<br>
proposed organism and therefore doesn't suffer this
<br>
deficiency.
<br>
<p>7 &amp; 8. The brain's neurons are physically connected to
<br>
each other and don't really move relative to one
<br>
another. This isn't a problem.
<br>
<p>9. N/A
<br>
<p>10. The brain does have a proven energy source- solar
<br>
nuclear fusion, which is transferred indirectly
<br>
through light and food.
<br>
<p>11. The universe is about 1.3 * 10^10 years old, not
<br>
10^36. The Universe is still dense enough for entire
<br>
solar systems to form.
