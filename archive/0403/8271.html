<br>
Philip,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The proposed law states that
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Supreme Court
<br>
shall not have jurisdiction to review, by appeal, writ of certiorari, or
<br>
otherwise, any matter to the extent that relief is sought against an
<br>
element of Federal, State, or local government, or against an officer of
<br>
Federal, State, or local government (whether or not acting in official
<br>
personal capacity), by reason of that element's or officer's
<br>
acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or
<br>
government.&quot;
<br>
<p>The third article you cite states that
<br>
<p>&quot;Because the judiciary is &quot;an element&quot; of the federal, state and local
<br>
governments, this wording, if it becomes law, may allow any judge to
<br>
institute biblical punishments without being subject to review by the
<br>
Supreme Court or the federal court system.&quot;
<br>
<p>This looks like BS to me.  According to the proposed law, if a judge
<br>
does some action X and justifies it by recourse to God, the Supreme
<br>
Court may still hear a case as to whether X was legal or not.  Simply,
<br>
the Supreme Court may not hear a case as to whether *the justification
<br>
by recourse to God* was legal or not.  See the distinction?
<br>
<p>The proponents of the law may see it as a step toward some kind of
<br>
grander religious agenda.  But in itself, I don't see this as dangerous.
<br>
<p>I admit I am not a lawyer (though I've reviewed a frightening number of
<br>
legal documents in the last 10 years!), so there may be some subtlety
<br>
that I'm missing.

Subject: What would implications be for Singularity if US a theocratic
<br>
state?
<br>
<p><p>Has anyone been tracking the implications of the recently introduced
<br>
(US) Constitution Restoration Bill of 2004?   
<br>
<p>I gather a Bill has been introduced into both houses for The
<br>
Constitution Restoration Act of 2004 (House version: H.R. 3799; Senate
<br>
version: S. 2082).  If passed, the Act would bar the U.S. Supreme Court
<br>
and federal courts from hearing cases challenging &quot;expressions of
<br>
religious faith by elected or appointed officials&quot;.  The surface issue
<br>
looks pretty trivial eg. preventing Supreme Court reviewing decisions by
<br>
government officials to display the ten commandments and other religious
<br>
references. However these may not be the only expressions of religious
<br>
faith by elected or appointed government officials as the Bill expressly
<br>
includes a reference to God being the *sovereign source of law* by an
<br>
official in his capacity of executing his office - rather than the
<br>
sovereign source of the law being the people of the United States.
<br>
Perhaps government officials could make other much more important
<br>
executive decisions claiming imunity from court review on the grounds
<br>
that they were expressions of religious faith based on the law of God.

<br>
<p>The third report suggests that the the religious Right is the source of
<br>
the Constitution Restoration Bill of 2004 and that the Bill is meant to
<br>
have much more than cosmetic efect.
<br>
<p>I'm too unfamiliar with the US body politic to be able to evaluate this
<br>
issue adequately but it could perhaps have a direct bearing on
<br>
activities in the US that the religious Right feel challenge the
<br>
supremacy of God in US society.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
