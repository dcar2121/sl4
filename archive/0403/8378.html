<p><p>I'll give this one more go-around and then (out of respect for the 
<br>
group)leave it for such time that perhaps a newer, more effective 
<br>
approach or materials might be available.
<br>
<p>It seems that when people approach the question of &quot;What is 
<br>
consciousness?&quot; they come at it from generally one of two directions:
<br>
<p>(1) A first-person experience of self awareness
<br>
<p>(2) A third-person conceptualization of how things seem to work
<br>
<p>In either case, we want to understand the underlying physical basis for 
<br>
how seeing a red object results in the distinct experience of perceiving 
<br>
redness.  (Already, we are slipping into semantic quicksand here.)
<br>
<p>By &quot;understand&quot; we mean to fit this observation into our existing 
<br>
knowledge base of linked concepts of how the world &quot;really is&quot;. (Now, we 
<br>
find ourselves in quicksand, surrounded by a treacherous bog, all hidden 
<br>
in fog, but let's proceed on the assumption that we can feel our way 
<br>
through.)
<br>
<p>As Ben pointed out, the simplest conceptualization depends on our 
<br>
pre-existing knowledge base.  This holds true for comparing two 
<br>
viewpoints until the context is widened to the extent that one viewpoint 
<br>
begins to include the other.  As we widen the context to allow for 
<br>
further observations, we encounter stuff that doesn't fit, apparent 
<br>
paradox.  This is where the so-called &quot;hard problem&quot; is found.
<br>
<p>Paradox is always due to insufficient context.  Whether there is missing 
<br>
information, or logic improperly applied, or the question is improperly 
<br>
stated or meaningless, there is no paradox in the physical world -- all 
<br>
the parts must and do fit.  Paradox is a condition of apparent 
<br>
inconsistency due to insufficient conceptual context.
<br>
<p>The core of the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness is that it includes the 
<br>
built-in assumption that there is someone doing the experiencing. 
<br>
Someone who is somehow separate from the process and who can report 
<br>
objectively on the experience.
<br>
<p>The solution to understanding the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness is to 
<br>
widen the conceptual context (the third-person perspective) and see that 
<br>
all the behaviors and reported experiences appear to be explainable in 
<br>
naturalistic/mechanistic terms.
<br>
<p>But, this leaves some with the disturbing and unresolved feeling that 
<br>
something is missing.  Although all the processes can be described (in 
<br>
theory) in mechanistic terms, where is the direct feeling of experience 
<br>
in all this?  The answer is that this perception, this feeling of direct 
<br>
experience, is the natural result of these processes.
<br>
<p>*The only way we have to know how we feel is by using these processes to 
<br>
both ask and answer the question.*
<br>
<p>Our consciousness is not outside these processes, but part of these 
<br>
processes.  We're built to feel that it's real and we have no other way 
<br>
to experience it.
<br>
<p>There are known dysfunctional cognitive states where this perception of 
<br>
the direct experience of reality is missing.  Zombie states, Capgras 
<br>
syndrome, split brain experiments and hundreds of other examples show us 
<br>
that our conscious experience is the *result* of brain processing, and 
<br>
that in fact, our &quot;direct experience&quot; is full of gaps and fabrications. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind-altering drugs can provide satisfyingly convincing personal 
<br>
evidence that our mind is not as coherent as we assume, or can feed even 
<br>
more  elaborate speculations on the nature of mind.  Buddhism and some 
<br>
other philosophies teach that the sense of self is an illusion, but 
<br>
these too struggle with the natural perception that our experience is 
<br>
what is most real.  And in a limited philosophical sense, what we 
<br>
experience *is* what is most real to us -- this just doesn't help us get 
<br>
out of that box and past the paradox mentioned earlier.
<br>
<p>So it's interesting that our minds are able to build conceptual models 
<br>
that can include the workings of the mind and the greater universe, but 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;humans are currently at a stage of development where their direct 
<br>
experience, with all it's known limitations, is still given preferred 
<br>
seating in the Cartesian theater.
