<em>&gt; The short answer - I want an environment where a program is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also data so that automatic program generation and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulation is facilitated.  Making a programming language 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML-compliant pretty much guarantees this 
</em><br>
<p>I guess this is what Samantha questions....  
<br>
<p>The problem is that unless this XML/prog-lang mapping is done in a very
<br>
simple, manageable, compact way, it's not of any practical use...
<br>
<p>Honestly, I think what you want is Refal.NET (which doesn't exist of
<br>
course, but would be a fun port to make.  Some friends of mine have now
<br>
ported OCaML, another weird functional language, to .NET ... The port is
<br>
called Nemerle)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMPORTANT POINT:  If I were Ben and working on Novamente, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be making sure that my freezing and thawing (storage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and retrieval) of schemas, atomspaces, etc. was available 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through XML and that Sasha 2's syntax was XML compliant.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we use XML as one option for saving/loading.  However, it's very
<br>
very slow to load large XML files into Novamente, so for repeatedly
<br>
loading the same data we load it in from XML *once* and then save a
<br>
binary &quot;net image&quot; file, which can be loaded and reloaded much faster.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Note to Ben:  A couple of things that I would hope for but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't yet see in Novamente are a) ways to take recognize and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of the scale invariance of many activities through 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encapsulation 
</em><br>
<p>There are processes for &quot;encapsulation&quot; but none that specifically
<br>
address scale-invariance; I'm not sure what you mean...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and b) a way to compile specific time-critical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schemas from more general schemas (and the reverse, allowing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for subsequent description of currently compiled code, like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CIM-dynamics, WITHOUT affecting the system).
</em><br>
<p>This is something that we know we need, but have not yet thought about
<br>
in detail.  This would take the form of specific &quot;graph rewriting&quot;
<br>
algorithms acting on CombinatorTrees and CombinatorDAGs ... Comparable
<br>
to what exists inside some functional language interpreters.  But this
<br>
is not a good discussion for SL4, I suppose -- too narrowly technical...
<br>
<p>-- Ben
