<em>&gt; I'll make a more controversial statement, though: I think that if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world WANTED a Singularity in, say, 5-8 years, it could quite possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get it.  A Manhattan-project-style attack on the AGI problem could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially yield dramatic results in a 2-3 year period....  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the powers that be do not seem to have a belief-system oriented in
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; direction at all, so this statement of mine is basically irrelevant in
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; practical sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben G
</em><br>
<p>Of course, if I speak from my gut, I must admit don't even think it
<br>
would take a Manhattan Project style effort.  I think I could get there
<br>
in 2-3 years with an investment of $20 million for staff and hardware.  
<br>
<p>A core AGI team shouldn't number more than 7-8 people, working very
<br>
closely together and without distractions.  And the needed hardware
<br>
should cost just a few million dollars at current prices (I like the
<br>
Octiga bay supercomputers, but a network of 64-bit servers maxed-out on
<br>
RAM would do the trick too).  However, more staff would be VERY useful
<br>
for things like building visualization tools, doing software testing,
<br>
building code to link the AI system to various perception/action
<br>
devices, etc.  Having this kind of &quot;peripheral&quot; work taken care of
<br>
competently and systematically could, I suspect, make the difference
<br>
between success in 2-3 years and success in 5-7 years.
<br>
<p>I think I'll get there in time anyhow, even without funding beyond what
<br>
we're already getting from our (currently) small-time commercial
<br>
endeavors ... but money could certainly buy time.
<br>
<p>Now, set aside my faith in my own Novamente AGI project ... and imagine
<br>
that not only my project but 25 other AGI projects were similarly funded
<br>
for the next few years, at a cost of half a billion dollars.  
<br>
<p>The odds of getting a human-level AGI would pretty dramatically
<br>
increase, wouldn't they....
<br>
<p>But unfortunately, the US would rather spend money sending someone to
<br>
Mars or going back to the Moon or whatever ... which is very cool, but
<br>
is only a greater priority than AGI, biotech and nanotech under a very
<br>
naïve belief system...
