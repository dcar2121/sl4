<p><em>&gt; Hi Jef, thanks for your comment. I think that if we are going for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximization of positive qualia and minimization of negative qualia, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth is necessary. No way we can reduce negative qualia without growing. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just put growth as a subgoal that's all, I object to people saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth is a goal in itself, that it's justified and it should be an index of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality. As long as growth serves a purpose then it is very welcome.
</em><br>
<p>To be clear, I do not consider growth a goal.
<br>
<p>By the way, I really like the way these discussions tend to expand and 
<br>
clarify our thinking on difficult subjects.
<br>
<p>In my thinking on ethics the following points have emerged with some 
<br>
clarity:
<br>
<p>Definition of morality
<br>
*  &quot;Moral&quot; choices are those that are seen as good and consistent in the 
<br>
broadest sense.
<br>
<p><p>Basis for moral reasoning
<br>
*  There seems to be an &quot;arrow of morality&quot;, such that as organisms 
<br>
evolve to broader levels of context, their goals tend to align toward a 
<br>
universal morality.
<br>
<p><p>Method of moral reasoning
<br>
*  A scientific understanding of growth -- the dynamics of 
<br>
organizational complexity -- will help us make choices *that work* at 
<br>
various organizational scales.  (This applies to both choosing goals and 
<br>
finding ways to achieve them.)
<br>
<p>Out of this developing science will come principles that will be 
<br>
popularly and effectively adopted as new moral rules.  These new rules 
<br>
will be applicable over a wider scope and with more specificity than the 
<br>
moral rules of old.
<br>
<p>Older moral rules such as The Golden Rule, Kant's Categorical 
<br>
Imperative, The Ten Commandments, The Eightfold Path of Buddhism, will 
<br>
be superseded by principles from the science of complex organizational 
<br>
dynamics.
<br>
<p>As these principles are extracted and popularized, people will begin to 
<br>
communicate their moral choices in terms such as the following:
<br>
&quot;Because it maximizes effective growth&quot;,
<br>
&quot;Because it maximizes diversity&quot;,
<br>
&quot;Because it maximizes effective interaction&quot;,
<br>
&quot;Because it increases the freedom of the system&quot;
<br>
&quot;Because it preserves the information structure&quot;,
<br>
or...
<br>
&quot;Because it is more extropic&quot;.  ;-)
<br>
<p>- Jef
