<p>
I do pretty much go along with Ben’s comments.
<br>
<p>Regarding terrorism,  You may well imagine that where
<br>
I am now (New Zealand) people are relatively safe, but
<br>
it just isn't so.  One of the world's biggest Muslim
<br>
nations (Indonesia) is right on the border of N.Z and
<br>
Australia, and there are strong fundamentalist
<br>
elements there.  There is a small but real possibility
<br>
of an Indonesian invasion of Australia or N.Z.  In
<br>
addition Australia is a target due to its alliance
<br>
with the United States, and recently copped the Bali
<br>
bombings.  No where in the world is safe.
<br>
<p>I think it's rather naive to think that fundamentalism
<br>
is largely a function of the economic conditions in
<br>
the Middle East.  One could equally turn the
<br>
hypothesis around, and argue that the economic
<br>
conditions are caused by fundamentalism.   Sure, more
<br>
democracy and fairer conditions would definitely help,
<br>
but I think ideology is just as big a culprit as the
<br>
conditions.  There are plenty of uber-wealthy
<br>
(millionaire and even billionaire), well educated 
<br>
Christen fundamentalists in the United States after
<br>
all.  Many of the Middle Eastern governments are
<br>
actually more moderate than the people - it's the
<br>
fundamentalists that constrain the governments, not
<br>
visa versa.  And there are plenty of ultra-wealthy and
<br>
well educated radical Muslims - in Saudi Arabia for
<br>
instance.    
<br>
<p>I intend to make a move to the States some time in the
<br>
next few years.  But not to any of the major cities. 
<br>
Especially not New York or Washington: two prime
<br>
candidates for another terrorist attack.  
<br>
<p>I like the look of the 'Free State Project' in New
<br>
Hampshire:  <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/index.jsp">http://www.freestateproject.org/index.jsp</a>
<br>
<p>Here's a real attempt to create an actual Semi
<br>
Libertarian society.  They're aiming to get 20 000
<br>
Libertarians to make a move there initially.  6 000
<br>
are pledged so far.  There's a good net-work of
<br>
Transhumanists and Libertarians being built up there. 
<br>
There is also a sympathetic group of hard-core
<br>
'Survivalists', people who can prepare.   
<br>
<p>New Hampshire is relatively small , out-of-the-way and
<br>
has access to the ocean.  It's also a strongly
<br>
defensive position.  Much of the terrain is forest and
<br>
the winter's are freezing cold: factors which would
<br>
make life very difficult for any hostile incursion.  A
<br>
Libertarian legislative could protect transhumanist
<br>
projects, and keep techno-phobes and the Federal
<br>
government off the backs of any transhumanist
<br>
Institutes.  If the world goes to hell in a
<br>
hand-basket, NH  could be the best place to be.  If
<br>
the U.S Federal government collapsed, I think NH could
<br>
fend off the ensuring chaos.  Even if the world
<br>
doesn't go to hell in a hand-basket, the Libertarian
<br>
experiment makes the State attractive to me.  As the
<br>
Singularity approaches, that's the place I've chosen
<br>
to see in the 'End Times' (Transcension).  And if it
<br>
goes wrong... that’s where I'll be making my 'last
<br>
stand'.
