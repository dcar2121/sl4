</em><br>
<p>There is a lot more infrastructure that supports the second oldest

computer language which was largely tailored for AI over decades.   The 
<br>
XML infrastructure is for manipulating data stored in XML format.  It 
<br>
was not designed for writing, reasoning about or transforming 
<br>
functions.   Nor is that infrastructure written in XML itself.   So XML 
<br>
is not complete in the sense that a language like Lisp is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  More importantly, I want the programs running

</em><br>
<p>Still sounds like Lisp comes a hell of a lot closer to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There is no existing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML, it could be done most quickly if the language were XML-compliant.
</em><br>
<p>So, that XML is popular says that doing something XML was not designed 
<br>
for in XML will make it more likely to be done well?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LISP, a program is also data but efficiency and scalability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swappable modularity with compilation) are not built into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and LISP doesn't have nearly the audience or the infrastructure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support new development.
</em><br>
<p>I do not understand why you believe that XML has &quot;swappable modularity 
<br>
with compilation&quot; but XML does.  I am not sure how the heck you are 
<br>
parsing that phrase to make that work. XML doesn't even contain itself. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires other tools and languages to do anything with it at all.  
<br>
Except for a small core, a language like Lisp is very self-contained.  
<br>
Lisp is as efficient in its compiled form as C with a bit of care.   It 
<br>
is quite scalable.  To argue that it is not would be effectively to 
<br>
argue that no languages are scalable as every other language can be 
<br>
expressed in Lisp.   That is rather a lot of power.

<p><p><em>&gt; = = = = =

<em>&gt; The long answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any procedural computer program/function can be represented by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data structure composed of a series (list) of statements that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs/functions.  XML has no problem representing this as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &lt;function name=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &lt;vars&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 &lt;var name = &quot;inString&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &lt;/var&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &lt;list&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             &lt;function name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             &lt;function name=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 &lt;var name = &quot;secondvar1&quot; type=&quot;integer&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 &lt;var name = &quot;secondvar2&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referent=&quot;inString&quot;/&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             &lt;/function&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             &lt;function name=&quot;third'&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &lt;/list&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &lt;/function&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is trivial and irrelevant to real programming and reasoning about 
<br>
programs.  It is also not really very applicable to functional 
<br>
programming.   Yes, I know you could write XML that looked sort of like 
<br>
the syntactic structure of functional programs.  But so what?
<br>
<p>Write me a function that returns a function in XML alone (no external 
<br>
code allowed).   For that matter, write me a function that does any 
<br>
computation at all in XML alone.    This is why I find this discussion 
<br>
so amazingly strange.  It is an argument that a language that can only 
<br>
encapsulate data is somehow better than real programming languages.    
<br>
It is an argument stuck at the level of language syntax.  If you want 
<br>
to write the text of programs in XML I will think you rather strange.   
<br>
But please do not confuse text with actual functionality or utility or 
<br>
expressive power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, actually, there are A LOT of decisions to be made as to how all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things should be represented . . . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point, though, is that any procedural language program COULD be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented in XML syntax fairly easily.
</em><br>
<p>So why limit yourself to only procedural languages?
<br>
<p>The interesting questions are not whether you could bastardize the 
<br>
syntax of procedural languages into XML form but whether this would 
<br>
actually buy you anything worth the trouble.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ASIDE:  If one wants to go down the functional programming path, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are even more easily be represented by hierarchical tree structures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and XML.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also note that procedural programs can be transformed into functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs simply by realizing that series/lists are themselves composed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and can be replaced by functions)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, what does all this buy us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, there already exists substantial infrastructure for parsing XML,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving it in and out of various datastructures, etc., etc.
</em><br>
<p>Most of it clumsy and woefully inefficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, now that our programs already exist in a DATA format, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a lot of the tools that we need to be able to modify them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if I were Samantha, I would argue that all of these things could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done in LISP and I would be correct.  But what's generally missing in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LISP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a lot of what's required for true SPEED and SCALABILITY or, as Ben 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puts
</em><br>
<p>The burden of proof is on you to show anywhere near the speed and 
<br>
scalability for an XMl based language that has already been 
<br>
demonstrated by Lisp.  You keep asserting that XML beats Lisp in this 
<br>
regard without a shred of evidence or argument for support.   This will 
<br>
not do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Separate *efficiency of implementation* from *logical structure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; programs*.  In other words, have a language with two layers: one layer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that is more like a formal specification, and the other layer that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; transformed to be efficiently executable.  It's the first layer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can usefully be represented in XML, and potentially manipulated using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; XML-manipulation tools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, what I envision when I talk about an XML-based language is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like XML.NET i.e. a system where I can write a description of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function in my language but compile it down to or replace it with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation-efficient version.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMPORTANT POINT:  If I were Ben and working on Novamente, I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making sure that my freezing and thawing (storage and retrieval) of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schemas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atomspaces, etc. was available through XML and that Sasha 2's syntax 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was XML
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compliant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Need I point out that XML itself is trivial to represent in Lisp and 
<br>
Lisp has built into it vastly more data expressive power than XML 
<br>
dreams of?  Or that the result is immediately computable?   There is 
<br>
less separation, less &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; if you will, in a language 
<br>
like Lisp.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The whole point to this is to try to make a very modular, swappable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming environment that lends itself to both very high levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstraction and drilling down to the lowest detail when necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In XML the abstraction will come from outside XML.  In Lisp, the 
<br>
abstraction is built up within the same language and environment with 
<br>
tranformations between the levels of abstraction and cross-cutting 
<br>
across the levels all available in the same language.   I don't see how 
<br>
a lot of dead XML data representation plus various types of 
<br>
manipulating code in one or more other languages (yes, the in-memory 
<br>
representation is another language) can possibly compare in elegance, 
<br>
flexibility or power.
