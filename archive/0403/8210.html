</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the one hand, sharing can advance research, on the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have substantial proprietary value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The number of people who can understand a workable design for even much

lesser projects is small.  The number who both understand it and have 
<br>
the time/talent/resources to implement it or anything like it is 
<br>
infinitesimal.
<br>
<p>One of the things that is most likely to lead straight to a dystopia is 
<br>
being such control freaks on information and knowledge that advancement 
<br>
of human effective intelligence is stillborn before it becomes 
<br>
effective enough and concentrated enough to succeed at AGI.    Our 
<br>
proprietary attitudes toward knowledge might be more on the problem 
<br>
than the solution side of the equation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To tell you the truth, I was slightly uneasy even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posting those few very general ideas to sl4 you see in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my last couple of posts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I really don't see why.  Those ideas and a hell of a lot of 
<br>
inspiration, genius and hard work still may well not be enough.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Most of the people working in A.I probably visit sl4
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; off all our ideas without a second thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Ripping off&quot;?   I wish that someone would &quot;rip off&quot; something critical 
<br>
to increasing the intelligence available before it is much too late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The marketing side of it needs to be a lot more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful as well.  Some things (like the Sys Op idea)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will just cause people to go ballistic.  Other things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like wild speculation about life after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, will just cause people to dismiss it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as sci-fi fantasy.  I would never have talked about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity at all.  And for God's sake don't talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about life after the Singularity!  Most people just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't believe a word of this stuff.  There is too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hype and far too many 'slip ups' on the marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side.  And the few non-scientifc people in the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population who do believe this stuff are scared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shitless by it.  AI will upset religious and social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; norms.
</em><br>
<p>For Newton's sake don't try to tell us what we should and should not 
<br>
talk about!  One person's rant is another's inspiration.    Religious 
<br>
and social norms need to be upset.  We need to grow new norms as 
<br>
quickly as we can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of this may sound a bit paranoid, but really Sing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inst needs to start thinking about these things.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just 'Singularity Realism'.
</em><br>
<p><p>One person's realism is another person's paranoia.  :-)
