<p>I've read that paper, but my question is different from the one he
<br>
addresses.  Bostrom focuses on the possibility that we're living in an
<br>
ancester-simulation run by posthumans. This doesn't really apply to an SI,
<br>
who I think would be much more interested in the possibility that it's
<br>
living in a universe simulation running in a computationally much richer
<br>
base reality.
<br>
<p>Of course some of the reasoning Bostrom uses applies to this case,
<br>
but we also need something that he doesn't address: a prior distribution
<br>
on the laws of physics of base reality. He doesn't have to address it
<br>
because he assumes that the laws of physics of base reality are the laws
<br>
that we observe, and the only question is whether we're living in an
<br>
ancestor-simulation or not.
<br>
<p>One appealing answer to this question of the prior is to define the prior
<br>
probability of a possible universe being base reality as the inverse of
<br>
the complexity of its laws of physics. This could be formalized as P(X) =
<br>
n^-K(X) where X is a possible universe, n is the size of the alphabet of
<br>
the language of a formal set theory, and K(X) is length of the shortest
<br>
definition in this language of a set isomorphic to X. (Those of you
<br>
familiar with algorithmic complexity theory might notice that K(X) is just
<br>
a generalization of algorithmic complexity, to sets, and to
<br>
non-constructive descriptions. The reason for this generalization is to 
<br>
avoid assuming that base reality must be discrete and computable.)
<br>
<p>That still leaves the question: which set theory? This is analagous to the
<br>
question in algorithmic complexity theory of which universal Turing
<br>
machine do we use to define algorithmic complexity? Algorithmic complexity
<br>
theorists have ignored the question (because they can obtain asymptotic
<br>
results without having to define a particular Turing machine) so they're
<br>
not of much help to us on this point.
<br>
<p>The lack of a objective criteria for choosing a formal set theory for this
<br>
purpose leads me to wonder if perhaps the choice of a prior is a
<br>
subjective one, similar to the &quot;choice&quot; of a supergoal in the presumed
<br>
absence of objective morality. In case it is, shouldn't we try to answer
<br>
this question before building an SI?
