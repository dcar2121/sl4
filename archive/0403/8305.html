<em>&gt;From: Dani Eder &lt;<a href="mailto:danielravennest@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20De-Anthropomorphizing%20SL3%20to%20SL4.">danielravennest@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The human genome is 3.36 billion base pairs, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;840 MBytes raw.  Using an efficient compression
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithm it can be compressed to 21% of it's raw
</em><br>
<em>&gt;size, hence there is 180 MBytes of unique data in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the genome.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately the case isn't that simple.  Not all DNA is 
<br>
information-coding, in fact, most of it isn't.  Early estimates pinned the 
<br>
amount of protein-coding DNA to about 10%.  We now know now that it's more 
<br>
like about 2%.  But which part of the genome do you count as &quot;information&quot;?  
<br>
Just the exons that make it to mature peptides and RNA?  How about the 
<br>
introns (with important intron/exon boundary and branchpoint sequences that 
<br>
inform the splicing apparatus) and 5' and 3' untranslated regions?  How 
<br>
about promoter and enhancer sequences?   What about sequences that don't 
<br>
directly affect gene expression, but that get methylated or acetylated and 
<br>
can thus affect chromatin structure, and indirectly expression of nearby 
<br>
genes?  How about AT/GC ratios?  Do those count as information?  What about 
<br>
the selfish DNA sequences (transposons, etc.) that make copies of themselves 
<br>
and act like genomic parasites?  By inserting themselves into or near genes, 
<br>
they can disrupt their sequence or expression.
<br>
<p>It's all rather complex, and by the most liberal estimate perhaps 20% of the 
<br>
genomic sequence caries information that is pertinent to the development and 
<br>
function of H. sapiens.  That's maybe 600 or 700 million base pairs (160 
<br>
MB).  I draw the distinction because you could have, say, a document that is 
<br>
840 kb, but what if 80% of it is random, wordless strings of letters?  You 
<br>
wouldn't call that information.
<br>
<p>Anyway, that's a more accurate number to use for the information content of 
<br>
the human genome.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
