Tommy McCabe said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Eleventh, given the time frame (10^36 years in the future), and given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;current theories about cosmic expansion, who says there would even be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dust?
</em><br>
<p>and I said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Expansion isn't relevant to whether there's dust.
</em><br>
<p>but I suppose it is, since it's the increase in the volume
<br>
of space which prevents all the remnant particles from
<br>
meeting up to form complex structures again.
<br>
<p>I think Dyson's idea about positronium clouds as an
<br>
end-state has something going for it. Positronium is a
<br>
bound state of an electron and a positron. Obviously
<br>
they're in danger of annihilating, but if they have enough
<br>
momentum they can stay apart, while remaining attracted
<br>
by their opposite charges. I don't know if Dyson ever
<br>
wrote it up, but after his &quot;Life Without End&quot; paper,
<br>
when the idea of proton decay became fashionable,
<br>
he came up with the idea of positronium clouds rather
<br>
than dust clouds. The problem of proton decay comes
<br>
about in unified field theories which say that quarks can
<br>
become leptons (e.g. electrons), a transition which is
<br>
impossible in the Standard Model but which would just
<br>
be extremely rare in a unified field theory. This implies
<br>
that all atomic nuclei would eventually turn into
<br>
electrons and neutrinos, rendering atoms (and
<br>
molecules and dust) mortal. But electrons (and positrons)
<br>
were still immortal in these scenarios, thus the use of
<br>
positronium. I believe Dyson envisages &quot;gravitationally
<br>
bound positronium&quot;, in which you have an electron
<br>
and a positron orbiting each other at great distances;
<br>
such a system would have a large number of energy
<br>
levels (akin to the electron orbitals in an atom, but
<br>
far more numerous). The positronium &quot;atoms&quot; would
<br>
interact with each other gravitationally and
<br>
electromagnetically. I still have my &quot;no rigid bodies&quot;
<br>
problem, but I guess I can also see very long-lived
<br>
&quot;gravitational molecules&quot; of positronium, larger than
<br>
today's observable universe, in which epochs pass
<br>
without any structural change, and in which complicated
<br>
orbital resonances meanwhile do the computing.
<br>
If you lived in one of those island galaxies I described
<br>
in a previous post, your long-range planning might
<br>
center on preparations for the positronium era -
<br>
setting up the initial conditions of your final, positronium
<br>
incarnation.
