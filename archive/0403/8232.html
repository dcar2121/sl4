<p><em>&gt;Hi Ben,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; it's worth noting that a Luddite attitude underlies part of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pisses off bin Laden and crew. These guys hate modern technology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cultural and psychological changes it has caused.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd be supprised if an anti-*technology* orientation is what's at the core 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of fundamentalist Muslim concerns.  I think it's the cultural and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychological issues that are central.
</em><br>
<p>The technological and psychological issues feed back on each other, 
<br>
particularly with respect to income per capita.  High technology means high 
<br>
income, it usually leads to education for women and the resultant lower 
<br>
birth rates which feed back into higher income per capita which dampen down 
<br>
the spread of xenophobic memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But Islam (as with Christianity and Judaism and Hinduism etc. etc.) has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many tendencies - many of which are moderate and modernist.  An 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting question is why the Fundamentalist versions appear to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gaining ascendency over the moderate or modernist versions.
</em><br>
<p>I make an evolutionary psychology based case that *some* xenophobic meme 
<br>
would be amplified up into inciting war or at least attacks like 9/11 by 
<br>
the conditions all over the Islamic world of looming privation.  It is 
<br>
largely happenstance which versions became ascendant.  The worst &quot;looming 
<br>
privation&quot; case is in Saudi Arabia where the income per capita has fallen 
<br>
by 75% in the last generation.  (Largely from very high population growth.)
<br>
<p>This is all based on hunter-gatherer adaptions to periodic overpopulation 
<br>
or the ecology's productivity fluctuations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the case of the Middle East the heavy handedness of first British 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Imperialism (before the British Empire collapsed) and then the US (and to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lesser extent current European) interests must play a key part since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most of the Middle Eastern regimes are quite undemocratic and hence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moderate and modern views have less scope to develop.
</em><br>
<p>It will be interesting to watch China in this respect.  Democratic (or at 
<br>
least decent) government probably both follows wealth and helps create 
<br>
it.  (Another positive feedback loop.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But also oil and the non-democratic nature of the regimes has put very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large amounts of money into the hands of some quite fundamentalist people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enabling them to bank roll extremist hate-based schools in the region and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Pakistan etc. and terrorist networks.
</em><br>
<p>That is no doubt true.  It is also true though that if these kids had 
<br>
better prospects for productive work the schools would have little attendance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In Australia some years ago we had a surge of support for an ultra-right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Party that were attacking modernity and globalisation etc. and whose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politics were dominated by disgruntlement and a chip on the shoulder.
</em><br>
<p>Think back.  Did this happen in an economic downturn?  In the US, you can 
<br>
chart the neo-nazi movements against how well the economy is doing.  One 
<br>
up, the other down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Fortunately this party has now had a collapse in support.
</em><br>
<p>After the economy recovered?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the one good thing its rise accomplish was to make (at least some) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people aware that if modernity rides roughshod over people then the people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who are hurt will lash back.  It's not really a terribly startling insight 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it is an important one.  If modernity is going to be seen as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blessing then the benefits need to be shared around universally.  We can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just work on averages - it how it affect each individual and community 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that matters.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if it has to get down to the individuals, but if you don't 
<br>
want memes being amplified that induce people to try to start wars, then 
<br>
you need to keep per capita income steady or rising slowly worldwide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This has central relevance to the singuarity.  If the singuarity is to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embraced and not fought bitterly then it will have to be managed so that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the benefits are spread widely - in fact universally.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, though the most bitter fighting against the rich by the very poor 
<br>
is a lost cause.  When everyone was at the same hunter-gatherer technology 
<br>
level this was not the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The real risk with the singularity is that it will be a very lop-side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;affair where humans and transhumans and AGIs etc. become cleverer and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cleverer technically but fail to become cleverer and cleverer in terms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social competence.
</em><br>
<p>This is where my interest as been focused recently.  Applied evolutionary 
<br>
psychology and memetics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think this becomes a recipe for either vast conflict or for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control-based society that stops backlash by main force or manipulation.
</em><br>
<p>The poverty struck are not very likely to be able to do truely massive 
<br>
physical damage to a high tech society, but your point is well taken.  The 
<br>
cost of trying to keep box knife armed attackers under control is far 
<br>
higher and more trouble than trying to deal with the poverty 
<br>
problems.  Those problems *cannot* be cured unless population growth is 
<br>
brought under control.  The current US opposition to birth control in other 
<br>
countries is at cross purposes to their security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I personally think that the singularity would have the greatest chance for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a smooth ride if, on this side of the transition, we set out to make sure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(as far as one can given the uncertainties of life) that the benefits of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the change are directed substantially and sufficiently to making sure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world is a better place for all people.
</em><br>
<p>The alternatives are really grim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And to get things moving in that direction we have to start out with an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attitude of understanding and sympathy for the vast majority of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people.  And while acts of terrorism and brutality are not excusable at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all, I think it is important that we understand how society throws up such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people and behaviours.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  And how to back out of the resultant conflicts.  The fading of the 
<br>
troubles in Ireland is highly instructive if you look at the birth rates 
<br>
there over the past 30 years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; there will be no BUSINESS AS USUAL in an environment of such rapid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change -- the concept of &quot;as usual&quot; doesn't apply!!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;But this has been the case in bursts ever since the move from hunter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gathering to agricutlure-supported urbanism - and it's certainly been the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case since the industrial revolution.  These days 'business as usual' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never stays the same for long because 'business as usual' includes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological and social invention and innovation as an endogenous element.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Having minds that are able keep up with highly rapid change is NOT the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same as having minds that are adapted to stasis or slow change...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Human minds seem to be able to cope with BOTH highly rapid change and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stasis or slow change.  It's been a characteristic that has emerged 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressively over the last 2 million years (argued well in &quot;A Brain for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All Seasons: Human Evolution and Abrupt Climate Change by William H. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Calvin, 2003). The sofware side of people's brains (experience &amp; training) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can lead to minds attuned to either rapid change OR stasis/slow change - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but the hardware has potential to deal with both. My guess is that AGIs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could be like this too depending on how they are trained and the goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structures they have.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent book incidentally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So it still seems plausible to me that if one's mind can keep up with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speed of the singularity that day-to-day business will still involve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues of what to change, how to adapt, what to retain, how to integrate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the old and new, how to manage seen and unseen side effects of change.
</em><br>
<p>Without mental enhancements I really doubt it.  One of the viruses last 
<br>
year spread with a doubling rate of 8.5 second  to a population of about 
<br>
75,000 machines.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The funny thing about a lot of this discussion is that many people are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attracted to technology because its a domain of fun and power where you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can get away with not engaging with people (read that as advanced general 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligences).
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that to actually be the case.  High tech people are just as 
<br>
social as anyone else.  Where they have a hard time is engaging with people 
<br>
who are a lot less smart and knowledgeable than they are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But one of the critical outputs from this technological system will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(eventually) super-artificial general intelligences.  One of the things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that these entities will be really good at (if they choose to turn their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind in this direction) is managing hugely complex nets of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship.  Human societies are much more complex than other primate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies, I suspect, because we have the grey matter to manage a much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more complex social system.
</em><br>
<p>Am awful lot of the complexity is in the records we keep.  That's the 
<br>
result of a memetic invention and proliferation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So my guess is that if the singularity is driven by more than one AGI then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future that emerges will be one of even *more* complex social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems.  So a person trying to escape the complexities of engagement and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationships by going into the singularity is going in precisely the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong direction, unless they are hoping that that the new powers that be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will allow them (uploaded or not) to live a life of a disengaged recluse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the preifery of the new society.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.
