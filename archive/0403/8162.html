<p>If you can make a strong case I think it could be funded without much of a 
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>But I don't think anyone right now has a clear idea of what it would take 
<br>
to build an AI by other means than a simulation of a human brain.  (Correct 
<br>
me and send pointers if someone *does* know.)
<br>
<p>If I were to lay out a research project leading in the simulation 
<br>
direction, I would probably try to build on William Calvin's models of what 
<br>
is going on in the human cortex.  A few years ago I worked out how large an 
<br>
area of computers it would take to simulate the cortex, but I can't find 
<br>
anything so perhaps I didn't put it on the net.
<br>
<p>The human cortex surface area is about 1/4 square meters (half a meter on a 
<br>
side), packed solid in a hexagonal array with &quot;active elements,&quot; groups of 
<br>
about 100 neurons that act together in a 0.03 mm minicolumn.  (See page 29 
<br>
in _The Cerebral Code_,  webbed here: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/bk9/bk9ch2.htm">http://www.williamcalvin.com/bk9/bk9ch2.htm</a>)
<br>
<p>I think with some simplification the active elements (and their 
<br>
connections) could be simulated at a millisecond update rate with a 
<br>
specialized 1 square cm processor running at about a GHz and dissipating 
<br>
about ten watts.  (Current x86 processors are in this size and power range 
<br>
for this clock rate.)
<br>
<p>The linear expansion factor from 0.03 mm to 1 cm is about 300, so this 
<br>
would amount to a silicon surface of about 150 meters on a side--which is 
<br>
close enough to my memory of 200 meters on a side last time I worked it 
<br>
out.  There would be 10,000 processors per square meter, or 225,000,000 of 
<br>
them in total.
<br>
<p>Power would be interesting, 2.25 Gw--which is about 1/3 of the peak power 
<br>
output of Grand Coulee Dam.  At 2 cents a kwh, the power bill would be $50k 
<br>
an hour, or $400 million a year.  Cooling would be interesting 
<br>
too.  Cost?  If the processors were 1/10 of the total, and could be 
<br>
produced for $10 each (perhaps--processing silicon takes close to a dollar 
<br>
a square cm just for electricity) then such an AI project would run about 
<br>
$22 billion for hardware--which is only a thousand times off from Ben's 
<br>
estimate.
<br>
<p>Makes a human brain at 25 watts and fitting into a 1500cc skull *really* 
<br>
impressive.  It's on the order of 100 million more efficient in power and 
<br>
volume then current solid state hardware--which is fairly impressive itself!
<br>
<p>It would take some thinking about this kind of project, but the hardware 
<br>
organization might keep it from a &quot;takeoff.&quot;  Of course that makes it less 
<br>
useful as well as less dangerous.
