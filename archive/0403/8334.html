From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Singularity%20Institute%20volunteer%20meeting%20this%20Sunday%20@%207%20PM%20EST">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think we should stop using language such as 'waking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people up' to the Singularity. Eliezer, or anyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; here, has not figured out how to create FAI. I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; problem with FAI per se, but I find it unacceptable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that many on this list:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are welcome to your opinion.  Now what?  Does no one knowing fully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how to create FAI mean that we should not seek to acquaint people with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity?  How so?
</em><br>
<p>If we're all hoping for a 'Friendly' Singularity, then
<br>
there is no conflict between us.  I was wrong in that
<br>
I thought FAI is stupid (although I didn't say that) and
<br>
at the same time I also *want* to have morality.  Maybe
<br>
we ought to work towards figuring out an objective morality,
<br>
that's the most important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 1. Claim that FAI is feasible without qualifications
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and without detailing how it could be done;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do you mean by &quot;detail&quot;?  How much detail? This is a very complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;project and its is just the beginning.  Why would you expect to be able 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to fully detail a project of this ultimate complexity so early?   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Claims of feasibility may not require as much detail as you want to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasonable claims.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 2. Steadfastly avoid any political discussions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are obviously relevant to establishing a scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; theory of (general) morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmm.  I'm lost.  Political discussions are relevant to a scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory of morality?  Please explain.
</em><br>
<p>Politics is obviously relevant, especially if we are to
<br>
look at the 'data' in a scientific way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Be honest. There is no evidence that lying to people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; makes it better for them. Can you cite some examples?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is there evidence that insulting people, many of whom you very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obviously do no understand or understand their work,  works for you?
</em><br>
<p>I have repeatedly stressed I had no intention of insulting
<br>
anyone.  People may get the false impression because my
<br>
English isn't entirely natural and also I tend to be very
<br>
brief.  Sorry about that...
<br>
<p>The technical problem of designing AGI and the political
<br>
problem of dealing with intelligent automation are equally
<br>
important.  I try to understand both aspects and I'm also
<br>
taking time to study AGI designs by A2I2, Novamente, and SIAI.
<br>
