<p>
Jef,
<br>
<p>I don't accept the idea that empirical science and the &quot;third-person
<br>
perspective&quot; provides a simpler and more accurate explanation of
<br>
everyday human mental life, than folk psychology with its assumption of
<br>
&quot;experience&quot; and &quot;consciousness.&quot;   Science provides interesting
<br>
explanations for various features of my mental life, but folk psychology
<br>
tells much far more about experiences like getting hurt, dying, having
<br>
children, falling in and out of love, etc.
<br>
<p>Now, you might respond, &quot;Sure, explanations involving experience and
<br>
consciousness may be USEFUL in some contexts, even though the phenomena
<br>
of &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; don't &quot;exist&quot; in a fundamental
<br>
sense.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or, you could adopt a Nietzschean criterion of truth, in which &quot;true&quot; is
<br>
defined as &quot;useful to a given organism in achieving its goals.&quot;  In this
<br>
case, experience and consciousness are definitely part of human truth.
<br>
<p>Personally, I view the relationship between &quot;human understanding&quot; -- of
<br>
which folk psychology is a part -- and empirical science as one of
<br>
interdependency.  Science enhances and modifies our mutual human
<br>
understanding.  But human understanding underlies our belief in science,
<br>
by providing a prior distribution based on &quot;human judgments of
<br>
simplicity&quot;, which we use to ground the comparison of various scientific
<br>
theories.
<br>
<p>This feedback between science and human understanding has, as a special
<br>
case, the feedback between the scientific and experiential
<br>
(human-understanding-based) views of the mind.
<br>
<p>Among other things the Singularity may result in the resolution of this
<br>
dialectic between scientific and human understanding, via the creation
<br>
of minds for which there is no dichotomy between scientific and innate
<br>
cultural/psychological understanding.  I suspect that the &quot;theory of
<br>
mind&quot; possessed by such posthuman minds will incorporate -- and discard
<br>
-- aspects of our current first-person AND third-person theories, and
<br>
incorporate new aspects as well.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
