<p><p>No, it might be about &quot;as smart&quot; in some abstract sense, but not 500 
<br>
times more.  Again, you aren't getting a gigabyte of information 
<br>
encoded for every gigabyte of disk you have.  If the moon and stars 
<br>
aligned, and you wrote the almighty AI program, you would still be off 
<br>
by an order of magnitude efficiency-wise as a simple consequence of the 
<br>
kind of hardware you are using.   The number of bits I need to encode 
<br>
something and the number of bits I actually use are two very different 
<br>
things, even with a great deal of effort.
<br>
<p>But more importantly, counting disk, your memory is WAY too slow.  This 
<br>
is a good example of time complexity effectively killing the deal when 
<br>
space complexity is okay.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't think memory is going to be a problem for AI.  I think the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main problem is going to be trying to trade off memory against limited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processor power.
</em><br>
<p><p>What do you need all that processor for?
<br>
<p>The real hardware bottleneck is actually memory latency, and it is a 
<br>
pretty severe bottleneck.  Doesn't matter how fast your processor is if 
<br>
it is starved for data.  This has been discussed repeatedly in the 
<br>
archives of this list.  Even the best RAM subsystems found in commodity 
<br>
systems are treading on inadequate, never mind using disk swap.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You might be right.  I suspect though that you are misled.  I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the data and processors are mixed together in the brain in a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will be difficult to simulate in serial processors--assuming this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is actually needed for AI.
</em><br>
<p><p>Serial == Parallel.  Six of one, half dozen of the other.  
<br>
Mathematically equivalent in every way.
<br>
<p>The hard part of the simulation is getting the kind of effective 
<br>
latency that the brain gets when channeling everything through a small 
<br>
number of memory busses to a small number of processors.  The brain may 
<br>
be slow, but everything is local.  The brain &quot;processors&quot; can reference 
<br>
more objects in a second in aggregate than the fastest computers we 
<br>
make.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I am not sure there is evidence that neural networks have much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevance to biological brains.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't follow artificial neural networks, as I could probably be 
<br>
classified as a detractor of them.  I do occasionally take a look at 
<br>
biological neural structure stuff though.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If you are trying to do pattern matching with coefficients, isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that equivalent?
</em><br>
<p><p>Pattern matching with coefficients...?
<br>
<p>I'm doing something different, and something that has little relation 
<br>
(theoretical or coincidental) to ANNs.  It is more convergent with the 
<br>
biological structures and models, but this is accidental and 
<br>
unimportant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you have a couple of hundred million processors, which I think is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good number to consider, then each can have a few hundred bytes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without having to bother with compression.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is completely missing the point.  At that resolution, there is no 
<br>
compression.  But how do you store a megabyte of information 
<br>
efficiently in such a system?  There are many layers, and it isn't like 
<br>
you would want to do bit-slicing anyway.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think it is worth noting that the closest kind of projects to AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the Google search engine *are* massively parallel.
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, parallel == serial.  How &quot;massively parallel&quot; an application can 
<br>
be depends on the memory latency requirements between nodes.  For a lot 
<br>
of codes (including mine, unfortunately) you cannot do useful 
<br>
parallelization unless you have an inter-node latency on the order of 
<br>
&lt;1us.  This has been thoroughly discussed on supercomputing lists, and 
<br>
is also the reason huge ccNUMA supercomputers can *still* school a 
<br>
commodity computing cluster for many apps.
<br>
<p>This reflects the very unbalanced architecture of modern commodity 
<br>
computers.  Lots of processing power, but extremely poor at working on 
<br>
very large fine-grained data structures because of weak, slow memory.  
<br>
True supercomputers don't have this weakness and is why a Cray at 
<br>
800MHz can school a Pentium 4 by an order of magnitude on some codes, 
<br>
but they also cost a small fortune.  The brain, for all its weaknesses, 
<br>
is a well-balanced computing architecture.
