<p>Re this thread split from a snipped one by Yan King Yin.
<br>
<p>I think the subject of understanding how humans minds operate (in the 
<br>
service of genes) is significant this side of the singularity.
<br>
<p>It is clear that in times of war what we consider normal human rational 
<br>
thinking and behavior is badly degraded.  The reasons for this are rooted 
<br>
in our tribal evolutionary past and are not far from obvious to those up on 
<br>
evolutionary psychology.
<br>
<p>This relates to the primary subject of this list because our ability to 
<br>
manage the creation of friendly AIs in peaceful times is difficult enough; 
<br>
we don't need it to be any harder.  Thus considering how to keep human 
<br>
populations out of wars is at least marginally on topic.
<br>
<p>There is another reason to understand the evolutionary origin of 
<br>
psychological traits in evolved minds.  One approach to AI is simulation of 
<br>
natural minds.  It would be a disaster to upload a bunch and have them make 
<br>
war on the rest of us because we didn't understand how to keep them from 
<br>
entering &quot;war mode.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am in complete agreement that debating the merits of contemporary 
<br>
politics and events is off topic.
<br>
<p>A discussion of our pervasive psychological traits rooted in our deep 
<br>
evolutionary history might, however, make use of contemporary examples, 
<br>
such as the forces behind the origin of meme sets that are the source of 
<br>
highly disruptive recent events.
<br>
<p>But if there is opposition to this general line of discussion here, it can 
<br>
certainly be moved elsewhere.

<br>
<p>PS and sorry for not changing the subject line on my first response.
