Hi Ben/Keith,
<br>
<p>I've been taken to task for saying:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The funny thing about a lot of this discussion is that many people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attracted to technology because its a domain of fun and power where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get away with not engaging with people (read that as advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general intelligences). 
</em><br>
<p>Ben said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure this cliche' holds true very often anymore.  Personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of what I do all day is engage with people --- the Novamente
</em><br>
<em>&gt; team, customers for our businesses, my wife &amp; kids, etc.  I don't love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tech because I need to escape from people.  Perhaps some people do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but there are lots of asocial non-techies as well....  Perhaps this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cliche' of techies is no longer applicable? 
</em><br>
<p>Keith said: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe that to actually be the case.  High tech people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as social as anyone else.  Where they have a hard time is engaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with people who are a lot less smart and knowledgeable than they are. 
</em><br>
<p>OK, I was over-generalising. Sorry.  
<br>
<p>I guess what I'm reacting to is the us &amp; them-ishness of some of the 
<br>
discussion eg. we're smart, got the right ideas and there's all these 
<br>
dumb folk out there who just don't get it and are likely to get in the way.  
<br>
And that we should race ahead of these people and not bother 
<br>
engaging constructuvely with their concerns.
<br>
<p>My strong intuition is that we won't solve the problem of friendliness for 
<br>
AGIs and we'll increase the chance of the deliberate or inadvertant 
<br>
derailment of work leading to the Singularity if us/them thinking plays 
<br>
any significant part in our work or strategies.
<br>
<p>An idea I floated a little while ago was for us to work as if we had a 
<br>
'pact with humanity (and other life)' so that we continually shaped AGI 
<br>
and other singularity-orientated work to ensure a compassionate, 
<br>
respectful and helpful relationship with other people and living things.  I 
<br>
still think this would be a good idea to flesh out and put into action.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
