<p>
When is the earliest possible time in our universe
<br>
that a technological singularity could have occurred?
<br>
<p>Let’s examine the evidence and make some conjectures.
<br>
<p>In order to determine the theoretical earliest time we
<br>
need to know what the necessary precursors are for a
<br>
technological singularity is.  Since the Earth and the
<br>
emergence of our own civilization is the only example
<br>
we have, we’ll assume that life and therefore
<br>
technological civilization requires a planet as a
<br>
necessary prerequisite for a technological
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>So when were the first planets formed? Since planets
<br>
require heavy elements, the earliest possible time
<br>
would’ve been after the supernova explosion of a
<br>
first-generation star. The first generation of stars
<br>
started forming approximately 160 million years after
<br>
the Big Bang. The most short-lived of these stars were
<br>
the blue giants.  All first generation stars were
<br>
composed entirely of hydrogen and helium and no heavy
<br>
elements.  Thanks to nucleosynthesis in the cores of
<br>
these stars, all the heavier elements through Uranium
<br>
were first created during this time. After the first
<br>
of these blue stars exploded, all it’s material
<br>
including the heavy metals, formed the necessary
<br>
conditions for birthing stars with proto-planetary
<br>
systems.  
<br>
<p>According to this story,
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/science/space/10CND-PLAN.html?ex=1080277200&amp;en=01f45dab7c7c1289&amp;ei=5070">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/science/space/10CND-PLAN.html?ex=1080277200&amp;en=01f45dab7c7c1289&amp;ei=5070</a>=<br>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope found tantalizing evidence
<br>
that planets first appeared much earlier in cosmic
<br>
history, around 12.7 billion years ago, and therefore
<br>
may be more abundant than previously suspected.  
<br>
Since we know both the earth and sun are each 4.5
<br>
billion years old, the earliest possible earth like
<br>
planets could have appeared as early as 1 billion
<br>
years after the big bang.
<br>
<p>So from here we look at Earth’s history to ascertain
<br>
our final figure.  This is where a bit of guesswork is
<br>
required.
<br>
<p>For now, lets examine the historical record of life on
<br>
our planet. There is now observational evidence that
<br>
archaebacteria, the first type of life, were around as
<br>
early as 3.97 billion years ago.  For the next 2.2
<br>
billion years life on Earth consisted of nothing more
<br>
anaerobic bacteria and archaeans.  Then about 1.8
<br>
billion years ago eukaryotic cells appeared as fossils
<br>
too.  With the beginning of the Middle Proterozoic 1.8
<br>
billion years ago, comes the first evidence of oxygen
<br>
build-up in the atmosphere. This global catastrophe
<br>
spelled doom for many bacterial groups, but made
<br>
possible the explosion of eukaryotic forms. These
<br>
include multicellular algae, and toward the end of the
<br>
Proterozoic, the first animals.
<br>
<p>With the Cambrian Explosion soon after, all the major
<br>
phyla of life we see today emerged on to the scene. 
<br>
Between the Cambrian explosion and today, there have
<br>
been 5 great extinctions, the last of which was 65
<br>
million years ago, when 90% life including all the
<br>
Dinosaurs were wiped out by a comet. From this lowly
<br>
10% that was left emerged almost all the complex life
<br>
we see today.
<br>
<p>So the real question now is could this 3.97 billion
<br>
year history of life have evolved quicker?  We know
<br>
the first 2.2 billion years of life consisted of
<br>
nothing more than simple anaerobic bacteria and
<br>
archae, and the next 1.2 billion years single-celled
<br>
eukaryotic oxygen-breathing bacteria.  So for the
<br>
first 3.4 billion years the degree of evolutionary
<br>
change was almost non-existent. There is no reason to
<br>
suspect the emergence of eukaryotic cells couldn’t
<br>
have happened sooner, perhaps as earlier as a few
<br>
million years after the first bacteria.  The
<br>
mechanisms underlying these punctuated periods of
<br>
evolution are still largely unknown, so it’s mostly
<br>
conjecture.  But lets take a crack at it anyway.
<br>
<p>I think most of this period’s stagnation was the
<br>
result bad luck.  Perhaps the correct mutations
<br>
necessary for the emergence of multi-cellular life
<br>
simply have a very low probability of occurring.  We
<br>
know that quadrillions of bacteria were spread out all
<br>
over the earth, and only after 3.4 billion years of
<br>
random mutations and conditions eventually gave rise
<br>
to the first multi-cellular organisms.  If the result
<br>
is largely by chance, then life multi-cellular life
<br>
could have occurred shortly after life first appeared
<br>
at all.  Then again, mutli-cellular life could be so
<br>
rare, that only 1 out of a million bacteria bearing
<br>
planets gives rise to multi-cellular life during the
<br>
lifetime of its parent star.
<br>
<p>It’s quite possible that multi-cellular organisms
<br>
could have emerged as early as 3 billion years ago,
<br>
giving rise to the equivalent of the Cambrian
<br>
explosion 2.5 billion years earlier than it did.  This
<br>
leaves the last 543 million years after the Cambrian
<br>
Explosion until now.  Perhaps if we had a larger gas
<br>
giant in a orbit closer than Jupiter’s, there would
<br>
have also been less asteroid and cometary impacts
<br>
during this period, further accelerating the right
<br>
kinds of conditions for life to occur.   In the scheme
<br>
of things, this time frame is small enough that I
<br>
won’t compress it any further for the sake of this
<br>
essay, and assume that 500 million years is the
<br>
minimum time necessary for complex technological
<br>
civilization to evolve from the first appearance of
<br>
multi-cellular life forms.
<br>
<p>So assuming my 2.5 billion year compression of the
<br>
history of life is possible in a planetary system with
<br>
the right conditions, this means technological
<br>
civilization on the Earth could have occurred as early
<br>
as 2 billion years after the formation of Earth
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>Since we know that the first planets were forming as
<br>
early as 12.7 billion years ago, and using earth’s
<br>
history as our example, this means that the first
<br>
technological singularity could have occurred as early
<br>
as 10.7 billion years ago, or 3 billion years after
<br>
the Big Bang.   If we take out my conjectured time
<br>
compression of evolution, we add an additional 2.5
<br>
billion years, then we get 5.5 billion years after the
<br>
big bang, or 8.2 billion years ago.
<br>
<p>This leaves us with a theoretical minimum of 8.2 –
<br>
10.7 billion years ago when the first technological
<br>
singularity could have occurred.
<br>
<p>Comments, feedback, flaws?
