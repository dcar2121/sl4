<em>&gt; I made some seraches on Amazon.com and found very few general books on AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best I found to have a general view on the subject was &quot;Artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minds&quot; by Stan Franklin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also &quot;The Society of Mind&quot; by Marvin Minsky ,but than again this late one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems that hans't lead to anywhere in the last 20 years or so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I bought also &quot;Reinforcement Learning, an introduction&quot; by Stton and Barto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and found it very deep and difficult to undertsand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, there is Roger Penrose, which doesn't insterest me at all:
</em><br>
intelectual
<br>
<em>&gt; balooney.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the classic &quot;Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach&quot; by Stuart J.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my WISHLIST , I have &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Guide to Intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Systems&quot; by Michael Negnevitsky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, we can always search for specific themes like: agents, neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks and so on but the reality is that there are very few books on AI.
</em><br>
<p>That's not surprising, considering how large and diverse of a field AI is,
<br>
_Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach_, for example, is over 1,000
<br>
pages long and is just an introductory text; it doesn't go too far in depth
<br>
on anything, because any given chapter of that book would probably take
<br>
1,000 pages in itself to discuss the entire topic fully in-depth. You could
<br>
try narrowing your search to some subfield, to say, only
<br>
neural-network-based approaches.
<br>
<p>The best general AI books would probably be Douglas Hofstadter's, in
<br>
particular _Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies_, which discusses several
<br>
of Hofstadter and his student's AI projects, or _Analogy Making as
<br>
Perception_; the latter one not being a general AI book (it's all about
<br>
CopyCat), but nonetheless its a very important book for AI in general!
