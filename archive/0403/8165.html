<em>&gt;there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;in 2-3 years with an investment of $20 million for staff and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you can make a strong case I think it could be funded without much
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Keith, I am curious what funding sources you're thinking of.
</em><br>
<p>I know at least one computer savvy person who could write a check that large.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The major science and technology funding bodies in the US are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tightly tied into the &quot;narrow AI&quot; research programme and very skeptical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of radical approaches to AGI.  This is in spite of the fact that they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spent hundreds of millions of dollars on narrow AI programs (Cyc being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the flagship example ;-) without obtaining dramatic returns either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientifically or economically.
</em><br>
<p>That's not surprising considering how much computational power biology 
<br>
lavishes on the problem.  Have you ever looked up the MIPS rating of a retina?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, if by a &quot;strong case&quot; you mean a case that will convince AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skeptics such as the folks at the National Science Foundation -- I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this essentially means &quot;something like young-child-level human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence has been achieved and what remains is teaching of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system and refinement of the algorithms.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I would not need that level, but you need to sell me that you have a viable 
<br>
approach before I stick my neck out and try to convince people with money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have no doubt that once we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get to this point, ample funding will be available.  Also, by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point, the political issues associated with AGI will become important --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Luddites will start paying attention....
</em><br>
<p>Possibly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem is doing the work to get our AGI design (Novamente)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implemented and tested and tuned to the point of skeptic-convincing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;young-child-level human intelligence.  Getting the funding for this work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fortunately, the Novamente project *is* funded; however, the funding is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for commercial applications of the partially-complete codebase, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allows us to do some fascinating and important application work, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;push the AGI project along slowly, but not to proceed rapidly toward AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the way that we would attempt if we had pure AGI research funding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But I don't think anyone right now has a clear idea of what it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to build an AI by other means than a simulation of a human brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me and send pointers if someone *does* know.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Obviously, I think I do have a clear idea in this regard.  However, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI design has not been published or presented on the Internet.  We plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to publish a lot of material on Novamente sometime in the not too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distant future, probably early 2005 it looks like.  Writing up stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like this in a quality way is time-consuming, and time spent writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needs to be balanced against time spent doing.
</em><br>
<p>We might consider spending an hour or so in chat.  If nothing else, you 
<br>
could salvage the chat log for a written presentation material.
<br>
<p>I happen to be a bit skeptical that the hardware is up to the task based on 
<br>
arguments by Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil and others.  In the long run this 
<br>
is not a problem since hardware equal to the task is less than a human 
<br>
generation away.  If you have a radical approach that would allow cockroach 
<br>
level hardware to generate superhuman AI level performance, I would sure 
<br>
like to know what it is.
