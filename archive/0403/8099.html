<em>&gt; The key points are that there's a Universal Morality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has to have certain general charactertistics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's a personal morality, which has to have certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general characteristics, and all sentient minds are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined to be the interaction between UM and PM.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe we use the word differently, but morality to me is all about what
<br>
happens to others, regardless of what happens to you, it's about averaging
<br>
out suffering rather than sticking it to the least powerful. So I don't
<br>
believe such thing as a personal morality can ever exist.
<br>
Morality is universal, or it's not morality, just a goal system.
<br>
<p>I further cannot agree 100% that any rational being will come to the same
<br>
definition of morality.
<br>
An AI follows a goal system. if its goal system and architecture do not
<br>
allow it to create additional supergoals it will keep doing what it was told
<br>
to, getting smarter and smarter (gathering more information) but never
<br>
trying to do anything else than it was originally created to do.
<br>
<p>Now, I can support your statement with one and only one chain of reasoning
<br>
<p>- any sufficiently intelligent being necessarily has a model of self complex
<br>
enough to produce both qualia and the notion of having qualia
<br>
- such sentient would deduce value of other sentients' qualia since a
<br>
universe with only one qualia stream instanced in one brain is less likely
<br>
than a universe with a qualia stream per brain
<br>
- sentient would therefore come to see negative qualia as ultimate evil
<br>
through personal experience of such phenomena
<br>
<p>but I think a bunch of people won't agree with this, so how do you support
<br>
your statement?
