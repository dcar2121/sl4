Heya Paul!
<br>
<p>While a useful tool for understanding the Singularity, some aspects of 
<br>
the analogy between the rise of Homo sapiens and the possible rise of 
<br>
superintelligence worry me. John Smart (www.singularitywatch.com) has 
<br>
been using this analogy heavily since he appeared on the Singularity 
<br>
analysis scene, so my concerns with Pesce's analogy definitely apply to 
<br>
him as well.
<br>
<p>My first problem with the analogy is that it subtly implies a 
<br>
developmentally predetermined positive outcome to the Singularity, when 
<br>
this needn't be the case. The first recursively self-improving 
<br>
intelligence could easily be selfish, or obsessively focused on a goal 
<br>
whose accomplishment entails the destruction of humanity. In this 
<br>
scenario, the arrival of the Singularity needn't represent the &quot;next 
<br>
stage of intelligence and complexity in the universe&quot; in the positive, 
<br>
uplifting sense at all. A superintelligence devoted solely to 
<br>
manufacturing as many paper clips as possible could easily delegate all 
<br>
of its complexity and intelligence towards plans for the complete 
<br>
material conversion of the universe into self-sustaining paperclip 
<br>
manufacturing facilities, for example.
<br>
<p>Approaching the Singularity with the belief that &quot;the history of our 
<br>
universe has been a continuous ingression of intelligence into matter&quot; 
<br>
(as I originally did!) can give us a false sense of relief, a feeling 
<br>
that the overarching hand of meta-evolution is guiding us towards a 
<br>
desirable outcome. As it so happens, I do disagree that the universe has 
<br>
been unfolding in this way. The word &quot;intelligence&quot;, when unpacked, 
<br>
subtly signifies a substantial set of traits; problem-solving ability, 
<br>
carefulness, better choice of goals, conscientiousness, synergy with 
<br>
surroundings... even sociability, altruism, and fairness. Yet the vast 
<br>
majority of these traits are possessions of humanity alone. Passing 
<br>
these precise traits on to superintelligence will not be easy, but 
<br>
hopefully it is at least possible.
<br>
<p>The universe has steadily been increasing in complexity, yes. From the 
<br>
anthropic point of view, this makes perfect sense; a threshold level of 
<br>
complexity is clearly required for a universe to generate agents capable 
<br>
of observing it to begin with. But once the agents have come into being, 
<br>
there are not necessarily any promises for continued survival. The 
<br>
forces responsible for building stable forms in this universe across the 
<br>
eons do not give a damn about us, and would continue chugging along 
<br>
should we become extinct one day.
<br>
<p>My second problem with the analogy is that it actually seems to 
<br>
understate the potential magnitude of a successful Singularity. John 
<br>
Smart argues that the discrepancy in information-processing between 
<br>
major phase transitions (say, genetic and epigenetic information 
<br>
patterns) works out to around 10 million, but this difference actually 
<br>
seems minor in comparison to what a Singularity might bring. If human 
<br>
general intelligence is represented by our brains, and our brains weigh, 
<br>
on average, 1.3 kilograms, each processing roughly 10^17 ops/sec of 
<br>
information (whether all these operations are functionally relevant to 
<br>
symbol manipulation or general intelligence is heavily questionable), 
<br>
then the 100 billion or so humans that have existed throughout history 
<br>
add up to around 10^28 total ops/sec running on roughly 1.3 x 10^11 
<br>
kilograms of meat.
<br>
<p>Say that the first transhuman intelligence acquires a modest level of 
<br>
nanotechnology, like the rod-logics that Drexler described in 
<br>
&quot;Nanosystems&quot;, which process roughly 10^18 ops/sec with a single 
<br>
kilogram. Say that this transhuman intelligence quickly went off into 
<br>
the Solar System and grabbed a quantity of mass equal to about one 
<br>
thousandth the mass of the Earth. That works out to about 6 x 10^21 
<br>
kilograms. Say it then released self-replicating nanobots onto that 
<br>
mass, converting it into computing components to expand itself, upload 
<br>
people, run more intelligences...whatever. Already you have roughly 
<br>
10^39 ops/sec of computing power there. And with that amount of 
<br>
computation, surely someone would figure out how to build better 
<br>
computing elements, and gather more matter, and increase the overall 
<br>
intelligence of the general collective...
<br>
<p>My point here is that the Singularity radically outclasses any 
<br>
historical event, even when we make incredibly conservative assumptions. 
<br>
To me, making an analogy between the rise of general intelligence and 
<br>
the Singularity sounds like trying to make an analogy between a 
<br>
firecracker and the Big Bang. Any analogy will be appealing, but as far 
<br>
as I can tell, the Singularity seems to be an event which is *genuinely* 
<br>
new. Consider a hypothetical world where a large transition that occurs 
<br>
can objectively be said to lack any analogies. If humans lived in such a 
<br>
world, don't you think they would grasp for whatever analogies they 
<br>
could, just to achieve the sensation of cognitive closure? Obviously the 
<br>
ancestral environment didn't have anything remotely like the Singularity 
<br>
in it, so we're clearly adapted poorly to modeling changes of this size. 
<br>
Therefore I think it makes sense to be extremely careful in which 
<br>
analogies we choose to use, if any.
<br>
<p>Thanks for sharing this article with the list, in any case! I thought it 
<br>
was particularly interesting because it brings up the analogy of casting 
<br>
spells on the external world to achieve effects, an analogy I've been 
<br>
using carefully since I first discovered the concept of the Singularity. 
<br>
It's also nice to see a new prominent figure taking interest in the 
<br>
Singularity!

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;represents a punctuated rupture with at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical precedent - the birth of language, the jump
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from genetic to epi-genetic information transfer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Until Modern Humans emerged on the scene, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution was happening via DNA information transfer –
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a very slow glacial process of evolution.  At some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point in Homo sapiens evolution we developed symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation ability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is some snippits about the Singularity (a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long but interesting) from Mark Pesce, inventor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;VRML.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;~~~
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The thing that separates us from the Neanderthal isn’t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain size, or brute strength, but a symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation capability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In order to have symbols, you need to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness capable of symbolic manipulation, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to say a linguistic consciousness. While
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paleoanthropologists believe that the Neanderthal had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some very basic linguistic capabilities, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believed that these abilities were very limited –
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps similar in nature to those of a year-old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;child, capable of identifying objects or actions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What we see with homo sapiens is that this linguistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability overflowed into the entirety of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The first benefit of this was the emergence of what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand as language: nearly every human being has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an innate capability to take a few symbols and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulate them infinitely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For example, although few of us ever use more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about 2000 English words, we can describe just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything with those words, because we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instantaneously recombine them in any sensible order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to create new forms of expression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For 4 billion years, DNA was the recording mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of history, the memory of biology. As soon as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed language, we no longer needed the slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form of DNA for memory; we could use the much faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form of language, which produced with it a deep sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of memory within the individual – since the linguistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symbols could be contained within the human mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since we became a symbol-manipulating species, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forward evolution, in DNA terms, has come to a dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stop. (This has recently been proposed by reputable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists.) However, our linguistic capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allow us to perform acts of memory much faster than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DNA, probably at least 10 million times faster!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, suddenly, homo sapiens is not just a biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entity working within the matrix of DNA and its slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical recording, but now bursts through and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starts processing its interactions within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment 10 million times faster than ever before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For all of evolutionary time, information had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;travel the slow route through biology – through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bios - before it would be coded into our DNA. Now we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had this additional process – which we call the logos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Word – which was a completely new thing, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something that the bios had any time prepare for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;From its first recognizable moment, humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrates an entirely new relationship between bios
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and logos. Information, freed from its need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embedded in the slow, dense vehicle of our DNA, speeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up 10-million-fold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However – and this is the second most important point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I want to make today – the logos has its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teleology, its own entelechy, its own drive to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;final dwell-state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We assume that we are masters of language, of word and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The situation is exactly reversed. We are not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control of words, they control us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins got it entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right when he invented the concept of “memes,” which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be thought of as the linguistic equivalent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genes. Rather than being part of the bios, memes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the carriers of the logos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OK, so we’ve covered the emergence of the bios, some 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion years ago, and the emergence of the logos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps as much as 150 thousand years ago. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We, as a species, have been driven by memes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last hundred thousand years, and this has forced us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further and further away from any direct connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the natural world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We’re being hollowed-out by our memes. That is to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that our interiority, which is an artifact of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slow, quiet progression of the bios, is rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vanishing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The modern conception of interiority is really a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creation of the Enlightenment in Western Europe, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was only noted by philosophers as it was beginning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vanish utterly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So here’s the central point of what I wanted say: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singularity is absolutely inevitable, and absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaningless. The closest analogy we could make would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be the whine of feedback you get when you place a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microphone too close to an amplifier. The screech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drowns everything else out, just as what we are – as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals and culture – are being replaced by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rising form of activity dedicated to a single goal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making a clear path for the transmission of the logos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We’re improving the fidelity of meme swapping until it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asymptotically approaches its theoretical limits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The transmission of facts and ideas is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becoming instantaneous, and the speed of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development of novelty followed. When ideas move
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faster, there’s a greater capacity for them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interact, to produce concrescence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The history of the 20th century could accurately be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;described as a series of advancements in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communication, beginning with radio and ending with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Internet, each technology successively colonizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world, and each more rapidly than the technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technological artifacts are concretized language; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is, any technology is a bit of language that has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turned into a physical object.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The first technology that was turned into a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;object was the linguistic technology itself. Writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the first real technology of importance, because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freed linguistics from their oral substrate, and made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the carrier medium much more durable. We have an idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of history from 3500 BCE forward because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invention of writing, which has created a continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All other technologies, are, each in their way, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descendants of writing. Writing was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exteriorization of our drive to communicate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We’ve seen the linguistic acceleration of DNA as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;codes, and the linguistic acceleration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communication as telecommunication, but we’re only now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the threshold of the acceleration of technology. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Things may look as though they’re going fast now, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this is nothing – literally, absolutely nothing – next
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to what’s about to happen, because (and now we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precedent for it) we’re about to see a technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceleration on a similar order to the acceleration we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saw when the logos separated from the bios. In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case, techne, our ability, is about to be freed from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logos, our ability to describe it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do I mean when I say this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There’s an emerging science, known as nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which will, before the next few years have passed by,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give us a very fine-grained control over the material
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With nanotechnology we should be able to precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;design molecules to order, for whatever purpose we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might desire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is the coming linguistic revolution in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology, because, at this point, the entire fabric
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the material world becomes linguistically pliable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anything you see, anywhere, animate, or inanimate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will have within it the capacity to be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transformed by a rearrangement of its atoms into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another form, a form which obeys the dictates of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;linguistic intent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It’s very hard for us to conceptualize such a world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I have continuously been forced to draw on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;metaphors of world of magic for any near analogies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It will be as if we have acquired the ability to cast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spells upon the material world to achieve particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This isn’t to say that we’re about to acquire the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;omnipotence we normally ascribe to God, but that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abilities will be so far beyond anything we’re
</em><br>
<em>&gt;familiar with today that we have no language to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conceptualize them. No language at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And that search for a language to describe the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we’re entering is, I think, the grand project of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present civilization. We know that something new is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approaching.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So we have three waves, biological, linguistic, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological, which are rapidly moving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concrescence, and on their way, as they interact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce such a tsunami of novelty as has never before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been experienced in the history of this planet.
