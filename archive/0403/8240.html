<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But also oil and the non-democratic nature of the regimes has put very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;large amounts of money into the hands of some quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalist people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enabling them to bank roll extremist hate-based schools in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in Pakistan etc. and terrorist networks.
</em><br>
....
<br>
<p>I have had several Muslim students in the university English classes I
<br>
teach. They've come from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan and Iran. When
<br>
I've spoken to some of them out of class, I have found quite a range of
<br>
opinion. But one thing struck me about how they responded to one of the
<br>
assignments I give, which is to write a resume and cover letter. Among the
<br>
Saudi and Yemeni students, the only employers they ever consider working for
<br>
are the government-run combines (e.g., Aramco, which is a conglomerate with
<br>
business interests that go far beyond the oil industry; and government-owned
<br>
banks, which under Islam, are curious institutions since they are not
<br>
allowed to loan at interest).
<br>
<p>The corruption of the Saudi royal family is legendary. But in this, they are
<br>
certainly not unique. In trying to understand Muslims better, I have done
<br>
some reading. Among all the sources I've looked at, my personal favorite
<br>
(being the skeptic that I am) is &quot;Why I Am not a Muslim&quot; by Ibn Warraq (the
<br>
pen-name of a former Muslim now living in the West).
<br>
<p>My general conclusion is that Islam had enough diversity in its intellectual
<br>
history to offer models for Muslim societies that were far more open than
<br>
most today. Contemporary Muslim societies are backward-looking and resentful
<br>
of the gap between their former glory and their present squalor. Most are so
<br>
insular that they prevent their members from knowing what the rest of the
<br>
world is really like. (Obviously, the Muslim college students who have some
<br>
to the West are the exceptions.) According to the United Nations, more
<br>
foreign books were translated and published Greek in recent years than in
<br>
the entire Muslim world, which is hundreds of times larger.
<br>
<p>The other factor here is that the Muslim world has no industry and few
<br>
universities of any quality. Yet the elite live very well from oil revenues.
<br>
It seems to me that any society that depends on an extractive industry like
<br>
oil will tend to stratify into a super-rich elite and the vast majority who
<br>
will depend mostly on government hand-outs and state &quot;businesses&quot; for their
<br>
daily bread. That's not a situation conducive to free inquiry, innovation or
<br>
economic independence.
