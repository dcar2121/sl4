<em>&gt; But all this is just using XML as a *data language*, not using it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store procedures.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;But your procedures ARE data.  Why not store/transfer them like your other
<br>
data?  Isn't this exactly the unhelpful dichotomy that always seems to get
<br>
in the way of recursive self-improvement?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still, this is using XML for data storage.  While Atoms defining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures may be stored in this way, they're being manipulated on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very coarse level (i.e. being categorized according to general qualities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like topic area, period of time in which they were used, etc.).  They're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not being manipulated &quot;as procedures&quot;, used to generate new procedures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML is, in my view, a pain in the butt for this purpose.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree that you don't want to manipulate procedures when they're in
<br>
their XML form - - you'd clearly load them into their data structures first.
<br>
I'm not sure that I understood your comment about &gt; not being manipulated
<br>
&quot;as procedures&quot;, used to generate new procedures, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't share Samantha's LISP evangelism -- I like LISP in principle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but personally I find it a bit annoying.  I prefer Haskell if I'm going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use a functional language.  And I love Refal in principle, though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't done much coding in it.  For Novamente, we chose C++ because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were paranoid about scalability to deal effectively with massive amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memory....
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;LISP is interesting and good to know.  EVERYONE who wants to argue
<br>
languages
<br>
should be FORCED to learn Prolog (the only language where I've had the
<br>
experience of programming awkwardly in it until I actually FELT something
<br>
twist in my head and then suddenly programming it felt and was natural . . .
<br>
:-).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A curious question - - &gt; Are you planning to build Sasha on top of Haskell
<br>
or in C++?
<br>
<p>Refal has a ton of cool features but also looks unnecessarily verbose at
<br>
times.  I don't know whether it is to support the optimization for
<br>
supercompilation or to support some of it's other neat features but it seems
<br>
as if some of the verbosity could be eliminated in favor of
<br>
behind-the-scenes expansion (i.e. could you support all of Refals features
<br>
with the programmer using Haskell-type syntax).  I'm probably missing a lot
<br>
here though.
