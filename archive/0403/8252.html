Hi Michael,
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;My first problem with the analogy is that it subtly
</em><br>
implies a developmentally predetermined positive
<br>
outcome to the Singularity, when this needn't be the
<br>
case. The first recursively self-improving
<br>
intelligence could easily be selfish, or obsessively
<br>
focused on a goal whose accomplishment entails the
<br>
destruction of humanity.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Yes, this is definitely true, and Mark Pesce and I
<br>
agree with you.  Mark has said that the bios was not
<br>
prepared for the emergence of the logos.  We could
<br>
look at current species extinction as analagous
<br>
evidence of what you are saying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;In this scenario, the arrival of the Singularity
</em><br>
needn't represent the &quot;next stage of intelligence and
<br>
complexity in the universe&quot; in the positive, 
<br>
uplifting sense at all. A superintelligence devoted
<br>
solely to manufacturing as many paper clips as
<br>
possible could easily delegate all of its complexity
<br>
and intelligence towards plans for the complete 
<br>
material conversion of the universe into
<br>
self-sustaining paperclip manufacturing facilities,
<br>
for example.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>I agree this is a possibility, however I think the
<br>
reality will be vastly more complex than that.  The
<br>
question then is will this new emergent complexity be
<br>
friendly in any sense we can fathom, or will we be
<br>
consumed or destroyed by it?  I don’t think anyone
<br>
knows what the answer to that is, and as Mark Pesce
<br>
says it is the greatest challenge we face.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;The universe has steadily been increasing in
</em><br>
complexity, yes. From the anthropic point of view,
<br>
this makes perfect sense; a threshold level of 
<br>
complexity is clearly required for a universe to
<br>
generate agents capable of observing it to begin with.
<br>
But once the agents have come into being, 
<br>
there are not necessarily any promises for continued
<br>
survival. The forces responsible for building stable
<br>
forms in this universe across the eons do not give a
<br>
damn about us, and would continue chugging along 
<br>
should we become extinct one day.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Again, agreed.  Nothing in Mark Pesce’s thinking would
<br>
disagree with that.  This is precisely the problem
<br>
that worrying him the most.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;My second problem with the analogy is that it
</em><br>
actually seems to understate the potential magnitude
<br>
of a successful Singularity.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>I don’t see where he does that.  All Mark says is that
<br>
the next change is beyond anything our language can
<br>
fathom, and that is at least as big as the jump from
<br>
bios to logos.  His 10-million fold figure was only
<br>
pertaining to the speed of logos over bios, not techne
<br>
over logos.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;My point here is that the Singularity radically
</em><br>
outclasses any historical event, even when we make
<br>
incredibly conservative assumptions. To me, making an
<br>
analogy between the rise of general intelligence and 
<br>
the Singularity sounds like trying to make an analogy
<br>
between a firecracker and the Big Bang. Any analogy
<br>
will be appealing, but as far as I can tell, the
<br>
Singularity seems to be an event which is *genuinely* 
<br>
new. Consider a hypothetical world where a large
<br>
transition that occurs can objectively be said to lack
<br>
any analogies. If humans lived in such a 
<br>
world, don't you think they would grasp for whatever
<br>
analogies they could, just to achieve the sensation of
<br>
cognitive closure? Obviously the ancestral environment
<br>
didn't have anything remotely like the 
<br>
Singularity in it, so we're clearly adapted poorly to
<br>
modeling changes of this size. Therefore I think it
<br>
makes sense to be extremely careful in which analogies
<br>
we choose to use, if any.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Exactly.  That was Mark Pesce’s whole point!  He said
<br>
the coming changes are so great the completely
<br>
outstrip ANY linguisitic model we could possibly hope
<br>
to attach to them.
<br>
<p>Quoting him again here,
<br>
&quot;
<br>
And that search for a language to describe the world
<br>
we’re entering is, I think, the grand project of the
<br>
present civilization. We know that something new is
<br>
approaching.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;So we have three waves, biological, linguistic, and
<br>
technological, which are rapidly moving to
<br>
concrescence, and on their way, as they interact,
<br>
produce such a tsunami of novelty as has never before
<br>
been experienced in the history of this planet.&quot;
