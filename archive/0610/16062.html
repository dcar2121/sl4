Another neat article, describing how presenting binocularly-masked
<br>
subliminal nude images improved performance on a visual discrimination
<br>
task. The nude images only improved performance if they fit the
<br>
subject's sexual orientation. This makes me wonder if having a
<br>
background software process which periodically flashed nude images
<br>
fight-club-style would help or hinder productivity... ;)
<br>
<p>(If anybody can locate the original PNAS article for this, could you
<br>
post a link here?)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID=000B6DFA-316D-153D-B16D83414B7F012F">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID=000B6DFA-316D-153D-B16D83414B7F012F</a><br>
<p>&quot;Cognitive neuroscientist Sheng He of the University of Minnesota and
<br>
his colleagues gathered groups of heterosexual men, heterosexual
<br>
women, homosexual men and bisexual women numbering 10 each. Each
<br>
viewed special images pointed directly at each individual eye. The
<br>
researchers could cancel out vision of one eye's image by presenting a
<br>
specific high contrast image to the other eye. Such an image, called a
<br>
Gabor patch, consists of a series of contrasting lines that form an
<br>
abstract--and visually arresting--shape. &quot;Normally, the two eyes look
<br>
at the same image. They don't have any conflict,&quot; he explains. &quot;We
<br>
create a situation where the two eyes are presented with two images,
<br>
and then they will have binocular competition. One image is high
<br>
contrast [and dynamic], the other is static. You basically just see
<br>
the dynamic image.&quot;
<br>
<p>Into the canceled out image slot, the researchers slipped an erotic
<br>
image; for example, a naked woman displayed for a heterosexual man. To
<br>
ensure that subjects did not consciously detect the invisible image,
<br>
they were asked to press a specific key if they noticed any difference
<br>
between the left and right images. Over the course of 32 trials, men
<br>
were significantly better at detecting the orientation of Gabor
<br>
patches when they appeared in the slot formerly occupied by an
<br>
invisible image of a nude woman.
<br>
<p>The heterosexual men, however, had a more difficult time detecting the
<br>
same orientation when it was located where an invisible picture of a
<br>
nude man had been; this was not the case for heterosexual women when
<br>
viewing their own sex naked. And the homosexual men's response was
<br>
similar to that of the heterosexual women, as were the bisexual
<br>
women's and heterosexual men's. This focus benefit did not carry over,
<br>
however, when the participants were allowed to consciously see the
<br>
naked photos, the researchers report in the paper published online in
<br>
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. It may have been
<br>
that the erotic images were on display too long, they speculate;
<br>
previous studies have shown that it is difficult to maintain attention
<br>
in one spot. Or it could be that social or cultural norms take over.
<br>
&quot;Maybe you don't want to look at the nude pictures,&quot; he suggests.
<br>
Regardless, it appears that our minds are exquisitely tuned to detect
<br>
sexual opportunity--especially when it is invisible. &quot;
