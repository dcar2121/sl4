I'm confident that many people are still reading this list, but like me, are
<br>
experiencing a crush of work-related events that preclude extended email
<br>
postings to many of the lists to which we subscribe.
<br>
<p>Just wait. Eventually the dam will break and a flood of messages will wash
<br>
into your in-box.
<br>
<p>Regards,

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears people have got bored with what I was saying - I should not
<br>
have mentioned that Penrose thinks the mind is nonalgorithmic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I don't think anyone is saying anything on this list.
<br>
Maybe we did miss the rapture... so the singularity isn't a expanding sphere
<br>
of computronium eh?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An upload requires somewhere from a roomful to a buildingful of
<br>
computers; it can't run over a wide area cluster, the bandwidth is far too
<br>
slow. Therefore it's sessile and highly dependent on the biological humans
<br>
maintaining the equipment; it can't so much as sneeze without permission.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't this apply equally to AIs?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. With the caveat that an AI could be designed so that certain
<br>
subtasks - search in particular - can be factored out over high-latency
<br>
links (so the individual nodes could be separated by large distances). But
<br>
there is no reason to believe all or even most of an AI could run at useful
<br>
speed over such links.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain shows an ability to repair itself and grow, an upload
<br>
should also be able to.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. But brains don't ascend to godhood overnight (not in the
<br>
material universe anyway!) and there's no evidence an upload would be able
<br>
to either.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think it more  likely that uploads are either illegal  or
<br>
not recognised by the law as alive.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly wouldn't rule out either of those possibilities.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair enough, but there are many technologies that are more dominant
<br>
then people thought as well.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as?
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is
<br>
possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful
<br>
with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I need to dig up the quotes from that era about how human-level AI
<br>
was going to be achieved by the year 2000? :)
