<em>&gt; &gt;or preventing the code from executing.  Any existing languages got that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;feature, which is simply first on the list?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically you would need into integrate a Java decompiler and a Java
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compiler into your program so that it can decompile and compile you programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at run-time but that shouldn't be too hard - there are a lot of open source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java decompilers and compilers.  Without any changes to the Java compiler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might lose the names of the non-exposed variables and functions but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that if you have control of the Java compiler you can keep them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'll probably want to turn off all the optimizations that the compiler can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do in order that the decompiled code looks like the original code.
</em><br>
<p>Guess what, Ben, I once wrote a piece of code that did that, too, and
<br>
NIINF.  &quot;No, It Is Not Flare.&quot;  I do not want to have to compile, much
<br>
less decompile and recompile, a .class file every time I want to make a
<br>
single change.  The idea is absurd.  If I was going to create that kind of
<br>
hack, I would use regular expressions and write my own Perl parser in
<br>
Perl.  Better yet, I would use Common LISP.  The only reason I wrote a
<br>
piece of code that compiled and decompiled class files was to try and
<br>
create a Java interpreter in Java, back when Java first came out, before
<br>
Java had a java.lang.reflect feature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How to implement this programmatically?  I would suggest a &quot;function lock&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or an &quot;object lock&quot; mechanisms kind to how one locks memory in a shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory system (although you could get the parse tree without locking it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locking is only required for modifying it).  During the time it is locked if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one tries to execute it an exception will be thrown.  Soon as you unlock a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function or object it will be re-compiled.  This would require a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modification of the VM but not a huge amount.
</em><br>
<p>And now we're supposed to be modifying the VM too?!
