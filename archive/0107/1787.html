Subject: Languages and AI
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   A few months ago there was a discussion on this list about the utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and appropriateness of various languages for coding the ultimate AI.
</em><br>
<p>I've tried to look in the archive, but since there is no text search
<br>
function (is there?) I read a whole bunch of interesting articles and got
<br>
side-tracked quite often. My current job really, really sucks is all I have
<br>
to say!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Right now there is a lot of talk about new languages and platforms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically designed to facilitate strong AI programming.  Using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right tools for a task is certainly crucial, and I do agree that comparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing languages and designing new ones to aid AI programming is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthy activity.
</em><br>
<p>I would still even question the worthiness of designing new ones at this
<br>
time. High-level languages makes a human programmer's job of instructing a
<br>
computer much easier than coding in platform-specific assembly (with or
<br>
without macros). A HLL is an isomorphism between the programmer's knowledge
<br>
of the problem domain sequence of processes, and the instructions that a
<br>
CPU(s) natively execute (except maybe programming at the microcode level).
<br>
Will a Seed AI optimize its own source using a HLL, or in machine code? I
<br>
assume the latter! No doubt it would be a lot easier to program a Seed AI
<br>
using a &quot;good&quot; HLL, but there are so many of them already available, whether
<br>
they be procedural, object-oriented, annotated, declarative, parallel,
<br>
vector, etc. Once a Seed AI starts running, there is no more use for the
<br>
programmer with a HLL is there?
<br>
<p>I noticed a very brief thread in the archives about the TUNES project
<br>
www.tunes.org . The FAQ describes its implementation
<br>
<a href="http://tunes.org/Tunes-FAQ-6.html">http://tunes.org/Tunes-FAQ-6.html</a>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
So our mid-term goals would be to work out the initial bootstrapped system
<br>
into such a generic metaprogramming platform that can be used not just to
<br>
dynamically compile itself into binary, but to do arbitrary meta-level
<br>
manipulations of arbitrary structures into arbitrary other structures. On
<br>
the syntactic front, we'd begin manipulating lowly HTML and XML, then jump
<br>
on to more arbitrary grammars, including subsets of other programming
<br>
languages, as well as any ad-hoc stuff we need to interoperate with the
<br>
external world. This could be the basis for semi-automatically interfacing
<br>
with code from other systems, or even semi-automatically stealing it,
<br>
starting with the nicer ones and moving toward more complexity (Scheme,
<br>
Haskell, CAML, Mercury, Common LISP, Java, etc., culminating with C; C++ is
<br>
too horrid to ever salvage C++ code into TUNES).
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
And of course there is a whole lot more detail. I hope that these guys
<br>
succeed with this project.
<br>
<p><p>As for portability among platforms, maybe an evolved Seed AI would program
<br>
in Java bytecode, and each platform would compile for optimization. Long
<br>
live Java! ;-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I am going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violate all sorts of copyrights and stuff, and post a short excerpt from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hofstadter's excellent book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; which I found quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant:
</em><br>
<p>Was this in &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot; too? This excerpt sounds very familiar.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program was written not in Lisp but in a language called SAIL, very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different in spirit from Lisp.  Nonetheless, it could easily have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written in Lisp.  The reason it doesn't matter is simply that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific questions of how the mind works are on a totally different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level from the statements of any computer language.  The ideas transcend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the language.  &quot;
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that Dougie would be pleased to know that I couldn't agree with him
<br>
more on this. In GEB, one of the dialogue chapters is various linguistic
<br>
translations of a poem by someone famous and I think is titled &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;
<br>
(excuse my ignorance, but, I'm ignorant). When the text was translated from
<br>
its original language into another, then back again (to English I think),
<br>
the &quot;meaning&quot; was effectively lost due to the translation process. If we try
<br>
to program a brain in anything other than a completely isomorphic langauge
<br>
to machine code, i.e. platform-specific assembly language, I fear there is a
<br>
risk that using a HLL that something will be missing in the translation by
<br>
the compiler, or even the OS, that would inhibit the AI being realized.
<br>
<p>How does &quot;all your base are belong to us.&quot; translate back into Japanese?
<br>
(and then back into English since I don't know Japanese.)
<br>
<p><p>I also feel that there must be an alternative to a linguistic approach to
<br>
programming. Entering text is a very sequential operation. This seems
<br>
natural, because human thoughts are _usually_ linguistic, regardless of how
<br>
many languages you speak. This is also the key to speed-reading, btw, is to
<br>
override the way we've all been taught to read subvocally (speak the text in
<br>
our mind instead of vocally) according to Evellyn Wood, but I digress... A
<br>
picture tells a thousand words, or maybe more technically, a whole lot of
<br>
implicit metadata. This is why pictures are more appealing than text that
<br>
holds exactly the same amount of information. Even thinking about objects
<br>
versus structs, or XML DOM versus SAX event model, a hierachical model
<br>
introduces a visual element to our thoughts. Why can't we develop a visual
<br>
HLL, or a High Level Visualization programming language? I have suggested
<br>
UML in a previous email. I don't know of any others.
<br>
<p><p>cheers,
<br>
