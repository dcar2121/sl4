<em>&gt; From: &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@webmind.com?Subject=RE:%20Languages%20and%20AI">ben@webmind.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why on earth do you folks want logical control to be expressed in XML,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway?
</em><br>
<p>For my purposes, I want to be able to visualize code, reading a 
<br>
common description of language independent algorithmic components.
<br>
XML makes a nice common format that will have lots of tools
<br>
available for manipulation. And is powerful enough to represent
<br>
most any data structure I can think of.
<br>
<p>There are several things I find interesting to do with this:
<br>
<p>1) Create graphical animated *INTERACTIVE* representations of what
<br>
transpires during program execution. This will help other programmers
<br>
see what's going on (we are a heavily visual species) and will help
<br>
in the same way that patterns form a common understandable mental
<br>
models. The structure of programs, with all their dependencies is not
<br>
captured all that well by mere text (though text can be a great way 
<br>
to enter programs). Programs themselves should be thought of and
<br>
manipulated as rich data structures! (ie. graphs of interdependencies,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p>2) Map to all other programming languages (both ways, ie.
<br>
bijunction).
<br>
<p>3) Once a nascent programmer AI starts spitting out programs of
<br>
ver own, I'd really want to be able to understand them. Pretty,
<br>
animated pictures which hilight dependencies and causalities
<br>
seems like the best thing to me. If mappings existed to other
<br>
programming languages, the AI could start studying the body of
<br>
open source software to determine what is useful and what isn't.
<br>
With the parse tree also in XML (ie. Flare as Eli suggests), the
<br>
AI learning to code would have access to making all sorts of
<br>
optimizations at all levels.
<br>
<p>Again this is just a personal interest of mine. Why might the 
<br>
world want control structures in XML? Portable computing. I send
<br>
you a codelet. You parse it and run it. Very fluid. It would be
<br>
the ultimate extension of write once, run anywhere.
<br>
<p>The goal is not merely to be able to represent these control
<br>
structures, but to build a world wide infrastructure that uses
<br>
these (yes, binary is better, but to define them we want XML
<br>
and then we can come up with binary analogues). 
<br>
<p>Refal as XML is a first step. I might be able to use that as a 
<br>
starting point. I'm not sure this is available to me as a free
<br>
open source programming environment. So maybe I should check. 
<br>
Since I think Friendly AI is really important, I'd rather help
<br>
the Flare cause if it helps Eli (since then maybe I'd be able
<br>
to play at least a miniscule role is leading to the Singularity).
