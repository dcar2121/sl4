<p>Yes, I dwelled on this when I wrote the message. I was slightly pressed for 
<br>
time when I wrote the message, otherwise I would have tried to find a 
<br>
suitable message in there.
<br>
<p>Also, since Jack seems to be new to this list, I wasn't sure that he even 
<br>
knew that the SL4-list had an archive (correct me if I'm wrong here, I 
<br>
didn't at first) so the link was also meant as a way to see what has been 
<br>
discussed in the past (not only about the topic in question).
<br>
<p>[rummaging trough the archives]
<br>
<p>Oops... It would seem that this topic hadn't been brought up before on the 
<br>
SL4 list. However, I would wager that most people on this list would agree 
<br>
that AI beats IA for various reasons (for example the ones in my message).
