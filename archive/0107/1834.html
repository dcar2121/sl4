Ok, here's my current take on this.
<br>
<p>Case 1: We don't actually need human type intelligence to have a super 
<br>
'smart' AI that can protect us from ourselves.  Think air-bags.
<br>
We just continue with what we are doing, and work to integrate software 
<br>
into more and more of the world.
<br>
<p>Case 2: Network everybody.  People worry about privacy, etc... when you 
<br>
talk about that, but here's a thought &quot;Who *needs* privacy?&quot;
<br>
I see very little chance of humanity surviving in it's current form for the 
<br>
next 100 years.  If we just wire (or wireless) everyone's heads together, 
<br>
and allow everybody to have access to everyone else's wet-ware, we could 
<br>
watch out for people thinking about doing bad things with nanotech, 
<br>
etc...  Sure, there will be neural-hacking going on, but maybe that's ok 
<br>
too.  Maybe it will come down to the top 1000 hackers in the world running 
<br>
everyone else's brain... sure things would be different, but at least we 
<br>
wouldn't all be dead.  (Probably with all of that computing power, those 
<br>
1000 'people' would be very very smart too... aka you will be assimilated 
<br>
(but it's ok - hacker ethics and all :-)).
<br>
<p>Case 3: Launch an all out nuclear war.
<br>
Knock us back to the stone age, and let the cycle begin again.  Doesn't 
<br>
sound too fun, but it might buy us some time.
<br>
(This is a last resort only to be used on the eve of someone releasing a 
<br>
DNA munching nanobot.)
<br>
<p>Case 4: Launch very fast (FTL?) generational space ships.  Colonize between 
<br>
the stars (or better yet between the galaxies).
<br>
Problem with this is that at this point it takes a LOT of resources to do 
<br>
it.  The key is to not to tell anybody where you're going.  It's never 
<br>
going to be enough save everybody on Earth, but it will ensure that humans 
<br>
go on living somewhere... maybe someday to comeback with The AI.
<br>
<p>I'll leave it at that, but I'm sure there are hundreds more.  I've tried to 
<br>
list these in order of feasibility.  And, from what it looks like there are 
<br>
people in the world working on all of the above cases, so I do feel 
<br>
confident that humanity will 'survive'.
<br>

<br>
<p>PS I never try to say anything original, so if you find something valid 
<br>
above, then it's probably stolen from someone else.
