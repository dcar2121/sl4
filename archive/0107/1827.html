</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know.  That was exactly my point - that Moore's Law might break
<br>
down completely, and yet computers would go on smoothly increasing in
<br>
cost/performance with scarely a blip.  If this happened, everyone would
<br>
immediately begin speaking of Moore's Law as if it strictly controlled
<br>
cost/performance and had never had anything to do with transistor sizes. 
<br>
If transistor counts kept increasing but systems also started shipping
<br>
with multiple CPUs, Moore's Law might technically remain intact but would,
<br>
from the perspective of a computer buyer, suddenly appear not as a steady
<br>
acceleration but as a speed limit that had been broken (!).
<br>
<p>Moore's Law is now really a social observation rather than a technical
<br>
one, and is used that way almost universally; it generalizes so readily to
<br>
so many observed phenomena in the computing industry that one speaks of
<br>
&quot;Moore's Law for performance per dollar&quot; or &quot;Moore's Law for disk
<br>
drives&quot;.  As I don't work for Intel, I have now accepted this and have no
<br>
trouble with, e.g., Ray Kurzweil's graph showing the operation of &quot;Moore's
<br>
Law since 1900&quot; for clerks, mechanical calculators, vacuum tubes, and
<br>
transistors.
<br>
<p>Moore only *thought* his Law was about transistors.  Imagine if Isaac
<br>
Newton had first observed that apples fall at a constant acceleration, and
<br>
formulated Newton's Law as &quot;The velocity of a freely falling apple changes
<br>
by a constant amount in a given unit of time.&quot;  Would we still be speaking
<br>
of Newton's Law as if it applied only to apples?
