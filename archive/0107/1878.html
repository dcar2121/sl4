Hate to point this out, but unless one of us becomes significantly 
<br>
independently wealthy, any &quot;Real AI&quot; project will almost certainly be 
<br>
backed by corporate financing.  So a &quot;Red Button&quot; is not going to be a 
<br>
viable option most likely.  Maybe the technical head of the team may have 
<br>
some secret trojan that would wipe out the code on command, but there will 
<br>
be backups (probably some of them off-site), etc.  On the other hand, most 
<br>
corporations don't like the idea of having their code available to the 
<br>
public either.  So I imagine it would be fairly well protected.
