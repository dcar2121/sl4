</em><br>
<p>Ok, Brian.  We've been going back and forth and you have yet to even touch 
<br>
on a response when I ask you the same type of question.  So what is the 
<br>
design for general AI?  Please provide us with all the nifty details so 
<br>
that we can actually compare the neural path with the general AI path and 
<br>
make some informed projections.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Who said that neural implants would have a low probably of working with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individual patients?  What is your specific argument against such a thing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In order to develop a powerful implant that will work for a wide range
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of individuals, there would have to be a huge amount of work and testing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done over a long period of time. And then even if it gets to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of being sold commercially, what's to prevent the users who develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some kind of symptoms or actual disease from suing them ala the breast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implant women? They all had some symptoms which it turns out were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really related to the implants. Yet they successfully sued the crap out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Dupont. Can you imagine the kinds of lawsuits people might come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with for brain implants? The kind of subjective diseases and symptoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they could convince a jury of? It all looks way too risky from what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see, and I reiterate that I find it hard to believe a large company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would really try to develop it.
</em><br>
<p>Would they be worse than the lawsuits for spilling hot coffee?  I've also 
<br>
noted that you can still buy breast implants, so their must be profit in it 
<br>
despite the suits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The vast majority of potential users will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;pretty satisfied with external wearable apparatus, and I think this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;where the real action will be. Many of the things you want can be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;with wearables- you only need to get access to the internals if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;to really try and increase the raw intelligence or speed of thought or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;direct memory capacity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Access to last three things is the Holy Grail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For us yes, but is there a real market out there today for it?
</em><br>
<p>YES!  Oh, come on now, your going to tell us that you wouldn't want such an 
<br>
implant yourself?  Honestly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Actually there are some people around here that think they know that. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;simply haven't proven it yet. This is quite different again than the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of progress in RNIs where no one really has any idea yet how to do much at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;all besides linking a few neurons to a computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would posit that you actually have no clue as to what the state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then educate me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can you show me some research involving more than a few neurons? Can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show me some research explaining how it will be possible to wire a RNI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to my brain such that it increases my raw intelligence, memory, or speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of thought?
</em><br>
<p>Please do likewise Brian.  Can you tell us how it will be possible to 
<br>
create a General AI?  What the design for a seed AI that can reach general 
<br>
AI will be?  How an AI will be able to improve itself to the point of 
<br>
reaching the Singularity?  How friendliness will be implemented in these 
<br>
and what the ultimate result of it will be post Singularity?  Even how we 
<br>
can test a pre Singularity general AI to ensure that it is friendly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Who said the bulk on the processing power must be done on person... maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one has an uplink to off person processors?  I don't see any hard limits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the processing power available to a human with a neural interface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Could be, especially if you are willing to stay wired up instead of free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;roaming. How much bandwidth do you think it would take to maintain &quot;oneness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between your bio-brain and the computer-chunk of your mind, and would it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be possible to disconnect from the computer even when 99% of the processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is being done there? Or would parts of your mind migrate over to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computing hardware, leaving you unable to function without it in place...
</em><br>
<p>So, how much bandwidth will broadband wireless connections have in 2020?
