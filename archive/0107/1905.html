</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please understand that cloning was banned because it is currently quite

</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to induce hundreds of pregnancies that failed in various ways?  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banned it because even though it wasn't safe people were stilling willing to

<em>&gt; try it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't buy that argument. I think that argument is an excuse that they
<br>
are using to ban it, but their real reasons lie in morality/ethics/
<br>
religion/squeamishness/fear. This reminds me of the precautionary
<br>
principle used by anti-tech Greens- things should be banned until they
<br>
can be proven 100% safe. How are we supposed to improve the process if
<br>
the research is banned?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I expect that non-FDA/FTC approved implants will be banned as well.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like non-FDA/FTC artificial hearts are currently banned from being implanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into humans.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt you would ever get an intelligence enhancing device approved
<br>
by such an organization, assuming of course you were even allowed to
<br>
develop it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Exactly, it may well be impossible to come up with a one-size fits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;technology for something as uniquely individual as the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It probably is possible to come up with something that is similar to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-size-fits-all model?  What is your specific argument against such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing?
</em><br>
<p>I'll take the Higgins approach and say &quot;show me the money&quot; here. The
<br>
ball is in your court to explain to us how a generic implant could be
<br>
developed that would be able to automagically adapt itself to each
<br>
individual's brain wiring. From what I see going on currently it takes
<br>
a lot of effort to locate even a few interesting neurons in a patient.
<br>
As for automatically wiring up many many more neurons in just the right
<br>
way, how will that work?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;company will take the risks to commercial it if they know that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people it won't work, or they even risk getting sued?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who said that neural implants would have a low probably of working with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual patients?  What is your specific argument against such a thing?
</em><br>
<p>In order to develop a powerful implant that will work for a wide range
<br>
of individuals, there would have to be a huge amount of work and testing
<br>
done over a long period of time. And then even if it gets to the point
<br>
of being sold commercially, what's to prevent the users who develop
<br>
some kind of symptoms or actual disease from suing them ala the breast
<br>
implant women? They all had some symptoms which it turns out were not
<br>
really related to the implants. Yet they successfully sued the crap out
<br>
of Dupont. Can you imagine the kinds of lawsuits people might come up
<br>
with for brain implants? The kind of subjective diseases and symptoms
<br>
they could convince a jury of? It all looks way too risky from what I
<br>
see, and I reiterate that I find it hard to believe a large company
<br>
would really try to develop it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;country where Dow Chemical got sued by women who got breast implants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Will companies really expose themselves to the kinds of risks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with neural hacking?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You forget that overall Dow Chemical made a lot of money and that they did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make and sell the breast implants in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>I do not know the exact details of whether Dow ended up making or losing
<br>
money on the whole implant issue. I know someone who might know, so I'll
<br>
check.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The vast majority of potential users will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pretty satisfied with external wearable apparatus, and I think this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;where the real action will be. Many of the things you want can be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with wearables- you only need to get access to the internals if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to really try and increase the raw intelligence or speed of thought or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;direct memory capacity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Access to last three things is the Holy Grail.
</em><br>
<p>For us yes, but is there a real market out there today for it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually there are some people around here that think they know that. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;simply haven't proven it yet. This is quite different again than the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of progress in RNIs where no one really has any idea yet how to do much at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all besides linking a few neurons to a computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would posit that you actually have no clue as to what the state of the art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.
</em><br>
<p>Then educate me.
<br>
Can you show me some research involving more than a few neurons? Can you
<br>
show me some research explaining how it will be possible to wire a RNI
<br>
to my brain such that it increases my raw intelligence, memory, or speed
<br>
of thought?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In fact, reverse engineering the evolved mess that is the brain may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be very very hard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be hard but there are many well-funded professors and graduate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students working on it everyday.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah and there have been a lot of people working on AI since at least the
<br>
'50s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;At least machine learning folks have created non-general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;AIs that can excel at specific tasks like chess. Even that puny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Is much more than the progress so far in RNIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like I said before you don't seem to know what the current state of the art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in neural implants is.
</em><br>
<p>My understanding is that they can (using pretty invasive implants) access
<br>
a few neurons, allowing someone with a lot of training to move a mouse
<br>
cursor on a screen. Yeah and they had computers in the mid 20th century
<br>
that played tic tac toe. I'd consider both accomplishments to be at about
<br>
the same point on their respective tech timelines (i.e. very very early).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;An AI should only be eventually constrained by how much computing power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it has available. The same will hold for your RNI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;How can a RNI that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is internal to your skull, or at most wearable, possibly match the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;computing power available to an AI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who said the bulk on the processing power must be done on person... maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has an uplink to off person processors?  I don't see any hard limits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the processing power available to a human with a neural interface.
</em><br>
<p>Could be, especially if you are willing to stay wired up instead of free
<br>
roaming. How much bandwidth do you think it would take to maintain &quot;oneness&quot;
<br>
between your bio-brain and the computer-chunk of your mind, and would it
<br>
be possible to disconnect from the computer even when 99% of the processing
<br>
is being done there? Or would parts of your mind migrate over to the
<br>
computing hardware, leaving you unable to function without it in place...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually with stuff like Flare we are beginning to see how computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;power can help developers out. Just like how software helps Intel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;engineers create chip designs, software will eventually help software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people create code. Actually it already does, but it is a pretty limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The above idea of using computers to help out people out in their chores is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of the computer revolution.  This includes helping Intel design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new chips or helping a developer write a new program or me to write this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email.  It is in no way what so ever a &quot;a pretty limited effect.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In terms of software it is a pretty limited effect currently. Reread what I
<br>
said. The whole reason software developer productivity has not followed
<br>
any kind of exponential curve (so far...) as seen in hardware design is
<br>
because the tools to develop software have not scaled in the same way
<br>
hardware tools have. This is changing in various ways such as evolutionary
<br>
programming techniques, so there is hope it will eventually start to scale
<br>
with the hardware.
