<p>In the 1830s, Dani Eder didn't write:

<p><em>&gt; Once various
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Answer: almost everyone will still have to work hard at tasks not of their
<br>
choosing to get a decent life, just like they always have.  The liberation
<br>
of 90% of the population from agriculture only increased leisure
<br>
moderately.  The deindustrialization of the US during the last thirty years
<br>
was accompanied by an increase in work hours and a decrease of leisure.
<br>
These examples show that the disappearance of various types of work does not
<br>
directly translate into increases in non-work time.
<br>
<p>What happens when a revolutionary technology makes one class of things cheap
<br>
is that the price of other things increases until the economy is close to
<br>
full employment again.  Consider two examples: real estate and haircuts.
<br>
<p>The price of real estate in England has increased smoothly since the economy
<br>
revived in 1000 AD.  The price of real estate in the Boston area, where I
<br>
live, skyrocketed when the 90s Internet boom rained money into the area.  In
<br>
your future hyper-productive economy, people will still need to live
<br>
somewhere nice, and people willing to work will bid up the prices of all the
<br>
nice land until most people have to work to afford rent.
<br>
<p>Why are haircuts ten times more expensive in Boston than in Mexico City?
<br>
The Bostonians aren't ten times more well-coiffed.  Any dexterous chatty
<br>
person can become a hair cutter, but dexterous chatty people are ten times
<br>
more valuable in Boston than they are in Mexico City, because they could get
<br>
a job that is ten times more productive in Boston than in Mexico City.
<br>
<p>Real estate and haircuts have two properties that will maintain their price
<br>
during an increase in automated manufacturing.  First, neither can be made
<br>
in a factory by robots.  Second, each is a positional good: people with a
<br>
worse haircut or house than their associates feel inferior.  There is no
<br>
objective sense in which some quantity of hair care or shelter is &quot;enough&quot;.
<br>
It depends on how much other people have.  This will keep the prices going
<br>
up, as show-offs spend more and slackers struggle to maintain some decent
<br>
minimum.  The show-offs will work hard to maintain their lifestyle, and the
<br>
slackers will work just enough to get by.
<br>
<p>--CarlF
<br>
<p>PS Intellectual honesty requires me to state that I really don't know how
<br>
much it costs to get a haircut in Mexico City.  I made up the number.
