Hi, I'm Dan Clemmensen. I had intended to do a bit more research
<br>
before posting, but I just inadvertently posted a reply, so I
<br>
feel that I should introduce myself. The FAQ enjoins me to
<br>
avoid modesty in a JOIN posting. Modesty is not a major problem
<br>
with me anyway, so here goes:
<br>
<p>I'm 51 years old, married, three daughters, and I've been a computer
<br>
programmer specializing in data communications for about 30 years. My
<br>
official job title is &quot;systems architect&quot;, which is fairly descriptive.
<br>
I prefer high-level design to management. I founded Netrix corporation
<br>
in 1985 and was the defacto CTO for about 14 years.
<br>
<p>I've recently joined Hyperchip
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hyperchip.com">http://www.hyperchip.com</a>
<br>
We are building an internet core router.
<br>
<p>I was quite active on the extropians mailing list for a period
<br>
of time during the mid 1990's. Damien Broderick derived quite
<br>
a lot of background for his book, &quot;The Spike&quot;, from the list during
<br>
that period. I'm quoted slightly more often than Elizier, mostly
<br>
because I was a &quot;radical singulatarian.&quot; On May 1, 1996, I made
<br>
the prediction that the singularity would occur within ten years
<br>
of that date. I still believe this.
<br>
<p>I wrote a small paper, &quot;Paths to the Singularity,&quot; and put it on
<br>
the web, after reading Eliziers's &quot;staring into the Singularity&quot;
<br>
and other papers of the same vintage. Elizier apparently read it, but
<br>
I don't think it had much in the way of profound insights. I
<br>
think I coined the term &quot;superintelligence,&quot; or SI, to identify the
<br>
class of possible transhuman intelligences that may or may not be
<br>
AIs. (If I'm wrong on this, I apologize to the originator.)
<br>
<p>I'm not a well organized person. As evidence of this, &quot;Paths to
<br>
the Singularity&quot; is no longer available on the web. (I'll send it
<br>
to anyone who will find a place for it.)
<br>
<p>A google search on &quot;clemmensen singularity&quot; shows that Elizier
<br>
refers to that little paper several times. From reading his
<br>
references, I believe that he extracted a lot more from the
<br>
paper than I put into it. This is very flattering, but I feel
<br>
the credit goes to him.
<br>
<p>I have done a great deal of software design and implementation at
<br>
many levels. In particular, I've implemented several special-purpose
<br>
languages using YACC and LEX (or bison and flex) and I have some
<br>
experience with GCC internals.
<br>
<p>I'm reading through the material on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/">http://intelligence.org/</a>
<br>
web site, but with the press of a new job and family commitments
<br>
I'm going slower than I had hoped. As soon as I have anything
<br>
meaningful to say, I'll say it. Until then, I'll probably say
<br>
meaningless stuff :-)
