You're not going to like my response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Really?  Fine.  I want to be able to access the PARSED source code, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the plaintext, from inside the program.  Furthermore, I want to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alter the parsed source code, represented in a natural way (i.e., an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expression is a tree and not a series of machine instructions).  I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be able to annotate any element in this tree, whether a branch or a leaf,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with complex data structures of my own devising, including new data types
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of my own devising, without destroying the integrity of the existing data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or preventing the code from executing.  Any existing languages got that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feature, which is simply first on the list?
</em><br>
<p>You can add this feature to Java with a little work.
<br>
<p>Basically you would need into integrate a Java decompiler and a Java
<br>
compiler into your program so that it can decompile and compile you programs
<br>
at run-time but that shouldn't be too hard - there are a lot of open source
<br>
Java decompilers and compilers.  Without any changes to the Java compiler
<br>
you might lose the names of the non-exposed variables and functions but I
<br>
think that if you have control of the Java compiler you can keep them.
<br>
You'll probably want to turn off all the optimizations that the compiler can
<br>
do in order that the decompiled code looks like the original code.
<br>
<p>How to implement this programmatically?  I would suggest a &quot;function lock&quot;
<br>
or an &quot;object lock&quot; mechanisms kind to how one locks memory in a shared
<br>
memory system (although you could get the parse tree without locking it,
<br>
locking is only required for modifying it).  During the time it is locked if
<br>
one tries to execute it an exception will be thrown.  Soon as you unlock a
<br>
function or object it will be re-compiled.  This would require a little
<br>
modification of the VM but not a huge amount.  Java with it's introspection
<br>
capabilities already supports querying for an Objects exposed functions or
<br>
variables, this is just an extension to that.
<br>
<p>I suspect that you can do this modification to C# as well but I am not
<br>
totally sure about that yet.  They might have more protection against
<br>
de-compilers that Java did.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

<em>&gt; Hi Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd strongly recommend against creating a language.  It will take way too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much work and more probably will never get done.  Also I have not yet seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any new features that are really driving you towards a new language.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for all the well-meant naysaying (he said, seething quietly), but I
<br>
know what I need and why, from several years' worth of wishing in routine
<br>
programming (not just for AI), and it can be done inside a programming
<br>
language that will benefit the community at large and not just SIAI.  The
<br>
programming language will be forked off as a separate open-source project
<br>
that will rendezvous with the AI side when it reaches production quality
<br>
or becomes so cool that it's worth using the beta.
<br>
<p>Flare really is an entirely different kettle of fish, and no, I CAN'T live
<br>
without it.  Some things in Flare are cool, but other things are things
<br>
that we can either do poorly in Python (or, heaven help us, C++) on our
<br>
lonesome, or do elegantly in Flare with the support of the open-source
<br>
community.  There's a section of the language space that we need to
<br>
explore, and Flare is the first, fundamental step into that language
<br>
space, the step that makes it possible for us to take the next steps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Describe the feature that you want and I'll bet that I can find an
</em><br>
existing
<br>
<em>&gt; language that has that feature.
