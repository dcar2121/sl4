<p>
Note that infinite labor productivity is quite
<br>
possible given a robotic/automated manufacturing
<br>
economy.  It just means the human labor divisor
<br>
in the formula ouptut/labor-hour = productivity
<br>
has gone to zero.  
<br>
<p>Okay, I don't really expect it to go completely 
<br>
to zero, if only because there are people who
<br>
like making things for fun(I'm one of them).
<br>
So there will still be some labor input in the
<br>
economy as a whole.  But the productivity of
<br>
the automated part of the economy can be arbitrarily
<br>
high given self-replicating robots and factories.
<br>
Neither nanotech nor transhuman AI are needed
<br>
to make this happen, just an extension of current
<br>
factory automation.
<br>
<p>In response to the S-curve vs exponential growth
<br>
issue, while any given technology has an s-curve
<br>
in adoption (really a bell curve when you include
<br>
the de-adoption as it gets superceded), civilization
<br>
as a whole is following one huge s-curve where
<br>
the levelling off is caused by reaching the
<br>
fundamental limits of the universe (Planck's
<br>
constant, speed of light, etc.).  
<br>
<p>One definition of the Singularity is that time
<br>
horizon beyond which you can't make any useful
<br>
predictions because too many things will have
<br>
changed.  Some folks think that will be shortly
<br>
after the first superintelligent AI is developed.
<br>
<p>The definition I go by is a bit different: that
<br>
singular time in history when technology is
<br>
changing the fastest, just before physical
<br>
limits of the universe put a brake on further
<br>
improvements.
