<em>&gt; &gt; I'm afraid you may be underestimating the vast amount of work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make a scalable, efficient programming language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps.  On the other hand, it doesn't need to be a vast amount of work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put in by people on the SIAI payroll.
</em><br>
<p>Creating an innovative new programming language that will operate scalably
<br>
in a clustered SMP setting is a *big* project which will involve a
<br>
roughly-Linux-scale global collaboration.  (Ok, making an OS is harder than
<br>
making a language.  But not more than an order of magnitude harder.)
<br>
<p>Of course, it's hard to predict which open-source efforts will blossom into
<br>
significant global initiatives, and which will remain tiny.  But it's worth
<br>
realizing that if this one does remain tiny, it will produce a prototype
<br>
language that will be useful only for prototyping.
<br>
<p>For instance, Gofer is one of my favorite Haskell interpreters.  It's a
<br>
one-man project.  But it's not at all efficient or scalable -- it takes one
<br>
outstanding computer scientist and some of his students just to create and
<br>
maintain the inefficient prototype Gofer version that exists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While Webmind may be currently recoding some operations in C++, I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure you'd have been so successful if you set out to work in C++ from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning.  I certainly don't think C++ would be a good idea for SIAI.
</em><br>
<p>C++ is a poor prototyping language.  We should have switched to it sooner
<br>
than we did, but I agree that for initial exploratory prototyping, it is not
<br>
the way to go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I recall from your own discussions, Java isn't scalable.
</em><br>
<p>After much study and analysis, our conclusion is that the problem with Java
<br>
is that it uses a simplistic and crappy garbage collection algorithm.  This
<br>
is a problem that could be easily remedied by the JVM team if they cared
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>A JVM, being 32 bit as all current ones are, has only 2GB max memory
<br>
available to it, no matter how much memory is in the machine itself.  And a
<br>
standard Baker-style copying GC needs two spaces: from-space and to-space.
<br>
That cuts the effective available memory by 50%.  And you want to-space to
<br>
be mostly empty after a GC, otherwise you'll just do another GC again really
<br>
soon and spend all your time GCing.  So you'd want only half of from-space
<br>
to be actual live object at the time of the GC, and the rest dead. (Really
<br>
you'd want much less than half to be live for good efficiency, but certainly
<br>
more than half is going to kill you.)  So there goes another 50%.  Well,
<br>
50%+.
<br>
<p>Based on this analysis, one would want to load &lt; ~400 MB of objects into a
<br>
Java process...
<br>
<p>And this analysis accords roughly with our experience.  The Java Webmind
<br>
core always performed much more badly when one loaded &gt; 500MB of objects
<br>
into it.
<br>
<p>Ah, the power of hindsight ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern programming language, designed in an era of Beowulf networks, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be nicely and transparently scalable - if we handle it right.
</em><br>
<p>Networking in Java is not a huge problem.  There is some overhead in the
<br>
serialization and deserialization of objects, however.  In modern networks,
<br>
this is slower than the actual time required to transmit an object across an
<br>
Ethernet cable.  [Even if you override the readObject() and writeobject()
<br>
methods appropriately]
<br>
<p>I am not convinced that there is a much more efficient way than the Java way
<br>
to do *general* serialization and deserialization of objects.  The sure way
<br>
to make this process more efficient is to introduce *specialized* methods as
<br>
one can do in C/C++.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will take an army of coders, but if an open-source project is cool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, it can *get* an army of coders.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I hope that Flare grows into something cool enough that it attracts
<br>
an army of great coders!!  I'm all for having more and more cool,
<br>
interesting languages in the world!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And our alternative is Python; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know whether that's more or less scalable than Java, but my guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be less.
</em><br>
<p>I think that using Python or Java or Lisp or whatever to build easily
<br>
manipulable prototypes, and then using C/C++ to build the real scalable
<br>
system, is the best way for you to go.
<br>
<p>I think that one mistake I made in the early days of Webmind was to focus
<br>
too much on tool-building rather than on clarifying the concepts and designs
<br>
at the heart of the AI system.  Tools are important, and most of the tools I
<br>
wanted really were good ones, but once you know exactly what AI system you
<br>
want to build, you can get a much better sense of which tools are truly
<br>
important and which are just nice-to-have.
<br>
<p>I admire your concerted focus on your mission, Eli.  But I hope you can
<br>
focus even more narrowly on the core of your mission -- the actual design
<br>
and creation of an AI.  (that way, perhaps Webmind will have another species
<br>
of AI to talk to!)  for this reason, I think that finding someone else to
<br>
take over your Flare project is a great idea.  But if this doesn't happen, I
<br>
hope you'll be willing to let it slide for a while, and let theorizing about
<br>
Friendliness slide for a while, and get down to the nitty gritty of
<br>
clarifying your very interesting intuitions about how to actually make
<br>
intelligent software...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that you strongly overestimate the degree to which providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mathematical representation for code is progress toward understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs.
</em><br>
<p>It's a necessary precursor, but it certainly doesn't get you all the way
<br>
there....  Understanding the intention behind the code is just as important
<br>
as understanding the mathematical structure of the code, and that's a
<br>
tougher nut to crack of course...
