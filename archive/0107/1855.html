</em><br>
<em>&gt; this can play much of a role in anything that is unique to human

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just wondering since your sort of posting on this list right now.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have time don't worry about it.
</em><br>
<p>For me there are two issues. One is the simple question of fact as to
<br>
whether or not quantum coherence exists somewhere in the brain. The 
<br>
other is whether it has anything to do with consciousness. 
<br>
<p>But first let's be a little clearer about the meaning of consciousness. 
<br>
It can be used to mean awareness of oneself, or to mean awareness of
<br>
anything at all. Sophisticated self-awareness might be restricted to 
<br>
a few big-brained species, but awareness may exist a long way down the
<br>
phylogenetic tree. 
<br>
<p>Starting with the second issue: for me, the existence of macroscopic
<br>
quantum states in the brain would make the unitary aspect of awareness
<br>
(its all-at-once-ness, the holistic simultaneity of experience...)
<br>
a little easier to understand. It wouldn't make *self*-awareness any
<br>
easier to understand - although if you think that all awareness is
<br>
grounded in some quantum phenomenon, you'll have to identify 
<br>
self-awareness with some version of that phenomenon. But quantum
<br>
entanglement is a much stronger ontological tie than the famous
<br>
40 Hz synchronized firing which is the most popular solution to the
<br>
&quot;binding problem&quot;. Synchronization can solve the problem of getting
<br>
two pieces of information to the same place at the same time, in an
<br>
otherwise asynchronous network, but it doesn't require us to think
<br>
of the synchronized neurons as a natural whole. But since entangled
<br>
quantum systems actually don't have individual states - only the
<br>
whole system does - there's a much stronger case for thinking of 
<br>
two entangled things as one. 
<br>
<p>So that's some of my motivation. Now, if neural microtubules are
<br>
the locus of a macroscopic quantum state which in turn is the
<br>
locus of awareness, then yes, any peculiarities of human consciousness
<br>
have to be explained in terms of features unique to the human brain. 
<br>
I think there's scope for that: there's more neurons, the cellular
<br>
environment is different, and human tubulins are that little bit
<br>
different from anything else, just like most genes in most species. 
<br>
But remember that many things unique to humans may be explained
<br>
with reference to cognition, not consciousness, in which case it's
<br>
the larger stuff like architecture and connectivities which matters. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, however imponderable the philosophy may seem, the presence
<br>
or absence of quantum coherence should at least be calculable. So
<br>
that's what I work on: one class of models of quantum coherence in
<br>
the microtubule, somewhat different from the original Hameroff-Penrose
<br>
theory. Some time this year I hope to do the definitive decoherence
<br>
calculation for that class of models, to find out whether a quantum
<br>
state could last long enough to make a difference. If it makes
<br>
theoretical sense, then we can start looking for it. If not, I'll
<br>
move on to something else.
