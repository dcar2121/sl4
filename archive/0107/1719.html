<p>If by &quot;augmenting&quot;, you mean things like retinal scanning glasses, smooth 
<br>
and flexible wearables with broadband internet connections then I can agree 
<br>
with you. But if you mean more intrusive technology such as implants, then I 
<br>
am more skeptical. It might be technically feasible, but the moral panic 
<br>
from the &quot;bioethicists&quot; would make it impossible to augment humans in this 
<br>
fashion. Animals maybe, but not humans in such a short timeframe. Remember: 
<br>
cloning is &quot;morally repugnant and against human dignity&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The optimistic view that the Singularity will arise out of AI development 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on computer hardware assumes that the complexities of human intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be replicated on machine hardware without any insoluble problems 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If that were the case historically, we would have AI:s among us, no? If you 
<br>
say that the case is NOT that we don't have any insoluble problems, 
<br>
logically there must exist an insoluble problem in creating AI. Which 
<br>
problem is it? :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Since there are real risks in whatever route we take towards the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity, once it begins to be perceived as a possibility by the larger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I believe there is a good chance that it will never be perceived as a 
<br>
possibility by the larger population.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;it is highly likely there will be a massive reaction with the kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protests we are seeing today towards the biotechnology companies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and on a much larger scale: the biotech companies are not a threat to 
<br>
the national security of every country on earth, which incidentally 
<br>
superintelligent AI is. The &quot;massive reaction&quot; will probably not only come 
<br>
from militant luddites and anti-[favourite evil here] people, but also from 
<br>
powerful governments. Since the singularity community consists of only a 
<br>
handful of people, the result of a confrontation is clear.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Without the convincing demonstration of the reliability of friendly AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controls,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This looks like the infamous &quot;precautionary principle&quot;: If you cannot prove 
<br>
that it is harmless, ban it. This principle is much liked by the luddite 
<br>
community because it is logically impossible to prove that something is 
<br>
harmless, so you can ban just about anything with this principle.
<br>
The moral of the story: you can never convince the world leaders that 
<br>
&quot;friendly AI controls&quot; is guaranteed to prevent your SI from converting the 
<br>
earth to computronium. And even if you can convince them that we will have a 
<br>
Sysop scenario: Why would they want this? Why would they give up their power 
<br>
to a machine? In the subconscious mind, the Sysop is a big fat male 
<br>
competing for food and mates with the power to grab ALL food and ALL mates 
<br>
for itself. Who would want such competition?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;it may be impossible to continue to conduct open AI research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The AI research that has the stated goal of constructing superintelligent AI 
<br>
should not be open or at the very least, not evangelized. At the moment, 
<br>
only a few people take this work seriously, but as time progresses, the need 
<br>
for secrecy might be more apparent.
