<em>&gt; Do you think giving a human-level Webmind more resources (not just memory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but ops) will increase its raw intelligence, or can this only be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through it rewriting its code into new designs?
</em><br>
<p>I think giving it more resources will increase its intelligence.  Of course,
<br>
some aspects of the system benefit more from increased firepower than
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>The good news here is that schema learning seems to be a problem that scales
<br>
well as one adds more memory and processing power.  More is always better --
<br>
the rate of improvement of intelligence with addition of memory &amp; processing
<br>
can be bumpy, but there's definitely no &quot;ceiling&quot; beyond which adding
<br>
firepower doesn't help significantly for schema learning.
<br>
<p>(This conclusion refers only to the WM approach to schema learning; I can't
<br>
speak about other approaches as confidently.  Schema learning is done in WM,
<br>
very roughly, using an evolutionary computing approach with inference based
<br>
on the system's knowledge as the fitness function.  Hebbian learning and
<br>
inference based approaches historically have traditionally scaled badly as
<br>
compared to evolutionary-style approaches, but maybe Peter and Eli will come
<br>
up with clever ways to circumvent the traditional problems with these sorts
<br>
of techniques.)
<br>
<p>A phase transition in WM intelligence will occur when it has enough
<br>
processing power to effectively learn schema of the same size as its various
<br>
AI control schema.  At this point, through improving schema learning,
<br>
additional firepower will indirectly improve *all* aspects of the system's
<br>
intelligence.  (I'm sure this won't be the only phase transition in the
<br>
system's evolution.)  (We may somewhere have data that will allow us to make
<br>
estimates of how much processing power this will be, but I don't have it at
<br>
my fingertips.)
