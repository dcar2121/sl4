<br>
<p>What if:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(1) The mind does something noncomputable (in the Turing sense),
<br>
thanks to as-yet unknown physics;
<br>
<p>(2) This noncomputability lies at the heart of qualia; and
<br>
<p>(3) We must explicitly take advantage of this feat of physics in
<br>
order to produce an artifact capable of running &quot;real AI&quot;?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first problem with this argument is that (2) is unnecessary and a red
<br>
herring.  Qualia are sensory data as presented to consciousness. I assume
<br>
the noncomputabilty arises in the consciousness aspect and not sense data
<br>
per se-- we already know a lot about how the brain processes visual images
<br>
and noncomputability has yet to rear its head.  But consciousness of sense
<br>
data is not necessary to real AI, if by real AI we mean ability to write and
<br>
improve programs, or do math or translate languages.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More abstractly but more realistically, one might ask whether
<br>
consciousness in general, or even self-consciousness, is necessary to real
<br>
AI.  The short answer is: noone has a clue, because noone has the faintest
<br>
idea how consciousness arises from our brain activity.  Philosophers try to
<br>
generate arguments that consciousness is essential or not, or that it
<br>
naturally arises from any cognitive activity or not, but the arguments on
<br>
either side that I've seen, such as Searle on the one hand and Dennett on
<br>
the other, beg all the important questions before they are barely started.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But assume that Eli's creature, or Ben's webmind, never develops
<br>
consciousness, as far as we can tell; they just do all the intellectual
<br>
tasks we are dreaming of.  Will that slow the arrival of the singularity?
<br>
Not so far as I can see (though it would make uploading a less enticing
<br>
prospect).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general question Emil is asking, it seems to me, is the same old big
<br>
question:  is general intelligence computable?  Bringing qualia or even
<br>
consciousness into it doesn't seem to sharpen the question at all  ( in the
<br>
way that Jerry Fodor's concerns, that abductive reasoning, being holistic,
<br>
will be so massively difficult as to be effectively uncomputable for a long
<br>
time, at least point to a more focused problem).  But the only real answer
<br>
to the general concern is to say we won't know til we try.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More tentatively, however, I must say that the idea that the problem
<br>
will be hardware (unknown physics in the brain that is in some mysterious
<br>
way uncomputable) rather than software  (Fodor's worry) seems to me most
<br>
unlikely. It seems to me a fundamental confusion of categories.  Once you
<br>
find a &quot;new physics&quot; phenomenon that is uncomputable, if you ever do, I will
<br>
bet the uncomputability will be able to be manifested in a substrate
<br>
employing only the old physics as well.  Uncomputability is ultimately a
<br>
mathematical phenomenon, not a phvsical one, and it will be independent of
<br>
the details of brain chemstry or physics.
