<p>This sounds just like the kind of thing I'm always trying to do!  I 
<br>
have OCD, and everyday I have to struggle with only being able to get 
<br>
my teeth reasonably clean instead of as clean as I'd like to.  Uh oh, 
<br>
I think I got some dust on me from the keyboard; back to my 
<br>
compulsions.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Also, I don't know if it was just a typo, but bathgroom sounds about 
<br>
like for what the room is used.  I like it and I think I'll try to 
<br>
use it.
<br>
<p>Finally, so this post has something of relevance in it, I'm not quite 
<br>
sure what the dream is supposed to be getting at.  The only thing 
<br>
that jumps at me is that it could be used as a way of describing the 
<br>
kind of shock people have when they first hear about physicalistic 
<br>
mind theory (well, everyone's told me it's shocking, so I'll defer to 
<br>
them, but personally I never once believed that the mind was somehow 
<br>
something more than the result of the brain).
