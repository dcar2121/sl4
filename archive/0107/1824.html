<p>
Why is it, I wonder, that some people look at exponential growth and see
<br>
it continuing indefinitely, while others look at exponential growth and
<br>
try to forecast when it breaks down?  Personally, I'll admit to using
<br>
Moore's Law, but everyone uses Moore's Law.  The rest of the time I try to
<br>
think in terms of processes I can visualize, and lower bounds.  For
<br>
example, one often hears folk asserting that Moore's Law will break down
<br>
in 2015 or whenever, but we know that currently visible technologies can
<br>
take us to 2005.  This being the case, I tend to assume that the exact
<br>
*timing* of the development of these visible technologies will roughly
<br>
follow Moore's Law, both because I don't have the time to track individual
<br>
project dates, and because Moore's Law has been so powerful in the past.
<br>
<p>Supposing that Moore's Law suddenly breaks down in 2005 and transistors
<br>
abruptly stop shrinking, I'm still not nervous, because I know that
<br>
computers will suddenly start having more and more symmetric
<br>
multiprocessing CPUs, rather than bigger and bigger CPUs, and everyone
<br>
will talk about how it was &quot;obvious&quot; that Moore's Law would someday switch
<br>
over to parallel power per dollar instead of serial speed per dollar.  Or
<br>
we could see serial speed continuing to increase at the current rate even
<br>
as the number of CPUs also begin to double every couple of years, which
<br>
would also break down Moore's Law, albeit from the opposite direction.  Or
<br>
FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) might become common and break down
<br>
our yardsticks.
<br>
<p>Or things might simply continue entirely as they have.
<br>
<p>The real question, from my perspective, is &quot;Will computing power go on
<br>
increasing?&quot; and the answer appears to be, with continuing inevitability,
<br>
yes.  Will this computing power be in a form useful for AI?  Yes.  Is the
<br>
Singularity still on schedule?  Yes.  Is software, rather than hardware,
<br>
still the critical path?  Yes.  My attention won't really start to focus
<br>
on Moore's Law until someone argues that it's
<br>
critical-path-to-Singularity... although James Rogers(?) did sharply raise
<br>
the profile of &quot;bandwidth&quot; as the hardware characteristic with the slowest
<br>
exponent, something that could easily end up affecting AI.
