<p>Deep Blue isn't lame quite yet.  This is about checkers, rather than
<br>
chess.  Impressive checkers-playing ability was achieved very early on in
<br>
AI - 1963 - and not as the result of a traditional tree-searching
<br>
program.  It was instead a program that memorized a lot of board
<br>
positions.  For example, suppose the program looked three moves ahead from
<br>
a certain position, and assigned that position a certain value based on
<br>
the minimax of the lookahead.  That value was then stored in memory and
<br>
future lookaheads which touched on that position would use the stored
<br>
value, rather than the value assigned by the primitive position-evaluation
<br>
function.
<br>
<p>The winning program thus also had the property that it was very impressive
<br>
in opening games and midgame, but tended to wander a bit during the
<br>
endgame.  The combination of the fascinating (well, back then) algorithm
<br>
and its ability to actually beat a human opponent (a huge milestone for AI
<br>
back in 1963) made Arthur Samuel's checkers program one of the classics. 
<br>
Although the game wasn't as &quot;solved&quot; as it was then thought, since it
<br>
still took until 1994 for a new program called Chinook to become world
<br>
champion.
<br>
<p>So it's been known for a long time that learning is the key to checkers. 
<br>
Furthermore, a very simple learning algorithm in checkers sufficed to
<br>
yield impressive performance using very little computing power.  It isn't
<br>
at all surprising that a sophisticated combo of neural nets and genetic
<br>
algorithms can beat a checkers program based on blind lookahead; a
<br>
checkers program based on an extremely simple, almost &quot;blind&quot; form of
<br>
learning can do the same thing.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that the neural/genetic combo had less effect than was
<br>
claimed - just that, from the description, and from the choice of problem
<br>
domain, it's pretty hard to evaluate how much of an advance, if any, has
<br>
been made.  Furthermore, the checkers domain is much smaller and more
<br>
regular than the chess domain, which may have helped them to develop
<br>
neural nets acting on it, but also makes those neural nets less
<br>
impressive.
