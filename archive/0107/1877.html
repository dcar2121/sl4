I believe this discussion has been done previously, you may want to check 
<br>
the archives.  But here is a summary of my viewpoint:
<br>
<p>The 1984 bit is the Sysop who, essentially, controls everything.  I 
<br>
understand how this is supposed to work ideally, but note the &quot;supposed to&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;ideally&quot;.  We don't live in an ideal world and things seldom work like 
<br>
their are supposed to.  You can usually get things to work like they are 
<br>
supposed to after a significant amount of experimentation, debugging, and 
<br>
general tinkering.  But, for a &quot;Friendly&quot; Seed AI, it pretty much has to 
<br>
work exactly the very first time.  Thus I believe it will almost certainly 
<br>
fail.  Which then leads us to &quot;how will it fail&quot;.  If it only fails 
<br>
marginally it could still take over as the Sysop but have a warped 
<br>
interpretation of &quot;friendliness&quot;.  This is very bad since the Sysop 
<br>
theoretically has complete control over us, which would prevent us from 
<br>
fixing the Sysop (or disposing of same).  Which could end up pretty ugly, 
<br>
maybe not 1984 ugly, but maybe worse.  Maybe this would be hell since we 
<br>
could/would most likely live forever.
