</em><br>
<p>Well, actually increased processing speed alone could get us to transhuman 
<br>
AI all by itself.  It would just take a very, very long time.  Assuming an 
<br>
AI that could come up with equivalent ideas as 1 AI researcher, but worked 
<br>
at 30% the speed.  Since the AI could run 24/7 it would equal a single AI 
<br>
researcher @ 50 hours/week.  Now, give enough time so that this same exact 
<br>
software could run 1 million times as fast on better hardware and you would 
<br>
very likely have a winner.  Because a single AI researcher could explore 1 
<br>
million times as much territory in the same amount of time.  Much of this 
<br>
would lead nowhere, but some great insights would certainly be made as 
<br>
well.  Add to this the fact that all this knowledge, both successful and 
<br>
unsuccessful, would be available to this single individual.  Just having 
<br>
that much raw experience alone should lead to much more productive 
<br>
research.  Give this thing a year and you should have incredible progress, 
<br>
even though the thing isn't any smarter than any a single human working in 
<br>
the same field.
<br>
<p>To put it another way, if Ben Goertzel had a million years to work on AI 
<br>
(without serious distraction like medical/financial problems), how much 
<br>
progress do you think he would have made on AI by the end of that 
<br>
time?  Quite substantial, I'd actually bet that he would have solved all of 
<br>
the hard problems by then.  The only potential problem is, if he was 
<br>
working in complete isolation would he stagnate at some point?  But this 
<br>
never needs to be a problem for the AI since it could have dozens (if not 
<br>
more) scientists to discuss ideas with.
<br>
<p>The big hurdle is getting general AI that is roughly equivalent to a single 
<br>
human scientist implemented and working.  If we can do that I believe the 
<br>
Singularity will be inevitable.
