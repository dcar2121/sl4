&lt;I tend to look at IQ as more of a logarithmic measure of effective
<br>
intelligence.  The difference between an IQ of 50 and one of 100 is more
<br>
exponential than linear, though the problem when applied to humans is that
<br>
it is more a measure of capability than results.

</em><br>
And this is key.  IQ is a measure of capability. Perhaps the biggest
<br>
advantage of an AI is (presumably) it wouldn't be designed with the
<br>
inherent bias towards assuming it's present level of mentality is
<br>
a static item. :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn't have anything to do with an AI &quot;rewiring it's own head&quot;
<br>
in the programming sense...just learning via trial and error to use 
<br>
ever increasing amounts of what it already has by design.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans don't GROW like we should. I think we all can say mea
<br>
culpa on this one yes?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This point tends to get obscured by Eli's (neccessary) focus on
<br>
the self-modification of code (else how to get a TAI?).  The
<br>
possibilities inherent in lacking the human habit of mental inertia
<br>
and predisposition towards not growing at all possible junctures
<br>
are awesome. Especially if you have the mental time to read 
<br>
everything ever written. Edison vs. Tesla (the stereotypes anyway).
