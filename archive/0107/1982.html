<p>Maybe, maybe not.  There's no question that the ordinary product of our public school
<br>
systems could be taught to think more clearly, thus becoming more productive.
<br>
<p>But a .5 human intelligence, which I take to mean something like a &quot;50 IQ&quot;, and the
<br>
answer is: no, I don't think so.
<br>
<p>Without giving too much credence or importance to IQ scores, but using
<br>
the concept in a loose way, we can say that (some) experts
<br>
characterize the mentally retarded with an IQ of 25-50 as &quot;trainable&quot;
<br>
rather than &quot;educable&quot;.
<br>
<p>Of course, a &quot;not quite human&quot; AI isn't likely to be much like a mentally retarded
<br>
human.  Probably more like an &quot;idiot savant&quot;, i.e. hyperintelligence in some ways,
<br>
but really stupid in other ways.  As an example, we are shocked to see some autistic
<br>
people do complex multiplications in their heads, but we should *expect* that even
<br>
the most lame-ass general AI we can build to be able to do that no problem, since it's
<br>
exactly the kind of thing we can easily program.  We can say &quot;Hey, Compu-Homer, what's
<br>
3.7 divided by .2345?&quot;  He'll be able to answer easily.
<br>
<p>I suppose the real question is how hard it would be to network a bunch of .5 idiots
<br>
and create a single networked intelligence of somewhat human capabilities.
<br>
<p>I believe that Gordon's original point can be expanded by saying that _depending on
<br>
the particular *way* in which our AI is stupid, and the *reasons* for that stupidity,
<br>
simply throwing more CPU cycles just makes a really fast moron.
