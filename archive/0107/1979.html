</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I (loosely) agree with this, but there is an interesting phenomenon
<br>
that should be noted.  Someone mentioned a gas station operator the
<br>
other day, and that's a reasonable example.  But keeping in mind that
<br>
it's possible to find very bright people almost anywhere whose life
<br>
circumstances have led them to a position of that sort, I'll use a
<br>
fictional example instead: Homer Simpson.
<br>
<p>I've known some dumbasses in my life, as I'm sure you all have unless you have
<br>
lived a life of incredible privilege.  You could give Homer Simpson one million
<br>
years and he couldn't solve the AI problems that Ben Goertzel will solve *this
<br>
year*.
<br>
<p>But is Ben Goertzel &quot;one million times smarter&quot; than Homer Simpson?  Not by any
<br>
of the usual measures!  Maybe twice as smart, let's say.  10 times as smart.
<br>
Doesn't matter.  By any conventional measure (IQ, neuron firings, whatever), it
<br>
isn't a million times.
<br>
<p>But the relatively small *degree* of increase intelligence of Ben over Homer, gives
<br>
rise to an extraordinary difference in *kind* of thinking.
<br>
<p>I think that this is what Gordon meant.  If you have a .5 human intelligence, and you
<br>
just speed it up by a factor of 2, then you've now given your idiot the ability to think
<br>
up more stupid thoughts more quickly.  This doesn't mean that it will make more progress,
<br>
since it will still not be able to correctly judge which ideas are right or wrong.
<br>
<p>Still, I agree with this:
<br>
<em>&gt; The big hurdle is getting general AI that is roughly equivalent to a single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human scientist implemented and working.  If we can do that I believe the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity will be inevitable.
</em><br>
<p>It will be interesting to see if there is a long delay between building our first
<br>
&quot;human level dumbass&quot; and our first &quot;human level scientist&quot;, keeping in mind that
<br>
building even 1 billion human level dumbasses isn't likely to help us much in getting
<br>
that scientist built.
