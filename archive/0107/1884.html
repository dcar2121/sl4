</em><br>
<p><p>Terms like &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; represent folk-psychology concepts,
<br>
whose meanings are ambiguous and multifaceted.  It's not reasonable to
<br>
expect any reasonably compact mathematical definition to fully capture the
<br>
sense of such a term, nor any reasonable executable experimental protocol to
<br>
measure a quantity association with such a term.
<br>
<p>Further, it is it clear that these folk concepts, precisely as commonly
<br>
considered, are precisely the concepts one needs for scientific analysis.
<br>
<p>Our aim with formalizations of intelligence, mind or related concepts, or
<br>
tests desired to measure these things, should be to create scientific
<br>
concepts which capture significant aspects of the associated folk concepts
<br>
with which they share names -- and which we believe are useful for science
<br>
and engineering, perhaps more so than the corresponding folk concepts in
<br>
their full ambiguity.
<br>
<p>So, to me, quibbling over what's intelligence and what's smartness isn't all
<br>
that interesting.  We need to devise practical tests to allow us to detect
<br>
whether our AI systems are on the right track or not, and objectively
<br>
compare different Ai approaches -- whatever words you want to use to
<br>
describe this...
