</em><br>
<p>I am being too terse in some of my emails, sorry.
<br>
<p>I understood the metaphor and the implied mapping of the metaphor to your
<br>
point.  It was the underlying point that I was disagreeing with.  The point
<br>
was, as I understood it, that artificial-AI/seed-AI was a better that
<br>
augmenting humans based on some criteria.  I was suggesting that the
<br>
criteria (i.e. &quot;the goal&quot;/&quot;more promising&quot;) on which you based this judgment
<br>
were ill defined/not defined and thus your conclusion was not supportable
<br>
and thus the analogy was &quot;somewhat vacuous&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anyways, one of my longer term goals (and probably one of the harder ones to
<br>
realize) is to make people smarter - thus I favor human cognitive
<br>
augmentation. ;-)  What's your goal?  How are you comparing one path to the
<br>
other?
<br>
<p>Also one has to look at the environment in which all this research is taking
<br>
place.  I figure that human cognitive augmentation is going to be somewhat
<br>
part or an offshoot of the very well funding medical field.  More
<br>
specifically it will be an offshoot of the field of cognitive
<br>
neuroscience/cognitive science/neuroscience - a somewhat large and active
<br>
set of fields.  I do not see as much support being AI thus even if they
<br>
problems to be solved in each field are comparable I suggest that the one
<br>
with more researchers and funding (i.e. the one society is more motivated
<br>
towards) is going to make more progress.  I do not believe that cognitive
<br>
prosthetics is a end to itself, much of it will be for helping those who are
<br>
physically or mentally disabled in some way.  I also feel that the possible
<br>
benefits to society are enormous and difficult to question where as the
<br>
benefits of a SysOp or a total replacement for human intelligence are
<br>
somewhat less so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I would not risk trying
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Are you reasoning with an analogy in order to disagree with my conclusions
<br>
on the seed-AI vs. human augmentation?  If so I disagree (and you should
<br>
state it more explicitly because I am having problems with the reverse
<br>
mapping of argument statements from analogy to target) or maybe I am just
<br>
misunderstanding you now.
<br>
