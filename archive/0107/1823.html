<p>Probably not.  Do you not think that there might be some factors that may
<br>
invalidate your extrapolation of exponential growth?  Many things follow an
<br>
exponential growth curve for a while and then level off.
<br>
<p>Technological adoption and population growth (see Thomas Malthus) are two
<br>
classic examples.  Technological adoption is an interesting one in my mind
<br>
and relevant to our purpose here.  It follows something that economists call
<br>
an &quot;S-curve&quot;.  A new product obviously starts off with no users and it
<br>
slowly starts to grow.  If it is a technology that is of us to most people
<br>
(i.e. computers, cell phones) it will grow for quite a while but at some
<br>
point it reaches a saturation point.  Once everyone has a cell phone it's
<br>
becomes a little harder to sell phones (i.e. the replacement phone market is
<br>
limited to something like 15 % of the population per year) and this can be
<br>
significantly lower than the growth was just prior to the saturation point
<br>
(50% per year in the case of cell phones).
<br>
<p>Many people have experienced first hand the pitfalls of naively believing
<br>
exponential growth can be sustained over the long run (especially to the
<br>
point were it become a ridiculous notion) - that is how Nortel lost 19.6
<br>
billion this quarter and how many investors loss their millions in the stock
<br>
bubble market.
<br>

Subject: Other signposts towards the Singularity
<br>
<p><p>Most of us on this list are familiar with Moore's Law,
<br>
which posits a fixed doubling time for number of
<br>
transistors on a chip or processing power/$.  More
<br>
recently Moravec and Kurzweil have noted how the
<br>
doubling
<br>
time for computation/$ has gradually shortened from
<br>
about 3 years early in the 20th century to about 12-15
<br>
months currently.
<br>
<p>I took a look at manufacturing productivity and found
<br>
a similar faster-than-exponential growth is occurring.
<br>
The data are from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
<br>
and
<br>
measure output per labor hour for all US manufacturing
<br>
industry.
<br>
<p>The rate of increase in productivity per year was
<br>
2.1% in the 50's, 2.5% in the 60's, 2.6% in the 70's
<br>
2.9% in the 80's, and 4.1% in the 90's.  The
<br>
first half of the 90's it was 3.2%, and in the
<br>
second half of the 90's it was 4.9%.
<br>
<p>The doubling time in productivity decreased from
<br>
33 years in the 50's to 17 years in the 90's.
<br>
Extrapolating the trend indicates infinite
<br>
productivity
<br>
in the 2030's, i.e. a Singularity.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>I have an interest in the history of technology and
<br>
like to take a long view.  I trace the current run
<br>
up to the Singularity as starting around 1000 AD as
<br>
Europe comes out of the Dark Ages and starts the
<br>
positive feedback loop of technology.  Since then,
<br>
each invention that allows more population, and
<br>
more of that population to be doing non-menial
<br>
tasks has increased brainpower available for
<br>
further invention.  Improvements in knowledge
<br>
distribution, from the printing press to the Web,
<br>
have made the available brainpower more efficient.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>With or without a transhuman AI, we are headed for
<br>
a future that is radically different.  Once various
<br>
industries are sufficiently automated, we will
<br>
have an economic system that requires minimal work
<br>
to operate.  What will civilization be like when
<br>
everyone can pursue their interests rather than what
<br>
has to be done to keep food on the table and a
<br>
roof over your head?  What will government be
<br>
like when you can have a &quot;seed factory&quot; or &quot;seed
<br>
robot&quot; that can produce copies of itself as well
<br>
as anything else you need.  AI and nanotech are
<br>
not required for these &quot;seeds&quot;, just high-grade
<br>
automation.
<br>
<p>I don't know the answers to these questions, but I
<br>
do believe strongly that our technological
<br>
civilization is headed that way, and we'll get
<br>
there in a generation or so at most.  See you there.
