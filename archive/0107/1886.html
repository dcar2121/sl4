<p>
There is no doubt in my mind that an AI, to get really smart really fast,
<br>
will have to learn human language so it can learn from us, conversationally
<br>
and through reading texts.
<br>
<p>There are three ways to approach this:
<br>
<p>1) Build a smart system and teach it human language
<br>
<p>2) Build a smart system and hope it learns human language on its own
<br>
<p>3) Build a smart system and *wire knowledge of human language into it*, in
<br>
such a way that this knowledge can be mutated and improved freely by the
<br>
system as time goes on
<br>
<p>4) Build a smart system and carefully engineer the structure so that
<br>
learning human language will be relatively easy, then teach it human
<br>
language
<br>
<p><p>In Webmind Inc., we experimented with approaches 2) and 3), inconclusively.
<br>
<p>2 didn't work, but there were known shortcomings in the system's cognition
<br>
modules (it wasn't that smart!).
<br>
<p>3 didn't work, but we didn't get through more than 30% of the work it would
<br>
have taken to make it work.  What you need to do is take all the parts of
<br>
the NLP pipeline and implement them using completely flexible, learnable
<br>
&quot;schema&quot;: tokenization, morphological analysis, parsing (using lexicalized
<br>
feature structure grammars,  context-free grammars, or whatever framework),
<br>
semantic mapping, discourse planning, sentence generation, reference
<br>
resolution, etc.   There's a lot of stuff there, and a lot of knowledge in
<br>
the NLP community about how to do it.
<br>
<p>Our current plan is approach 4.  From all our work on approaches 2 and 3, we
<br>
understand pretty well what kinds of cognitive structures are needed to make
<br>
language learning work, so we can 'prime' the system for language learning
<br>
in various subtle ways, without building in any specific linguistic
<br>
knowledge, rules, etc.  We believe the human brain comes primed for language
<br>
learning in similar ways.
<br>
<p>If you're going to study computational linguistics and are interested in
<br>
real AI, my advice would be to focus on *unsupervised language learning* and
<br>
on *combining syntax and semantics in the course of processing*.  These are
<br>
cutting-edge topics which are closer to a &quot;real AI&quot; approach to language
<br>
than plain vanilla computational linguistics.  Most computational
<br>
linguistics is based on either hand-coded rules, or supervised learning from
<br>
corpuses, and while this stuff is interesting, it doesn't teach you that
<br>
much about how to make software that *really understands* human language.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: Usefullness of computational linguists in reaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This fall, I enter college for my formal education in the ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer science and linguistics.  So, my question is for some of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with real life AI experience, how can a computational linguist be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful in AI projects?  I'd like to know so that I don't waste time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking courses that might seem useful to me but end up not being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have thought about this some, so let me throw my ideas out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please add to/correct them.  First, I know that this kind of role is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful in gathering information for the information backing that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good seed AI is going to need to get started, but we're already about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 years into doing this and I project that in maybe 10 years or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sooner pretty much all human knowledge is going to be archived and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll know how to best have an AI interface with that knowledge base.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, I have thought that the AI may just start spurting out to us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in vis own language that ve develops (this seems unlikely and I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect it to happen, but there could always be a bug that causes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI to develop communication skills before ve has anything to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate with).  In this case, having a linguist on hand would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very useful.  Similarly, when we have two or more AIs running and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to talk to each other, they are going to develop a new language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will be more efficient for them (we may not even recognize it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a language, but they'll surely develop some means of communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more efficient than English, especially since anything they come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't need to be spoken, eliminating a lot of the bulk found in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural human languages).  While the AIs will be very smart, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a linguist may still be needed to, if nothing else, teach AIs how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyze language and develop a means of translation (especially if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns out that AIs are really bad at pattern recognition compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans and it will take them a few real years to develop algorithms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do it properly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I'm curious what the list might have to say on the subject,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but beyond a few posts I think it will not be of interest to the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in general, so you should probably direct replies to me unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are sure the list will find it interesting in some way (I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flames count as interesting, or at least can ;-)).
