<p>
As an aside to all this stuff about Flare, I thought I'd add a little bit
<br>
about the Webmind approach to early-stage self-modification.
<br>
<p>The first phase of self-modification in Webmind won't involve rewriting of
<br>
the actual C++ source for Webmind.
<br>
<p>Rather, we have something in Webmind called a &quot;schema&quot; -- a procedure that
<br>
the system can follow, which is expressed entirely as a pattern of nodes and
<br>
links in the system.  Schema can be learned by a variety of methods,
<br>
reasoned on, forgotten, mutated, blah blah blah.
<br>
<p>Right now, some of Webmind's thought processes are represented as C++
<br>
objects called AIProcesses, and others are represented as schema.  Only the
<br>
ones represented as schema can be improved and adapted.
<br>
<p>Once the system gets smart enough, we'll rewrite all the AIProcesses in
<br>
terms of schema (not hard, but there's a performance penalty; we need to
<br>
make a really fast schema module first and we haven't done that yet).  Then,
<br>
the system will be able to observe and study and modify or replace all its
<br>
thought processes.  I call this Phase One WM self-modification.
<br>
<p>What the system *won't* be able to do, in this phase, is rewrite the
<br>
infrastructure underlying the AIProcesses: the definition of nodes and links
<br>
(though it will be able to add and delete variables from the node and link
<br>
objects, effectively), the fact that WM is a system with a bunch of
<br>
AIProcesses acting on a distributed table of nodes and links, the fact that
<br>
it caches memory to disk periodically, etc.
<br>
<p>Still, in phase One self-modification, the system will learn what its
<br>
reasoning, associating, feeling, etc. processes are doing, and how to
<br>
improve these processes.
<br>
<p>IN parallel with phase one self-modification, we'll have to do some basic
<br>
*teaching of programming*.  The system will be given the syntax for the
<br>
programming language it's written in, and some knowledge about the semantics
<br>
of the language.  It can then automatically represent (say) C++ programs as
<br>
schema and experiment with them given its knowledge about schema.  It  must
<br>
be led through a series of exercises in programming, involving simple &quot;CS
<br>
101&quot; programs, until it can improve and modify simple programs, etc.
<br>
<p>Now, once phase one self-modification is working well, AND the system knows
<br>
the programming language it's written in, THEN,
<br>
*then* it's time for Phase Two self-modification, where the two pieces are
<br>
put together, and the system tries to understand itself as an AI program
<br>
written in a real programming language.
<br>
<p>A language like Flare would make the &quot;teaching of programming&quot; phase a bit
<br>
easier.  But my feeling is that phase one self-modification is significantly
<br>
harder than &quot;teaching of programming&quot;, because understanding what makes a
<br>
reasoning rule better than another is harder than understanding what makes a
<br>
simple C++ program work.  So I feel that having flare would really only help
<br>
with the easier part of the problem....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I understand about Eli's approach, the problem of getting to phase
</em><br>
two modification isn't broken down into parts in the same way as I propose
<br>
to do.  But I don't understand his approach very well, so I won't say more
<br>
about it.
