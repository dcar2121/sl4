<p>Actually, my thoughts have more focused on milestones than on benchmarks. 
<br>
I have a pretty strong feeling that there will be no good way to compare
<br>
benchmarks.
<br>
<p>Here are some of the milestones I've been thinking about for the GISAI
<br>
architecture, in no particular order (some of them are early, some of them
<br>
are really advanced).
<br>
<p>Milestone:  Teaching an AI to play tic-tac-toe using a purely verbal,
<br>
communicational description and no programming whatsoever.
<br>
<p>Milestone:  Getting an AI to play humanstyle chess - chess without
<br>
internally representing a search tree larger than humans use - at credible
<br>
amateur levels.
<br>
<p>Milestone:  An AI being able to successfully determine when two pieces of
<br>
code do &quot;the same thing&quot; even when they have different graphs.  The
<br>
submilestones here are the various levels of &quot;the same thing&quot; - i.e.,
<br>
recursive vs. iterative implementations of the Fibonacchi sequence; the
<br>
different ways of computing Pascal's Triangle; the same piece of code
<br>
written in Java and in Perl; an array container class written in Java and
<br>
a linked-list container class written in C++; assembly language and C++
<br>
source; a high-level verbal description of an algorithm... and so on.
<br>
<p>Milestone:  As above, but being able to translate on demand between
<br>
substrates.  (Quite a different problem - not necessarily a more advanced
<br>
or less advanced version of the above.)
<br>
<p>Milestone:  Inventing a complex tool, through abstract reasoning rather
<br>
than blind search or even heuristic search, within a complex toy world or
<br>
the world of code.  Note that by &quot;abstract reasoning&quot; I mean something
<br>
quite different than the use of blind symbols in classical AI!
<br>
<p>Milestone:  Inventing a complex plan to solve a complex solution, again
<br>
through the use of abstract reasoning rather than blind search.
<br>
<p>Milestone:  Successfully linking events observed in a billiard-ball
<br>
modality image to higher-level symbols, such that a generic event (nine
<br>
balls in three groups of three) can be translated into a symbolic
<br>
structure and reconstructed in rough detail using only that structure.
<br>
<p>Milestone:  As above, but communicated to a human in English, and then
<br>
reconstructed from the human's description in English.  Both this and the
<br>
above also come in gradiated versions depending on the complexity of the
<br>
image.
<br>
<p>Milestone:  Storing a billiard-ball image in memory and retrieving it from
<br>
memory.
<br>
<p>... and so on ...
<br>
