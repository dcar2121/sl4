<p>I'll give you that.
<br>
<p>But productivity measures are usually more broadly defined as the amount of
<br>
outputs as compared to the amount of inputs (and I guess I had
<br>
misinterpreted your earlier statement in this definition).  Commonly
<br>
accounted inputs are both labor and goods.  If one is using automation in
<br>
the manufacturing process one usually must factor in the cost of the
<br>
automation both in terms of purchase, maintenance and depreciation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One definition of the Singularity is that time

</em><br>
<p>I sort of agree with that.  Sometimes though I feel that our ability to
<br>
predict the future may be staying constant as respect to time because at the
<br>
same time the world becomes more unpredictable we become more capable of
<br>
managing that uncertainty - although that is a totally unsupportable
<br>
statement I am sure that it is marginally true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The definition I go by is a bit different: that

</em><br>
<p>Sounds like Vernor Vinge's &quot;the era of failed dreams&quot; (or something like
<br>
that) from his most two books. :-)

Subject: RE: Other signposts towards the Singularity
<br>
<p>Note that infinite labor productivity is quite
<br>
possible given a robotic/automated manufacturing
<br>
economy.  It just means the human labor divisor
<br>
in the formula ouptut/labor-hour = productivity
<br>
has gone to zero.
<br>
<p>Okay, I don't really expect it to go completely
<br>
to zero, if only because there are people who
<br>
like making things for fun(I'm one of them).
<br>
So there will still be some labor input in the
<br>
economy as a whole.  But the productivity of
<br>
the automated part of the economy can be arbitrarily
<br>
high given self-replicating robots and factories.
<br>
Neither nanotech nor transhuman AI are needed
<br>
to make this happen, just an extension of current
<br>
factory automation.
<br>
<p>In response to the S-curve vs exponential growth
<br>
issue, while any given technology has an s-curve
<br>
in adoption (really a bell curve when you include
<br>
the de-adoption as it gets superceded), civilization
<br>
as a whole is following one huge s-curve where
<br>
the levelling off is caused by reaching the
<br>
fundamental limits of the universe (Planck's
<br>
constant, speed of light, etc.).
<br>
<p>One definition of the Singularity is that time
<br>
horizon beyond which you can't make any useful
<br>
predictions because too many things will have
<br>
changed.  Some folks think that will be shortly
<br>
after the first superintelligent AI is developed.
<br>
<p>The definition I go by is a bit different: that
<br>
singular time in history when technology is
<br>
changing the fastest, just before physical
<br>
limits of the universe put a brake on further
<br>
improvements.
