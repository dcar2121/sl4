John Stick said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find a &quot;new physics&quot; phenomenon that is uncomputable, if you ever do, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will bet the uncomputability will be able to be manifested in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate employing only the old physics as well. Uncomputability is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately a mathematical phenomenon, not a phvsical one, and it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be independent of the details of brain chemstry or physics. 
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't make any sense. An example of a noncomputable function
<br>
would be HALT[TM,IN], defined as follows: it returns &quot;1&quot; if the
<br>
Turing machine TM presented with the input IN will eventually halt,
<br>
and &quot;0&quot; otherwise. There's no end of specific cases where it's easy
<br>
to figure out the answer, but there is no Turing machine which can
<br>
compute the function's value for all possible pairs of inputs. 
<br>
<p>The computational primitives of a Turing machine are a few
<br>
operations: read, write, move right, move left. One can imagine
<br>
adding the function HALT (in some form) as a new computational
<br>
primitive. This defines a new class of abstract computers, 
<br>
capable of computing a much larger universe of functions (namely,
<br>
anything that can be expressed as a composite of Turing-computable
<br>
functions and &quot;halting functions&quot; for Turing machines). The
<br>
members of this new class are &quot;oracles&quot; of the first degree. 
<br>
But if OR1 is a member of this class, then it turns out that
<br>
HALT[OR1,IN] is not computable for a first-degree oracle. 
<br>
So you can define a second-order oracle which has HALT[OR1,IN]
<br>
as a new computational primitive. And so on. 
<br>
<p>If there is such a thing as &quot;noncomputable physics&quot;, it means
<br>
that, say, the equations of motion involve noncomputable
<br>
functions. There would be processes which, over time,
<br>
transformed one set of quantitative physical properties into
<br>
another set, according to some noncomputable transformation. 
<br>
Example: you have two groups of binary physical systems ('bits'). 
<br>
They spontaneously produce another binary entity, whose state
<br>
is HALT[TM,IN], where the first group of bits encodes a
<br>
Turing machine, and the second group of bits encodes an input
<br>
to that machine. 
<br>
<p>If there was such an interaction, you could use it to make
<br>
an oracle - to compute the values of functions that are
<br>
noncomputable for Turing machines - since it implements the
<br>
necessary new computational primitive. But if the rest of
<br>
physics involves Turing-computable processes, there's not
<br>
going to be any way to combine them to duplicate the
<br>
computational powers of this hypothetical new noncomputable
<br>
process. 
<br>
<p>This thread started with Emil Gilliam saying: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [what if] noncomputability lies at the heart of qualia
</em><br>
<p>and quoting Eliezer (<a href="http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/0103/0006.html">http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/0103/0006.html</a>): 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do think there's a good possibility that qualia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are noncomputable ... But I definitely deny that the noncomputability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has anything whatsoever to do with either Godelization or reflection. 
</em><br>
<p>Emil seems to mean Turing-noncomputability, but Eliezer seems
<br>
to mean something else, because if it means anything, Godelization
<br>
means jumping out of the system to add a new computational
<br>
primitive (HALT[]) or a new axiom (an unprovable-but-true Godel
<br>
proposition). What I think Eliezer means is that qualia might
<br>
not be computations, or might not be spontaneously generated
<br>
by computations independent of substrate. Personally I think
<br>
that's a reasonable opinion, but it is a *separate question*
<br>
from the computability-or-otherwise of physics. 
<br>
<p>If I read him correctly, Eliezer's issue is a question of
<br>
ontological categories: what sort of thing *is* a quale
<br>
(singular of qualia)? Is it an &quot;informational property&quot; as
<br>
Chalmers would have it, possessed by any implementation of
<br>
a particular finite-state machine? Or is it a substrate-dependent
<br>
property, like charge or mass? Whereas Emil is asking about
<br>
*dynamics*: what are the &quot;equations of motion&quot; of qualia?
<br>
Are they Turing-computable or not? 
<br>
<p>It is quite consistent to maintain that qualia are 
<br>
substrate-dependent but &quot;Turing-computable&quot;, meaning
<br>
that their dynamics could be simulated and predicted
<br>
by a Turing machine. If this is true then consciousness
<br>
can be simulated without actually being created. I think
<br>
this is the simplest position, on account of 
<br>
<p>(i) the very sparse evidence that human thought has a 
<br>
Turing-noncomputable dynamics, and
<br>
<p>(ii) the difficulties in maintaining that computational
<br>
states are defined by objective (user-independent) properties
<br>
of physical systems.
