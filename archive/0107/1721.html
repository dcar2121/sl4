<em>&gt;Subject: Re: The Human Augmentation Strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Thu, 5 Jul 2001 21:47:32 -0400

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Christian:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks for your response to my message.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The suggestion I was trying to make (and not doing so very well) was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the attainment of super-intelligence may be easier to achieve through human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;augmentation rather than starting from scratch with today's machines.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this was how I interpreted your message. I might have drifted from the 
<br>
subject later on :-) . However, I think that such a course is unfeasible 
<br>
both from the moralist perspective and also from a technical perspective. I 
<br>
think that you would have to have an extremely good model of how the brain 
<br>
works and very advanced nanotech
<br>
and scanning technologies. This would probably take a very long time to 
<br>
achieve, and I think that developing a good model of General Intelligence 
<br>
would take less time/resources. It is probably so that if you are to get 
<br>
such good understanding of the human brain as is needed for decent 
<br>
augmentation, you would probably need a theory of General Intelligence 
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>I think that this IA (intelligence amplification) vs AI-question has been 
<br>
discussed before.
<br>
You can study the archives at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/">http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/</a>
<br>
<p><p>If I have understood you correctly, your angle is that it would be easier to 
<br>
develop the technologies neccesary for IA than developing a theory for 
<br>
General Intelligence. The problem of finding the matching *hardware* for 
<br>
implementing that theory would (probably) not be a problem due to  Moores 
<br>
law. Software and theory are the big problems.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;However, I believe that the enormous research being done to develop very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;small devices that can be placed in the body to correct medical problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will give us the technology to augment humans along the lines I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggesting.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm... &quot;enormous research&quot;? Isn't this an overstatement? Can you give some 
<br>
examples? I only know of Warwick's implant-stunts and some company 
<br>
developing a mini-sub for use in blood vessels.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I'm looking for the AARP to push the longevity aspects of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology and also to fight off the bioethicists.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't bet on it... You are talking about the American Association for 
<br>
Retired People here and not some &quot;American Advanced Research Project&quot; I 
<br>
suppose. I only skimmed their site, but I would guess that when (if) 
<br>
longevity research begins to pay off they will write articles telling us how 
<br>
wonderful and natural it is to grow old and die and that one Should Not 
<br>
Tamper With Nature.
<br>
<p>Even if they were positive I don't think that they would be able to sway the 
<br>
luddites/bioethicists. &quot;these people are desperate, how sad, can't they just 
<br>
accept their end yadayadayada...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>/Christian
