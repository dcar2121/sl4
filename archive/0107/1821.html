<p>
I agree with Eli that current languages leave much to be desired. Flare
<br>
includes some important features.
<br>
<p>Some background: In the late 80's I developed my own dream language - ONE -
<br>
a full-featured dynamically extensible language with full 'annotation'. My
<br>
company developed several major commercial applications in ONE. However,
<br>
when I sold the company, ONE lost it's chief driving force - me. I wish I
<br>
had an upgraded version of ONE to do my AI programming - I would enjoy
<br>
programming a lot more, and would be a lot more production in certain areas.
<br>
<p>Comprehensive new languages *can* be developed by a small team - however -
<br>
it is extremely difficult to persuade people to adopt a new language. And
<br>
for good reason: Expensive learning curve; don't fully appreciate power of
<br>
new features; risk of continuity; tools are different and not as good as
<br>
mature languages; can't use existing classes/ routines/ utilities; can't
<br>
hire people with expertise; etc.
<br>
<p>Having said all of this, here are a couple of personal desires for a
<br>
'Flare'.
<br>
<p>An elegant and powerful syntax for dynamic class/ object/ method
<br>
references - I don't fully understand how Eli proposes to do this in
<br>
FlareSpeak.
<br>
<p>I'm frustrated at the lack of inherent support for object (and dynamic class
<br>
&amp; method) persistence in current languages. It would to nice to have that.
<br>
<p>(I can send a separate post to Eli -I don't want to bog down this list/ post
<br>
with detail)
<br>
<p>Now for the reasons that a new language like Flare should may not be such a
<br>
good idea:
<br>
<p>I think that Ben's post pretty much says it:
<br>
<p>It's premature, not all that important to achieving AI, and a better
<br>
approach overall would be to improve Java (or C#) . A detailed AI design
<br>
(and implementation experience) will highlight what language features are
<br>
*really* crucial. For example, I believe that general intelligence will
<br>
require far more focus on data encoding &amp; (internal) representation than on
<br>
program structure and logic. If this is true, than language limitations play
<br>
far less of a role - most of the 'programming' really occurs within the data
<br>
structure.
<br>
<p>Then, as James pointed out, as soon as the code is (self-) modified at the
<br>
XML level - this very quickly becomes (practically) incomprehensible at the
<br>
FlareSpeak level anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my own experience, there are huge performance penalties for dynamic
</em><br>
creation &amp; referencing of objects, and many of the other neat features you
<br>
want. They require very substantial (and expensive) compiler development
<br>
(forget interpreters). What I see happening is that many of these features
<br>
that we want *are* slowly being added to mainstream languages. Don't
<br>
underestimate the benefits of mainstream languages, IDE's, compilers, etc. -
<br>
huge pool of programmers, interoperability, access to existing libraries
<br>
(e.g. LEDA), big-iron and network op-sys support; etc.
<br>
<p>Developing (even radical) extensions to an existing language - once specific
<br>
AI bottlenecks suggest it - seems to be a better approach.
