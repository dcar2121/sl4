<p>
Out of concern that my silence would be construed as agreement I make this 
<br>
post.
<br>
<p>My opinion is that Moore's Law has a specific definition having to do with 
<br>
transistor counts in Integrated Circuits.  There may be many similar 
<br>
effects in other fields, but they are not Moore's Law.  The problem with 
<br>
the Newton comparison is that there is a &quot;constant amount&quot; that remains the 
<br>
same regardless of using apples, bowling balls or buildings.  There is no 
<br>
constant amount between transistor counts, actual CPU performance, 
<br>
productivity of clerks, or others.  There certainly are similar values, but 
<br>
no constant.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I've said my piece and thus this will be my last post on this topic.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;multiprocessing CPUs, rather than bigger and bigger CPUs, and everyone

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) might become common and break down

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;our yardsticks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Moore's Law has nothing to do with CPUs!  If transistor counts stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increasing but systems start shipping with multiprocessing CPUs (not in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same chip) Moore's Law is broken.  Likewise, if transistor counts continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to increase as predicted but systems also ship with multiple CPUs there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no effect on Moore's Law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, I know.  That was exactly my point - that Moore's Law might break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down completely, and yet computers would go on smoothly increasing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost/performance with scarely a blip.  If this happened, everyone would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immediately begin speaking of Moore's Law as if it strictly controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost/performance and had never had anything to do with transistor sizes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If transistor counts kept increasing but systems also started shipping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with multiple CPUs, Moore's Law might technically remain intact but would,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the perspective of a computer buyer, suddenly appear not as a steady
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceleration but as a speed limit that had been broken (!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moore's Law is now really a social observation rather than a technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one, and is used that way almost universally; it generalizes so readily to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so many observed phenomena in the computing industry that one speaks of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Moore's Law for performance per dollar&quot; or &quot;Moore's Law for disk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drives&quot;.  As I don't work for Intel, I have now accepted this and have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trouble with, e.g., Ray Kurzweil's graph showing the operation of &quot;Moore's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Law since 1900&quot; for clerks, mechanical calculators, vacuum tubes, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transistors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moore only *thought* his Law was about transistors.  Imagine if Isaac
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Newton had first observed that apples fall at a constant acceleration, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formulated Newton's Law as &quot;The velocity of a freely falling apple changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by a constant amount in a given unit of time.&quot;  Would we still be speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Newton's Law as if it applied only to apples?
