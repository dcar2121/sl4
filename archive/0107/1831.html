<p>
What if:
<br>
<p>(1) The mind does something noncomputable (in the Turing sense), 
<br>
thanks to as-yet unknown physics;
<br>
<p>(2) This noncomputability lies at the heart of qualia; and
<br>
<p>(3) We must explicitly take advantage of this feat of physics in 
<br>
order to produce an artifact capable of running &quot;real AI&quot;?
<br>
<p>Related topics were touched upon a few months back in the thread &quot;The 
<br>
Singularity and the quantum mind,&quot; but the thread was unfortunately 
<br>
muddled by the confusion of several unrelated issues, and did not 
<br>
play itself out satisfactorily.
<br>
<p>The consensus I seem to find here is that although (1) and (2) are 
<br>
possible, they are unlikely, and that even if they are true, then (3) 
<br>
is so unlikely as to not be worth strategizing about. Is this, in 
<br>
fact, what most Singularitarians here think? *
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>At this point I must dispose of some red herrings that inevitably 
<br>
sidetrack most of these discussions:
<br>
<p>(A) Because of Penrose et al., much to-do has been made about quantum 
<br>
computers in this context, but I must point out that quantum 
<br>
computers are Turing-computable. That is, there is nothing a quantum 
<br>
computer can do that a classical computer can't do given enough time. 
<br>
Okay, that's not really true -- a classical computer can't pick a 
<br>
&quot;random number.&quot; But as I understand it, there is no *function* a QC 
<br>
can compute that a classical computer cannot. Penrose and others 
<br>
actually propose something noncomputable, beyond the quantum 
<br>
computer, in whatever it is that the brain does. Ignore quantum 
<br>
computers unless it's absolutely necessary to bring them up -- what 
<br>
is postulated is that some arrangement of atoms can cause nature to 
<br>
produce an noncomputable function that is explicitly taken advantage 
<br>
of.
<br>
<p>(B) Eliezer stated &quot;I do think there's a good possibility that qualia 
<br>
are noncomputable ... But I definitely deny that the noncomputability 
<br>
has anything whatsoever to do with either Godelization or reflection. 
<br>
I *know* how those work.&quot; Let's take this statement at face value, 
<br>
and ignore the Godelization and the reflection. If qualia are 
<br>
noncomputable, however, is there still no possibility that they would 
<br>
be needed to build an AI capable of bringing us to a Singularity (or 
<br>
even weaker &quot;real AIs&quot;)?
<br>
<p>(C) If (1)-(3) turn out to be true, this does not mean that we can't 
<br>
create an AI. It does mean we'll have to learn to manufacture some 
<br>
kind of physical artifact other than a computer. I say &quot;artifact&quot; 
<br>
because the term &quot;machine&quot; has become loaded in the last 50 years to 
<br>
mean &quot;Turing machine,&quot; rather than its more general, original sense 
<br>
of &quot;something we can manufacture.&quot; Of course, if all of physics is 
<br>
computable, then these two meanings are equivalent.
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>There is nothing in the consideration of this possibility that 
<br>
inherently requires reverting to mysticism or teleology (or 
<br>
accusations thereof).
<br>
<p>There is, of course, the fact that current empirical evidence 
<br>
pointing to something noncomputable in the [microtubules, or what 
<br>
have you] is extremely lacking, as Ben Goertzel pointed out. This 
<br>
argument should be the best reason to reject this hypothesis for now. 
<br>
If the hypothesis is wrong, we should be able to say that it is 
<br>
erroneous science, rather than pseudoscience.
<br>
<p>However, I shall play the Devil's advocate and ask whether anyone has 
<br>
a backup plan in case (1)-(3) turn out to be true. It would 
<br>
definitely push the Singularity back by a decade or two, at the very 
<br>
least. At what point would we decide that it's probable enough -- or, 
<br>
pessimistically, that the strong-AI program has gone on for too long 
<br>
without progress -- that it's worth spending time on this? I suppose 
<br>
it largely (though not entirely) depends on what happens in physics 
<br>
in the near future.
<br>
<p>- Emil
<br>
<p><p>* Not that I am predisposed to insecurity and group-think, but I am 
<br>
trying to clarify for myself why previous stabs at this topic ended 
<br>
up the way they did.
