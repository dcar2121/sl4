<p>There's jobs in neural prosthetics... who said there wasn't?  There's
<br>
even a moderately sized program out of NIH supporting such work for a
<br>
couple of years now:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://npp.ninds.nih.gov/">http://npp.ninds.nih.gov/</a>
<br>
<p>Of course NIH isn't about transhumanism so you'll have to focus on
<br>
helping disabled people but that's a good starting point and probably
<br>
more useful in the near term.  It will have useful transhuman offshoots
<br>
given time -- I think that you're trying to do things in the wrong
<br>
order.

<p>I think that you are whining about nothing -- you're simply not
<br>
informed.
<br>
<p>I myself plan to get involved in this area...

<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Our goal should be to provide worlds that are so exciting -- such
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we read about in the novel 'True Names' -- that our players
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remain in the game, instead of returning to their everyday jobs.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or, maybe our goal should be to create everyday jobs (in anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and cognitive &quot;inloading,&quot; for example) that are so exciting they
</em><br>
seem
<br>
<em>&gt; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like play than work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ô¿ô
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Stay hungry,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Actually you can make jobs like this..but they are custom and
</em><br>
require
<br>
<em>&gt; you do  rather more than you really need to do the job to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certs.  I will wind up spending 3 years in Anesthesia or something so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can qualify to sit for the Anti-Aging Boards. In a way this is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since it gives me a solid trade but still...it would be nice to have
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; choice. It would be nice to be able to do a Neurology residency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a clinical electophysiology Fellowship without the focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epilepsy and pathology, and instead spead that time working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on understanding the problems facing implants in healthy patients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would give my left testicle (literally) for a Fellowship in
</em><br>
prosthetic
<br>
<em>&gt; medicine...but it ain't happening... you could get a PhD in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bioengineering...but there's another 4-5 years......
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Everyday jobs&quot; that are push a button, get your grades, give up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this much time and  here's the job...well maybe they exist ..but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the neat ones I have found you have to build from scratch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Whine whine whine.....
