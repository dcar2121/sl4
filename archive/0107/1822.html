<p>
Most of us on this list are familiar with Moore's Law,
<br>
which posits a fixed doubling time for number of
<br>
transistors on a chip or processing power/$.  More
<br>
recently Moravec and Kurzweil have noted how the
<br>
doubling
<br>
time for computation/$ has gradually shortened from
<br>
about 3 years early in the 20th century to about 12-15
<br>
months currently.
<br>
<p>I took a look at manufacturing productivity and found
<br>
a similar faster-than-exponential growth is occurring.
<br>
The data are from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
<br>
and
<br>
measure output per labor hour for all US manufacturing
<br>
industry.
<br>
<p>The rate of increase in productivity per year was
<br>
2.1% in the 50's, 2.5% in the 60's, 2.6% in the 70's
<br>
2.9% in the 80's, and 4.1% in the 90's.  The
<br>
first half of the 90's it was 3.2%, and in the
<br>
second half of the 90's it was 4.9%.
<br>
<p>The doubling time in productivity decreased from
<br>
33 years in the 50's to 17 years in the 90's.
<br>
Extrapolating the trend indicates infinite
<br>
productivity
<br>
in the 2030's, i.e. a Singularity.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>I have an interest in the history of technology and
<br>
like to take a long view.  I trace the current run
<br>
up to the Singularity as starting around 1000 AD as
<br>
Europe comes out of the Dark Ages and starts the
<br>
positive feedback loop of technology.  Since then,
<br>
each invention that allows more population, and
<br>
more of that population to be doing non-menial
<br>
tasks has increased brainpower available for 
<br>
further invention.  Improvements in knowledge
<br>
distribution, from the printing press to the Web,
<br>
have made the available brainpower more efficient.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>With or without a transhuman AI, we are headed for
<br>
a future that is radically different.  Once various
<br>
industries are sufficiently automated, we will
<br>
have an economic system that requires minimal work
<br>
to operate.  What will civilization be like when
<br>
everyone can pursue their interests rather than what
<br>
has to be done to keep food on the table and a 
<br>
roof over your head?  What will government be
<br>
like when you can have a &quot;seed factory&quot; or &quot;seed
<br>
robot&quot; that can produce copies of itself as well
<br>
as anything else you need.  AI and nanotech are
<br>
not required for these &quot;seeds&quot;, just high-grade
<br>
automation.  
<br>
<p>I don't know the answers to these questions, but I
<br>
do believe strongly that our technological
<br>
civilization is headed that way, and we'll get 
<br>
there in a generation or so at most.  See you there.
