[responding to Eliezer]
<br>
<p>I agree. Don't see it if you have the chance not to.  Don't forget to take 
<br>
your red pills daily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The one exception to this is their depiction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human-computer interaction in the Graphical User Interface of the future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which I thought was excellent, considerably exceeding the depiction I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen in any other movie.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but Golan Trevize had a computer similar to those [in Isaac Asimov's 
<br>
_Foundation and Earth_].  Put hands down, and just think.  That's my dream 
<br>
UI!  Moreover, Golan had even built an emotional bond with it, which was 
<br>
striking for me when I read it first years ago.  There was nobody that 
<br>
understood him as closely.  Asimov is a fricking visionary.  I love reading 
<br>
his stuff because maybe he is similar to me--creating imagery in terms of 
<br>
all kinds of relations and not just pictorial representations.  So I don't 
<br>
think what the movie showed was so original, and semi-transparent 
<br>
holographic displays HAVE been done before, and this is yet not in 
<br>
opposition to what you say, as you did not use the word &quot;original&quot; which I 
<br>
thought you did for a moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As redeeming features go, it isn't nearly enough to make up for THE PLOT.
</em><br>
<p>what plot? :]]  Insulting attempt at merging wave theory with essentialist 
<br>
shintoistic spirit concept!  At least they went easy on the good and evil 
<br>
stuff (as opposed to the Matrix, which although is a good movie, portrays 
<br>
the AI very negatively).
<br>
<p>PS: I know that the message I'm responding to was a while ago, hope no 
<br>
one's annoyed.  I'll even get to Flare some day.
