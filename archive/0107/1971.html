<p>
I've always thought that we humans are already
<br>
augmented by this thing called 'technology'.  With
<br>
eyeglasses I can see much better than I could
<br>
without.  With Google I can search much faster 
<br>
than manually searching a paper library.  For
<br>
that matter, with a paper library I can retrieve
<br>
a lot more information than a tribal elder
<br>
relying on his memory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From stone tools and fire on, we have been 
</em><br>
augmenting what the human body and mind can do
<br>
by themselves.
<br>
<p>Now, lets look at the comparative time scales
<br>
for different types of 'improvement'.  Assume
<br>
you tinker with human DNA to produce a 'super
<br>
genius'.  It's going to take at least 8-10 years
<br>
for such a child to get to the point of making
<br>
a useful contribution.  Meanwhile, computer
<br>
technology will have advanced 30-1000 fold in
<br>
the same time period.  While the 'super genius'
<br>
might be several times as productive as Newton
<br>
or Mozart, it won't be 100 times more.
<br>
<p>If you have a hybrid system, where neurons are
<br>
connected to extra thinking capacity, the extra
<br>
thinking capacity could do just as well on it's
<br>
own without the wetware to slow it down.
<br>
<p>Even a sub-human AI can learn at super-human
<br>
speeds because (a) electronics has a much higher
<br>
I/O capacity than neurons, and (b) you can gang
<br>
together a bunch of AI's learning different
<br>
things in parallel, then swapping knowledge sets
<br>
or clustering them together.
<br>
<p>So, as I see it adding wetware to the electronics
<br>
will only be a drag on the development of the
<br>
AIs.  Some people are going to do it anyway:
<br>
<p>It'll knock some milliseconds off the reaction
<br>
time of a gamer to tap into his brain rather than
<br>
wait for the neural signal to get to the fingertips.
