<p>Perhaps.  It was certainly less than clear, so let me try again.  My
<br>
argument is that one must be careful to distinguish between the properties
<br>
of the substrate of the computation and the properties of the computation
<br>
itself (and that the argument from Penrose seems troubling only if one runs
<br>
them together).  We don't think that the difference between a digital and
<br>
analog computer arises from constructing one of digital matter and one of
<br>
analog matter.  We don't think that a computer doing Euclidian calculations
<br>
must be situated in Euclidian space, while one doing nonEuclidian
<br>
calculations must be situated in nonEuclidian space.  We don't think that
<br>
the transition to quantum computing will by that mere fact alone make our
<br>
computers better at calculating the position of an electron.  Yet the
<br>
argument from Penrose is assuming a direct connection from a noncomputable
<br>
physical event to a noncomputable thought process, (I agree with your gloss
<br>
on what a noncomputational physical event would be)and a very strong
<br>
connection at that: not merely causal, but some form of necessary and
<br>
sufficient relationship, so that the thought process cannot be instantiated
<br>
on a different type of physical substrate.  This struck me as being remotely
<br>
possible, but extremely unlikely.  That is, the relationship is very
<br>
unlikely even if both forms of uncomputability are true of humans. I could
<br>
think of no other mathematical property that one might even be tempted to
<br>
think could be exclusively passed on from substrate to thought in such a
<br>
way.  And so I argued unclearly above that if we have a difficulty in
<br>
reproducing human quality thought, it will most likely be for reasons that
<br>
are independent of the physical substrate.
<br>
<p>Your example of an oracular function would work in tying thought to a
<br>
quantum process (which could in theory  &quot;look forward in time&quot;), if it
<br>
seemed to have anything to do with how we humans think.  But if foretelling
<br>
the future is the best example we can come up with of an uncomputable brain
<br>
event/ mind process pair,  I think that shows the weakness of the argument
<br>
from Penrose.
<br>
<p>One could argue that uncomputability is so rare that if you find it in two
<br>
related areas, brain physics and thought processes, they must be intimately
<br>
related.  I think that really boils down to a belief that the only way a
<br>
mental process could be uncomputable is if it arises from an uncomputable
<br>
physical process.  (Maybe so, and if so then the paragraph I wrote that you
<br>
quoted above, if not nonsense, is yet incorrect.)  But even so, this seems
<br>
to me much more reassuring than disturbing.  If the only fundamental block
<br>
on the road to AI were the small possibility that a noncomputable quantum
<br>
process, present in our brains and not reproducable in our devices, is
<br>
essential to human quality mentation, I would be elated.  I am much more
<br>
worried that the &quot;frame&quot; problem will slow the progress to AI down by 40-50
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>My overall point, which I think survives all this, is that the appeal to
<br>
Penrose's hypothetical about qualia, which is meant to strengthen a general
<br>
concern that AI cannot be constructed by giving the concern some
<br>
particularity, instead weakens it.
