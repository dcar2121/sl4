Okay, at first, I was thinking great, a Slashdot article by Jon Katz 
<br>
about AI; this is going to be bad.  Well, Jon did his usually good 
<br>
job of looking foolish, but what is interesting is the comments on 
<br>
the story.  Okay, so nothing is in there that would really be all 
<br>
that interesting to SL4ers, but what is interesting is just the kind 
<br>
of comments made and in what quantities.  There were several posts 
<br>
that brought up the Singularity and shed a good light on it.  One 
<br>
promising post realized that AIs don't think like humans, alas no one 
<br>
seemed to see how important this fact is and it didn't get moderated 
<br>
up any.  Most posts would have been new ideas 20 or 30 years go.
<br>
<p>Anyway, here is my analysis of the tech savvy audience after this 
<br>
article:  about 1% think seriously about AI, 24% are ready to 
<br>
seriously think about AI, 50% have thought about it a little and have 
<br>
misguided ideas (which I would like to think are mostly due to 
<br>
ignorance), around 20% are Luddites, and the last 5% are completely 
<br>
in the dark about the whole issue.
