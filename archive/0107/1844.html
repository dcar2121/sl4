</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer: almost everyone will still have to work hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at tasks not of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing to get a decent life, just like they always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.  The liberation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 90% of the population from agriculture only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased leisure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderately. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the total working hours as a % of lifetime
<br>
has steadily decreased.  Between the shortening
<br>
of the workweek from 12 hours x 6 days to 8
<br>
hours x 5 days, the later average start of 
<br>
work (age 14 -&gt; ~age 21), and the extended 
<br>
life expectancy, the fraction of our lives
<br>
spent working has gone down a lot.
<br>
<p>In countries where the population has levelled
<br>
off and the housing stock has been paid off
<br>
(i.e. Europe), they can get by with even fewer
<br>
working hours and more vacation time than we
<br>
do in the US.
<br>
<p>Since my personal needs are fairly modest, at
<br>
age 43 I've saved up enough to live off my
<br>
savings indefinitely.  I worked with a guy
<br>
who had even lower personal needs, who retired
<br>
after 7 years as an engineer.  And another
<br>
couple who between them averaged 0.5 low wage
<br>
job, which was enough for a small apartment,
<br>
food, and the cable bill.
<br>
<p>What keeps people in the 'rat race' is that
<br>
they want nice stuff, and they want it now.
<br>
They forget that the more hours they spend
<br>
working to afford the nice stuff, the less
<br>
time they have to _enjoy_ the nice stuff.
