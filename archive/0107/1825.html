</em><br>
<p>Moore's Law has nothing to do with CPUs!  If transistor counts stop 
<br>
increasing but systems start shipping with multiprocessing CPUs (not in the 
<br>
same chip) Moore's Law is broken.  Likewise, if transistor counts continue 
<br>
to increase as predicted but systems also ship with multiple CPUs there is 
<br>
no effect on Moore's Law.
<br>
<p>Moore's Law (quoted from Intel's web site):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon Moore made his famous observation in 1965, just four years
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the first planar integrated circuit was discovered. The press
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called it &quot;Moore's Law&quot; and the name has stuck.  Moore predicted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the number of transistors per integrated circuit would double
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every 18 months. He forecast that this trend would continue through
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1975. Through Intel's technology, Moore's Law has been maintained
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for far longer, and still holds true as we enter the new century. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mission of Intel's technology development team is to continue to 
<br>
break
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down barriers to Moore's Law.
<br>
<p>Sorry, I used to work for Intel and I'm tired of seeing it misrepresented 
<br>
on this list.
<br>
<p>It happens that more transistors means more performance out of a CPU.  And 
<br>
thus there is a correlation between Moore's Law and CPU processing power 
<br>
over time.
