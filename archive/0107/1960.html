<em>&gt;True, however the first versions of both languages took less than a year

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://history.perl.org/PerlTimeline.html">http://history.perl.org/PerlTimeline.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;version 1.0 at end of 1987, 2.0 in middle of 1988, 3.0 in Oct. 1989, 4.0
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in March 1991.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not really up on Perl or Python history, so I just spent about an hour 
<br>
looking into it.
<br>
<p>Perl:
<br>
1) It sounds like Larry had help from several people on the original 
<br>
versions of Pearl.
<br>
2) Perl 0 took 9 months, but was very simplistic
<br>
3) Perl 1 was released in 1987, not certain how much effort came between 0 
<br>
and 1 or even if they are the same
<br>
4) Perl 1 was very simplistic, it looks like Perl 3 is more at the level 
<br>
Flare will need to be at even for simple AI work
<br>
5) Perl 3 was released in Oct, 1989.  Which gives at least about 3 years 
<br>
from the start to a reasonably capable implementation
<br>
<p>Python
<br>
1) The original version of Python was created in about one year
<br>
2) Guido van Rossum had extensive experience with language design &amp; 
<br>
development from the company he worked for
<br>
3) Python was very similar to the language he already had experience working on
<br>
4) I didn't find documentation on what was in version 1 of Python, so it 
<br>
may not have been at a comparable state
<br>
<p>Assuming I have my facts straight, this should help answer some 
<br>
questions.  It took Perl about 3 years to arrive at a point where I believe 
<br>
it would be comparable to a useful implementation of Flare.  The first year 
<br>
had a couple of people working on the, the second two it was open 
<br>
source.  Version 1 of Python took about a year and may have been comparable 
<br>
to the useful implementation of Flare.  The creator of Python had extensive 
<br>
experience in language development &amp; implementation, which is what made 
<br>
this possible.
<br>
<p>If I got any of this wrong, please let me know.  Thanks.
<br>
