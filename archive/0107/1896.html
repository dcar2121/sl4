<p>Ah, now I get it (I just sent a message to James off list, but I 
<br>
think this will clear things up).  While people use the word 'moral' 
<br>
all the time, I know what the word actually means and what a limited 
<br>
use it actually has.  Of course, some people may actually think of 
<br>
sex in terms of right and wrong, and I think that's my problem right 
<br>
there.  While I might be interesting in talking about sexual behavior 
<br>
qua morals, other people want to think of it as 'this sexual act is 
<br>
okay, but this other one over here is evil'.
<br>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out to me.  I guess I have an explanation 
<br>
of what morals and ethics are and just what I mean by each to write.
<br>
<p>Oh, and BTW:  &quot;No offense.  :&gt;&quot;; I'm operating on Crocker's Rules (I 
<br>
was on sysopmind.com one day, came across the page about it, and 
<br>
realized this was already how I feel, now I can just call it 
<br>
something), so offending me is next to impossible.  :-)  Oh, but 
<br>
reading no offense and seeing a smile does put me in a better mood, 
<br>
so it probably doesn't hurt to type those few extra bytes.  ;-)
