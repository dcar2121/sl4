<p>
Hello, all.  This email is to announce that, although the Flare project
<br>
has not yet been started, there is now at least some preliminary material
<br>
intended to provide an idea of what Hello, all.  This email is to announce
<br>
that, although the Flare project has not yet been started, there is now at
<br>
least some preliminary material intended to provide an idea of what Flare
<br>
is about.  This material is intended for programmers only - it's informal
<br>
and quickly written, and is not supposed to be a complete introduction. 
<br>
Its purpose is to let people decide whether they're interested in Flare,
<br>
and if so, how interested.
<br>
<p>This material may be found at:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/flare/prog-overview.html">http://intelligence.org/flare/prog-overview.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/flare/idioms.html">http://intelligence.org/flare/idioms.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/flare/flarespeak.html">http://intelligence.org/flare/flarespeak.html</a>
<br>
<p>(For those of you who are wondering what &quot;Flare&quot; is, &quot;Flare&quot; is a proposal
<br>
for a new programming language that the Singularity Institute would like
<br>
to have on hand for AI, both because there are specific features required,
<br>
and because we need more powerful programming tools in general. In
<br>
dialects of LISP, both the program and the program data are represented as
<br>
lists.  In Flare, the program, program data, and ideally the program
<br>
state, are all represented as well-formed XML.  Flare would be run as an
<br>
open-source project.)
<br>
<p>I'm posting this preliminary material now, instead of waiting until
<br>
something more complete is available, because at least one Singularitarian
<br>
programmer who lives here in Atlanta has expressed serious interest in
<br>
implementing Flare and acting as the leader of the open-source project. 
<br>
We still don't have funding for Flare, but he's interested in volunteering
<br>
on a part-time basis and he has substantial hours open.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
However, even though it's a very real possibility that Flare will be
<br>
&quot;handed off&quot; in the immediate future, I know that there are others out
<br>
there who have been waiting patiently for me to start writing things up. 
<br>
No formal selection, or even partial commitment, has been made - if you
<br>
want to be the Larry Wall of Flare, or if you want to be in the running,
<br>
please contact me.  You're seeing this new material at the same time as
<br>
the potential leader in question; nobody is being cut out of the loop.
<br>
<p>I must admit that I view &quot;being in Atlanta&quot; as a significant factor. 
<br>
Being able to physically meet will probably reduce the amount of writing I
<br>
need to do before handing off Flare.  Still, if you have good
<br>
qualifications to head up an open-source programming language project and
<br>
you want the job, you'll be in the running - nobody has a head start and
<br>
no commitments have been made.
<br>
<p>At this time, I'm also collecting some preliminary names for people who
<br>
think they might be interested in working on Flare during the initial
<br>
stages.  (The potential project leader has worked with remote
<br>
collaborators before, and he says he thinks it would speed up the project,
<br>
even during the earliest stages.)  Take a look at the referenced URLs and
<br>
see whether you think you'd be interested.  Again, this does not represent
<br>
a commitment unless you want it to; we just want to make sure nobody who
<br>
wants in winds up being left out.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Current candidate languages for prototyping the interpreter are C++, Perl,
<br>
and Java, with C++ currently favored by the potential project leader.  If
<br>
you have a strong feeling about language of initial implementation, and
<br>
especially if you feel that this is a make-or-break issue for whether you
<br>
can participate in the project - i.e., you don't know Perl or you aren't
<br>
willing to work in C++ - please let us know.  Regardless of the choice for
<br>
prototyping, we will almost certainly want to drop into C++ eventually.
<br>
<p>Again, I'd like to note for the record that we are *not* announcing that
<br>
the Flare project has been initiated, and that announcement may not arrive
<br>
for a while yet - if any problems develop with the current plans, you may
<br>
not be hearing that announcement for some time to come.  We're just trying
<br>
to get a preliminary handle on what we can expect if things *do* move
<br>
quickly in the immediate future.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Eliezer.
