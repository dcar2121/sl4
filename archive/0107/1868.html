<em>&gt; Ben,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Perhaps a Better analogy would be instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bird augmentation...dirgible development.
</em><br>
<p>The dirigible analogy is interesting, but I don't find it as convincing as
<br>
my original analogy because dirigibles are not natural systems, whereas
<br>
birds are.
<br>
<p>Actually, the airplane analogy for AI is one I've thought about a lot.  As
<br>
is well known, many famous and brilliant scientists went on record with
<br>
mathematical proofs that human flight was impossible.  Then these country
<br>
hicks pulled it off.  The first airplanes sucked, but they worked -- even
<br>
though the theory underlying them was pretty crude, and only fully
<br>
understood decades later.  It was amazing how rapidly and usefully the
<br>
theory developed after the proof of concept was there.  Now of course
<br>
airplane construction follows theory rather than violating it.
<br>
<p>I suspect the same thing will happen with AI.  The so-called &quot;AI experts&quot; of
<br>
the academic mainstream argue why it's very difficult, there's so much we
<br>
don't understand about nonmonotonic logic, or long-term synaptic
<br>
potentiation, or whatever their particular angle is.  Meanwhile someone like
<br>
me or Eli or Peter gets the first real AI to work, even though it's kinda
<br>
clunky like the Wright Brothers' first plane... and then, with the real
<br>
thing as an experimental tool and a stimulus to the mind, theory really
<br>
takes off and develops side by side with practical experimentation as in a
<br>
*real science* (which AI barely is at the moment).
<br>
<p>The relation between natural flight (birds, insects) and airplanes is loose.
<br>
Yup, planes have wings like birds and bugs do.  But they don't flap them.
<br>
There were many, many early failed attempts to make airplanes with flapping
<br>
wings.  But we *still* can't do it.  And we still don't fully understand the
<br>
aerodynamics of all birds and insects either -- in some cases it's still
<br>
mysterious to us how they fly as well as they do.  The Wright brothers took
<br>
the wings and basic shape from birds, but added a different propulsion
<br>
system -- one of a type that never would have evolved, because it involves
<br>
wheels, gears and so forth, and evolved physical systems never seem to
<br>
involve *separated* moving parts (e.g. an axle and the hole that the axle
<br>
sticks through).
<br>
<p>Similarly, in building AI, I don't think the best path is to augment human
<br>
brains OR even to imitate them closely.  Rather, I think we need to look at
<br>
the conceptual principles underlying human brains, insofar as we understand
<br>
them, decide which of these principles we want to carry over to our
<br>
engineered system, and then with this limited set of principles, improvise
<br>
based on the theory and intuition we have at our disposal, given the
<br>
constraints imposed by the materials at hand.
<br>
<p>Humans have a pretty strong record of creating new technologies that were
<br>
believed to be impossible: airplanes, radio, TV.  ummm... spaceships...
<br>
vibrators? ;D...
<br>
<p>We do not have a similar track record of spectacularly modifying natural
<br>
evolved systems.  We have a great track record of *breeding* evolved systems
<br>
(artificial selection), but the most important cases of this (the creation
<br>
of domestic animals and  crops) have taken thousands of years.  Modern
<br>
breeding of animals and plants still hasn't created anything as important
<br>
as, say, wheat or rice, or the dog or horse.
<br>
<p>Eli and I agree on this thoroughly.  I love genetics and proteomics and I
<br>
think that fantastic work is going to be done in these areas, but I think
<br>
this work will before long be *enabled* by AI's that are able to assimilate
<br>
and reason about immense and diverse databases of molecular information.
<br>
All in all, I'll give you 20-1 odds it will be AI's helping humans to figure
<br>
out how to genetically engineer superhuman bio-beings, rather tha the
<br>
genetically engineered superhuman bio-beings who help to create AI.
<br>
