<p>
The main problem with opening Webmind development to a broad mix of
<br>
developers is
<br>
<p>a) convincing developers that this project is worth working on
<br>
<p>b) the amount of time it takes a developer to understand enough about WM to
<br>
be useful.   While it is possible to spin small, separable problems off from
<br>
WM, nevertheless, the optimal solution to these problems can only
<br>
occasionally be defined without reference to the WM context in which the
<br>
problems are posed
<br>
<p>Right now, WM is way past the &quot;vision&quot; stage and has led to loads of
<br>
difficult specific problems (mainly at the interfaces between different
<br>
modules (association-formation and concept formation, existential
<br>
quantifiers in higher-order inference and schema learning, etc.; but also
<br>
more basic stuff, like what's the best way to measure the &quot;usefulness of
<br>
thinking about X recently&quot;, a quantity used in importance evaluation and
<br>
scheduling, etc. etc. etc.).
<br>
<p>Furthermore, we're willing to open up the high-level conceptual docs to
<br>
anyone who's willing to sign a simple non-D document, and the codebase to
<br>
anyone who'll sign a non-D and who appears actually to be willing and able
<br>
to help with the work.  This is not open-source, but it's open enough to
<br>
allow academics, for instance, to participate if they want to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Accelerating the seed AI development
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The points made by Ben and Eli regarding the work required to achieve a
<br>
human-level seed AI and then to build towards a super-human version
<br>
demonstrate the value of opening the process at the current stage to a
<br>
broader mix of developers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do this without necessarily going all the way to reveal every
<br>
detail about the code is to identify specific problem areas where particular
<br>
kinds of algorithms may be useful. The first class minds on the main AI team
<br>
can describe the nature of the problem they are working to solve and provide
<br>
suggestions of possible algorithms. Then, hundreds of graduate level AI
<br>
folks could generate potential solutions where the most useful contributions
<br>
could then be explored in depth by the main research team.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is likely to be necessary as practical experience shows that the
<br>
dream of a couple thousand lines of code chugging away on Beowulf machines
<br>
don't get you very far. Without knowing the details of Ben's work, I can see
<br>
that he is running up against the many practical, technical problems that
<br>
require hard, grinding work to solve. Furthermore, there may be hundreds or
<br>
even thousands of these.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will know that progress is happening when Ben and Eli are raising lots
<br>
of specific problems that they are struggling to solve. Then, we'll know
<br>
they are past the vision and into the nuts and bolts.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck!
