hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't have to examine the Webmind design or code because no one can in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact define exactly what Real AI is.  You can't compare to something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no definition!  That's my point.  We don't have any idea of what Real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI looks like, and as such can't make any accurate statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create one much less how long that will take.
</em><br>
<p>Our first goal is to create a program that can hold an intelligent
<br>
conversation with humans about topics that it knows about.  It appears the
<br>
first version will know about financial markets and genetic and proteomic
<br>
data, for instance.  &quot;intelligent conversation&quot; is a qualitative assessment
<br>
which doesn't mean &quot;precisely human-like conversation&quot;, but, it can be
<br>
specified fairly precisely.  I'll post something defining what I mean by
<br>
this in a few weeks when I post a general document on milestones and
<br>
benchmarks for would-be AI systems.
<br>
<p>Once real communication between a human and an AI is established, then we
<br>
can move toward the next major goal which is having the system progressively
<br>
improve its own intelligence through self-modification.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I know that researchers have been able to interface devices with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous system.  There is a vision system that can take a camera
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly stimulates the optic nerve to produce rudimentary vision in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blind people.  Thus giving blind people real-time vision (albeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low resolution currently).  So we can say that their has been success in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural interfaces.  On the other hand, as far as I know, no one has ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created a working general AI of any order.  Webmind/Biomind may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced in that field but if I remember correctly they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never run the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system as a whole.  So I'd be tempted to say that, at the moment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into neural interfaces seems further along than research into AI.
</em><br>
<p>I guess this is a silly debate.  Both fields are at a relatively primitive
<br>
stage, far from achieving their end goals.  Is super-low-res vision closer
<br>
to real brain-enhancement than Deep Blue and EURISKO are to real AI?  Who
<br>
was the greater President, Lincoln or Washington or FDR?  Who's a cuter
<br>
French actress, Julie Delpy or Juliette Binoche?
