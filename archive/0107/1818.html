<p>
I would like to introduce myself. Hopefully most of you haven't filtered my name
<br>
out from my email change debacle.
<br>
<p>If the following reads like my resume, that's because I've cut'n'pasted stuff
<br>
from my resume.
<br>
<p><p><p>EDUCATION : Bachelor of Science (Computer Science major) University of Melbourne
<br>
1990
<br>
<p>BRIEF PERSONAL HISTORY :
<br>
&nbsp;I was born in Sydney, Australia in 1970. Both of my parent's work was in
<br>
graphic design, commercial art, book design and publishing and commercial
<br>
photography. My parents have worked for major book publishers and more recently
<br>
from their home business. I lived in Melbourne, Australia for 18 years where I
<br>
attended school, started one year of my Bachelor of Science degree at Monash
<br>
University and completed the remainder of my Bachelor degree at the University
<br>
of Melbourne.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;After graduating I took a job offer to work for CSIRO Australia as part of a
<br>
support team for Australia's most powerful supercomputer site. During this
<br>
period I became very familiar with all aspects and usage of the Internet and BBS
<br>
's, both technical and social, including the newest fad at the time called the
<br>
World Wide Web. It was through email correspondence that I first met my
<br>
wife-to-be, Rachael.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Rachael was studying theater as a freshman student at the University of
<br>
Northern Iowa in the USA. We started corresponding with each other by chance by
<br>
participating in an email discussion group that talked about life in the
<br>
theater. After a while, I offered to pay for half of a return trip from the USA
<br>
to Australia so that we could meet in person. She accepted, and we fell in love
<br>
during her stay in Australia for three months. We decided that we wanted to
<br>
marry, and I would immigrate to the USA. I successfully applied for a K1 fiancé'
<br>
s visa, which implies that upon entering the USA I was to marry Rachael (a US
<br>
citizen), and now I have the status of a USA resident alien with a green card
<br>
work permit. I am still an Australian citizen.

<br>
<p><p><p><p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXPERIENCE :
<br>
None. Except for the one year I did as part of my undergraduate course. I have
<br>
always had a passion since I was a child for Mathematics, Computer Science,
<br>
Artificial Intelligence and Psychology. I did consider getting a post-graduate
<br>
degree Masters in Cognitive Science about 10 years ago, but I sold out and
<br>
worked full time at my job. Now, that I'm married (no kids yet) and have a
<br>
mortgage, and a well paying job, I still feel I'm missing out a lot in the field
<br>
of A.I. which is what I really want to be doing.
<br>
<p>Recently, I have read &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot;, and as expected it explained fairly
<br>
concisely things that I've been thinking about for years. I don't remember how I
<br>
found www.intelligence.org , but I did. I printed and read most of version 0.9 of
<br>
Eli's Friendly AI. I've read most of Eli's stuff at www.sysopmind.com . I
<br>
figured while most of my family and friends are SL0 to SL3, I'm SL4, hence me
<br>
joining this mail list.
<br>
<p>Like any intelligent person dissatisfied with their life, I've had many a dream
<br>
about starting my own business, hiring experts and creating what has recently
<br>
been formally described to me as Seed A.I. Like any creative person, I have had
<br>
many ideas of products that I would like to develop with this A.I. and make lots
<br>
of money. Then I discovered WebMind. Just today, I (quickly) read Ben Goertzel's
<br>
story and analysis of what went wrong with WebMind. It made me genuinely sad.
<br>
Especially if I am ever worthy enough to be involved with WebMind 2, I would
<br>
have to move to Brazil! ;-)
<br>
<p>I also have a deep non-professional interest in psychology. I like to watch
<br>
people. I like to watch myself. I like people watching me ;-) I get enthusiastic
<br>
about self-help seminars and motivational speakers. I believe that when Western
<br>
medicine doesn't work, there is usually an &quot;alternative&quot; medicine or technique
<br>
that will. I believe in meditation, Zen, self-hypnosis. I know about creativity
<br>
techniques as designed by Edward de Bono. I know about body language and
<br>
communication and persuasion techniques with Neural Linguistic Programming
<br>
(NLP). I am very interested in social engineering and how technology affects us.
<br>
I'm an atheist, and I don't believe there are UFO's or aliens out there watching
<br>
us (although I do run SETI@home, just in case ;-). I can't wait for The
<br>
Singularity to occur.
<br>
<p><p>That'll do for now.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon
