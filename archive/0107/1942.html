<em>&gt; Ben wrote in unquotable html:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I think that the development of human level AI will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the efforts of a small focused team.  However, I think that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of *superhuman* AI will occur as you describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It will work like this.  A small team will build the roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-level AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and the world will get psyched about it.  THEN, the code will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opened up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and thousands of coders will participate in improving and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing and tuning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various components, contributing their creativity and making the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  smarter and smarter.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still don't get this. You described in your other messages that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect the completed human-level Webmind to be able to both reprogram
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself and its environment. If this is the case, why does it need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of very very slow human programmers to help it improve itself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldn't Webmind be able to improve, test, and tune itself much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly than realtime? Especially as it has access to faster hardware?
</em><br>
<p>The useful modification of a Webmind or other sophisticated AI system is a
<br>
*very hard problem*.  Only a certain subset of very smart humans, with a
<br>
particular cognitive orientation, are able to carry out this sort of task.
<br>
<p>Thus I assume that, when a Webmind begins to be able to usefully modify
<br>
itself, it won't be an expert at doing so.  Within the domain of
<br>
Webmind-improvement, it will have some strengths and some weaknesses.
<br>
Probably complementing the strengths and weaknesses of human experts and
<br>
Webmind-improvement.  Thus there will be a phase, most probably one of years
<br>
but pessimistically perhaps one of decades, where Webmind and humans are
<br>
improving Webminds in parallel.  This will lead up to the next phase where
<br>
Webminds are just so much better than humans at improving Webminds that
<br>
human assistance is irrelevant.
<br>
<p>It seems that the difference between our intuitions is that I suspect a
<br>
years-long &quot;semi-hard takeoff&quot; with ample human assistance, prior to the
<br>
hard takeoff, whereas you and Eli envision a briefer semi-hard takeoff
<br>
period without much human help.  (Some rather obscene metaphors suggest
<br>
themselves here, but I'll refrain ;)
<br>
<p>By the way, the assumption that Webminds or other AI's will be much faster
<br>
than humans is questionable.  This depends on hardware advances.  Of course
<br>
there are some things computers can do much faster than humans right now,
<br>
and there will be some cognitive tasks that Webminds can carry out much more
<br>
efficiently than humans early on (there already are, even now).  But even
<br>
though the elementary operation of a CPU is faster than that of a neuron,
<br>
there are just *so many fucking neurons*!!  The new Webmind core is pretty
<br>
fast, but even so, suppose one (very crudely) maps each WM node to a
<br>
neuronal group in the brain (1000-50,000 neurons, say).    Can Webmind cycle
<br>
through all its nodes as fast as the brain can activate all the
<br>
corresponding neuronal groups?  Not yet.  On a distributed hardware platform
<br>
(a Beowulf cluster, say), it can come sorta close in a few years perhaps,
<br>
with the efficiency of the new implementation and some more hardware
<br>
improvements, but it's not there (I can quantify this later).
