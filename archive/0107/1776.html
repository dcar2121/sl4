Ben,
<br>
<p>Sorry for taking so long to respond. We're real busy at work these days.
<br>
<p>Just did a talk on augmenting humans through direct brain interfaces --
<br>
my degree is cognitive science / neuroscience so I have a little of the
<br>
requisite knowledge in this area.  It seems very likely that we can do a
<br>
lot by making little additions or regulatory changes but it will not be
<br>
that easy.
<br>
<p>Your perspective is appreciated. I come from an applied research background in Artificial Intelligence not neuroscience.
<br>
<p>The technology to read from individual neurons within chronic
<br>
implantations is here.  I have not yet read of any major successes in
<br>
long-term artificial stimulation of individual neurons -- but that's
<br>
just an engineering problem and just give it time.  This stuff doesn't
<br>
really require esoteric nanotechnology, magical quantum interfaces but
<br>
just electrical current readings of the relevant neurons.  In other
<br>
words, the technology for making the bidirectional connections is not
<br>
major limiting factor.
<br>
<p>I agree. In addition to the pychological appeal of &quot;in-loading&quot; versus &quot;up-loading&quot;, there are major software problems which can simply be by passed if one goes the &quot;in-loading&quot; route. I cannot stress enough, the major industrial scale software issues involved in &quot;up-loading&quot;.
<br>
<p>What is the problem is figuring out what exactly will make us smarter
<br>
and how to integrate that in to our existing brain architecture.  It's
<br>
not as simple as adding more memory -- there is tons of different types
<br>
of memory in the brain and they are highly distributed very connected
<br>
with the computations being preformed.  Also there are a lot of
<br>
calibration problems that have to be overcome if we would like to be
<br>
able to recognize meaningful patterns in the brain.
<br>
<p>Again I agree completely. Plus these kinds of dynamic/adaptive system engineering problems are being worked on by today's machine learning community. These are difficult engineering problems; but, we are decades closer to solving these kinds of issues than we are to solving the kinds of software issues involved in &quot;up-loading&quot;.
<br>
<p>Thanks

<em>  &gt; Subject: RE: The Human Augmentation Strategy
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; Michael Korns coined the tern 'inloading' at Extro5 for the approach
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of
<br>
<em>  &gt; adding artificial neurons to live humans to upgrade them. He sees
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; inloading
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; as a more likely, and preferable path to human super-intelligence. It
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is
<br>
<em>  &gt; incremental, and less shocking than uploading - and will probably also
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be
<br>
<em>  &gt; easier to achieve.
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; Inloading involves gradually adding silicon/ nanotube/ quantum?! (or
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; whatever) artificial neurons &amp; connection to our brains, together will
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; some
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; technology to transmit all relevant information to an external
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;computer
<br>
<em>  &gt; for
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; backup. Eventually, artificial neurons would vastly outnumber original
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; ones.
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; I don't actually buy into this scenario for a number of reasons, some
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of
<br>
<em>  &gt; which are here: <a href="http://www.optimal.org/peter/hyperintelligence.htm">http://www.optimal.org/peter/hyperintelligence.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; But I like the meme: inloading - less threatening than uploading.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Simply'
<br>
<em>  &gt; the enhancement of brain function, but ultimately the same result
</em><br>

<em>  &gt; &gt;The suggestion I was trying to make (and not doing so very well) was
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that
<br>
<em>  &gt; the attainment of super-intelligence may be easier to achieve through
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; human
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; augmentation rather than starting from scratch with today's machines.
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; ... . However, I think that such a course is unfeasible both from the
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; moralist perspective and also from a technical perspective....
