<p>
Hi,
<br>
<p>Right now the effort to create a real AI is fragmented among a small
<br>
collection of individuals and groups.
<br>
<p>Among the individuals on this list, we have Eli's effort, Peter Voss's
<br>
effort, the work of myself and the rest of the Webmind Diehards team, and
<br>
some others as well (James Rogers?)...
<br>
<p>I realize that fragmentation is not necessarily a bad thing: evolution
<br>
proceeds through competition of different approaches, and the fittest
<br>
survives.
<br>
<p>However, at a certain point it will maximize our rate of progress toward the
<br>
Singularity if we focus all our efforts on *one* AI system rather than a
<br>
whole bunch.
<br>
<p>(Naturally my intuition right now is that this one should be Webmind, but
<br>
that's not my point at the moment -- and if someone else comes up with a
<br>
design that looks better (or better yet a working real AI), I'll throw
<br>
myself behind it fully.  I want to get real AI built; being the primary
<br>
conceptual architect is not nearly as important to me as seeing the end goal
<br>
achieved and being a part of the process ;)
<br>
<p>What would be valuable, I think, is if we could agree upon a series of &quot;IQ
<br>
tests&quot; for baby AI's, that we could use to objectively assess which ones
<br>
were more promising and generally should have more attention paid to them.
<br>
I also think it may be valuable to each AI developer to see how others'
<br>
systems perform on the same tasks that his system is working on.
<br>
<p>This isn't simple to do in general because the scope of AI is too broad:
<br>
people are making mobile robot systems, they're making computer vision
<br>
systems, mathematical reasoning systems, blah blah blah.  These baby AI's
<br>
are basically different species of program, and cross-species IQ testing
<br>
isn't easy.
<br>
<p>However, in the context of the quest toward self-modifying AI, it may be
<br>
possible to create such tests do more easily.
<br>
<p>Looking at the efforts of Eli, Peter and myself, there is a lot of common
<br>
ground.  None of us are trying to model human perception, action or language
<br>
processing accurately or in detail.  We're all making software programs
<br>
ultimately aimed at general intelligence and goal-oriented
<br>
self-modification.
<br>
<p>It may be worthwhile for us to spend some time figuring out a series of
<br>
detailed &quot;benchmarks&quot; by which to test the progress of such systems toward
<br>
the end goal.  Peter and I have been talking about this a bit; he's proposed
<br>
to use understanding of 2D shapes as an early IQ-testing context.  In
<br>
testing Webmind we've decided to use his suggested 2D shape domain together
<br>
with a couple more practical domains involving real-world data.  I can post
<br>
something here later about specific tests involving the 2D shape domain that
<br>
we'll run Webmind through over the next few months.  (The goal is not to do
<br>
any serious vision processing, edge detection etc., just to do basic pattern
<br>
recognition and pattern creation tests in an easily-humanly-interpretable
<br>
domain).
<br>
<p>Eli may have some ideas for simple tests involving program modification?
<br>
<p>In the context of &quot;schema learning&quot; in Webmind we created some tests
<br>
involving goal-oriented program creation: some maze-running stuff, some
<br>
stuff like &quot;learn to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem&quot;, etc.
<br>
<p>Obviously, we all agree this is the sort of thing SIAI should be focusing on
<br>
(rather than, say, ummm... creating new programming languages (even really
<br>
cool ones) or... augmenting human brains to be smarter or birds to fly
<br>
faster (or birds to be smarter)... right?
<br>
