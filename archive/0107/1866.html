Okay, I wouldn't normally post a dream here, but it's symbolically
<br>
relevant. So: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Just had one of the most peculiar, disturbing dreams it is possible
<br>
to have. And all that happened was that I repeatedly went to the
<br>
bathgroom to brush my teeth! But the way I was doing it... I would
<br>
*lift my head off*, suspend it in front of me by attaching
<br>
some sort of clip to my top front teeth that was at the end of
<br>
a cord that came down from the roof, and proceed to brush my teeth, 
<br>
inside and out! I did this for a few days in succession; I seem to
<br>
remember reflecting at one point about how jealous all those piercing
<br>
freaks would be if they saw what I was doing matter-of-factly every day; 
<br>
but eventually I began to become puzzled about how the whole thing
<br>
worked. How was my head reattaching to my neck each time? How did I
<br>
manage to detach it the first time? Was there a seam visible after
<br>
reattachment, resulting from the first time that I hacked it off? 
<br>
(I never wondered how it was that I was *seeing everything*, 
<br>
however.) On the last time, while these questions were running
<br>
through my head, I fumbled a bit and started to put it on back to
<br>
front. And finally, when I was reorienting it the right way round, 
<br>
it tilted a few times, and I saw that my neck was basically hollow, 
<br>
and further into the skull, disappearing behind some fold of
<br>
flesh, were *wires and cables*. I reattached it one last time and
<br>
looked at myself glumly. I had the answer: it was possible because
<br>
I was already some sort of robot or android. Then I woke up.&quot;
