</em><br>
<p>The reason for this is simple.  First off, we have Ben, so we know 
<br>
that human level intelligence is enough to work on AI algorithms and 
<br>
make meaningful improvements.  I'm willing to bet that, given enough 
<br>
time, Ben could keep making improvements, though as time goes on it 
<br>
will be harder.  Of course, for an AI this isn't a problem since it's 
<br>
dynamic, but I digress.  Secondly, how many dumbasses (yes, I think 
<br>
this is now a technical term ;-)) do you know that can improve an 
<br>
algorithm by any method other than getting lucky?  Personally, I know 
<br>
of none who can do that, but then I don't know that many.  But, I'm 
<br>
willing to make another bet that infra human intelligence is not 
<br>
enough to make useful improvements to algorithms within a reasonable 
<br>
amount of time (if ever).
<br>
<p>But, because I think we are getting way to anthropomorphic, I'll 
<br>
bring up that measuring AI in terms of human brains probably won't 
<br>
work.  If I were building an AI, first I'd want it to learn specific 
<br>
knowledge about computer science and then, as it improves itself, 
<br>
teach ver about more.
