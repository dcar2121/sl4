I suppose I should try to answer Emil's real question, which was: 
<br>
what if noncomputable physics exists, and we need it for real AI? 
<br>
<p>First of all, I am sure that plain old computable, nonconscious
<br>
AI is capable of producing some sort of superintelligence. 
<br>
If &quot;real AI&quot; means &quot;really impressive AI&quot;, then I'm sure you
<br>
don't need it. 
<br>
<p>But let's just suppose that there *is* something noncomputable
<br>
in the dynamics of human thought. Let's suppose humans have a
<br>
cognitive primitive that isn't Turing-computable. The *only*
<br>
candidate I have for that is some sort of 'semantic reflection'
<br>
operation, in which the 'meaning-qualia' of symbols in one thought 
<br>
act as causal inputs to another thought. Metamathematical (Godelian)
<br>
reasoning involves reasoning about the semantics of a formal
<br>
system; it's because you know the semantics that you can prove
<br>
the Godel proposition to be true, even though the formal system
<br>
can't. But you can create a new formal system by appending that
<br>
Godel proposition to the old one as an axiom, and it's not at
<br>
all clear that human beings really can engage in valid reasoning
<br>
about every such augmented system, which is why the 
<br>
Turing-noncomputability of human reason is far from proven. 
<br>
<p>But LET'S SUPPOSE. Let's suppose there's a noncomputable
<br>
cognitive primitive, implemented by some noncomputable
<br>
neurophysics in humans, like Penrose's quantum-gravitational 
<br>
wavefunction collapse. What would AI look like if it wanted
<br>
to use this new-physics process? 
<br>
<p>First, it would need to use the right hardware (quantum
<br>
computers with heavy ensembles of entangled qubits, in
<br>
Penrose's case). Second, it could use a programming 
<br>
language (Flare-prime) which included the extra computational
<br>
primitive alongside +, * and so on. Third, we could write
<br>
code in which we took for granted the ability to answer
<br>
Turing-noncomputable questions. 
<br>
<p>It's not clear to me what this third ability gets you. 
<br>
If the universe has Turing-noncomputable processes in it, 
<br>
then an oracle is going to be pragmatically useful, so,
<br>
okay, when our AI grows up it will want to have oracular
<br>
capabilities. But a &quot;Turing AI&quot; might still be capable
<br>
of formulating such a goal and doing the necessary
<br>
self-reconstruction. The question is: are the semantics
<br>
of the concept &quot;oracle&quot; Turing-computable? If yes, then
<br>
you don't need to already *be* an oracle to think about
<br>
becoming one.
