<p>
This fall, I enter college for my formal education in the ways of 
<br>
computer science and linguistics.  So, my question is for some of you 
<br>
with real life AI experience, how can a computational linguist be 
<br>
useful in AI projects?  I'd like to know so that I don't waste time 
<br>
taking courses that might seem useful to me but end up not being.
<br>
<p>I have thought about this some, so let me throw my ideas out and 
<br>
please add to/correct them.  First, I know that this kind of role is 
<br>
useful in gathering information for the information backing that a 
<br>
good seed AI is going to need to get started, but we're already about 
<br>
20 years into doing this and I project that in maybe 10 years or 
<br>
sooner pretty much all human knowledge is going to be archived and 
<br>
we'll know how to best have an AI interface with that knowledge base.
<br>
<p>Second, I have thought that the AI may just start spurting out to us 
<br>
in vis own language that ve develops (this seems unlikely and I don't 
<br>
expect it to happen, but there could always be a bug that causes the 
<br>
AI to develop communication skills before ve has anything to 
<br>
communicate with).  In this case, having a linguist on hand would be 
<br>
very useful.  Similarly, when we have two or more AIs running and 
<br>
able to talk to each other, they are going to develop a new language 
<br>
that will be more efficient for them (we may not even recognize it as 
<br>
a language, but they'll surely develop some means of communication 
<br>
more efficient than English, especially since anything they come up 
<br>
doesn't need to be spoken, eliminating a lot of the bulk found in 
<br>
natural human languages).  While the AIs will be very smart, I think 
<br>
a linguist may still be needed to, if nothing else, teach AIs how to 
<br>
analyze language and develop a means of translation (especially if it 
<br>
turns out that AIs are really bad at pattern recognition compared to 
<br>
humans and it will take them a few real years to develop algorithms 
<br>
to do it properly).
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm curious what the list might have to say on the subject, 
<br>
but beyond a few posts I think it will not be of interest to the list 
<br>
in general, so you should probably direct replies to me unless you 
<br>
are sure the list will find it interesting in some way (I think 
<br>
flames count as interesting, or at least can ;-)).
