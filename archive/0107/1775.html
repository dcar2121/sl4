<em>&gt; True, but cheaper ram doesn't have anything to do with the 4GB limit on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost effective Pentium based PCs.  The vast majority of systems (mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; board / BIOS combos) simply can't handle more the 4GB.  Some of the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high end systems might, but they are much, much more expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can handle 2-4GB.  So even if RAM was significantly cheaper still it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be cost effective to go beyond 4GB until new BIOSs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mother boards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can handle this become generally available.
</em><br>
<p>Correct.  And all this is very frustrating, tactically.
<br>
<p>The situation is subtle.  It's clearly true that by far the biggest obstacle
<br>
standing between us and a real AI is not hardware, but the lack of a
<br>
demonstrably correct detailed design.  (I think the Webmind design is
<br>
correct, but I don't delude myself that this has been convincingly
<br>
demonstrated yet.)
<br>
<p>And yet, it's also true that to create a thinking machine seems to require
<br>
much more hardware than to actually run one.  The reason is that one has to
<br>
do a lot of experimentation, a lot of testing, a lot of parameter
<br>
optimization, etc.  So that in order to take one's high-level AI design and
<br>
turn it into a detailed design, does seem to require a fair bit of computer
<br>
power -- since we lack the science to *deduce* a detailed real AI design and
<br>
hence have to use some trial and error experimentation in the design
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is then that hardware limitations slow us down a bit.  And
<br>
it's a constant struggle between spending time overcoming current
<br>
limitations so one can experiment with one's ideas effectively, and spending
<br>
time on pure design and analysis and waiting for the hardware to come about.
<br>
Personally, I spent about 8 years doing the latter, and started doing the
<br>
former in 1997 when it seemed to me, optimist that I am, that the hardware
<br>
was *almost there*...
