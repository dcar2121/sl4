<p>Actually, it pretty much is.  The point where we disagree is about how
<br>
hard it is to get to what you call &quot;phase one&quot;.  The reason why &quot;phase
<br>
one&quot; takes Flare or something like it is that initially the AI will be
<br>
extremely stupid and the alterations to the code will be more like
<br>
mutations and less like general reasoning.  General reasoning would work
<br>
about equally well with Flare, C++, or assembly.  The usefulness of
<br>
relatively &quot;stupid&quot; action is *extremely* dependent on programming
<br>
language.  Thus, Flare is needed so that we can build a stupid AI.  If we
<br>
had a smart AI, we could work in raw hexadecimal machine code... or
<br>
rather, the AI could.  The problem is that any AI built will initially be
<br>
stupid.  The better the programming language, the more suited to
<br>
modification by AIs, the dumber the initial AI can be and *still work*. 
<br>
Consider Flare as the first step on a very large ladder.  It's not
<br>
impossible to climb the ladder if that step is missing, but you have to
<br>
take a very *large* first step in order to climb it.  Frankly, I think
<br>
that the second step is high enough already, without yanking out the first
<br>
step as well.
<br>
<p>What you describe as &quot;phase two&quot;, and what I have nicknamed (borrowed from
<br>
Dan Clemmensen, actually) the &quot;self-optimizing compiler&quot; stage of seed AI,
<br>
might better be called the &quot;self-understanding programmer&quot;, capable of
<br>
pouring its source from Flare into Python, Perl, C++, SMP assembly, or
<br>
FPGAs with equal ease.  This is not necessarily 90% of the AI substance
<br>
needed to get to a hard takeoff - but it could easily turn out to be 90%
<br>
of the *time* required, especially if we should be thinking exponentially
<br>
instead of linearly.  Past the self-optimizing stage, AI development
<br>
ceases to resemble programming and begins to resemble chatting with the
<br>
AI.  I'm not sure there's much of a timewise gap between that and the
<br>
Singularity, even if it's a relatively primitive AI.  It may take a huge
<br>
amount of self-invention to move on from there, but it will be proceeding
<br>
very quickly.
<br>
<p>As for the notion that human-level AI will be developed, open-sourced, and
<br>
then slowly developed into superintelligence over years... Ben, you're in
<br>
&quot;hard takeoff denial&quot;.  (For the historical record, the term &quot;hard takeoff
<br>
denial&quot; was invented by Ben Goertzel.)
