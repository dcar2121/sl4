<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago there was a discussion on this list about the utility
<br>
and appropriateness of various languages for coding the ultimate AI.
<br>
Right now there is a lot of talk about new languages and platforms,
<br>
specifically designed to facilitate strong AI programming.  Using the
<br>
right tools for a task is certainly crucial, and I do agree that comparing
<br>
existing languages and designing new ones to aid AI programming is a
<br>
worthy activity.  However, many people (very bright people, indeed) tend
<br>
to lose sight of the bigger picture in this process, and shift the
<br>
ballance unreasonably towards language details, even attributing AI-ness
<br>
to certain features of a language.  In light of all this, I am going to
<br>
violate all sorts of copyrights and stuff, and post a short excerpt from
<br>
Hofstadter's excellent book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; which I found quite
<br>
relevant:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[...] Is it possible for a novelist to concieve of plot ideas,
<br>
characters, intrigues, emotions, and so on, without being channeled by her
<br>
own or his own native language?  Are the events that take place in, say,
<br>
'Anna Karenina' specifically determined by the nature of the Russian
<br>
language and the words that it furnished to Tolstoy?  If that were the
<br>
case, then of course the novel would be incomprehensible to people who do
<br>
not know the Russian language.  It would simply make no sense at all.  But
<br>
that is not even remotely tha case.  English-language readers have read
<br>
that novel with great pleasure and have just as fully fathomed its
<br>
psychological twists and turns as have Russian-language readers.  The
<br>
reason is that Tolstoy's mind was concerned with concepts that float far
<br>
above the grain size of any human language.  To think otherwise is to
<br>
reduce Tolstoy to a mere syntactician, is to see Tolstoy as pushed around
<br>
by low-level quirks and local flukes of his own language.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now please understand, I am not by any means asserting that Tolstoy
<br>
transcended his own culture and times; certainly he belongs to a
<br>
particular era and a particular set of circumstances, and those facts
<br>
flavor what he wrote.  But 'flavor' is the right word here.  The essence
<br>
of what he did -- the meat of it, to prolong the 'flavor' metaphor -- is
<br>
universal, and has to do with the fact that Tolstoy had profoundly
<br>
experienced the human condition, had felt the pangs of many conflicting
<br>
emotions in all sorts of ways.  That's where the power of his writing
<br>
comes from, not from the language he happened to inherit (otherwise, why
<br>
wouldn't all Russians be great novelists?); that's why his novels survive
<br>
translation not only into other languages (so they reach other cultures),
<br>
but also into other eras, with different sensibilities.  If Tolstoy
<br>
manages to reach further into the human psyche than most other writers do,
<br>
it is not the Russian language that deserves the credit, but Tolstoy's
<br>
acute sensitivity and empathy for people.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogous statement could be made about AI programs and AI
<br>
researchers.  One could even mechanically substitute 'AI program' for
<br>
'novel', 'Lisp' for 'Russian', and -- well, I have to admit that I would
<br>
be hard pressed to come up with 'the Tolstoy of AI'.  Oh, well.  My point
<br>
is simply that good AI researchers are not in any sense slaves to any
<br>
language.  Their ideas are as far removed from Lisp (or whatever language
<br>
they program in) as they are from English or from their favorite
<br>
computer's hardware design.  As an example, the AI program that has
<br>
probably inspired me more than any other is the one called Hearsay-II, a
<br>
speech-understanding program developed at Carnegie-Mellon University in
<br>
the mid-1970's by a team headed up by D. Raj Reddy and Lee Erman.  That
<br>
program was written not in Lisp but in a language called SAIL, very
<br>
different in spirit from Lisp.  Nonetheless, it could easily have been
<br>
written in Lisp.  The reason it doesn't matter is simply that the
<br>
scientific questions of how the mind works are on a totally different
<br>
level from the statements of any computer language.  The ideas transcend
<br>
the language.  &quot;
