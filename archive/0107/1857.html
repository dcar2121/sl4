<p>
Evan,
<br>
<p>Having written the original post advocating a consideration of human
<br>
augmentation as a possible better alternative, I'm pleased to see the point
<br>
being made that today's concentrated activity, primarily for medical
<br>
reasons, to learn how to augment humans is preparing the way to human
<br>
participation in the onset of the Singularity.
<br>
<p>No doubt, as Ben has pointed out, there are many technical problems to be
<br>
solved along the way, but the starting point is way ahead of where a seed AI
<br>
approach is starting. Progress in the area of human augmentation will take
<br>
many forms and likely will involve thousands of steps. But it will be very
<br>
measureable and we will know, from year to year, just how much progress is
<br>
being made. I'm not so sure the same will be true of the seed AI approach.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, as a group of humans most interested in this development, I
<br>
would argue that most of us would want to ensure that we were all active
<br>
participants in the experiences the Singularity would make available to us.
<br>
It may be true that the Singularity might leave us all behind anyway, but I
<br>
would like to think that we could construct it in such a way that augmenting
<br>
humans would be its primary task. If we were fairly far along at the time of
<br>
onset, that would make its task that much easier.
<br>
<p>Best wishes on joining the group,
<br>
<p>Jack

<em>&gt; Subject: augmenting humans is difficult and slow... Hi...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Just did a talk on augmenting humans through direct brain interfaces --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my degree is cognitive science / neuroscience so I have a little of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requisite knowledge in this area.  It seems very likely that we can do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lot by making little additions or regulatory changes but it will not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The technology to read from individual neurons within chronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implantations is here.  I have not yet read of any major successes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; long-term artificial stimulation of individual neurons -- but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just an engineering problem and just give it time.  This stuff doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really require esoteric nanotechnology, magical quantum interfaces but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just electrical current readings of the relevant neurons.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words, the technology for making the bidirectional connections is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; major limiting factor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is the problem is figuring out what exactly will make us smarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and how to integrate that in to our existing brain architecture.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not as simple as adding more memory -- there is tons of different types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of memory in the brain and they are highly distributed very connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the computations being preformed.  Also there are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calibration problems that have to be overcome if we would like to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; able to recognize meaningful patterns in the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if you can interface one human, then you can do it to a
</em><br>
thousand
<br>
<em>&gt; or a billion.   You don't need detailed models of the brain for this kind
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; thing - at least to start.  You can begin with a &quot;what do you feel when I
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; this?&quot; kind of thing and once crude dni's are working, things can take
</em><br>
off.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is certainly a hell of a lot more interesting than this uninspired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear-based seed AI thing.  The really neat part about the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach - and why it will nullify the seed AI approach is that you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to ask for resources to fund it, or try to recruit people to work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  It's happening all by itself; most people are not - and need never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, and probably wouldn't care if they did - that they are contributing
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; the singularity.   The resources of the evolutionary singularity are truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast and rapidly getting vaster.  And as others have pointed out, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary path begins with many of what are generally considered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hard problems&quot; solved, whereas the AI people have to start from square
</em><br>
one.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a lot more to be said on this subject, but I'm busy with moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently - to Pasadena, perhaps I'll meet some of you in Southern
</em><br>
Calif. -
<br>
<em>&gt; so I'll close for now.  But I'll be more talkative when I get established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.  (I haven't even written a &quot;join&quot; post yet.&quot;  It needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasized that there other paths - more inspired and inspiring ones - to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity than the imho cringing one proposed by the Institute of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building an AI and - if everything works out as hoped - maybe humans will
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; permitted to scale the heights; what I would call the &quot;singularity by
</em><br>
proxy&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; path.  I, for one, intend to participate DIRECTLY in the singularity.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope there are at least a few others here as well.
</em><br>
