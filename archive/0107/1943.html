<em>&gt; Yes, I strongly got the impression that WM nodes/links/etc. might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the properties of Flare.
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.  You could take Flare syntax and have it interpret to Webmind
<br>
schema, to be executed on the Webmind core.
<br>
<p>However, in general, Webmind schema are not as efficient as C programs doing
<br>
the same thing -- far from it.
<br>
<p>Where Webmind schema excel over C programs is when they refer to other
<br>
Webmind services at many points during their execution.
<br>
<p>So, schema execution is *not at all* efficient as a general programming
<br>
language compiler, but it's efficient for the execution of the *particular
<br>
class* of programs that we believe are crucial to cognition (programs that
<br>
involve the combination of the activity of various WM modules).
<br>
<p>Just to be clear: As of today, we don't have a sophisticated schema module
<br>
yet in the new C++ version of WM.  The one in the Java WM was an interesting
<br>
prototype but very inefficient and not suitable except for toy examples.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's one of the little ironies of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this - Webmind would probably find Flare even more directly useful than we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would, since Flare will probably correspond fairly well to the mindstuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Webmind AI.  On the other hand, this same property means that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since Webmind's cognitive processes are Flarish, Webmind can be written in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java with only one added layer of abstraction.
</em><br>
<p>Or in C++, as is the case with the current version
<br>
<p><em>&gt; SIAI, though, needs Flare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just to get started.  Frightening concept, but there it is.
</em><br>
<p>Because your approach to AI is somehow higher-level than ours?  I guess this
<br>
won't be clear to me until you explain more about your approach to AI.  I
<br>
get the sense that you want to put causal inference of some sort at the
<br>
center of it, but I don't understand what kind of scheme you intend to use
<br>
to represent other types of knowledge (the many varieties of non-causal
<br>
knowledge), and I also don't understand exactly what mathematics you intend
<br>
to use to carry out uncertain causal inference (you've mentioned Bayesian
<br>
learning before, but as Pei pointed out in a private e-mail to you, there
<br>
are many known shortcomings of Bayesian methods in such contexts).  Now
<br>
*this* is the e-mail thread I'd really like to have... but perhaps it's not
<br>
the time for it yet...
