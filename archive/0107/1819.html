Hi all,
<br>
<p>I re-read the Flare docs and thought hard about
<br>
<p>1) what is extremely valuable and what is peripheral in this proposal,
<br>
<p>2) how best to achieve what is extremely valuable
<br>
<p>I don't think Eli will like my conclusion, but I'll present it anyway.
<br>
<p>I think that the idea of annotative programming is a valuable and
<br>
fascinating one.  I'm not sure how necessary it is for AI, but it certainly
<br>
would be a useful tool to play with.
<br>
<p>One way to make annotative programming a reality in a reasonably short
<br>
period of time (say, a year or 2 instead of 5 years) would be to simply
<br>
modify an existing programming language to have the annotative-ness
<br>
property.
<br>
<p>In terms of existing languages, the two most plausible choices would seem to
<br>
be LISP and Java.
<br>
<p>My own preference is for Java, as this is more widely used and is the
<br>
subject of large-scale development at the moment.  Although currently we've
<br>
moved to C++ for Webmind, I still believe that Java and similar languages
<br>
are the future, and I suspect WM will be back in Java or something like it
<br>
one day.
<br>
<p>The Pizza and GJ projects extend Java to have higher-order functions and
<br>
generic types
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/">http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/gj/">http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/gj/</a>
<br>
<p>Similarly extending Java to handle general annotations in Eli's sense
<br>
shouldn't be too problematic, though certainly it will require a lot of
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>Java is far from perfect in how it handles garbage collection, threading and
<br>
lots of other issues.  But I have to believe that the many resources and
<br>
minds being thrown at solving these problems in Java, are going to yield
<br>
better results than a small team focusing on Flare, at least over the next
<br>
couple years.  (In the long run, yeah, Flare could conceivably build up into
<br>
a large-scale open-source initiative like Linux, but this would take quite a
<br>
long while.  Linux had a lot more of an obvious hook for attracting
<br>
worldwide coders.)
<br>
<p>In sum, and to be quite blunt and direct about it, my suggestion is:
<br>
<p>1) back-burner Flare
<br>
<p>2) focus on identifying exactly what &quot;annotative&quot; properties are
<br>
definitively valuable for implementing self-modifying AI, and create a
<br>
specification describing how these properties would manifest themselves in
<br>
an easily modifiable existing language such as Java or LISP
<br>
<p>3) modify the JVM or LISP interpreter appropriately
<br>
<p><p>Of course, making totally new programming languages is fun, and we all have
<br>
pet ideas about how to make a better programming language.  History shows
<br>
that most of these ideas don't come out as well as their creators think they
<br>
will.  The current Flare proposal strikes me as a mixture of &quot;cool pet ideas
<br>
about a programming language&quot; with &quot;really groundbreaking ideas about how to
<br>
make programming languages better for self-modifying AI.&quot;  If we take only
<br>
the latter and leave behind the former, we may be left with Annotative Java,
<br>
Pepperoni Pizza, or whatever...
<br>
<p>I can give more details later as time permits.  Or if someone else would
<br>
care to fill in some details on the &quot;Annotative Java&quot; idea that would be
<br>
great.
<br>
<p>Finally, I think the repeated mention of XML in the Flare documentation is
<br>
basically a distraction.  Yeah, XML is a nice standard to use, but let's
<br>
face it, we can take the run-time representation of a Java program and dump
<br>
it into XML if we want to.  Representability in XML is not the key point,
<br>
annotativity is the key point and XML is just a convenient textual
<br>
expression of annotative internal structures.  I think the documentation,
<br>
before it is presented to the &quot;real world&quot;, should be revised to reflect
<br>
this.
<br>
