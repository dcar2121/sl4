<em>&gt; Surely, once we have a single (even slow) AI with human general cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability (even mostly blind and quadriplegic), super-human ability will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly come down to something like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Building/ getting enough hardware (possibly specialized) to have a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more powerful version, and/ or many of these 'seeds'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Allowing them to learn specific skills &amp; knowledge of computer science,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to apply this to improving their own software/hardware design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incrementally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Repeat.
</em><br>
<p>Look, most human beings aren't able to program computers effectively, let
<br>
alone improve advanced AI programs!  There is a big gap between human-level
<br>
intelligence and being a master of AI and computer science with intelligent
<br>
self-modification ability.
<br>
<p>Yes, this gap could be crossed by having the system read computer science
<br>
papers (although note, human-level intelligence doesn't necessarily imply a
<br>
perfect ability to read human documents and understand them), and having it
<br>
be taught computer science by human experts.  But I think it will be crossed
<br>
by a combination of teaching and ongoing refinement of the inner workings of
<br>
the AI system by human programmers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Provided you have *really* achieved the essence of human general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, the take-off will be Hard &amp; Fast.
</em><br>
<p>The average gas station attendant has the essence of human general
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>I agree that getting from here to human-level general intelligence is a much
<br>
bigger step than getting from human-level general intelligence to the hard
<br>
takeoff.  But I still think that the latter step may be tougher than you
<br>
guys realize.
<br>
<p>I think that to achieve human-level general intelligence, you only need to
<br>
learn to modify fairly small schema in a goal-oriented way; the large schema
<br>
that run a general intelligence adapt over time in a more involuntary way.
<br>
Whereas goal-oriented self-modification requires learning and modification
<br>
of large schema in an intentional way, which is a hard problem, not
<br>
something that humans need to do ever, since we do not frequently edit and
<br>
then recompile our brains.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you guys are like mountain climbers standing on the foothills
<br>
looking up, and figuring when you get 90% of the way to the peak, the last
<br>
10% will be trivial.  But maybe the last 10% is the place where it gets
<br>
really steep and you have to use your pitons and oxygen tanks ;)  My sense
<br>
that this may be the case comes mostly from our practical and theoretical
<br>
work with schema learning... the toughest problem in the pantheon of
<br>
subproblems of cognition, a problem that human minds solve effectively only
<br>
in special cases and guided by special-case heuristics, a problem that
<br>
intelligent goal-oriented self-modification requires to be solved with much
<br>
more generality and scalability...
<br>
<p>I'll be curious to see if Eli's views on this change after he's spent more
<br>
time calculating and prototyping for his own approach to &quot;mental procedure
<br>
learning&quot;
