<em>&gt; I know I'm sounding like a cynic here, but why do we need yet another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming language? I will admit, it's been a while (a decade)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked at LISP, and I may be a lot more familiar procedural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming and with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object-oriented programming in C++ and Java, but I still find it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify YAPL.
</em><br>
<p>I have a similar attitude, though with a slightly different flavor...
<br>
<p>I am sure that current programming languages are not entirely perfect for
<br>
implementing real AI.
<br>
<p>However, I feel that in order to design a programming language that *will*
<br>
be close to ideal for implementing real AI, one must have a fairly detailed
<br>
design for the real AI itself.
<br>
<p>With the Webmind project, after many years and many more man-years of
<br>
effort, we are just barely getting to the point where it's clear *exactly*
<br>
what kind of programming language would be ideal for implementing Webmind.
<br>
(But we are not going to make a detailed design or implementation of this
<br>
language at the moment, because it would take a long time and we've judged
<br>
that our priority now is to get a version of Webmind that really works and
<br>
demonstrates some powerful intelligence.  For the next version, if we're
<br>
well-funded again when building it, perhaps we will go with our own ideal
<br>
language, who knows.)
<br>
<p>I understand that Flare involves many features that are intuitively resonant
<br>
with Eli's ideas about AI.  However, decades fo human experience in the
<br>
domain of computer programming languages teaches that it's a LONG WAY from a
<br>
language that seems intuitively sensible on the face of it, to a language
<br>
that is actually fun and productive to use.
<br>
<p>Thus, I tend to think that a more likely path to success would be: FIRST
<br>
articulate the detailed design for the AI system.  THEN, code at least key
<br>
parts of it in an existing programming language, or several.  THEN, at
<br>
earliest, start to worry about how to create a programming language in which
<br>
these &quot;key parts&quot; would be expressed much more simply and elegantly and/or
<br>
more efficiently.  Without some substantial code snippets of &quot;real AI&quot; in
<br>
conventional programming languages -- or pseudocode at least -- it's going
<br>
to be difficult to really get a new AI programming language right.  And I
<br>
don't just mean a couple pseudocode examples whipped up for illustrative
<br>
purposes.  I mean real code doing real things...
<br>
<p>Of course, although I strongly feel this would be the best way to go, I'm
<br>
also well aware that my judgment has not always been correct in the past!
<br>
Perhaps this time Eli's intuition is right on target, and he's identified a
<br>
language that, when implemented, will be easy and interesting to use and
<br>
will mesh perfectly with his detailed AI designs when they come about.
<br>
Sometimes one gets lucky, inspired, etc. -- that's the wonder of the
<br>
universe...
<br>
