</em><br>
<em>&gt; locking is only required for modifying it).  During the time it is locked if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one tries to execute it an exception will be thrown.  Soon as you unlock a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities already supports querying for an Objects exposed functions or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variables, this is just an extension to that.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think you've fully thought through the consequences of what you are
<br>
suggesting.  Making this work well in the general case would be more
<br>
difficult than it appears you think it would, particularly inside the
<br>
framework of the existing Java VMs.
<br>
<p>An easier way to implement this would be to store the sequence of
<br>
programmatic bits in a properly isolated transactional database engine.  You
<br>
then read your program by fetching some sequence of record ids and doing an
<br>
eval of the code.  With sufficient isolation, you can keep your threads from
<br>
stepping on each other and using an existing transactional engine you don't
<br>
have to reinvent some of the rather complicated logic required to implement
<br>
such things well.  A mildly custom fitted solution of this type would have
<br>
some intrinsic scalability characteristics that a lot of other solutions
<br>
don't.  (This is hardly an original idea by any means -- I've done some &quot;for
<br>
fun&quot; work on Python to adapt it in similar fashion and I'm sure others have
<br>
too.)
<br>
<p>This actually sounds kind of Forth-ish, though I don't have much expertise
<br>
in that particular language.
