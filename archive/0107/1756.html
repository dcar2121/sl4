<p>
Well I, for one, am extremely excited by Flare. Not just for AI, 
<br>
but because I like the concept of an annotative programming 
<br>
language. Many years ago, Gerald Sussman's thesis HACKER (I think 
<br>
it was called) attempted to automate the process of coding and
<br>
debugging ((in lithp, of courth)). I don't recall what limitations
<br>
he ran into (maybe I can look that up on-line, but I bet it'd be
<br>
hard to find), but I remember thinking that programs can really
<br>
be thought of as flow diagrams and that they should be represented
<br>
as such to take full advantage of everything we know about graph 
<br>
theory, systems theory, etc. With Flare, a much better attempt
<br>
at this problem could be made. Programmatically reasoning about 
<br>
the code will be a natural feature of the language itself adds 
<br>
everything one should need to do the job right. Especially if 
<br>
one of the limiting factors will be understanding the world
<br>
around one and that that problem would be being solved at the
<br>
same time.
<br>
<p>Assertion:
<br>
<p>XML will be the lingua franca of the internet. With XML Schema's
<br>
they finally got things right. My dream has always been to be able
<br>
to have a list object ['apple', 'orange', 'peach'] spit it out as
<br>
XML
<br>
<p>&lt;list&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;apple/&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;orange/&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;peach/&gt;
<br>
&lt;/list&gt;
<br>
<p>and have it read by another program. Yes, I know we can unparse 
<br>
or even share binary representations in memory more efficiently,
<br>
the point is to at least agree on one ascii representation. (XML
<br>
seems the right choice. It's powerful enough and has a lot of
<br>
backing.) Next, I'd want to graphically represent the list for 
<br>
visual modification so that you'd have a visual debugger for 
<br>
every language that has a compiler which communicates this XML 
<br>
back and forth. XML is easy to manipulate. It will have 
<br>
pervasive support and pervasive tools (generally it's not a
<br>
good idea to make technological predictions like these, but
<br>
this seems like a &quot;sure thing&quot; considering everyone behind 
<br>
it W3C, Micro$oft, IBM, Sun, ... more of a sure thing than
<br>
Bluetooth anyway)
<br>
<p>Ultimately, this thinking leads one to surmise encoding the
<br>
methods as well as the data in XML for portable computation.  Why
<br>
not define insertion-sort once and for all and add a handful of
<br>
animations. Then someone invents a new language, say, Pliant, and
<br>
you just follow the insertion-sort template and bingo, you can
<br>
reuse the animated visual debugger. The fact that Flare can be
<br>
tweaked to be use either statically or dynamically typed means 
<br>
that there is a very good chance that given an algorithm in Flare 
<br>
for insertion-sort, you might be able to press a button and get 
<br>
the isomorphic version of it in Pliant (assuming Flare is more
<br>
&quot;feature&quot;-full than Pliant is and yes this mapping might be very
<br>
difficult to use all of Pliant's idioms, whatever they happen to
<br>
be).
<br>
<p>Another feature I specifically like about Flare is that FlareSpeak 
<br>
is based on python, my favoritest language in the world, so I'd
<br>
be a happy camper to use it.
<br>
<p>I'm probably not qualified to lead a Flare project, but I would
<br>
if I were. I definitely intend to contribute as much as I can
<br>
as a volunteer because Flare is in the direct path to what I want
<br>
to accomplish anyway (all in my limited spare time unfortunately,
<br>
so it should be noted that these ambitions probably greatly
<br>
outstrip my availability).
<br>
<p>I'd like to implement a mini-Flare interpreter in the XML hobby
<br>
I'm working on now (in Java), so I'll just have to see if I get
<br>
anywhere or not. The good news is that lots of people will build
<br>
little parts of it and Eli can concentrate on building an FAI
<br>
(to build nano-fabs to save humanity and then finally go back
<br>
and document all that code ;-)
<br>
<p><p><p>PS - Eli's document on the Causality pattern (in the same dir
<br>
as the Flare stuff:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/flare/">http://intelligence.org/flare/</a>
<br>
<p>) Reminded me of the cross-cutting of Aspect Oriented Programming
<br>
languages like AspectJ, <a href="http://www.aspectj.com">http://www.aspectj.com</a>, though these are 
<br>
not quite the same things.
<br>
<p>PS - 
<br>
<p>Also a note to whomever leads Flare. If you have the situation of
<br>
<p>&lt;human&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;arm&gt;left&lt;/arm&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;arm&gt;right&lt;/arm&gt;
<br>
&lt;/human&gt;
<br>
<p>XQL (which Eli duely noted on his web page) already has syntax
<br>
for distiguishing human/arm[0] from human/arm[1] (I don't remember
<br>
if that's exactly right, but it's close). If XQL becomes the 
<br>
standard (it's a good candidate), it might be a good idea to 
<br>
borrow liberally from it.
<br>
<p>And away we go!
