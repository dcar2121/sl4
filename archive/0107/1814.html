<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@webmind.com?Subject=Re:%20Languages%20and%20AI">ben@webmind.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why on earth do you folks want logical control to be expressed in XML,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyway?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For my purposes, I want to be able to visualize code, reading a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common description of language independent algorithmic components.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML makes a nice common format that will have lots of tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available for manipulation. And is powerful enough to represent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most any data structure I can think of.
</em><br>
<p>I would just like to point out the term &quot;visualize&quot; here. Very good.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1) Create graphical animated *INTERACTIVE* representations of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transpires during program execution. This will help other programmers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see what's going on (we are a heavily visual species)
</em><br>
<p>This falls under the category of Data Visualization, and if you want to do it at
<br>
run time infers you have a profiling tool that visualizes said data. Sounds like
<br>
a Sysop to me. I think there will come a point (a.k.a. Singularity) where we
<br>
will not be able to understand this data no matter how it is human-visualized.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;and will help
<br>
<em>&gt; in the same way that patterns form a common understandable mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models. The structure of programs, with all their dependencies is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captured all that well by mere text (though text can be a great way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to enter programs). Programs themselves should be thought of and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated as rich data structures! (ie. graphs of interdependencies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.)
</em><br>
<p>That requires a modelling language, like UML. But isn't a program just a
<br>
specific implementation of a model? Also, hardly anyone programs in straight
<br>
text these days. Programmers have an IDE or a text editor, or use their own
<br>
indenting scheme in a basic text editor (unless you're writing an entry for the
<br>
Obfuscated C Programming Contest), which highlights comments in green, keywords
<br>
in bold, etc. None of these visual embellishments affect the code whatsoever
<br>
(unless it affects a buggy compiler). There is a standard, XML based, for the
<br>
exchange of program metadata such as this, called XMI (XML Metadata Interchange
<br>
I think). Rational, IBM, and other big players support this standard.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) Map to all other programming languages (both ways, ie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bijunction).
</em><br>
<p>At least in the object-oriented programming paradigm, XMI allows you to create a
<br>
model, then you can import it into any IDE with programming language support you
<br>
want. See TogetherSoft for their integrated modelling and source editor IDE. It
<br>
supports Java (of course), and supposedly C++.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3) Once a nascent programmer AI starts spitting out programs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ver own, I'd really want to be able to understand them. Pretty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animated pictures which hilight dependencies and causalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems like the best thing to me. If mappings existed to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming languages, the AI could start studying the body of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open source software to determine what is useful and what isn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the parse tree also in XML (ie. Flare as Eli suggests), the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI learning to code would have access to making all sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimizations at all levels.
</em><br>
<p>Like I mentioned in a previous email, I think something would be lost in the
<br>
translation between one language and another. For example, is it possible to
<br>
take Java source and convert it to Fortran? Or to English? And if you took the
<br>
result and translated it to Java, would it be _exactly_ (functionally) the same
<br>
program as the original?
<br>
<p><p>cheers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon
