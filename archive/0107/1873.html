<p>Actually, they could be our greatest worry.  For example, let's say 
<br>
in five years we have the basic core for AI developed (I'm thinking 
<br>
back to when you, Ben, mentioned that WM has a core of about 200 
<br>
lines of code that make the whole thing work) and it works well.  At 
<br>
the same time, Eli hasn't finished the Friendliness module yet (let's 
<br>
say it's version 0.9 and may still have a bug or two and is clearly 
<br>
marked as not ready for production use yet).  Now, some &quot;sweet guy&quot; 
<br>
who is a &quot;mild-mannered eccentric&quot; gets ahold of both and wants to do 
<br>
an AI project on his own just for fun.  Well, if he's not careful, we 
<br>
could all be hosed.  Ergo, it is key that the really important code 
<br>
for AI be kept out of the hands of all but a few qualified people who 
<br>
really know how to use it.  At all times, such code should be under a 
<br>
red button if you will, so it can be destroyed easily if it looks 
<br>
like the wrong people might get ahold of it (by the wrong people I 
<br>
mean ignorant, well-meaning researchers and evil corporations and 
<br>
governments).
