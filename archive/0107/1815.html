<p>The whole point is that if you're making meaningful statements in your
<br>
original program, then the answer to this question is Yes.
<br>
<p>Sure, you can try to translate 'all your base are belong to us' into
<br>
Japanese, and then you can try to translate whatever you got back into
<br>
English...  And the result probably wouldn't make much sense.  But then
<br>
again, neither did the original.
<br>
<p>Languages are advanced means of expressing language-neutral concepts and
<br>
ideas.  Suppose I speak to you in Russian, and you're a smart guy and
<br>
happen to know Russian.  Suppose also that you understand the ideas
<br>
behind what I am saying.  Then you go on to tell your friend what I have
<br>
just told you, because your friend doesn't know Russian, although she too
<br>
is a smart girl.  Now, in effect, I will have communicated my ideas to
<br>
your friend, and she will have in her mind a picture which is fairly close
<br>
to the picture that I had in my mind when I first talked to you.  Our
<br>
mental pictures will be functionally equivalent.
<br>
<p>The crucial part in this process is that you understand what I am saying,
<br>
and not simply the fact that you can translate Russian words into English.
<br>
This is, of course, the reason why all translation software these days is
<br>
so completely unreasonable.
<br>
<p>You may argue that various languages vary in their degree of
<br>
expressiveness, and so you can never quite translate without losing a
<br>
certain amount of information.  Russian is a very descriptive language,
<br>
very rich in adverbs and adjectives, and anyone who has tried to translate
<br>
Russian poetry has found this to be a very subtle process, demanding a lot
<br>
of creativity.  Nevertheless, as Hofstadter pointed out in the quote that
<br>
I posted earlier, you can read Tolstoy in English and not only make
<br>
perfect sense of his work, but be touched by it and admire his mastery.
<br>
The reason is that what is being communicated is ideas, and not mere
<br>
syntax.
<br>
<p>So can you take a Java program, translate it to Fortran, and then back to
<br>
Java without losing functionality?  Absolutely, as long as the original
<br>
program is making statements that are meaningful to you.  Almost all
<br>
modern programming languages are powerful enough as to be functionally
<br>
equivalent.  Can you have a mechanic process which can do that translation
<br>
for you?  That's a whole another question.  Except for special cases, the
<br>
answer is no, unless you can reduce creativity to mechanic processes.
