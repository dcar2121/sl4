From: &quot;Ben Houston&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@exocortex.org?Subject=Re:%20augmenting%20humans%20is%20difficult%20and%20slow...">ben@exocortex.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; The technology to read from individual neurons within chronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implantations is here.  I have not yet read of any major successes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term artificial stimulation of individual neurons -- but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just an engineering problem and just give it time.  This stuff doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really require esoteric nanotechnology, magical quantum interfaces but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just electrical current readings of the relevant neurons.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, the technology for making the bidirectional connections is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major limiting factor.
</em><br>
<p>Looks like you got that right, Ben. Here's an excerpt from today's London
<br>
Times.
<br>
<a href="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/07/08/stidordor03015.html">http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/07/08/stidordor03015.html</a>
<br>
Groups at several universities around the world are also working on
<br>
developing a neuromorphic retina, an artificial version of the real thing
<br>
that could restore sight to people with certain kinds of blindness. Trials
<br>
are under way and crude versions have already been implanted into patients.
<br>
However, scientists warn that the human retina is complex, and we are still
<br>
some years away from being able to build a satisfactory artificial version.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the problem is figuring out what exactly will make us smarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how to integrate that in to our existing brain architecture.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not as simple as adding more memory -- there is tons of different types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memory in the brain and they are highly distributed very connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the computations being preformed.  Also there are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calibration problems that have to be overcome if we would like to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to recognize meaningful patterns in the brain.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, except that _discovering_ what exactly will make us smarter, etc.,
<br>
may supercede figuring it out. IOW, brute force trial and error
<br>
experimentation may yield better results. Personally, I'd go for more memory
<br>
right off the bat (I forget why ô¿ô). Anyway, a &quot;neuromorphic retina&quot; would
<br>
excite the bio-feedback crowd and possibly help to recognize meaningful
<br>
patterns in the brain, or who knows, teach us how to provide positive
<br>
optimization feedback to amplify our own intelligence. If so, would you order
<br>
one or two?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
