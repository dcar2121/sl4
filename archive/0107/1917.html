I am pretty willing to call it a draw, but had to say a few last things...
<br>
<p>There is no way to PROVE 100% w/o a doubt right now that AI is very likely
<br>
to precede RNIs. However what I think I have at least shown is that we are
<br>
at a point in time now where there is at least a real possibility of having
<br>
real AI. The hardware is here. The software /may/ be here. This however is
<br>
lacking in RNIs, so what we can at least say is that there is NO chance of
<br>
having RNIs in this decade. Will you at least give me that Higgins?

</em><br>
<p>Whatever, but you'd be wrong. RNIs are at the stage of AI in the middle
<br>
20th century- both the hardware (ability to connect automatically to
<br>
large numbers of individual neurons in many different people) and software
<br>
(figuring out how to increase memory, intelligence, etc. with an implant)
<br>
do not exist. With AI we have the hardware, and MAY have the software- we at
<br>
least have the software for some areas of human ability.
<br>
<p>Now RNIs may progress faster than AI did on its timeline, but you cannot
<br>
say that at the current time RNIs are anywhere near AI. Perhaps you
<br>
simply know less about AI than you think you do about RNIs and this is
<br>
biasing you to believe RNIs will arrive first?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But it will most likely take many steps to get to that point, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; based on Eli's Seed AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ok, but you will agree that in a SI vs. somewhat augmented humans match,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the SI can get the Singularity done quicker, probably extremely quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by whipping up some very advanced replicating nanotech hardware. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;only real question is how long it takes to achieve SIness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given a fully functioning General AI, the availability of strong nanotech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that this AI has access to nanotech (I find this VERY unlikely), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes.  But what fool is going to give a seed AI access to nanotech?  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this still requires a functioning General AI that we still have no idea how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build.
</em><br>
<p>That is not what I meant, I meant the seed would grow up into a SI, and
<br>
once we have a SI it would very very quickly be able to make nanotech
<br>
(which the humans hopefully haven't figured out yet).
<br>
<p>BTW, what fool wants to give nanotech to 6 billion unsupervised sentients?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; development, a computer that runs 10 times faster has almost no effect on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the speed of the developer.  Nural implants could, on the other hand, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; incredible impact on the speed of developers as maybe they could think code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of typing it.  I'm not saying that this is going to be necessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but it would definitely be helpful and may be necessary in order to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the proposed time line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually with stuff like Flare we are beginning to see how computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;power can help developers out. Just like how software helps Intel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;engineers create chip designs, software will eventually help software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people create code. Actually it already does, but it is a pretty limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't get me started on Flare.  That is going to take a long time and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge amount of effort.  Great idea, but I doubt it will get the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources.
</em><br>
<p>Hey you could always help out...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't buy the argument that there is a major difference between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;speed we think and type. I know when I'm coding I spend MOST of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time simply thinking about what to type next. And I was always the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fastest/most productive coder wherever I worked... if it was the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that typing speeds were what was holding software creation back, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;could simply throw more developers at a project and it would get done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;faster. Or hire professional typists and let the programmers talk really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fast :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More developers = longer development cycle.  It is a myth that adding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developers speeds up development!  A professional typist would get in the
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, that is what I said. Yet if it was simply typing speed holding
<br>
things back, what gives?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; way, try using voice recognition (even good ones) for coding some time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I can code at least as fast as I can type.  If I could type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster (85 wpm last time I checked) I'm fairly certain I could code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster.  But I am admittedly and oddity.  I once personally produced some
</em><br>
<p>I can also code as fast as I can type WHEN I KNOW WHAT TO WRITE. But
<br>
I seriously doubt you sit in your office or cube everyday and type
<br>
continuously for 8 hrs. You most likely type some, then sit there and
<br>
compile, then test run it, then find a bug and then go looking through
<br>
your code to figure out where it went wrong, etc. etc. Faster typing
<br>
will not really speed this process up much at all. The only way to
<br>
really speed it up would be to more directly get the ideas of what
<br>
you want to software to do directly from your mind into the code. Again
<br>
that would be an extremely complex task for a RNI to pull off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 350,000+ lines of working, clean &amp; (mostly) reusable code in a single year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (while gathering requirements, doing architectural design &amp; technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management).  Maybe this is why *I* think a neural interface would be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darn helpful (because I want one now)!
</em><br>
<p>If we use 46 weeks and 5 working days a week and 8 hrs a day that is under
<br>
200 lines of code a day on average. At 85 wpm and an average of 8 words per
<br>
line of code, that means your actual time per day spent typing would be
<br>
under 20 minutes per day. No matter how you stack it, it appears that
<br>
typing speed was not a significant factor in this particular 350K LOC
<br>
project.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Finally, if you think SI (whether AI or human-based) is all we need,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;then why the bias of wanting human-based ones instead of AI first?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not biased!  I'm simply trying to state that we don't have any real,
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<em>&gt; honest estimation of when we'll get either neural implants or general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI.  I might, personally slightly prefer the human path due to my end goals
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<em>&gt; and my concern over the Sysop.  But any path that truly works and ends with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself + wife + friends uploading into a reasonable, non-restrictive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment is fine by me!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You look slightly biased to me, but perhaps I'm missing something. I also
<br>
want your end goals of everyone uploaded (everyone who wants to) and safe
<br>
in a non-restrictive environment, and yet I didn't end up picking the
<br>
human path. The AI path looks quicker and safer to me, and also the most
<br>
likely end state no matter what unless we kill ourselves off first.
