<em>&gt; &quot;B&quot;, of course.  There is no conceivable benefit to internally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing the brackets and so on.  &quot;XML&quot;, for our purpose, means &quot;tree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure in which adding new nodes or new node types does not destroy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrity of existing data&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, Eli, I am starting to see what you're trying to get at here.  I'll print
<br>
up your documentation and read it carefully and think about it more.  All
<br>
the XML mentions actually distracted me from the important points about what
<br>
you're trying to do.  Actually, XML is almost entirely irrelevant to what
<br>
you're trying to do.
<br>
<p>What is important about your proposal is the idea of making a programming
<br>
language with *efficient &amp; robust self-modification* as a design goal.
<br>
<p>But, I'm afraid that the Flare proposal you've created so far doesn't come
<br>
very close to presenting something that could be given to a programmer to
<br>
implement, with any plausible hope of coming up with a usable
<br>
implementation.
<br>
<p>I suspect that making an internal structure that allows modifications
<br>
robustly &amp; efficiently, AND is reasonably efficient when executing, may be a
<br>
very difficult detailed design problem.  It doesn't need a programmer yet,
<br>
and it doesn't need an open-source-style gang of programmers.  It needs a
<br>
lot of hard thinking on the part of a real expert in compiler design.
<br>
<p>Linux did well with a gang of coders of varying ability and insight, but
<br>
Linux was just a port of Unix to a different hardware platform.  What you're
<br>
talking about here is an internal programming language representation that
<br>
has different mathematical properties than the standard ones.
<br>
<p>Saying that the internal representation will be a tree gets you about 10% of
<br>
the way there.  The hard part is guaranteeing that representing common
<br>
programming constructions (elementary ones, and composite ones) is done in
<br>
an efficiently modifiable and yet efficiently executable way.
<br>
Multithreading and memory allocation are going to be particularly
<br>
interesting issues here, as will be dynamic binding if it's allowed...
<br>
<p>I don't think you should yet be seeking a programmer for this project.  I
<br>
think you should be seeking an expert design group to work out formally how
<br>
this thing should work inside, to some level of detail.  Most
<br>
optimistically, this will take several months of effort.  And then it will
<br>
be time to recruit a programmer, or more.
