<p>You should have stated a goal in order to qualify what was mean by &quot;more
<br>
promising.&quot;  Without stating a how you are comparing the viability of one
<br>
solution to another your conclusions are somewhat vacuous.

<p>I think that is a fairly decent response.  One should not be viewing this as
<br>
something that is mutually exclusive.  Nor should one see either of the
<br>
multitude of paths that people are proposing can not be followed in parallel
<br>
in conjunction with lateral transfer of learning.  I would not risk trying
<br>
to predict which would be more successful in the medium (ie. couple decades)
<br>
or long term (ie. centuries) - I do not value my intellect so highly.  I
<br>
suspect that in the medium and long-term what we view as alternatives may
<br>
become less distinct from each other and thus this argument may be moot.
<br>
<p>In the very near term we all must make choices on what path or paths to
<br>
pursue.  The reasons for the choices are complex and full of individual
<br>
perspective and subjectivities thus I cannot judge or argue against another
<br>
choice of paths.

<em>&gt; Evan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having written the original post advocating a consideration of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augmentation as a possible better alternative, I'm pleased to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being made that today's concentrated activity, primarily for medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons, to learn how to augment humans is preparing the way to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participation in the onset of the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No doubt, as Ben has pointed out, there are many technical problems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solved along the way, but the starting point is way ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where a seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach is starting. Progress in the area of human augmentation will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many forms and likely will involve thousands of steps. But it will be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measureable and we will know, from year to year, just how much progress is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being made. I'm not so sure the same will be true of the seed AI approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, as a group of humans most interested in this development, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would argue that most of us would want to ensure that we were all active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participants in the experiences the Singularity would make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be true that the Singularity might leave us all behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to think that we could construct it in such a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augmenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans would be its primary task. If we were fairly far along at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onset, that would make its task that much easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best wishes on joining the group,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jack

<em>&gt; &gt; Subject: augmenting humans is difficult and slow... Hi...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just did a talk on augmenting humans through direct brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfaces --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; my degree is cognitive science / neuroscience so I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; requisite knowledge in this area.  It seems very likely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lot by making little additions or regulatory changes but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The technology to read from individual neurons within chronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; implantations is here.  I have not yet read of any major successes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; long-term artificial stimulation of individual neurons -- but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; just an engineering problem and just give it time.  This stuff doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; really require esoteric nanotechnology, magical quantum interfaces but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; just electrical current readings of the relevant neurons.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; words, the technology for making the bidirectional connections is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; major limiting factor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the problem is figuring out what exactly will make us smarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and how to integrate that in to our existing brain architecture.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not as simple as adding more memory -- there is tons of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of memory in the brain and they are highly distributed very connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with the computations being preformed.  Also there are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; calibration problems that have to be overcome if we would like to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; able to recognize meaningful patterns in the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, if you can interface one human, then you can do it to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a billion.   You don't need detailed models of the brain for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing - at least to start.  You can begin with a &quot;what do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this?&quot; kind of thing and once crude dni's are working, things can take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is certainly a hell of a lot more interesting than this uninspired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fear-based seed AI thing.  The really neat part about the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approach - and why it will nullify the seed AI approach is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have to ask for resources to fund it, or try to recruit people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it.  It's happening all by itself; most people are not - and need never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know, and probably wouldn't care if they did - that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the singularity.   The resources of the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity are truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vast and rapidly getting vaster.  And as others have pointed out, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary path begins with many of what are generally considered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;hard problems&quot; solved, whereas the AI people have to start from square
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There's a lot more to be said on this subject, but I'm busy with moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently - to Pasadena, perhaps I'll meet some of you in Southern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Calif. -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so I'll close for now.  But I'll be more talkative when I get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there.  (I haven't even written a &quot;join&quot; post yet.&quot;  It needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emphasized that there other paths - more inspired and inspiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones - to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the singularity than the imho cringing one proposed by the Institute of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building an AI and - if everything works out as hoped - maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; permitted to scale the heights; what I would call the &quot;singularity by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proxy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; path.  I, for one, intend to participate DIRECTLY in the singularity.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hope there are at least a few others here as well.
