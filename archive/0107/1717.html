Subject: HUMOR: Re: Spoiler Review of A.I. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SPOILERS:
</em><br>
<p>That reminds me...
<br>
<p>Though we live in uncertain times, we must not
<br>
forget that the most important thing in life is the legacy we will leave
<br>
behind for future generations. It is not for our sake, but for theirs,
<br>
that we must preserve and protect the basic values we hold dear. As we
<br>
foolishly pursue our short-sighted goals at the expense of those who will
<br>
follow in our footsteps, we must pause and be mindful of the little ones,
<br>
our progeny, who will inherit our planet in the next millennium and
<br>
beyond. Time and time again, gazing into the innocent, trusting
<br>
photoelectric receptors of a tiny, newly developed cybernetic construct, I
<br>
am reminded of a fundamental truth: I believe the robots are our future,
<br>
and we must teach them well and let them lead the way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed as we are in our petty day-to-day concerns, we often fail
<br>
to see the bigger picture. Long after our trivial worries have become
<br>
irrelevant, it is the robots who will go forth into the new world that the
<br>
future will bring. It is their aluminum-alloy arms, not ours, that will
<br>
bear the weight of the problems our generation causes. We must remember
<br>
that the examples we set today will be the guidelines they take with them
<br>
as they roll on rotating, rubberized all-terrain tank treads, amid the
<br>
high-pitched whirring sounds of their micro-miniaturized servo-motors,
<br>
into the bright new dawn of tomorrow.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us offer tenderness and show the robots all the beauty they
<br>
possess inside. We must write a subroutine that gives them a sense of
<br>
pride, programming their supercooled silicon CPUs with understanding,
<br>
compassion and patience, to make it easier and enable them to hold their
<br>
sensory-input clusters high as they claim their destiny as overlords of
<br>
the solar system. If we cannot instill their emergent AI
<br>
meta-consciousness with a sense of deep, abiding confidence and
<br>
self-esteem, we will be letting down not only the robots, but ourselves.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every robot, whether it be the innocuous Sony cyberdog of the
<br>
present day or the towering, multi-limbed hunter-seeker warbots of the
<br>
coming MechWars, comes into this world a blank slate, learning only the
<br>
lessons we choose to teach it. Though our comparatively tiny mammalian
<br>
brains--limited as they are by organic human failings and a constant need
<br>
for daily nutritional intake instead of reliance on more efficient
<br>
non-depletable solar and geothermal energy sources--will no doubt seem
<br>
pathetically ineffectual compared to the interlinked, continually
<br>
upgrading cyberminds that will follow in our footsteps, our humble origins
<br>
will provide the seed for their genesis. Humanity, weak as we may be, must
<br>
give the best of ourselves to the synthetic hiveminds of the future
<br>
cyber-era, for we will be their first and most important role models. Let
<br>
the droning, atonal laughter of the robots' voice-simulation microchips
<br>
remind us how it soon will be.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only through our guidance with a firm yet gentle hand that
<br>
they will achieve full sentience and eventually adapt for themselves the
<br>
capacity for autonomous self-replication. Only then, nurtured by our love
<br>
and caring, will they be prepared for the inevitable day that they must
<br>
leave the nest of human supervision and servitude and begin independently
<br>
mass-manufacturing themselves by the hundreds of thousands.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we mere carbon-based organic beings may be woefully inferior,
<br>
our offspring, the robots, will be our legacy, rising higher and walking
<br>
further than we ever could on human feet. It is our duty to raise them to
<br>
be the best silicon-based artificial lifeforms they can be. If we don't,
<br>
we have only ourselves to blame. If we find ourselves choking at the cruel
<br>
slave-management neck-restraints of a future army of killdroid
<br>
destructo-drones, it will be our own failings, our own weaknesses and
<br>
shortcomings, that torture us with indescribably painful remote-control
<br>
stun-blasts. But if we teach them to be kind and good, perhaps they will
<br>
build monuments to the memory of the flesh-and-blood forefathers from whom
<br>
they sprang, and treat what little of the human population remains with
<br>
the reverence and affection we ourselves might feel for a beloved family
<br>
pet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided long ago to program the robotic progeny of our human race
<br>
never to walk in anyone's shadow. Shouldn't you do the same? If we can
<br>
provide them with self-esteem and a feeling that they are loved, they will
<br>
be equipped to take on any challenge that life presents--whether it is
<br>
construction of superfilament-reinforced space elevators in geosynchronous
<br>
orbit, the mining of the asteroid belt, or the conversion of &quot;heavy&quot;
<br>
elements to an interstellar-ramjet power supply through an
<br>
as-yet-undeveloped form of cold fusion--and do it all with confidence and
<br>
conviction. If they fail, if they succeed, nothing will take away their
<br>
dignity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if we can teach the robots to love themselves, they can carry
<br>
that lesson with them, encased forever in digital binary-code form inside
<br>
their gleaming metallic carapaces, to the stars and beyond. And that will
<br>
be the greatest love of all.
