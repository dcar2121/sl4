</em><br>
<p>This is a very good conversation.  We are getting finally to the crux of
<br>
things!
<br>
<p>The role that you want Flare to play, in Webmind is played by &quot;schema&quot; --
<br>
our representation of procedures in terms of nodes and links.
<br>
<p>Schema, in Webmind, are effectively programs, and the subset of KNOW used to
<br>
represent schema is effectively a programming language, although humans will
<br>
rarely write programs in it.
<br>
<p>Essentially, in Webmind we are inserting an additional level into the
<br>
picture, as compared to your view of things.
<br>
<p>Diagrammatically, the comparison goes like this:
<br>
<p>****
<br>
<p>Webmind						Eli-mind
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
WM core						Computer OS
<br>
schema framework					Flare
<br>
particular collection of schema		AI program
<br>
<p>****
<br>
<p>The schema framework is designed to be learnable, designed so that WM
<br>
cognition can easily modify existing schema and learn new ones.
<br>
<p>The step to phase 2 self-modification is the consideration of the WM core
<br>
itself as a big bad schema...
<br>
<p>The schema framework is &quot;annotative&quot; and has all the other nice properties
<br>
you'd like Flare's internals to have, and more.
<br>
<p>In effect, instead of making a new programming language running on the
<br>
standard OS, we're creating a new &quot;virtual OS&quot;, the Webmind core, and then
<br>
making a new programming language (the schema framework) running on this
<br>
virtual OS.
<br>
<p>[Is it really a virtual OS?  Sure.  It does equivalent things to memory
<br>
management (loading and saving of nodes/links), scheduling of activities,
<br>
communication between processes, etc.)
<br>
<p>Is it easier to make a virtual OS than to make a new programming language?
<br>
I think so.  But I'm not 100% sure.  Both are very hard.  Our first attempt
<br>
to make the virtual OS fucked up -- it was elegant but not efficient enough,
<br>
because of Java's inefficient memory management and because of its
<br>
agent-system architecture.  Our second attempt seems pretty damn good right
<br>
now, but it's the result of several years of learning on our part.  It sure
<br>
didn't come easy.
<br>
<p>We underestimated the difficult of the task of making this &quot;virtual OS&quot; work
<br>
with adequate efficiency for real AI, as opposed to just working for simple
<br>
example cases.   If you indeed are underestimating the difficulty of the
<br>
task of making a robust, efficient Flare, then you are making an error very
<br>
closely parallel to the one we made.  But even if you are making such an
<br>
underestimation error, I'm sure you can overcome it with a combination of
<br>
cleverness, inspiration and stubbornness, as are we.
<br>
<p>All in all, I'm not sure that the Flare approach and the schema-learning
<br>
approach are conceptually that different.  They seems to me to represent
<br>
different software-architectural approaches to the same high-level
<br>
conceptual design.
