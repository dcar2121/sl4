<em>&gt; hypothesis, and I don't understand why you feel this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement to be true.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have any communicable justification for your belief in

</em><br>
<p><p>Let me put it this way:  Can you name two or more formal universal definitions
<br>
of intelligence that are fundamentally orthogonal to each other?  I can't think
<br>
of any good example of this.  And if one can reasonably derive all
<br>
specializations from one particular universal solution, it would seem VERY odd
<br>
to me that you could derive those same specializations from a completely
<br>
different theoretical position without the differences in the universal
<br>
positions being superficial and consequently the result of shallow analysis.  My
<br>
intuition suggests this isn't even allowed.
<br>
<p>Therefore, all reasonable implementations will be approximations of the one
<br>
solution and necessarily be similar in all aspects that matter.  Efficacy of an
<br>
algorithm in the universal case generally improves the closer the approximation
<br>
to the ideal, and I don't know why that would be different here.  In fact, the
<br>
empirical evidence seems to suggest that this is *definitely* the case when
<br>
talking about AGI.  The thing that makes many broken AGI implementations
<br>
&quot;broken&quot; isn't that they are not approximations of the One True Solution, but
<br>
that the efficacy is so poor that they may as well not be in the real world on
<br>
real machines.
<br>
<p>IMPORTANT POINT: I think it would be trivial to show that *most* AGI designs are
<br>
theoretically valid approximations of the One True Solution (e.g. is it an FTM).
<br>
The real distinguishing factor is the efficacy of the design in an algorithm
<br>
space that severely punishes poor efficiency to the extent of rendering many
<br>
designs intractable in the general case on real machines.
<br>
<p>I'll explicitly state the caveat that my hypothesis is strictly for AGI, not for
<br>
specialized sub-fields of AI -- it seems obvious to me that it wouldn't apply in
<br>
the case of specialized AI.  It is less that I have proof of my hypothesis than
<br>
I've never seen evidence to the contrary.  Most of the &quot;contrary&quot; examples I can
<br>
think of were either shallow analysis or do not really address the underlying
<br>
issue.
<br>
<p>Perhaps it isn't clear to me what your counter-hypothesis is.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
