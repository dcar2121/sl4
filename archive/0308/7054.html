<em>&gt;Risky paths are reasonable only if there are no knowable faults with the path. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Creating an AI without a concrete theory of Friendliness, perhaps because you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't think it's necessary or possible to work out anything beforehand, is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowable fault. It is both necessary and possible to work out essential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things beforehand (eg. identifying &quot;silent death&quot; scenarios where the AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're experimenting with appears to perfectly pick up Friendliness, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become unFriendly as soon as it's not dependant on humans). You can't work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out every detail so you'll update and test your theories as evidence from AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development comes in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Creating an AI with the belief that no special or non-anthropomorphic efforts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are needed for Friendliness, perhaps assuming it'll be an emergent behaviour 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of interaction between altruistic humans and the developing AI or that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need only raise the AI 'child' right, is another knowable fault. There a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bunch of them, since there are always more ways to go wrong than right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An AI effort is only a necessary risk given that it has no knowable faults. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The project must have a complete theory of Friendliness, for instance. If you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't know exactly how your AI's going to be Friendly, it probably won't be, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so you shouldn't start coding until you do. Even then you have to be careful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to have a design that'll actually work out, which requires you to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficenlty rational and take efforts to &quot;debug&quot; as many human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrationalities and flaws as you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;AGI project&quot; -&gt; &quot;Friendly AGI project&quot; is not a trivial transformation. Most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI projects I know of have not taken sufficent upfront effort towards 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendliness, and are therefore &quot;unFriendly AGI projects&quot; (in the sense of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Friendly, not explictly evil) until they do. You have to have pretty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strong evidence that there is nothing that can be discovered upfront to not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take the conservative decision to work out as much Friendliness as possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before starting. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since an unFriendly AI is one of the top (if not the top) existential risk, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we're doomed both with and without AGI. For an AGI to have a good chance not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to destroy us, Friendliness is necessary. Ergo, Friendly AIs are better than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our default condition. By default an AGI is unFriendly: humane morality is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not something that simply emerges from code. If the AGI project hasn't taken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant up front measures to understand Friendliness, along with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continuing measures whilst developing the AI, it's not likely to be Friendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The unFriendly AI wouldn't destroy literally everything, but optimise nearby 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter to better fufill it's goal system. An unFriendly AI doesn't care for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans, and so we get used as raw matter for computronium. It's this kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scenario that's the risk.
</em><br>

<p>Hi Nick,
<br>
<p>I don't have a clear understanding of the big picture yet, but I think I've
<br>
spotted a mistake here: &quot;Robust&quot; Friendliness requires non-anthropomorphic,
<br>
mathematical / logical precision. Anything less than that would be risky.
<br>
However, Friendly to whom? We seem to have already excluded other
<br>
primates from consideration, not to mention animals. Even if that is OK,
<br>
the defintion of Friendliness will become more problematic when uploading
<br>
becomes available. Are uploads humans? Do copies have separate votes or
<br>
1 vote? I'm not sure how a formal system of Friendliness is capable of
<br>
dealing with such questions.
<br>
<p>The second problem is that Friendliness will be designed by a group of
<br>
*human* programmers, not by an AI. If we then concentrate all our
<br>
computational resources to the FAI, then Friendliness will effectively
<br>
become some sort of universal political solution. In other words:
<br>
A group of human programmers will have to design a perfect political
<br>
system. That sounds very unrealistic...
<br>
<p>The question is why put ourselves in a vulnerable position, sub-
<br>
-ordinating to a superintelligence which doesn't even exist now.
<br>
<p>Personally I think the most appealing solution is to let people augment
<br>
themselves rather than create autonomous intelligent entities. But we
<br>
don't have a direct neural interface to connect our brains to computers.
<br>
Unless we get uploaded otherwise we'll have to rely on LANGUAGE to
<br>
communicate with computers. This *linguistic bottleneck* is the hardest
<br>
problem I think.
<br>
