FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL ACCELERATION: A HIDDEN LAW OF NATURE?
<br>
<p>Technologist and Singularity Researcher Kurzweil to Debate Vitalist Denton
<br>
and Techno-Philosopher Tuomi at &quot;Accelerating Change Conference&quot;
<br>
<p>STANFORD UNIVERSITY (August 15, 2003) - Ray Kurzweil, noted inventor,
<br>
software developer and futurist, will present his work on &quot;the law of
<br>
accelerating returns&quot; and debate its merits with biologist Michael Denton
<br>
and innovation theorist Ilkka Tuomi to kick off a weekend conference devoted
<br>
to rigorous examination of the apparent acceleration of technology's
<br>
development, and the way it affects the human world.
<br>
<p>&quot;Accelerating Change '03,&quot; organized by the Institute for Accelerating
<br>
Change (IAC), will be held at Stanford University's Tresidder Union,
<br>
September 12-14. Twenty-four prominent thinkers will offer their insights
<br>
from across a broad spectrum of cutting edge disciplines, such as biological
<br>
computing, nanotech, interface design, cosmology, and futurism.
<br>
<p>Is technological acceleration a hidden law of nature? Is Kurzweil on to the
<br>
ultimate &quot;next big thing&quot;? Is there a trend, as he believes, of increasing
<br>
technological acceleration that leads to a &quot;singularity&quot; - a change so great
<br>
that it can't be understood before it occurs?
<br>
<p>His data shows that many trends in technology's development have accelerated
<br>
independent of economic conditions, marching to their own increasing
<br>
efficiencies, and periodically taking us into an &quot;exponential economy.&quot; But
<br>
can this be extrapolated to all computational systems?
<br>
<p>After his presentation, Kurzweil will debate Michael Denton, noted
<br>
post-Darwinian biologist and Platonist (&quot;Protein Folds as Platonic Forms,&quot;
<br>
J. Theoretical Bio, 2002), who proposes that our living proteins have unique
<br>
emergent properties that will not easily, or perhaps ever, be modeled by
<br>
technological systems. Denton thus asks whether there is something &quot;vital&quot;
<br>
to biological systems that must remain inaccessible to technology.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil will then debate Ilkka Tuomi, noted technology scholar and critic
<br>
of Moore's Law (the apparent doubling of computer power every 18-24 months).
<br>
Tuomi contends that Moore's famous &quot;law&quot; has been subject to both cultural
<br>
overstatements and bad data. He proposes that processor innovation is not
<br>
supply driven, but results from the paradoxical fact that the users of
<br>
information technology have been able to innovate new social uses for
<br>
semiconductors faster than engineers have been able to develop improved
<br>
technology. Tuomi sees the potential for stunning productivity increases
<br>
through the intelligent use of technology, but argues that the future of
<br>
semiconductors is finally determined by social innovation.
<br>
<p>An additional controversy of technological acceleration is whether
<br>
tomorrow's technology will be increasingly more &quot;autonomous&quot;? That is, will
<br>
it be more self-repairing, self-adapting, and self-governing?
<br>
<p>John Koza (Genetic Programming IV: Human-Competitive Machine Intelligence,
<br>
2003), another distinguished speaker at the event, will present the latest
<br>
evidence for self-organizing machine intelligence, and the increasing
<br>
number of areas where it matches or outcompetes biological intelligence.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are organizing 'Accelerating Change '03' to create broader awareness of
<br>
the way 'offspring' of complex systems always seem to accelerate over time,&quot;
<br>
says John Smart, President of IAC, the nonprofit organization behind the
<br>
event. &quot;Carl Sagan noted that replicating stars give rise to life-hospitable
<br>
planets, which give rise to genetic evolution, which gives rise to cultural
<br>
evolution, which gives rise to technological evolution, in a continual
<br>
quickening process that is still unexplained by our physics textbooks. And
<br>
now, systems that exceed even our own biologically-paced computation are
<br>
pulling us toward an unknown future.&quot;
<br>
<p>Smart continues, &quot;Kurzweil is one of a growing number of ground-breaking
<br>
theorists from a broad range of fields who have important things to say
<br>
about the next 10 to 30 years. Even with many of the dot coms gone, the
<br>
economy and culture remain permanently on a new, faster 'internet time.' To
<br>
engineer sustained economic recovery, we must learn how to guide
<br>
accelerating change. It is our organization's view that a multidisciplinary,
<br>
big picture, and long range view is necessary to really answer this
<br>
question, which is the reason for creating our new forum.&quot;
