<p>Thumbs down from me. The basic idea is just Zeno's Arrow: it's not moving
<br>
at any instant in time, so it's never moving. Zeno was trying to prove that
<br>
motion is an illusion. Lynds, conversely, believes motion is real and that
<br>
therefore &quot;there is not a precise static instant in time underlying a 
<br>
dynamical
<br>
physical process&quot;, and also no &quot;precisely determined&quot; instantaneous values
<br>
of physical magnitudes. I find it peculiar that he does not simply propose 
<br>
this
<br>
as the genesis of the uncertainty principle. The argument is that you can't
<br>
simultaneously have an exact position and a velocity; which at least 
<br>
*resembles*
<br>
the uncertainty principle; but instead he says explicitly, they're not the 
<br>
same
<br>
thing. Lynds's uncertainty is something extra.
<br>
<p>In any case, the original argument goes nowhere as far as I'm concerned.
<br>
It's like an argument that there is no such thing as length, because 
<br>
individual
<br>
points have no length, and adding zeroes just gives you zero. Well, in the
<br>
continuum model of space, any line interval of nonzero length is already a
<br>
little continuum; and there are infinitely many smaller continuum-intervals
<br>
within it; but none of that gets in the way of the individual points having
<br>
exact coordinates. An analogous view of continuous time would say that
<br>
change exists in any nonzero interval of time, and an instant of time is 
<br>
just
<br>
the limit in which change is zero because the starting point and the 
<br>
endpoint
<br>
are the same moment. This does imply that &quot;process&quot; or &quot;becoming&quot; is
<br>
something which involves more than one moment of time, but that should
<br>
not surprise anyone.
<br>
<p>Julian Barbour's view, which Eliezer mentioned, is a response to the
<br>
technical &quot;problem of time&quot; in quantum cosmology. In ordinary quantum
<br>
mechanics, Schrodinger's equation takes the form
<br>
<p>H psi (is proportional to) dpsi/dt
<br>
<p>&quot;H&quot; is the Hamiltonian operator, which specifies the dynamics of &quot;psi&quot;,
<br>
the wavefunction. The problem in quantum gravity is that you also know
<br>
that &quot;H psi=0&quot;. This implies that the wavefunction of the universe does not
<br>
evolve in time. Barbour's theory is a many-worlds theory without time;
<br>
he says that the various spatial configurations to which psi assigns a
<br>
probability all exist, without evolving in time, and the perception of time
<br>
is just an illusion. I believe that Kant, having formulated the notion that
<br>
time was an &quot;a priori form of intuition&quot;, had a similar idea - what if each
<br>
of &quot;my experiences&quot; is happening to a separate, static monad, rather
<br>
than to the one &quot;changing&quot; self?
<br>
<p>Personally, I think we do have knowledge of change on a deeper level
<br>
than just the use of memory to confirm that &quot;this moment differs from
<br>
my memory of the previous moment&quot;. If that sort of comparison was the
<br>
only way that we derived a sense of time's passage, then I think the
<br>
Kant/Barbour idea would be &quot;phenomenologically viable&quot;, that is, it would
<br>
be an idea about fundamental reality which is at least consistent with
<br>
perceived reality. But in fact, it seems to me that perceived reality is
<br>
already a process at an unreflective level, and that &quot;moments of experience&quot;
<br>
are an artefact of reflection, and that the idea of trying to prove the
<br>
reality of time by comparing one moment with another is basically doomed,
<br>
precisely because you've already adopted a mode of perception in which
<br>
you are filtering out the dynamic aspect of things.
<br>
<p>Anyway, apart from the philosophy, I may have a more formal problem with
<br>
Barbour's theory. How do you judge the plausibility of a multiverse theory,
<br>
given that by definition you are stuck in just one world? First of all, 
<br>
there
<br>
simply has to be *something* in the postulated multiverse corresponding
<br>
to what you see; your world must be somewhere in the ensemble.
<br>
Second, yours should be an average sort of world, modulo anthropic
<br>
considerations. In Barbour's case, this means arguing that his (deluded)
<br>
observer-moments, with their (fake) memories, should characteristically
<br>
remember a past (which never happened) in which the statistics of events
<br>
conformed to ordinary quantum theory - since this is what we see in our
<br>
world. In making that argument, does Barbour need to use the probabilities
<br>
associated with each world by psi? Because if he does, I think it's fair to
<br>
ask what those probabilities actually mean.
<br>
<p>Suppose someone said, &quot;In my theory of the multiverse, complex systems
<br>
cannot form in most universes.&quot; You might object that this would make
<br>
our world unusual, violating the second principle above. Now suppose
<br>
that the multiverse theorist, instead of arguing anthropically, said, &quot;Yes,
<br>
the complex-systems worlds are greatly outnumbered by the boring
<br>
ones; but the complex-systems worlds are *more probable*, and that
<br>
makes up for it.&quot; This way of talking makes no sense. The probability
<br>
in question cannot be &quot;probability of existing&quot;, since by hypothesis all
<br>
these worlds exist equally. So what does it mean?
<br>
<p>The only way out which I can see is via the concept of a &quot;measure&quot;.
<br>
In calculus, a measure tells you how to sum over continua, by assigning
<br>
a size to each subset. Any set which consists of a countable number
<br>
of points has measure zero and can be ignored (unless there are
<br>
delta-functions involved, but let's not go there). If the wavefunction
<br>
of the universe can be interpreted as a measure - as the thing which
<br>
tells you *how* to count the many worlds - then the &quot;probabilities&quot; are
<br>
legitimate, and describe the actual universal prior for that multiverse.
<br>
Otherwise, the probabilities are just a nonsensical fudge factor added
<br>
to Bayes's formula without justification. (I think this is a familiar
<br>
consideration in many-worlds philosophy, but I've never seen it stated
<br>
this directly.)
