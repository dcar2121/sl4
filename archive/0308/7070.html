<p>
I am in agreement with James Rogers, due to this generalization from 
<br>
personal experience:  When you know what you are doing, there is only ever 
<br>
one thing *to* do, even if there is more than one way to do it; the 
<br>
options you have are not nervously ambiguous; they are not chosen in 
<br>
uncertainty as to the function being fulfilled.  There may be more than 
<br>
one way to build an AI if you do *not* really understand what you are 
<br>
doing; evolution's construction of an evolution-unfriendly humanity comes 
<br>
under this header.  But if you know what you are doing, then on the most 
<br>
important level of description, your work consists of choosing 
<br>
implementations for required goals that have only one obvious correct 
<br>
description.  There are many kinds of functional processes with 
<br>
Bayes-structure; there is only one Bayes' Theorem, there is only one thing 
<br>
that those processes are doing.  That is how you know you are starting to 
<br>
understand something - when your apparent options vanish, merging into 
<br>
alternate implementations of a function that is not alterable.  A high 
<br>
school math student who is following memorized rules of algebra to solve 
<br>
simultaneous equations might imagine that the operations, by being applied 
<br>
in a different order, might yield different answers.  He might take a stab 
<br>
here, take a stab there, manipulate the equation this way and that - look 
<br>
at how many different things there are to do!  Maybe if you find a special 
<br>
order of operations, you can make the answers come out differently?
