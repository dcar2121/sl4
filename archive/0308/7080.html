<em>&gt;Article in Slate, by Jim Holt:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;One morning last April, the New York Times op-ed page ran a piece by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Australian physicist Paul Davies warning readers not to be so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gullible as to believe there could be more than one universe.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect this misrepresents Paul's views. Consider this quote from an
<br>
article in the Australian journal The Bulletin:
<br>
<p><a href="http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/EdDesk.nsf/0/1605b5c0613ca233ca256b8">http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/EdDesk.nsf/0/1605b5c0613ca233ca256b8</a>
<br>

<br>
<p><p>...How then do we reconcile the underlying time
<br>
symmetry of the laws of physics with a universe trapped on a
<br>
one-way journey to cosmic Armageddon? 
<br>
<p>The only way out is to take a critical look at what we mean by
<br>
&quot;universe&quot;. As far out in space as our telescopes probe (about
<br>
10 billion light years), time's arrow points the same way as it
<br>
does on Earth. But what can be said about regions of space
<br>
that lie beyond? If the universe began, say, 13 billion years
<br>
ago, then light from galaxies more than 13 billion light years
<br>
away will not have reached us yet. This distance is not a true
<br>
edge of the universe, just an expanding horizon of visibility
<br>
that limits our cosmic gaze. If galaxies 100 billion light years
<br>
away possessed reversed arrows of time we wouldn't be able
<br>
to detect the fact for another 87 billion years. 
<br>
<p>Cosmologists are slowly coming around to the point of view
<br>
that what we normally term &quot;the universe&quot; might actually be
<br>
only a small part of a much vaster system, often called the
<br>
multiverse. The region of space we can see through our
<br>
telescopes would be just a &quot;Hubble bubble&quot; within an infinite
<br>
system of bubbles – expanding or contracting regions of space
<br>
far beyond our cosmic horizon. A more radical possibility is
<br>
that these other bubbles might be completely disconnected
<br>
from our space, existing in parallel to our space and time. We
<br>
would never be able to detect them by direct means however
<br>
long we wait, although their existence might be inferred
<br>
indirectly. 
<br>
<p>If it were possible to take a god's-eye view of the multiverse,
<br>
there would be no overall arrow of time. Instead, some
<br>
universes would possess an arrow pointing forwards, others
<br>
backwards. The vast majority of universes would have no
<br>
definite arrow of time at all, but languish in a state of
<br>
perpetual disorder. Where a universe did have a strong
<br>
temporal directionality, beings within it would call the ordered
<br>
extremity &quot;the beginning&quot;, but this designation would have no
<br>
absolute significance. 
<br>
<p>Why, then, do we humans find ourselves in one of those rare
<br>
universes with a definite arrow of time? The answer is easily
<br>
found. Only in universes with gravitational smoothness at one
<br>
extremity would stars and planets arise, and offer a
<br>
bio-friendly environment. Only in those universes that, by
<br>
chance, started out in a relatively ordered state would living
<br>
beings emerge to puzzle over the paradox of time's arrow and
<br>
write articles for publications such as The Bulletin.
