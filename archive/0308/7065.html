<em>&gt;Connectionism, in the sense of building everything out of neurologically

</em><br>
fast,
<br>
<em>&gt;digital, serial. .... [snip] Secondly it conflates the levels of

organisation - you
<br>
<em>&gt;don't introduce all information on the lowest level, code, but on various
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different level built on top of code. You don't design things solely on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atomic level.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that neural-networks conflate the levels of organization;
<br>
aren't humans living proof of that? For example, you could set up 3 or more
<br>
separate Recurrent Neural Networks, and their interactions would produce
<br>
very chaotic behavior, churning hither and thither like a Lorenz attractor.
<br>
Concepts (or higher-levels) could be thought of as specific neural-network
<br>
interaction patterns, which, if they were like they are in humans, would
<br>
never produce precisely the same interaction pattern twice (see Freeman,
<br>
2000), the &quot;basins of attraction&quot; in these populations of networks gradually
<br>
changing over time.
<br>
<p>The real problem with neural networks would be that (I think) a Seed AI
<br>
would be nearly impossible. No one programs neural networks like they
<br>
program in C++, they set up the networks and then allow the networks to form
<br>
themselves by repeatedly using some training algorithm. By examining the
<br>
input and output of a neural network, you might get the feeling for what
<br>
it's doing, but how do you precisely change what it's doing? There's no
<br>
documentation, and there's virtually no way of guessing what will happen if
<br>
you change this or that synapse strength, without actually trying it, the
<br>
very idea of neural networks is that many connections may be changed
<br>
randomly without significantly altering the network's overall function. The
<br>
best a Seed AI could do to reprogram itself would be to run training
<br>
algorithms or random mutations on its underlying neural networks; which is
<br>
not the directed-sort of evolution which a Seed AI requires. Neural-networks
<br>
are good for evolution, but not necessarily for directed creation.
<br>
<p>LOGI's recipe calls for non-algorithmic, &quot;fluid&quot; processes at the higher
<br>
levels of concepts and thoughts. The only way I know how to do this would be
<br>
through the statistically emergent behavior of an underlying substrate, such
<br>
as connectionist methods like Neural / Bayesian networks, or interactions of
<br>
populations of agents, a la Hofstadter and Mitchell's Copy Cat (Mitchell,
<br>
1993) or perhaps Minsky's The Society of Mind (Minsky, 1985). Is there
<br>
another method which perhaps I missed, a way to build levels of organization
<br>
beyond mere code?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;CFAI is one of those documents you don't understand even if you read it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;closely. I personally found I had to read it multiple times and I still
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt;think I understand it all.
</em><br>
<p>Definetly! After reading CFAI or LOGI I thought that I understood them. Only
<br>
after reading some of the background books suggested, such as The Adapted
<br>
Mind or Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies, did I realize that I
<br>
previously had a mere superficial knowledge of what Eliezer was getting at.
<br>
In fact, I might still only have a superficial knowledge of what Eliezer was
<br>
getting at, in which case my points above are probably moot. ;-p
