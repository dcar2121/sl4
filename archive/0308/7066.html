</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;different level built on top of code. You don't design things solely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the atomic level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe that neural-networks conflate the levels of organization;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't humans living proof of that? 
</em><br>
<p>Human neural-networks are very different from computer neural-networks - 
<br>
neurons are pretty complex things. But it was not neural networks in general 
<br>
I meant, but our effort to create everything directly out of them. My second 
<br>
problem only refers to that approach - if you try and build things on top of 
<br>
a neural substrate but introduce information at all levels of organisation 
<br>
(however that might be done), then that method doesn't conflate levels of 
<br>
organisation. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, you could set up 3 or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate Recurrent Neural Networks, and their interactions would produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very chaotic behavior, churning hither and thither like a Lorenz attractor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concepts (or higher-levels) could be thought of as specific neural-network
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction patterns, which, if they were like they are in humans, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never produce precisely the same interaction pattern twice (see Freeman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2000), the &quot;basins of attraction&quot; in these populations of networks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually changing over time.
</em><br>
<p>Concepts can be thought of as specific neural-network interaction patterns, or 
<br>
as specific patterns of atoms. These levels are too low, and the description 
<br>
too general, to separate concepts from general chaos. It's not enough that 
<br>
they don't repeat themselves (I'm not sure even that's necessary, don't you 
<br>
want them to act the same in the same context?) but that they have all the 
<br>
various features concepts need (acting like useful learned complexity as LOGI 
<br>
describes). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real problem with neural networks would be that (I think) a Seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be nearly impossible. No one programs neural networks like they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program in C++, they set up the networks and then allow the networks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form themselves by repeatedly using some training algorithm. By examining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the input and output of a neural network, you might get the feeling for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it's doing, but how do you precisely change what it's doing? There's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no documentation, and there's virtually no way of guessing what will happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you change this or that synapse strength, without actually trying it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very idea of neural networks is that many connections may be changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomly without significantly altering the network's overall function. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best a Seed AI could do to reprogram itself would be to run training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms or random mutations on its underlying neural networks; which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the directed-sort of evolution which a Seed AI requires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neural-networks are good for evolution, but not necessarily for directed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation.
</em><br>
<p>Right, this is what I mean by conflating levels of organisation - trying to do 
<br>
everything on the lowest level (code, neural networks, atoms). It's not 
<br>
impossible to have multiple levels of organisation where the bottom level is 
<br>
a neural network, but seems like a pretty difficult substrate to work with. 
<br>
But I have no experience in these neural networks, so I could easily be wrong 
<br>
about the difficulty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; LOGI's recipe calls for non-algorithmic, &quot;fluid&quot; processes at the higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels of concepts and thoughts. The only way I know how to do this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be through the statistically emergent behavior of an underlying substrate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as connectionist methods like Neural / Bayesian networks, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions of populations of agents, a la Hofstadter and Mitchell's Copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cat (Mitchell, 1993) or perhaps Minsky's The Society of Mind (Minsky,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1985). Is there another method which perhaps I missed, a way to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels of organization beyond mere code?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a fluid background of heuristics like Eurisko? I don't understand LOGI 
<br>
enough to answer this question :) I imagine, however, that the answer is 
<br>
&quot;yes&quot;.
