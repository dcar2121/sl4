<p>Perhaps you're just confused on the terminology, but just in case not:
<br>
<p>Friendliness and morality are not the same thing.  Friendliness is a 
<br>
system of metamorality.  A Friendly AI will find an `objective' 
<br>
morality.  At least, that's the theory.  Friendliness doesn't even 
<br>
necessarily explicitly care about humans; they are cared about if it 
<br>
turns out to be moral to care about them.  I think most of us would 
<br>
agree that it's moral to preserve our own human lives (an aspect of 
<br>
panhuman morality), so I wouldn't be surprised if that was a special 
<br>
case of the morality of a Friendly AI.  Maybe it will be moral to 
<br>
preserve the lives of cows, I don't know what cows want.
<br>
<p>I guess the short of it is that Friendliness != morality, which you 
<br>
seem to be confusing here.
