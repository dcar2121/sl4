<p>JR&gt; Almost everyone who responded to my assertion did not grok it.  That may

JR&gt; have been a communication failure on my part or simply that I assumed the
<br>
JR&gt; audience had sufficient contextual background to figure it out.  Mixed with
<br>
JR&gt; a bit of apparent reading non-comprehension.  I've been meaning to get back
<br>
JR&gt; to this but stepping through it from the primitives will be painfully
<br>
JR&gt; lengthy so time is an issue.  The reasoning behind my assertion is actually
<br>
JR&gt; fairly elegant in a formal sense and you can prove it with the clever
<br>
JR&gt; application of things we've already discussed on this list; I thought
<br>
JR&gt; someone might put the pieces together.
<br>
<p>James, could you give a yea/nay possibly with brief clarification to
<br>
the following (which did occur to me when you first made your
<br>
statements) as an approximation of your meaning/reasoning: 
<br>
<p>General Intelligence can be measured against e.g. AIXI, i.e.
<br>
degree of compression is the relevant factor here.  Given finite
<br>
resources, there will be algorithms that approach &quot;ideal
<br>
compressibility&quot; (i.e. that degree achieved given infinite
<br>
resources i.e. AIXI) more or less closely; it follows from these
<br>
premises that there will be a best algorithm for this.
<br>
<p>[Side note: from earlier hints, would this involve a network of
<br>
mutually-determining/converging Bayesian equations?]
<br>
<p>[Also note that I do not necessarily agree with the statement-I'm-
<br>
interpreting-you-to-be-making above.  Perhaps in a *very* general
<br>
sense of General Intelligence I would...]
