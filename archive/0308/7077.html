<em>&gt; Isn't this another way of reiterating your fundamental assumption without

<p><p>Almost everyone who responded to my assertion did not grok it.  That may
<br>
have been a communication failure on my part or simply that I assumed the
<br>
audience had sufficient contextual background to figure it out.  Mixed with
<br>
a bit of apparent reading non-comprehension.  I've been meaning to get back
<br>
to this but stepping through it from the primitives will be painfully
<br>
lengthy so time is an issue.  The reasoning behind my assertion is actually
<br>
fairly elegant in a formal sense and you can prove it with the clever
<br>
application of things we've already discussed on this list; I thought
<br>
someone might put the pieces together.
<br>
<p>So not tonight, as I have more important things pressing at the moment.  I'm
<br>
analyzing the output of a very clever piece of software as it analyzes
<br>
Plasmodium genomes this evening.  Speaking of which (and admittedly
<br>
off-topic), I developed a lovely new algorithm for doing local alignments of
<br>
sequences that appears to blow the pants off of the standard Smith-Waterman
<br>
family of algorithms both in terms of time AND space by adapting some of the
<br>
core algorithms I developed for the AI work.  The applicability of this
<br>
stuff seems endless even without AI per se.
<br>
<p>Like the Novamente people, we are finding a rather immediate opportunity for
<br>
these technologies in biotech.  I'm *finally* spending a huge chunk of my
<br>
time on this, which has been helpful in hitting milestones at a brisk pace.
<br>
<p><p>Off to work I go,
