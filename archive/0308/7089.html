<p>
We have very beautiful term - an artificial intellect.
<br>
Whether but let's understand such it beautiful actually.
<br>
Let's compare it to other terms.
<br>
Let's take for example the term - a table.
<br>
This very simple term. All of us well know, that it means.
<br>
There are very many things connected with it and
<br>
also well-known. They specify its essence.
<br>
Our term - an artificial intellect - not such.
<br>
Let's take other term - weather.
<br>
With it slightly heavier. It not so concrete.
<br>
But all the same well certain.
<br>
Everyone may feel that it means.
<br>
Let's take the following term - black hole.
<br>
It not so known. Nobody may feel,
<br>
to imagine it to itself. But all the same it designates
<br>
something concrete. Still possible to touch
<br>
it as abstraction at least.
<br>
Our term - an artificial intellect - again not such.
<br>
What term has properties similar to ours.
<br>
Seems the best candidate the term - the God 
<br>
( or the Supreme Mind - whom as is pleasant).
<br>
Nobody may specify him as on something concrete.
<br>
As on a table for example.
<br>
Nobody may outline his borders as process.
<br>
As it can be made with weather.
<br>
Nobody may To describe him with help of abstraction.
<br>
As it can be made with black hole.
<br>
Once for research of the term - the God
<br>
arisen whole science - theology.
<br>
Now for research of the term - an artificial intellect
<br>
also arisen whole science, even two.
<br>
These two sciences investigate that of that are not present.
<br>
Just right that that is not present, instead of that that impossible.
<br>
( Knowledge of impossible - really divine knowledge)
<br>
And now solve such riddle.
<br>
If from the person to take away all that that is displays
<br>
to intelligence: language, abstract thinking
<br>
there will be rather advanced animal.
<br>
But that remain when we shall take away from
<br>
persons an advanced animal.
