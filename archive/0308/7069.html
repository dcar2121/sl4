<p>
James/Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll explicitly state the caveat that my hypothesis is strictly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI, not for specialized sub-fields of AI -- it seems obvious to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it wouldn't apply in the case of specialized AI.  It is less that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have proof of my hypothesis than I've never seen evidence to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary. Most of the &quot;contrary&quot; examples I can think of were either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shallow analysis or do not really address the underlying issue. 
</em><br>
<p>Why does your one-best-ideal-system model only apply to AGI but not 
<br>
to specific applications of AI?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the more complex the system under consideration 
<br>
the more likely the fitness landscape for optimisation solutions will be 
<br>
highly uneven (as Ben has described it) leading to more than one 
<br>
sensible approach.  I would have thought that as a consequence AGI 
<br>
(as opposed to situation-specific AI) would therefore have been a 
<br>
stronger candidate for multiple solutions - given that the GI task is more 
<br>
complex than any/most specific applied intelligence task(s).
<br>
<p>One major experiment in multiple optimisation solutions in complex 
<br>
general intelligence systems was played out at the level of the *use* of 
<br>
an GI system rather than at the level of the creation of the GI 
<br>
architecture over the last 50,000 years in New Guinea.  The geography 
<br>
of New Guinea is highly broken up due to recently formed mountain 
<br>
ranges and the food naturally available from the jungle is remarkably 
<br>
limited - so in large parts of New Guinea villages are very isolated.  
<br>
Over the last 50,000 years something like (if my memory serves me 
<br>
correctly) about a 1/3 of the world languages evolved in this one large 
<br>
island - and the languages are not just variation on each other - they 
<br>
are as varied within the island in their fundamental linguistic 
<br>
characterisitics as human languages are varied across the entire globe.  
<br>
Also the cultural characteristics of the different communities vary 
<br>
massively - despite thefact that until a few hundred years ago (or less 
<br>
in many places) the technologies used by the people were all variations 
<br>
on stone age agricuture augmented by hunter-gatherer strategies.
<br>
<p>One interpreation of this data is that, faced with what looks like much 
<br>
the same challenge of human survival, vast numbers of solution have 
<br>
evolved - because the villages were isolated enough to allow many 
<br>
opportunities for experimentation.
<br>
<p>The explanation of the much greater linguisitc and cultural 
<br>
homogeneity of the rest of the world is most likely the invasion of other 
<br>
cultures by those with current military (and commercial) power.  Jared 
<br>
Diamond's thesis in his book Guns, Germs and Steel suggests that the 
<br>
global pattern of military (and commercial) dominance that we have 
<br>
seen in the last 13,000 years, most particularly since the emergence of 
<br>
agriculture, has owned a great deal more to geograpgical and 
<br>
ecological differences between the different parts of the world than it 
<br>
has done to the specific cultural traits of the inhabitants of specific 
<br>
areas.  So the homegenisation found in most parts of the world is not a 
<br>
counter argument to the multimodal optimisation found in New Guinea - 
<br>
ie. the dominance of a few cultures is not proof that there really is only 
<br>
one ideal - it is more an example of first mover adavantage - those 
<br>
cultures that dominated first got the chance to stamp their culture and 
<br>
language on other by force of power rather via some kind of objective 
<br>
test of long term optimality.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this story alone give me reason to believe that Ben's basic 
<br>
hypothesis is right.  Also the history of technology is replete with other 
<br>
examples.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
