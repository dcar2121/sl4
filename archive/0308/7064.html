Hi Nick,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Humans weren't designed to be altruistic, rational, or good. They were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to be selfish (in the sense of increasing *their* inclusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fitness) in a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, it's largely by accident that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can be altruistic at all (except in the limited sense of reciprocal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruism - selfish trade). 
</em><br>
<p>My understanding of things (based on my own observations of humans 
<br>
and other people's views including those of primatologist Frans De 
<br>
Waal) is that, while altruism emerged as a pramatic response to human 
<br>
survival in a social species, once the capacity is there 'altruism' is/can 
<br>
be more than just a clever form of selfishness - it can be real.
<br>
<p>I think the nastiness in human history can be explained, not by denying 
<br>
our capacity for (genuine) altruism, but by recognising that humans and 
<br>
(all [?] other biological life) operate in a 'them' / 'us' mode. Each one of 
<br>
us has our in-group and our out-group.  With the in-group we can be 
<br>
genuinely altuisitic (at times), with the out-group we can be 
<br>
breathtakingly horrid (at times).
<br>
<p>I think a real challenge for AGI development (perhaps even the central 
<br>
challenge?) - especially for the &quot;friendly&quot; sort of AGI - is to not end up 
<br>
creating mentalities that see any life (anything??? do we have to go 
<br>
that far??) as being part of an out-group towards which friendliness 
<br>
need not be applied.
<br>
<p>Once you see 'everything' as deserving friendliness consideration, and 
<br>
especially if the new AGI admits of the possility of future innovation, a 
<br>
further key issue is how do you develop ethics to guide the assured 
<br>
continuity of desirable features of the present into the future while also 
<br>
changing some of the features of the present (ie. how do we integrate 
<br>
sustainability and genuine progress?).
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
