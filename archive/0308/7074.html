Well, consider a related question: Is there a single, clearly optimal human
<br>
brain/mind, given a fixed number of neurons, a fixed fund of
<br>
neurotransmitters, and a moderately specific set of &quot;goals for human life&quot;?
<br>
<p>I doubt it.  I reckon that given any reasonably subtle set of goals for
<br>
human life, there are a lot of qualitatively different brain/mind structures
<br>
that are near-optimal, rather than one that is clearly superior to all
<br>
others except its near neighbors.
<br>
<p>Anecdotal evidence for this lies in looking at sets like &quot;the set of great
<br>
theoretical physicists&quot; or &quot;the set of great programmers.&quot;  The set of great
<br>
theoretical physicists does not cluster around one archetypal &quot;ideal
<br>
theoretical physicist&quot;, rather it contains a heterogeneous bunch of
<br>
qualitatively rather different brain/minds.  It looks to me like the fitness
<br>
landscape of &quot;greatness at theoretical physics&quot; is strongly multimodal,
<br>
rather than unimodal-after-smoothing.
<br>
<p>I'm guessing that &quot;intelligence given a fixed fund of computational
<br>
resources&quot; is even more strongly multimodal than &quot;greatness at theoretical
<br>
physics given a human brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>But as Rafal pointed out in his post --- for sure, all we can do is
<br>
speculate... none of us has anywhere near the knowledge needed to make a
<br>
definitive statement on this issue.

<em>&gt; Subject: One road or many to AI? (was: brainstorm)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am in agreement with James Rogers, due to this generalization from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal experience:  When you know what you are doing, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one thing *to* do, even if there is more than one way to do it; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options you have are not nervously ambiguous; they are not chosen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty as to the function being fulfilled.  There may be more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one way to build an AI if you do *not* really understand what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing; evolution's construction of an evolution-unfriendly humanity comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under this header.  But if you know what you are doing, then on the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important level of description, your work consists of choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementations for required goals that have only one obvious correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description.  There are many kinds of functional processes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayes-structure; there is only one Bayes' Theorem, there is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that those processes are doing.  That is how you know you are starting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand something - when your apparent options vanish, merging into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate implementations of a function that is not alterable.  A high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school math student who is following memorized rules of algebra to solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneous equations might imagine that the operations, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a different order, might yield different answers.  He might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take a stab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, take a stab there, manipulate the equation this way and that - look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at how many different things there are to do!  Maybe if you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of operations, you can make the answers come out differently?
