Dear Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am in agreement with James Rogers, due to this generalization from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal experience:  When you know what you are doing, there is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever one thing *to* do, even if there is more than one way to do it;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the options you have are not nervously ambiguous; they are not chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in uncertainty as to the function being fulfilled. 
</em><br>
<p>Hell, I wish I lived in a world so simple that it was clear that there was 
<br>
only one thing to be done to solve the problem I was looking at.
<br>
<p>By the way I understand fully what you mean when you said: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if you know what you are doing, then on the most important level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of description, your work consists of choosing implementations for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required goals that have only one obvious correct description. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ......That is how you know you are starting to understand something -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when your apparent options vanish, merging into alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementations of a function that is not alterable. 
</em><br>
<p>In my own creative work I experience the same process - often.  And 
<br>
it's a real buzz when it happens.
<br>
<p>But what I also experience is what happens when you widen the dataset 
<br>
that frames your original problem.  Then often the exciting perfect 
<br>
solution evaporates or has to morph significantly to take account of the 
<br>
new/varied understanding of the problem - and this instability is 
<br>
accentuated by the fact that there are often many way to do the thing 
<br>
you have chosen to do - as you said in your own message.
<br>
<p>It's this capacity for multiple understandings of the problem as much as 
<br>
the possibility that there is an uneven fitness landscape for the 
<br>
optimisation of solutions for any given problem definition that makes it 
<br>
highly likely that there will not be just one road to AGI.
<br>
<p>I'll reiterate 'Sutton's law' - that the more complex the system the less 
<br>
likely it will be that there is one ideal solution.  And in AGI we are in the 
<br>
process of creating the next quantum leap in the complexity of the 
<br>
universe (assuming that AGIs have't been invented before (several 
<br>
billion times!).
<br>
<p>But anyway, I think the whole debate is back to front.  Even if it were 
<br>
true that there was only one idea way to do anything (harking back to 
<br>
Plato's ideals) - how do we know when we are looking the ideal solution 
<br>
in the face when we are on this side of the future?  We can only make 
<br>
an effective stab at making the judgement about fitness of any solution 
<br>
from some time in the future.  For all the current AGI projects - does it 
<br>
help anyone to have an idea that there is one perfect solution if we 
<br>
don't know what it is?
<br>
<p>Groupthink in the present is no guide.  And if there are genuinely held 
<br>
and well informed differences of opinion now then the issue about 
<br>
which is best must remain open.  The future might tell us which was 
<br>
best or it might not.  When there are uneven fitness landscape for the 
<br>
optimisation of solutions it is very common for the solution to be chosen 
<br>
to be the one that fits a local optimum that is the easiest to get to rather 
<br>
than a better optimum that is harder to reach.  The attainable second 
<br>
best often locks out the hard to attain first best.  The history of 
<br>
technology shows this over and over, in fact the history of any area of 
<br>
interest shows this.  This is the nature of the evolution of complex 
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
