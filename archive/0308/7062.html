</em><br>
<p>Right, the FAI does have to deal with morality but the morality it develops is 
<br>
not sensitive to what the programmers think - this removes Friendliness from 
<br>
the realms of human politics and into that of engineering. It has to evaluate 
<br>
things itself, especially through the transition to superintelligence. 
<br>
Friendly AI is the art of giving an AI the ability to think morally like us. 
<br>
<p>So it does indirectly determine morality - a Friendly AI will have a humane 
<br>
morality (the class of humane moralities is grounded in the kind of 
<br>
moralities humans would choose to have if they had the intelligence, wisdom, 
<br>
and ability to do properly choose). But it doesn't determine morality in the 
<br>
way humans disagree on eg. select moral status of abortion and suicide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Come to think of it, that seems to be a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI -- as a tool to solve cognitive problems, but no more than that.
</em><br>
<p>All problems are moral issues, things are done as means to an end. One can 
<br>
either represent this explictly in the AI, so it knows the reason why you're 
<br>
asking it to, say, determine the logical status of the Riemann Hypothesis, or 
<br>
not. The former is a mind, the latter a tool. 
<br>
<p>A tool can only be as moral as it's wielder, and often less so as it doesn't 
<br>
know what you *really* mean and so it often doesn't do what you intended it 
<br>
to. You only transfer the tail end of your justification so it can't correct 
<br>
many of your mistakes. For instance, a car is a tool. You transfer the tail 
<br>
end of the subgoal &quot;get to X without crashing&quot; which includes &quot;drive 
<br>
forwards&quot;. Introduce wall, car drives forwards into wall as ordered, you die.
<br>
This is the behaviour of a tool - it cannot correct most mistakes on the hands 
<br>
of it's user. As another example, a gun is a tool. In the hands of a murderer 
<br>
it kills. This is the behaviour of a tool - it does what it's told, it's only 
<br>
as moral as its user. An AI that solely solves cognitive problems is a tool.
<br>
<p>A mind can be more or less moral than it's creator, there is no upper bound. 
<br>
This is an additional risk in the hands of those who don't know what they're 
<br>
doing, a benefit in the hands of those that do. Friendly AI describes the 
<br>
structure and content needed for an AI to surpass the morality of present day 
<br>
humanity, especially as it gains transhuman intelligence. We don't want the 
<br>
AI tied to our mistakes, especially the ones we can't see yet (it was only a 
<br>
few hundred years ago that slavery was seen as moral - what moral 
<br>
imprefections still remain?). Solutions to problems we don't even know exist.
