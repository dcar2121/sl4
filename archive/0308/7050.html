<p>The entire universe?  Naw.  Many AGI projects is a great idea precisely 
<br>
because we don't know which path is the most fruitful with least danger at 
<br>
this time.  If humanity is facing almost certain disaster without an AGI and 
<br>
only with the right kind of AGI is the likelihood of survival/thriving high, 
<br>
then even risky possible paths are reasonble in light of the certain of doom 
<br>
without AGI.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Each AGI project is a chance for failure.  Even if you manage to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a project that has a chance of creating the Singularity, it has a good
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are doomed without AGI.  Ergo, any AGI with a good chance of not destroying 
<br>
us is better than our default condition.   It would be a stupid AI that would 
<br>
literally wipe out &quot;everything&quot; which would belie it being smart enough to 
<br>
grab and retain control of &quot;everything&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should try to limit our points of failure, not increase them.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer AGI projects, in my opinion, the better, because we will be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to focus more resources on it (intelligent people, money, etc.) rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than spreading the resources thin to create a lot of half-ass projects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have a greater chance of existential disaster than one well backed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Limiting points of failure as you would have it is actually limiting points of 
<br>
success or even survival (of the 21st century in my estimation).   If we 
<br>
don't know how to do AGI then having one mega-effort is likely to result in 
<br>
being bogged down in endless conflicting architectures, theory, and of course 
<br>
normal big project monkey-shines.   Again, given AGI of a friendly variety is 
<br>
our own real hope, we must not put all our eggs in one controversy and 
<br>
politics wrought basket.
