<p>I've tried pondering this issue before (it would help if I actually knew a great 
<br>
deal about biology, etc., but I don't), and I come to the conclusion that it 
<br>
must be inaccurate to try and relate computer bits to base pair data. The reason 
<br>
is because I think you have to take into account the tremendous amount of &quot;data 
<br>
compression&quot; involved in the base pair information.
<br>
<p>Let's take for example what happens when you run a typical piece of computer 
<br>
software on a PC vs. what happens when you &quot;run&quot; some DNA/RNA in a live cell. In 
<br>
the PC, the bits on the hard drive (DNA) aren't usually even compressed, and are 
<br>
simply loaded into RAM (transfer via RNA) and run (via ribosomes etc.) 
<br>
sequentially or via simple jumps. Unless the program that runs is compressed 
<br>
down beforehand into extremely crazily reduced forms (such as perhaps in a 
<br>
assembly language coder contest by some insanely good hacker), what it produces 
<br>
when run isn't a great deal more complex than what was sitting on the hard drive.
<br>
<p>By contrast, the whole cellular system has evolved to take extreme advantage of 
<br>
the real, physical, 3D environment inside the cell, and what the DNA data 
<br>
translates into when run is an extremely complex protein that goes on to perform 
<br>
yet more complex behaviors. So it seems the DNA data, when run on the 
<br>
appropriate hardware, represents in extraordinarily compressed form something 
<br>
very complex. Or maybe a better way to say it is that it might make more sense 
<br>
to try and measure the _uncompressed_ data amount generated by DNA + its running 
<br>
environment vs. the uncompressed running computer code.
<br>
<p>This seems obvious when you compared 700MB of DNA and what it can produce when 
<br>
run over time, vs. 700MB of Windows XP OS code. Now, would it be possible to 
<br>
create some sort of unique computing environment that would allow you then run a 
<br>
relatively short computer program that would over time lead to something very 
<br>
complex? I think so. But again, to really compare things you should try and 
<br>
compare apples vs. apples and &quot;uncompressed&quot; systems against each other.
<br>
<p>At least, that's my take for now...
