<em>&gt;Nanotech is not necessary for awakening.  Existing nanotech is also not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary for expanding computational resources, but will make a huge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impact on how things turn out a few &quot;steps&quot; of change beyond awakening.
</em><br>
<p>Who knows, maybe nanotech IS necessary for awakening.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;(Takeoff hardness) = derivative of {(initial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficiency)x(goals)+(additional resources)}^(computational resouces).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That formula is probably very wrong - my math sucketh -  but hopefully you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get my drift.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;4) AI goals (how much it wants to improve)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The only concievable case in which an AI's goals would limit its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;self-improvement would be some programmer enforced boxing, which is a bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;idea in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How it goes about self-improvement is a limiting factor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Converting all nearby matter to computronium-of-the-moment is the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rapid way to self-improve in the short term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sitting back (self improving, without assimilating more resources), gives 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an expantive AI time to think about which resources it needs to assimilate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now, which resources should be left till later, and which &quot;resources&quot; have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merit in existing untouched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Self-improvement is good for any goal in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, but aquiring resources for improvement, although fast, is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily the best.
</em><br>
<p>I see your point here, although I imagine if the rate of thought is 
<br>
super-human, then it probably takes much longer to assimilate the resources 
<br>
than it does to establish how to go about assimilating resources. Meaning, 
<br>
it would probably have time to think about optimizing it's actions while 
<br>
those actions are in their processes of occuring. I imagine it would be 
<br>
enough &quot;ahead of the game&quot; to be in a constant push for more resources.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In summary, if you have an intelligent system, hard take-off is both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;desirable and probable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I refute that.  Firstly, you haven't said &quot;Friendly&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Because Friendliness is not necessary to say here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Secondly, &quot;hard take-off&quot; encapsulates a number of scenarios that, even if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the AI is friendly to sentients, are otherwise undesireable.
</em><br>
<p>I meant desirable from the intelligent entity's POV.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;where the necessary and sufficient factor is computational resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;See above.
</em><br>
<p>I think your function can be simplified a little bit. You might as well 
<br>
abstract the &quot;goals&quot; from the equation entirely. Essentially, when you 
<br>
&quot;take-off&quot;, you are taking off in a direction. The direction is what your 
<br>
&quot;goals&quot; are defining. What you are &quot;moving&quot; in that given direction is.. the 
<br>
Universe. In order to be considered an intelligent entity, you must have the 
<br>
means to interact with the Universe in such a manner as to potentially 
<br>
increase the complexity with which you are capable of interacting with the 
<br>
Universe. So that part is given. The only remaining variable is cognitive 
<br>
capacity- which is the interface between your goal, that is, your 
<br>
directional faculty, and your means of activity: the means with which the 
<br>
Universe is steered.
<br>
<p>Given a certain depth of cognitive analysis for Universe steering, I imagine 
<br>
the most desirable point at which you would steer the Universe, is the point 
<br>
at which you have the most amount more depth of cognitive analysis for 
<br>
steering the Universe. Obviously this isn't a direct rule, because as an 
<br>
ultimate end it would be rather pointless, but intuitively it seems to be 
<br>
one of the most influential of rules that a seed AI would follow, as the 
<br>
guiding point to its supergoal.
<br>
<p>I could be wrong, but I'm not.
