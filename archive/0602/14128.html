Rick,
<br>
<p>As an inventor of an &quot;android robot brain&quot; also to be revealed in 2006, I
<br>
face the same issues as you. From reading your website and your posts here,
<br>
I see that we share the same basic philosophy. From your writings I believe
<br>
your AI system will not be built purposely as hostile, but friendly. As you
<br>
have said we corporations are driven by the profit motive, and that means
<br>
Customer Satisfaction, and not building defective, unsafe products that
<br>
injure the customer or community. Thus I believe you are not purposely
<br>
building an unsafe, unfriendly AI system, and want nothing to do with that.
<br>
So I wish you the best of luck in commercializing your AI PIBOT.
<br>
There is plenty of room in the strong AI/conscious machines industry for
<br>
all of us, and the benefits that we all will enjoy in this future
<br>
technological paradise mst be brought about for us and our children. So I
<br>
am looking forward to your historic presentation in November of  2006 in
<br>
Toulouse (France), and in fact I am glad it is you who might have all or
<br>
part of the AI marvel. And who can argue with where your system and efforts
<br>
will be employed, as stated in your mission statement:
<br>
<p>&quot;Rick Geniale Enterprises Corp. will devote the greater part of its efforts
<br>
and resources to implement an AGI in all the fields related to medicine and
<br>
healthcare.&quot; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the reasons given above, I believe the people of earth can safely
</em><br>
support your efforts to build such a &quot;safe-built&quot; singularity machine/seed.
<br>
Now all you have to do is wow us at your Presentation. haha lol.
<br>
<p>Good luck Rick; I will be buying your book and supporting you (because I
<br>
believe you firmly and purposely support  the &quot;safe-built&quot; standard of the
<br>
industry),
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; turin,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are just thinking that all of us are victims of a big mistake and of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a big misunderstanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We believe that this mistake has been caused by too much fake speeches 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and scenarios that have been appeared on SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably, these fake speeches are due to envy and jealousy regarding our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work (that nobody knows in detail).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, AGI is a field with undefined edges and contours, so it's very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to talk nonsense about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet worst, the lack of a deep cognition about AGI's building problems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the lack of standard of knowledge in this field, lead people to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most erroneous conclusions about everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, if we are not talking about the cognitive architecture of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI, but we are merely talking about it's behavior, it's obvious that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any AGI must essentially be: 1) useful to mankind; 2) useful to mantain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or improve 21st century lifestyles and values. Nobody, in the Occidental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World, can have doubts about that (and we are a profitable company in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Occidental World).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding friendship, we think that friendship is a relation that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established between two or more people or entities that share a set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental values about mankind and its society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is a relation that is entirely based on trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is loyalty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is association.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship involves the exchange of ideas, thoughts, knowledge and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is solidarity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is not subjection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other than friendship are courtesy, kindness, complaisance, compliancy, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deference, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship is something that happens in human interactions: but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nexus between friendship and AGI could be a nonsense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, before that we can make any kind of scenario (beautiful or bad) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any direction we (humans), first of all, must be able to pass the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing Test (NOW, WITHOUT PASSING THIS TEST, any discussion regarding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any possible scenario remain a NONSENSE!!!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the case in which PIBOT will pass the Touring Test, we WILL MERIT A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MONUMENT for a very important scientific invention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, nobody should be worried about the work RGE Corp.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our best wishes.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;This is the problem with friendly SI. I am afraid that if we do not
</em><br>
allow
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;them to understand first hand subjective experience, we could produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;psychopaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was being hyperbolic here, let me qualify this statement. I don't
</em><br>
think am autnomous friendly SI which does not understand first person
<br>
subjective experience would magically become a psychopath. But I am worried
<br>
that -any- autonomous friendly SI that does not understand first person
<br>
subjective experience will be impoverished in its decision making as that
<br>
decision making relates to human whose existence is for the most part
<br>
centered around our own subjective experiences.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The architecture need not produce a psychopath, that is merely an
</em><br>
extreme example, we could make sociopaths, obsessive compulsive, manic
<br>
depressive SIs. I am not talking about their cognitive architecture here; I
<br>
am talking about their behavior, the way they socially interact with
<br>
humans. I do not expect their cognitive architecture to resemble ours in
<br>
the slightest. I think our cognitive architecture has gotten us into a lot
<br>
of trouble. I am speaking here in part metaphorically, but also
<br>
behaviorally.  
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I would like for the SI when it tells someone, Hello, to understand what
</em><br>
saying hello means to me, whether when it says Hello it means the same
<br>
thing as I do or not.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This to me seems to be require giving the SI an understanding of human
</em><br>
subjectivity, and does not require the SI to possess subjective states
<br>
itself, but I wonder if there is an advantage to subjectivity itself or if
<br>
an SI can really make good decisions without its own subjectivity.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Then the question of general SI subjectivity comes into play. This is
</em><br>
something that is difficult to quantify, and so we end with armchair
<br>
philosophy. We talk often about feasibility, survival, etc, but I am
<br>
interested in what an autonomous SI would want to do aesthetically,
<br>
philosopically, scientifically, if it possessed its own subjectivity. There
<br>
is in an effort to maximize our own survival or efficiency, there a danger
<br>
of course of losing subjectivity itself, which is something we as humans
<br>
value, and I personally would like some of the SI to be autonomous and
<br>
possess subjectivity because otherwise it seems the future would be
<br>
impoverished without them.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;How to do this safely? I don't know. As I said, I don't think happiness
</em><br>
is of much value or human subjectivity in and of itself, and I am curious
<br>
as to what shape SI subjectivity would take and if any subjectivity can be
<br>
considered &quot;friendly&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In truth, I would rather we build autonomous and &quot;awake&quot; SI with
</em><br>
subjectivity that were pscyhotic and tyrannical in the old scifi horror
<br>
movie sense and wipe out our species than merely building braindead SI  
<br>
completely under our control which would be used as powerful slaves to
<br>
maintain 21st century lifestyles and values until the end of the universe. 
<br>
Neither scenario is very likely, I am merely trying to illustrate the point
<br>
that you have ot risk survival to be creative.  1 in 10 Nasa astronauts
<br>
have died, granted Nasa often makes major errors in safety due to red tape,
<br>
etc, but to be explorers one has to face a certain amount of risk.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't think there is such a thing as a clean Singularity. It would be
</em><br>
nice if it turned out to be all peaches and cream the way Kurzweil hopes, I
<br>
like the idea of being a femtotech ghost, -but- for creativity within the
<br>
Singularity or to bring about any sort of Singularity, like giving SI
<br>
subjectivity.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I would like to do so patiently, soberly, and in a promethian fashion,
</em><br>
but shit happens...... this whole problem of friendly AI troubles me.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I am coming from a different background than most of the poeple on this
</em><br>
list, but Socrates asks this, &quot;who is the friend?&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Is the friend the slave, the person who does everything you say, then we
</em><br>
just make brain dead SI, like a hammer. Or does the friend present
<br>
opposition, and if so, what is acceptable opposition?  When we speak of
<br>
friends we are speaking of other people, if we do not consider SI people or
<br>
do not think that the concept of the person is important in relationship to
<br>
SI, we shouldn't use the word friendly at all in reference to SI.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The idea of the friend and subjectivity  has implications beyond SI as
</em><br>
it relates to the human institution of slavery as well as animal labour,I
<br>
am just trying to start a discussion about the &quot;inner life&quot; of machines.
