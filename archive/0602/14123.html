<em>&gt;Eliezer has posted a job notice at the SIAI website,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking for research partners to tackle the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of rigorously ensuring AI goal stability under
</em><br>
self-&gt;enhancement transformations. 
<br>
<em>&gt;I would like to see this problem (or perhaps a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refined one) stated in the rigorous terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theoretical computer science; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd like to see this list try to generate such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formulation.
</em><br>
<p>Fascinating, fascinating.  
<br>
<p>I thought as a final post I'd better try to say
<br>
something actually intelligable, so I shall take one
<br>
crack at actually pointing to a solution :D
<br>
<p>O.K... 
<br>
<p>Is there such a thing as 
<br>
'a probability of a probability' ?  
<br>
<p>See a new paper by Robin Hanson arguing for a new
<br>
Bayesian framework wherein probabilities can be
<br>
assigned to priors:
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf</a>
<br>
<p><p>Also see blog entry by Ben Goertzel:
<br>
<p>*The management of uncertainty in the human brain: new
<br>
experimental insights*
<br>
<p>&quot;In other words, some of us maverick AI theorists have
<br>
been saying for a while that using just ONE number
<br>
(typically probability) to measure uncertainty is not
<br>
enough. Two numbers -- e.g. a probability and another
<br>
number measuring the &quot;weight of evidence&quot; in favor of
<br>
this probability (or to put it differently, the
<br>
&quot;confidence&quot; one has in the probability) -- are needed
<br>
to make a cognitively meaningful algebra of
<br>
uncertainty.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
<p><p>I assume Bayesian probability theory could be
<br>
reformulated in terms of some kind of fuzzy set
<br>
theory.  Then the notion of 'a probability of a
<br>
probability' would be referring to fuzzy sets
<br>
containing other fuzzy sets.  The problem of sets
<br>
containing other sets has never been fully solved. 
<br>
According to Roger Penrose:
<br>
<p>'In fact, the way that mathematicians have come to
<br>
terms with this apparently paradoxical situation is to
<br>
imagine that some kind of distinction has been made
<br>
between 'sets' and 'classes'...Roughly speaking, any
<br>
collection of sets whatever could be allowed to be
<br>
considered as a whole, and such a collection would be
<br>
called a *class*.  Some classes are respectable enough
<br>
to be considered as sets themselves, but other classes
<br>
would be considered to be 'too big' or 'too untidy' to
<br>
be counted as sets.  We are not neccessarily allowed
<br>
to collect *classes* together, on the other hand, to
<br>
form larger entities.  Thus 'the set of all sets' is
<br>
not allowed...but the 'class of all sets' is
<br>
considered to be legitimate...
<br>
<p>There is something unsatisfactory about all
<br>
this...This procedure might be reasponable if there
<br>
were a clear-cut criterion telling us when a class
<br>
actually qualifies as being a set.  However the
<br>
'distinction' appears often to be made in a very
<br>
circular way.&quot;
<br>
<p>-Roger Penrose. 'The Road To Reality' , Page 373
<br>
(Hard-back version)
<br>
<p>Paper on possible extensions to set theory:
<br>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/dmytro/www/NewSetTheory.htm">http://web.mit.edu/dmytro/www/NewSetTheory.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Abstract: We discuss the problems of incompleteness
<br>
and inexpressibility. We introduce almost
<br>
self-referential formulas, use them to extend set
<br>
theory, and relate their expressive power to that of
<br>
infinitary logic. We discuss the nature of proper
<br>
classes. Finally, we introduce and axiomatize a
<br>
powerful extension to set theory.&quot;
<br>
<p>O.K, so... did I solve it?  Are any of these ideas of
<br>
relevence?
