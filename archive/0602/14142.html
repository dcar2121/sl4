Hi Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're going to charge straight ahead and develop an unsafe system in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hopes you can bolt on a module that makes it safe, I've got to ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, just how exactly does this module work?
</em><br>
<p>This is a very fair and good question, and unfortunately I am not
<br>
going to answer it right now.  The answer is a somewhat complex one,
<br>
involving ideas that have been worked out at varying levels of detail,
<br>
and I am now facing a big backlog in terms of writing down and working
<br>
out details of my AGI-related ideas.  I will get to writing this
<br>
aspect up in detail, but probably not till early 2007.
<br>
<p>I can see you might argue that it makes sense to write this aspect up
<br>
BEFORE the others, but, in terms of the particular approaches I'm
<br>
taking, the reverse approach is actually more sensible....
<br>
<p>I will note, however, that there are many cases in computer science
<br>
where VERIFYING a solution to a problem is a lot computationally
<br>
simpler than FINDING the solution, and is addressable by entirely
<br>
different algorithms...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What kind of module are you visualizing that's simpler than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full FAI and can check the output of an evolutionary programmer, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does this trick require constraints built into the EP module?
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure if they require constraints or not.
<br>
<p>If a constraint were required, it would simply be that the EP module
<br>
log all its intermediary results ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the safety of the whole project depends on this verifier being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical, and otherwise it ends up being literally worse than nothing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe you ought to build the verifier first - just to make sure it works?
</em><br>
<p>The verifier will be built before Novamente is given strong
<br>
self-modification abilities.  But building the kind of Friendliness
<br>
verifier I'm thinking of is almost surely harder than building
<br>
toddler-level AGI, and so we are working toward the latter from a
<br>
practical implementation/testing point of view while working on
<br>
Friendliness verification and other more advanced topics from a purely
<br>
theoretical perspective at the moment.
<br>
<p>The reason we do not consider this unsafe is basically that we are
<br>
quite sure our architecture will not permit a toddler-level AGI to
<br>
undergo any kind of hard takeoff.  We have not formally proved this,
<br>
but nor have I (or you) formally proved that my toaster will not
<br>
undergo a hard takeoff...
<br>
<p>-- Ben
