<p>This is a key problem with Friendly AI, though... You have to test
<br>
your programs to learn anything, to progress towards AI.  You will
<br>
have to have programs that learn, for you to progress towards AI.  We
<br>
may very well reach the point where we need to build self-modifying
<br>
programs, in order to progress further towards AI, long before those
<br>
programs are actually smart enough to be dangerous.
<br>
<p>Computer scientists always think their programs are going to be much,
<br>
much, MUCH smarter than they end up being.  If we stop turning our
<br>
programs on when we think they might be smart enough to be dangerous,
<br>
we would probably be 2 decades too soon.  So how are we ever to
<br>
progress?
