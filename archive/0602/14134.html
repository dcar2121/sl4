<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Marc
<br>
<p>And please don't try to copy Eliezer's obnoxious lines
<br>
(the nauseating 'Sincerly').  Come up with your own
<br>
obnoxious lines.
<br>
<p>Mitch was specfically calling for people on the SL4
<br>
list to attempt to define the problem of goal
<br>
stability.  It appears no one but me has the balls to
<br>
attempt it - all afraid of looking stupid I suppose -
<br>
there's no more worries for me on that score ;)
<br>
<p>The solution to goal stability couldn't be frigging
<br>
clearer
<br>
<p>I've been screaming the metaphysics of the universe
<br>
out on the transhumanist lists for a couple of years
<br>
now.    My reward  was to be laballed a crack-pot and
<br>
I was even lumped in with that Mentifex idiot!
<br>
<p>The answer is so frigging obvious it's painful.  The
<br>
Bayesian framework needed to be extended to deal with
<br>
the notion of 'a probability of a probability'.  I've
<br>
been saying over and over again for years that the
<br>
Bayesian framework needed to be extended.  Robin
<br>
Hanson's new  paper has the right idea that I was
<br>
looking for and there's a precise new theory in there
<br>
for how this could be done:
<br>
<p><a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>Bayesian probability theory can be reformulated as a
<br>
new kind of fuzzy set theory.  Then the notion of 'a
<br>
probability of a probability' amounts to the notion of
<br>
classes of sets (how sets can be grouped together).
<br>
<p>In order to make this precise you needed to extend set
<br>
theory - by creating TWO different definitions of a
<br>
*Set*.  
<br>
<p>One definition of a *Set* concerns Sets which have
<br>
physical and mental concepts as members.  The other
<br>
definition of a *Set* concerns Sets which have *other
<br>
sets* as members.  Not all collections of sets are
<br>
premitted to be grouped together into a larger set
<br>
(Mathematical *classes* which are not sets are really
<br>
'failed sets' with no mathematical existence).
<br>
<p>What does all this have to do with goal stability? 
<br>
It's obvious!  Imagine different successive states for
<br>
a self-improving AGI - each an 'improvement' on the
<br>
last.  Each 'state' of an AGI system is really a
<br>
Bayesian reasoning machine, consisting of a web of
<br>
probabilistic associations.  So each 'state' of the
<br>
AGI is really a fuzzy set.  When the AI changes to a
<br>
new state, this amounts to a new 'fuzzy set' being
<br>
created.  The problem of goal stability amounts to
<br>
ensuring that all the new fuzzy sets (all the future
<br>
states of the AI) fall into the same *class*  (namely
<br>
the class of 'Friendly' Bayesian reasoning machines). 
<br>
In other words there needs to be a way of assessing
<br>
the 'probability of the probability' (because Bayesian
<br>
reasoning has to be used to analyze the different
<br>
mathematical 'states' of an AGI system - and each such
<br>
'state' is itself a Bayesian reasoning machine - a web
<br>
of statistical associations - or a 'fuzzy set').  
<br>
<p>As mentioned above, this is done by extending set
<br>
theory to create TWO different notions of a fuzzy set,
<br>
corresponding to TWO different kinds of probability
<br>
theory (one class of probabilities deals with physical
<br>
and mental concepts, the other class of probabilities
<br>
deal with mathematical concepts -  i.e 'probabilities
<br>
of probabilities' - a 'probability' itself being a
<br>
mathematical concept).  
<br>
<p>To think I was lumped in the same category as
<br>
Mentifex.  Sheeh.
<br>
