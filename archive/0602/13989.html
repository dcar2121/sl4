<p>Rick,
<br>
<p>Now you seem to be answering some of the questions I wanted you to 
<br>
answer a few weeks back.
<br>
<p>What you describe sounds like a work in progress, with no proof that it 
<br>
is currently working any better than other projects, or that it ever 
<br>
will.  Many of us have projects in states that are at least as advanced 
<br>
as yours, by the sound of it.
<br>
<p>By claiming or implying in public that it is already finished, when you 
<br>
now seem to be saying that it is simply in progress, you are being 
<br>
somewhat economical with the truth, no?   Do you have any reason to 
<br>
believe that PIBOT already has advanced capabilities that put it well 
<br>
beyond the capabilities of other AGI projects?  If you do, could you 
<br>
share with us what is the source of this optimism?  What has PIBOT done, 
<br>
so far, that has impressed you most?
<br>
<p>And by the way, PIBOT is *not* a &quot;singularity&quot;:  you cannot redefine a 
<br>
term that already has a clear meaning.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore
