<p>Unless you have figured out some way to process information without 
<br>
material, an AGI has to run on some kind of hardware.  While any computer 
<br>
can simulate any other computer, the cost of doing so is high.  I.e., an 
<br>
AGI that solves problems much slower than we do has limited uses.  It may 
<br>
be that AGI will turn out to partly or even mostly be a hardware problem
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And a human baby cannot recursively self improve.
</em><br>
<p>It takes outside help (consider badly neglected or extremely rare wild 
<br>
raised children) but most people would consider the progress between a 
<br>
newborn and a PhD self improvement. How is your see AI going to acquire its 
<br>
knowledge of the world?
<br>
<p>And true, the process gets limited by the hardware, but don't you think an 
<br>
AGI is going to be limited by hardware too?  If not I have this spiffy 
<br>
Apple II I want to run your AGI software on.  (I know, a seed AI is 
<br>
expected to improve its hardware too.)
<br>
<p>It also might be useful to consider recursive self improvement as a 
<br>
separate problem from AGI.  I would be impressed enough by an intelligence 
<br>
as smart as an average human if you could bring that off.  Insisting on 
<br>
both smarts and recursive self improvement and friendly in the same package 
<br>
is a Xanadu.  (Xanadu was trying to do so much at once that events--the 
<br>
Web--ran over them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is the wrong place to look for seed AI size estimations.  Wheat can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think!!
</em><br>
<p>Humans can, or at least we think they think.  (All too often I have my 
<br>
doubts.)
<br>
<p>However, if you don't think a DNA estimate has merit, propose another.
