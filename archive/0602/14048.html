<p><em>&gt; &gt; Not &quot;within the Singularitarians&quot;, but

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are the fans of Terence McKenna, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used the term 'singularity'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at some point for one of his ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to think the shamen and McKenna-ites do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have some real insights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amidst all their lunacy, although unfortunately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the psychedelic path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to combine deep insight with rampant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense (which is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising given the somewhat indiscriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect of the psychedelic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substances on the human brain).  McKenna
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tripped a bit too often for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my taste, but to each his own ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity is about going beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow human ways of looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the world, and shamanism does tell you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something about that, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately modern technology is going to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us far more powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods...
</em><br>
<p>I think the powerful temporal coincidences
<br>
between certain 'new age' singularity ideas
<br>
including McKenna, time wave and the Mayan
<br>
calendar rollover are undeniable, particularly
<br>
the very odd fact of the Mayan calendar entering
<br>
a new cycle in 2012 and not, say, 2212; but is
<br>
there any logical way to make more of them than
<br>
coincidence?
<br>
<p>I have to tell you, up front, I've never had
<br>
access to ayahuasca or its relatives, but I'm
<br>
definitely smarter when I have a very small
<br>
amount of THC in me...
<br>
<p>I would suggest, no more than half-seriously,
<br>
that the human mind/brain has some sort of very
<br>
lo-fi quantum method of sensing future events,
<br>
which might be most reliable when almost all
<br>
future timelines lead to a particular event.
<br>
Suppose such a faculty added only one chance in a
<br>
million to correct random guesses, but as one
<br>
approached a massive discontinuity like we are
<br>
discussing, 999,999 out of a million possible
<br>
timelines lead to it. It's as if the
<br>
tech-Singularitarians were experts on ships and
<br>
could hear propellers approaching, while the
<br>
new-age-singularitarians only saw a looming shape
<br>
in the fog. Some of them might think it's a giant
<br>
gorilla or the Stay-Puft marshmallow man or The
<br>
Mothership; but they can all sense its approach.
<br>
<p>One of my favorite Robert Anton Wilson passages
<br>
is from 'Reality Is What You Can Get Away With':
<br>
<p>Cisco: The New Age is the biggest load of
<br>
bullshit and superstition since the Spanish
<br>
Inquisition.
<br>
Pancho: Okay.
<br>
(a little later)
<br>
Cisco: The New Age is the greatest evolutionary
<br>
advance since our ancestors crawled out of the
<br>
ocean. It is a technological, biological,
<br>
spiritual leap that will change everything we
<br>
know.
<br>
Pancho: Wait a minute. Didn't you just say the
<br>
New Age was bullshit?
<br>
Cisco: Yes, I did.
<br>
Pancho: And now you're saying it's a huge step
<br>
forward?
<br>
Cisco: That's right.
<br>
Pancho: Well, how can that be?
<br>
Cisco: It's simple. Some things called New Age
<br>
are complete bullshit; other things, also called
<br>
New Age, are incredible breakthroughs that will
<br>
change our lives completely.
<br>
Pancho: But then how do we know which is which?
<br>
Cisco: The only way is to learn to think for
<br>
ourselves, to stop being robots.
