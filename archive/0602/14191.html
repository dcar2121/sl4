</em><br>
<em>&gt; A disingenuous argument, Ben; many AGI projects are farther along the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have completed implementation.  Then they didn't work, as is the prior
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; vague ideas of which they were very proud even though they had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concrete idea of how intelligence would magically flow from their AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't boast of how many lines of code your project has.  Demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your understanding of intelligence.  Only then does your partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completed code matter more than the already-completed code of Eurisko or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOAR.  I understand the impulse to show off one's own strong points, but
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Sure, I basically agree with your comments, which is why I started my
<br>
paragraph with &quot;Based on crude considerations....&quot;  ;-)
<br>
<p>However, less crude considerations also indicate to me that SIAI is
<br>
not that far along the path to a practical AGI design.  There is also
<br>
the fact that there is very little that looks useful for practical AGI
<br>
work in any of the SIAI publications (while there is a lot that looks
<br>
useful for Friendliness theory, for example).
<br>
<p>But anyway, predicting who is going to make a huge breakthrough is
<br>
really really hard, and not the most useful or fascinating topic for
<br>
discussion...
