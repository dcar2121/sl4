</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oops!
<br>
<p>I had accidentally clipped off the first sentence of your post,
<br>
which explained that.
<br>
<p>Now that I understand that, I'll try to re-interpret what you said.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So the maximum number of bits of Phi and hence number of known
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or provably friendly programs is bounded by the length of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starting program. It would be less than that because you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to take into consideration the bit requirement of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machinery to transform your bit of Phi into a program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other things you want your program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do. But tightening the bound is not of much interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to be constructing a Phi that is specific to a specific
<br>
starting program.  However, I know for a fact that for any program,
<br>
halting or not, there are an infinite number of programs equivalent to
<br>
it.  Just think about it.  So this can't be right.  Also, I still
<br>
don't see how it logically follows.  I totally fail to see the
<br>
intended point of connection.  There doesn't seem to be anything
<br>
relating the length of phi to the length of the starting program.
