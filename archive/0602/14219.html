<p>
I was just at an NIH biomedical computing interest group meeting where
<br>
Ben Goertzel &amp; Bruce Klein &amp; some others presented a summary of Ray
<br>
Kurzweil's book, /The Singularity is Near/.  An idea that occurred to
<br>
me, during the section on government regulation, is that:
<br>
<p>- The worst possible outcome of the Singularity is arguably not total
<br>
extinction, but a super-Orwellian situation in which the people in
<br>
power dictate the thought and actions of everyone else --  and,
<br>
ultimately, George W. Bush or some equivalent wins the singularity and
<br>
becomes the only remaining personality in the solar system.
<br>
<p>- We've already seen, with genetics, what happens when, as a society,
<br>
we &quot;take time to think through the ethical implications&quot;.  We convene
<br>
a panel of experts - Leon Kass &amp; co. on the President's Bioethics
<br>
Committee - and, by coincidence, they come out with exactly the
<br>
recommendation that the President wants.
<br>
<p>- A scenario in which we take time to &quot;consider the ethical
<br>
implications&quot; and regulate the transition to singularity is almost
<br>
guaranteed to result in taking those measures that strengthen the
<br>
power of those already in power, and that seem most likely to lead
<br>
lead to the worst possible scenario:
<br>
Dubya-(or-Cheney)-equivalent-as-Ubermind.
<br>
<p>- The internet is the decentralized, difficult-to-control thing that
<br>
it is only because the government wasn't prepared for it, and wasn't
<br>
able to supervise its construction.
<br>
<p>- If we consider, on the one hand, that the internet, developed
<br>
rapidly with little regulation, worked out well and egalitarian; and
<br>
on the other, that a cautious approach is practically guaranteed to
<br>
lead to the worst possible outcome...
<br>
<p>- ... we must conclude that the SAFEST thing to do is to rush into AI
<br>
and the Singularity blindly, without pause, before the Powers That Be
<br>
can control and divert it.
