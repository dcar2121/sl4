<p>It would be hard to decide which genes were coding for brain
<br>
structure. There are differences in the brains function of people who
<br>
have been born blind, notably reuse of the visual cortex for other
<br>
purposes*.
<br>
<p>So damage to genes that encode for the eye lens could have an effect
<br>
on brain function and also structure, because function is determined
<br>
by structure. Well at least microstucture is.
<br>
<p>It makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. If the brain didn't
<br>
accept information about how it should be from the body around it
<br>
there would have to be two genetic changes for senses and motor
<br>
control to improve. One change coding for the increased number of
<br>
sensor inputs (e.g. number of rods and cones) and another change for
<br>
the brain structure to increase the amount of processing available for
<br>
processing inputs.
<br>
<p>The way that evolution has managed to change visual acuity and body
<br>
shape fairly fluidly between species suggests that this is not the
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>With regards to the limits ongoing argument about limits of formal
<br>
self-modfication leading to algorithmic information growth, these have
<br>
no bearing on the informational growth of natural intelligence as it
<br>
is not a formal system.
<br>
<p>So whatever information is in the genetic code, a portion of it might
<br>
simply be instructions for how to extract information to algorithms
<br>
about how to act/process information in a non-provably optimal but
<br>
genetically useful fashion from the environment.
