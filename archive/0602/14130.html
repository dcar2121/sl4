Brian,
<br>
<p>It should be remembered that Rick Geniale did not first post to hype
<br>
anything. He posted IN RESPONSE to an SL4 list post that completely trashed
<br>
his AI system without a shred of evidence. And that's bad for business so
<br>
of course he responded. So there is no need to bash Rick Geniale or treat
<br>
him as a leper. As for me, I am a patent pending inventor who has released
<br>
as much propriety information as I can. My posts were however never for the
<br>
purpose of hype but for the purpose of securing a universally respected,
<br>
friendly, &quot;safe built&quot; strong AI / conscious machine industry. Right now
<br>
people have an extreme fear of the industry  that could make for a very
<br>
hard take off that wrecks the industry in the public eye. I'd like to have
<br>
answers to those fears, and that is what I'm here to learn. All of us need
<br>
to work together to bring about the beneficial future we all want. I can
<br>
assure you, I haven't and won't be discussing my invention on this list.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not fond of the idea of SL4 collecting over time a group of inventors
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt; small companies forever hyping month after month, year after year, &quot;AGIs&quot;
</em><br>
that 
<br>
<em>&gt; are either forever vaporware or more likely turn out to be some form of
</em><br>
narrow 
<br>
<em>&gt; AI project that has little or zero relevance to this discussion forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I humbly suggest to the list owner and snipers that they might consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requiring anyone who posts here claiming that they have developed an AGI
</em><br>
to 
<br>
<em>&gt; convincingly demonstrate it within a month, or be banned forthwith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note, this is different than claiming you're simply working on an AGI,
</em><br>
but one 
<br>
<em>&gt; that isn't done. However, even for folks who are simply just working on
</em><br>
one, 
<br>
<em>&gt; standard list quality guidelines should apply. If you bring up your own
</em><br>
project 
<br>
<em>&gt; in a post, your post should contain some interesting technical details or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments, and not simple contentless posturing and claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My opinion only of course.
