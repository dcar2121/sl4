<p>
Numerous people on this list are truly alarmed at the prospects of AIs
<br>
wiping out humanity.  It seems to me that it would be easier to
<br>
develop existential-threat diseases than to develop AI.  For instance,
<br>
it is already known how to make a 100%-lethal
<br>
vaccine-and-antibiotic-and-natural-resistance-resistant smallpox.  If
<br>
someone were to modify it further to have a latent period - say, of
<br>
three years after infection - we would be looking at something that
<br>
could kill pretty much everyone on the planet.
<br>
<p>Humans are prone to imagine utopian social orders, and to believe that
<br>
they know the one true way how to order society so as to cure all its
<br>
ills.  Such schemes have always failed.  I think it is inevitable that
<br>
some new world-reformer will decide that their favorite social order
<br>
will work this time, if they can only start from a clean slate, with
<br>
no other competing social orders.  This person, not the military
<br>
invader or the religious zealot, is the most dangerous; unlike our
<br>
other homicidal nutcases, they have an incentive to kill EVERYONE on
<br>
the planet except a selected few.
