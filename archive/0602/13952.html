...yet more copying/pasting/palsying in order to be OT
<br>
<p>have we previously considered genetically modifiying other mammals to
<br>
achieve a greater level of global intelligence?
<br>
(<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;q=site:sl4.org+%22mammals%22">http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;q=site:sl4.org+%22mammals%22</a>
<br>
to <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0511/12595.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0511/12595.html</a> , but this is a _very_
<br>
different question)
<br>
<p>Big Cats, Dolphins &amp; Elephants (others anyone?) all have certain
<br>
faculties that are almost certainly more highly evolved than ours
<br>
(Elephant memory as a possibly-junk-science example)
<br>
<p>This snip from the archive:
<br>
<em>&gt; think it's implied by evolution that the difference between humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other higher mammals as far as absolute intellectual ability can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be traced back to small, specific differences between us and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chimpanzees
</em><br>
has a flipside; if we tweak those small differences to the way humans
<br>
evolved, do we end up with 'higher mammals'  with humanlike
<br>
intelligience?
<br>
<p>these 'lower' mammals could show great promise in being genetically
<br>
modified to talk, think and have usable digits or (possibly
<br>
bio-mechanic/electronic) actuators. Also, we can do this modification,
<br>
including cloning, without breaking any kind of law or statute as is
<br>
the case with genetically modifying humans.
<br>
<p>It could be that a super-intelligent talking Tiger could be
<br>
genetically predisposed to solving FTL; That enhanced dolphins could
<br>
be quantum-math savants, and that elephants could be unparallelled
<br>
estimators and correct-judgement perceivers.
<br>
<p>We all have kidneys, right? Would it be so hard so 'hoist' them? Could
<br>
the payoff be worth
<br>
it? surely the more heterogenous the thought spectrum the greater the
<br>
chance of breakthroughs? And yes, I want to boink leopard-head girl
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>ps. I think some day soon people in secure estates like those in the
<br>
US are going to have GM Rottweilers the size of Humvees patrolling
<br>
no-mans-land sections within inner/outer walls. Let's be sure not to
<br>
give _them_ too much of a clue :-)
