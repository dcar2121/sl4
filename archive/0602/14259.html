<em>&gt; We have actually ALREADY reached the point where many computer programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-modify.  I can practically guarantee that they aren't friendly, as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even have any model at all of the world external to the computer.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to be friendly if you don't know that anyone's there.  (A chain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly less relevant examples of self modifying code follows.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S.:  Check out: Evolutionary algorithms, Genetic Programming, Self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Optimizing Systems, and Self Organizing systems.  You might also look into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Core War and Tierra.  These are all (currently) quite primitive, but they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual self-modifying code.
</em><br>
<p>Hi,
<br>
<p>I'm very familiar with these techniques and in fact my Novamente AI
<br>
system uses a sort of evolutionary algorithm (a novel variant of
<br>
Estimation of Distribution algorithm) for hypothesis generation.
<br>
<p>Technically, most evolutionary algorithms do not involve
<br>
self-modifying code, rather they are learning-based automated code
<br>
generation.
<br>
<p>Tierra does involve self-modifying code of a very simple sort, but not
<br>
of a sort that could ever lead to mouse-level intelligence let alone
<br>
human-level or superhuman.
<br>
<p>Of course, not all self-modifying code has nontrivial hard-takeoff
<br>
potential; and an AI system need not possess self-modifying code in
<br>
order to have nontrivial hard-takeoff potential.
<br>
<p>Sorry if I spoke too imprecisely in my prior e-mail,
<br>
Ben
