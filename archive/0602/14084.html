Truly bizarre.  You assert that you believe knowledge is *always* preferable 
<br>
to happiness, and support it with a datum showing that knowledge is 
<br>
*sometimes* preferable to happiness, e.g. in the volcano example.
<br>
It is in fact a trivial consequence of game theory that knowledge can make a 
<br>
group of individuals worse off in net, or that an individual's knowledge is 
<br>
often more costly to others than it is beneficial to himself.
<br>
As for the supposed dysfunction of the 6 billion or so humans who can be 
<br>
made unhappy by having knowledge (Technically, what else *could* someone be 
<br>
made unhappy by.  People are information, their unhappiness is also 
<br>
information, and is in fact, among other things, the knowledge that they are 
<br>
unhappy) so what?  Declaring people to be dysfunctional because they fail to 
<br>
meet certain standards that you set for them is definitely not humane.  It 
<br>
seems to me to be more like the vindictive preference of one of evolution's 
<br>
creations that the environment should impose selective stresses which he is 
<br>
atypically well equipped to handle, not unlike the hope that a strong man in 
<br>
a tribe might hold that wars and wild beasts will come and enable him to 
<br>
translate his strength into status and differential survival relative to his 
<br>
weaker peers.
<br>
A culturally benighted person, prehaps from an Islamic country, could be 
<br>
made worse off by knowing that his daughter is not a virgin. (honor 
<br>
killings)
<br>
A sensitive, philosophical Westerner of Christian background, IQ 125, high 
<br>
openness, and high neuroticism could be made a great deal worse off by 
<br>
knowing that there is no reason to believe in his mythology (existential 
<br>
dispair possibly leading to clinical depression).
<br>
You can be saddened by your cursory familiarity with thermodynamics (a 
<br>
little knowledge is a dangerous thing, learn it for real, with the math, and 
<br>
I think you will feel better), but appearently not by the Scylla and 
<br>
Charybdis of chaos and determinism which one must also pass before becoming 
<br>
comfortable with GAI.
<br>
Michael Wilson could hypothetically find himself in a situation where very 
<br>
violent people very badly want him to program a seed AI for them before 
<br>
Friendlyness theory is complete.  In such a situation he would not be able 
<br>
to comply with their wishes, and would be made worse off by knowing the 
<br>
details of what his friends and family were experiencing as a result.
<br>
Each of these scenarios involves people falling along a continuum of 
<br>
increasing mental resiliance, but ultimately I believe that they differ by 
<br>
degree, not by kind.  A FAI would not suffer in any of these situations 
<br>
because it cannot suffer and is not a person, but I would be deeply 
<br>
skeptical of any supposedly Friendly output which rapidly lead to people who 
<br>
were not vulnerable to the fourth scenario.  (ignoring issues of 
<br>
invulnerability due to the implausibility of the situation 
<br>
post-singularity).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That quote seems to me to be an appealing one for people who are more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to endure unpleasent truths than their contemporaries, but it is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humane preference.  That people can be made unhappy by correct knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well as by incorrect is a classic literary theme, and obviously one with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least some truth behind it.  Even relatively rational people might want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know neither their opponent's poler hand nor the time of their future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inevitable death, and for the bulk of humanity even a spouses's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extramarital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attractions or the mythologized status of a historical hero can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;painful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with little attendant benefit.  I would be extremely reluctant to accept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; singularity that eliminated people's right to ignorance as &quot;Friendly&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that incautiously embraced the preferences of a person's extrapolated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; informed self and forced that person to live with the choices implied by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those preferences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is an interesting point. Personally, I consider that knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;always preferable to happiness. The typical situation that comes to mind is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that of people living close to a volcano. Of course, there are items of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge not as important or vital as that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd say though, that if knowledge makes you unhappy, you're dysfunctional.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And yes, I'm probably dysfunctional for a certain domain of things, like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thermodynamics. Ignorance on extramarital attractions or the truth behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heroic myths seem to me to do actual harm rather often though, but I won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get stuck on the example.
