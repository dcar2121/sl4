When Kennedy gave his famous speech at Rice University about going to 
<br>
the Moon, the speech, as well as the other things he said to his 
<br>
subordinates on the subject in the next few months, could probably have 
<br>
been contained in some 30K bits.  Maybe?  Ballpark, anyhow.
<br>
<p>But when this small packet of information was launched into the society 
<br>
that was America, it triggered some massive shifts of resources that 
<br>
eventually resulted in a series of Apollo spacecraft landing on the Moon.
<br>
<p>It tells us almost nothing about the Apollo space programme to speculate 
<br>
on how many bits were in JFK's utterances.
<br>
<p>Ditto for the amount of information in the DNA that triggers the 
<br>
development of a brain.

<em>&gt;&gt; I wish to remind that the 30k (20k-25k according to Wikipedia

<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome</a>) is the number of genes that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; RNA and some portions that may have additional functionality not yet 
</em><br>

<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Comparative genomics studies of mammalian genomes suggest that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; approximately 5% of the human genome has been conserved by evolution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; since the divergence of those species approximately 200 million years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ago, containing the vast majority of genes and regulatory sequences. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Intriguingly, since genes and known regulatory sequences probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; comprise less than 2% of the genome, this suggests that there may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more unknown functional sequence than known functional sequence. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; smaller, but large, fraction of human genes seem to be shared among 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; most known vertebrates.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still a far cry from exhausting the RAM of a modern PC.
