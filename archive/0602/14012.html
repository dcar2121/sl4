</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your thread-kill accepted, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, have you or the others considered before the practicalities of HOW 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have some discussion about the likely pre-Singularity impact of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity *idea*, and the likely threats from the way the world is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going, without the discussion turning political?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say this because I am very interested in the way that things will play 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, and with ways to approach the threats the world faces between now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then, but in the past I have watched these discussions go by without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteering any thoughts, for the simple reason that they do seem to go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straight from sanity to politically charged insanity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, one issue of great importance is the way that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nanotechnology idea started out with similar transformative vision, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has since become co-opted by corporate interests in such a way as to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuter some of the real nanotech goals?  Here we have something very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, but it is by its nature very political.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would it be a matter of allowing debate, but requiring all to take pains 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to avoid any inflammatory remarks (in other words, temporarily suspend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crocker's Rules)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or is it simply impossible to talk about this at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect the latter.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It's possible to talk about, but it takes a major, *cooperative* effort, 
<br>
from people who genuinely want to avoid having the conversation 
<br>
degenerate into politics, rather than trying to sneak in a snide word or 
<br>
two under whatever cover they can find.
<br>
<p>That point (and what follows) is not addressed to you, Loosemore, it's 
<br>
addressed to the list in general.
<br>
<p>You could *try* to have that conversation on SL4, and I would suggest 
<br>
following one simple rule absolutely:
<br>
<p>*Don't mention current events.*
<br>
<p>There is to be no mention of who is President of the United States, or 
<br>
what religion is rioting wherever.
<br>
<p>If you want illustrative examples, look for them in the year 1920 or 
<br>
earlier.  If you don't know any historical illustrative examples, you're 
<br>
not knowledgeable enough to think usefully about politics.
<br>
<p>If you know something is going to cause offense, don't say it.
<br>
<p>I don't care how right your principles are.  Keep them out of the 
<br>
discussion - make sure I can't even tell, from your message, which side 
<br>
of the modern-day Blues and Greens you're rooting for - or I will 
<br>
killthread the topic and that will be the end of the conversation on SL4.
<br>
<p>If people start yammering about politics, putting their allegiances on 
<br>
display, and saying uninteresting things, that will be the end of the 
<br>
conversation on SL4.
<br>
<p>You can take the conversation to extropy-chat or wta-talk, depending on 
<br>
your taste, where it will instantly degenerate into useless shouting.
<br>
<p>I suspect that it is not possible to talk about politics in a grown-up 
<br>
way without a grown-up moderator independently approving each message 
<br>
which obeys the spirit and the letter of the rules, denying all others; 
<br>
and I am not willing to put forth this effort for the SL4 mailing list.
<br>
