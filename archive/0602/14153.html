<p>What Jef said is right:
<br>
<p>1. The question I posed had to do with near-term human responses. 
<br>
Saying the difference is moot because of some future state is like
<br>
saying that discussing which path leads to AI quickest is moot because
<br>
we'll get there eventually.
<br>
<p>2. All the evidence suggests that more complex systems provide more,
<br>
not fewer, evolutionary niches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This discussion has reminded me of Stephen J. Dick who, in his 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper &quot;Cultural Evolution, the Postbiological Universe and SETI,&quot; put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth the &quot;Intelligence Principle,&quot; in which he declared that &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance, improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the central driving force of cultural evolution, and that to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent intelligence can be improved, it will be improved.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>And THAT reminds me of pre-WWI Western thought, which believed exactly
<br>
the same thing.  Which is why they believed that humanity was aspiring
<br>
to a peak of evolution foreordained by God.  Which is a notion that
<br>
Stephen J. Gould has spent a great deal of time fighting.  (This post
<br>
is not an endorsement of Stephen Gould.)  But which also leads to your
<br>
conclusion that evolution will converge.
