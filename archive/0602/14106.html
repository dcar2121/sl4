I can't really answer any of your questions, but it seems pretty intuitive 
<br>
to me.
<br>
<p>Any case where you create some kind of &quot;intelligent system&quot; implemented as a 
<br>
computer program, with the endowed property of writing computer code, it 
<br>
just seems that by default you are going to go straight into a hard 
<br>
take-off, and basically ripping the Universe a new one in a trivial amount 
<br>
of time.
<br>
<p>When you rip the Universe a new one, if you don't rip it *just right*, you 
<br>
are probaby going to decimate any remnant of sentience, other than perhaps 
<br>
your AGI.
<br>
<p>I think some people on this list share the same intuitive grasp of the idea. 
<br>
Maybe after I've educated myself a bit more (school is such a drag on 
<br>
education), I can try to discuss this concept in more technical terms, to 
<br>
actually see whether this intuitive idea can be made more sensible.
<br>
<p>In order to do that, I think it is necessary to talk about just what an 
<br>
&quot;intelligent system&quot; is, in general.
<br>
<p>But I think that pretty much lands everything right where it is expected.

<em>&gt;I agree with Ben, and would like to mention an even more fundamental issue:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Over years of discussion if have also not heard convincing arguments that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea of a &quot;verifiable FAI&quot; makes sense, and/or is at all possible. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example, FAI inherently requires a dynamic goal structure (ie. not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pre-defined) operating in unpredictable environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't have time to enter into the debate (to busy actually building AGI),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but just wanted to stress that not everyone here buys into some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basic assumptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another assumption that I don't share is that &quot;normal&quot; AGI is likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Unfriendly&quot; - ie. detrimental to us.

<em>&gt;Eli&gt; You can't &quot;add Friendliness&quot;.  It adds requirements like determinism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and verifiability to the entire architecture.  It rules out entire classes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of popular AI techniques, like evolutionary programming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have never seen you give a convincing argument in favor of this point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though I have heard you make it before.
