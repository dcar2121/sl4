<p>
I agree with Ben, and would like to mention an even more fundamental issue: 
<br>
<p>Over years of discussion if have also not heard convincing arguments that
<br>
idea of a &quot;verifiable FAI&quot; makes sense, and/or is at all possible. For
<br>
example, FAI inherently requires a dynamic goal structure (ie. not
<br>
pre-defined) operating in unpredictable environment.
<br>
<p>I don't have time to enter into the debate (to busy actually building AGI),
<br>
but just wanted to stress that not everyone here buys into some of these
<br>
basic assumptions.
<br>
<p>Another assumption that I don't share is that &quot;normal&quot; AGI is likely to be
<br>
&quot;Unfriendly&quot; - ie. detrimental to us.

<p>Eli&gt; You can't &quot;add Friendliness&quot;.  It adds requirements like determinism
<br>
and verifiability to the entire architecture.  It rules out entire classes
<br>
of popular AI techniques, like evolutionary programming,
<br>
<p>I have never seen you give a convincing argument in favor of this point,
<br>
though I have heard you make it before.
