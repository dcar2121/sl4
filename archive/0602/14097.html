<em> &gt; And if so, perhaps the Institute needs to put all its resources into
</em><br>
<em> &gt; researching and evangelizing Friendliness, then teaming up with the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; world's leading GAI researchers -- whether at MIT, Stanford, or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wherever they are -- to add Friendliness to their development
</em><br>
<em> &gt; program.
</em><br>
<p>You can't &quot;add Friendliness&quot;.  It adds requirements like determinism and 
<br>
verifiability to the entire architecture.  It rules out entire classes 
<br>
of popular AI techniques, like evolutionary programming, plus all 
<br>
combinatoric architectures based on mixing up a pot of tools and hoping 
<br>
that intelligence pops out.  When I added Friendliness to my list of 
<br>
requirements, it took me an extra year (I was young) to notice that I 
<br>
needed to throw out my entire AI theory and start over from scratch. 
<br>
But I did.  I wouldn't give good odds about a single pre-existing AI 
<br>
project making that decision, in all the pool of possibles.
<br>
<p>And even if 80% of them make that difficult decision, which is 
<br>
improbable, the problem is still just as bad because Friendly AI adds 
<br>
extra effort and time to development, which the 20% defectors don't have 
<br>
to put in.  So the good guys have to be smart enough to win even with 
<br>
their handicaps, or you're screwed.
