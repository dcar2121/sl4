</em><br>
<p>In order to argue for exponential advancement of technology -
<br>
let us say, a doubling of output every decade -
<br>
you would have to claim that there was 10 times as much change
<br>
between 1970 and 2006, as between 1934 and 1970,
<br>
and 100 times as much change as between 1888 and 1934.
<br>
<p>I don't believe that a plausible argument can be made that
<br>
there was more change between 1970 and 2006 than between
<br>
1888 and 1934.  Maybe someone will be able to make an
<br>
argument that is convincing to you.  But I think even the
<br>
most biased Extropian could not claim, when looking at a
<br>
timeline, that there has been three times as much change.
<br>
The theory of exponential advancement, with a doubling of
<br>
output every decade, requires 100 times as much change.
<br>
<p>If you use Moore's law to give your rate of change,
<br>
you must claim that there was 2^48 = 2.8x10E14 as much
<br>
change between 1970 and 2006 as between 1888 and 1934.
<br>
This PROVES, as in Q.E.D., case closed,
<br>
that the notion that technological progress proceeds
<br>
according to Moore's law, or even a doubling every decade,
<br>
is completely absurd.
