<em>&gt;The verifier will be built before Novamente is given strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-modification abilities.  But building the kind of Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;verifier I'm thinking of is almost surely harder than building
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toddler-level AGI, and so we are working toward the latter from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practical implementation/testing point of view while working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendliness verification and other more advanced topics from a purely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theoretical perspective at the moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The reason we do not consider this unsafe is basically that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quite sure our architecture will not permit a toddler-level AGI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undergo any kind of hard takeoff.  We have not formally proved this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but nor have I (or you) formally proved that my toaster will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undergo a hard takeoff...
</em><br>
<p><p>If take-off is an explosion...
<br>
<p>If you follow my metaphor, it seems to me as though Ben is trying to create 
<br>
a nuclear reactor, whereas Eliezer is trying to make a nuclear bomb.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is always the potential for a reactor that melts down and 
<br>
turns into a nuclear explosion. The only thing is to remember that some 
<br>
nuclear explosions are good, and others are bad.
<br>
<p>Really, either of their approaches can work fine in theory. Ben's approach 
<br>
is to get the nuclear reaction into a controlled environment, and then 
<br>
determine whether/how to melt the thing down into a safe explosion. Eliezer 
<br>
says lets just figure out how to slap the plutonium together in the right 
<br>
way from the beginning, and save ourselves the trouble of building all the 
<br>
extra reactor engineering and getting bogged down in the details of reactor 
<br>
safety.
<br>
<p>Eliezer DOES have a point though- if you carry it through the metaphor, then 
<br>
you have to understand that reactor safety is about intelligent reactor 
<br>
safety as opposed to nuclear reactor safety. I don't know how comparable 
<br>
these two things are. It has definitely been demonstrated through much of 
<br>
the philosophy here on SL4 that reactor safety is definitely a difficult 
<br>
problem, and is independent of explosion Friendliness. Simply put, if the 
<br>
explosion is guaranteed Friendly, then you have no need for a reactor at 
<br>
all. Otherwise, you not only have to worry about reactor safety, but ALSO 
<br>
explosion Friendliness.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think Ben's approach is impossible, impractical or 
<br>
necessarily sub-optimal. If you have verifiable reactor safety, and that 
<br>
actually ends up being EASIER than verifiable explosion Friendliness, then 
<br>
what do you know, Ben would have taken the optimal approach from the 
<br>
beginning, because he would have his verifiably safe reactor with which he 
<br>
could study Friendliness in it's definite and observable form (such that the 
<br>
problem of Friendliness explosion becomes easier to solve than through 
<br>
theory alone).
<br>
<p>Now if we only had a Manhatten project...
