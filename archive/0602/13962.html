I don't particularly like where this thought leads, although I can't
<br>
argue with the logic of it.
<br>
Specifically, I wonder why, if all intelligences will move toward the
<br>
same rational fitness peak, that the future needs more than one such
<br>
entity except possibly for redundancy. Does this mean that the first AGI
<br>
which is not inherently friendly will immediately make a few copies of
<br>
itself and then destroy all other intelligences capable of challenging
<br>
its apex position? Or will these slight differences arising from our
<br>
(only very slightly different) backgrounds be enough justification for
<br>
keeping us all around?

[WAS Re: Syllabus for Seed Developer Qualifications]
<br>
<p>Speculation about the potential differences between augmented humans and
<br>
<p>non-human animals is moot. Uplifted intelligences, whether they are 
<br>
descended from humans, animals, or rocks, will, in a Lamarckian process,
<br>
<p>rapidly accelerate towards a common fitness peak. Post-biological 
<br>
intelligences may retain vestiges of their pre-post-biological brain 
<br>
(much like we still retain the reptilian part of our brain), but that 
<br>
will ultimately be of no real consequence as all advanced intelligences 
<br>
will gravitate towards roughly the same mode of cognitive being.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
George
