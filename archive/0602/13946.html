<em>&gt; OCaML is one plausible candidate.  Pretty fast, compileable &amp; interpretable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's an Object Oriented dialect of CaML which is a dialect of ML.  SML
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't have lots of nice features, like variables, but OCaML (and CaML?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slips them back in.  Also, ANSI C can be embedded into the code.  (So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; docs say.  I'm not familiar enough to judge.)
</em><br>
<p>Must say I use a nice p2p app written in Objective CaML, but I thought
<br>
it would be too obscure to mention - my bad!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Have you looked at Alice, from Stanford University?  Still in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stages, but it looks like it supports parallelism in a quite interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion.  Check out &quot;Promises&quot;.  Nice!
</em><br>
<p>will do; though new/experimental languages have certain advantages
<br>
(evolution says they'll be better) they also have certian
<br>
disadvantages; like the necessity to write your own API modules for
<br>
solved problems (sorts, collections, tcp/ip, unicode, math, remoting,
<br>
etc) - this is not to say that any newer-language-of-your-choice
<br>
doesn't have some or all of these features; but does in have
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also:  If you think of &quot;subsets of some other language&quot; as not worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering, please think again.  Languages can be made much better by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removing some feature that's just too dangerous.
</em><br>
<p>subset as I'm meaning it refers to the available API. What I'm trying
<br>
to get at is that I might in the course of developing 'workhorse' AGI
<br>
code need to:
<br>
- write code that will parse the pixels of a scanned exponential
<br>
graph, generate the data model it represents and call various math
<br>
functions against the result
<br>
- fire off a gazillion threads on multiple servers across the globe
<br>
which share resources and scheduling to achieve a given computation
<br>
result; the initiation of which can instantaneously load and run new
<br>
code segments without requiring user tweaking of the distributed
<br>
clients (e.g. stopping the target application server on the
<br>
distributed client, updating the class library and restarting - I'd
<br>
consider this to be a pretty severe disadvantage)
<br>
- parse the source code and OS/chip specific binaries of all known
<br>
langauges to define a functional model that can be applied against
<br>
mathematical proofs and then regenerated in any other language
<br>
- text transliteration, conversion and parsing supporting unicode
<br>
languages and all known file formats
<br>
- web/net spidering to grok every online resouce possible via every
<br>
known protocol; tcpip, p2p, X.25, SOAP, SNMP etc
<br>
- mature persistent storage support incl. database connection pooling
<br>
and driver/api support for the big rdbms', LDAP,bdb etc
<br>
<p>For the above examples a language like say Java has pretty much all
<br>
the prerequisites in the API or free, stable 3rd party libraries; I
<br>
wouldn't need to write any workhorse code for the operations
<br>
themselves (e.g. the Java 2D API could parse an image of a graph from
<br>
any one a host of image file formats and could generate pixel plot
<br>
metadata with relative ease) - just the higher functional code for
<br>
achieving the result. When I say one language is a subset of another,
<br>
I mean it's available module library for solving known tasks is not as
<br>
broad. So when I say 'Python is a subset of Java', I'm saying is
<br>
doesn't have the breadth of API that Java does - I think this is a
<br>
fair comment. Python definitely does more than just web operations,
<br>
and has it's champions (Google is a great example) but as a programmer
<br>
who favours his LAMP flavoured in Perl I'm always going to be a little
<br>
biased :-)
<br>
<p>And in regards to 'dangerous' language features, I could posit that
<br>
our future code-writing AGI will have no problem using such features
<br>
very, very effectively. Backing away from something because of a
<br>
percieved lack of skills, especially in others, belies a certain
<br>
neurotic attitude that could well be holding the development timeline
<br>
back. If our AGI will be able to do it, we should be trying to improve
<br>
our collective engieering skills until we can do it too.
<br>
<p>... the next few paragraphs go _way_ OT; search to ':skip' to, well, ...
<br>
<p>side note: I find myself calling 'bullshit' whenever anyone denegrates
<br>
thier peers and/or society in this implicit way - e.g 'most
<br>
programmers can't do pointers/gotos/language-feature-x' or 'most
<br>
people are stupid, useless bovines'.   It's not the fault of the
<br>
greater group that your message stinks - sometimes we all get to be
<br>
the Crazy Person. I have a host of things I feel all sorts of
<br>
inclinations to believe in (AGI,
<br>
Rationality-as-a-replacement-for-religion (Dawkins), Aether,
<br>
agrav=FTL, nationalism-is-evil,
<br>
all-humans-can-be-considered-biologically-equivalent) but I realise
<br>
that some of my cherished favourites are probably hokum,and that if
<br>
they're not gaining any kind of traction with the majority then
<br>
there's a good chance I'm flat wrong. We've got where we are today via
<br>
a collective effort, and the world is full of nutty, beautiful little
<br>
fruits from the tree-of-humanity and that the vast majority are
<br>
affable and sensible sorts with just as much curiostiy and wonder as
<br>
me. Denigrating the intelligence others also calls into question where
<br>
you fit in the bell curve; and that maybe in certain areas it is *you*
<br>
(and me) who are 'blissfully incompetent'
<br>
(<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/DyeHard/story?id=1291826">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/DyeHard/story?id=1291826</a>)
<br>
<p>further, _very_ OT comment, while I have the inclinatation to
<br>
braindump: have we previosuly considered genetically modifiying other
<br>
mammals to achieve a greater level of global intelligence? Big Cats,
<br>
Dolphins &amp; Elephants (others anyone?) all have certain faculties that
<br>
are almost certainly more highly evolved than ours (Elpahant memory?)
<br>
and these 'lower' mammals could show great promise in being
<br>
genetically modified to talk, think and have usable digits or
<br>
(possibly bio-mechanic/electronic) actuators. Also, we can do this
<br>
modification, including cloning, without breaking any kind of law or
<br>
statute as is the case with genetically modifying humans. It could be
<br>
that a super-intelligent talking Tiger could be genetically
<br>
predisposed to solving FTL; That enchanced dolphins could be
<br>
quantum-math savants, and that elephants could be unparalled
<br>
estimators and correct-judgement perceivers. We all have kidneys,
<br>
right? Would it be so hard so 'hoist' them? Could the payoff be worth
<br>
it? surely the more heterogenous the thought spectrum the greater the
<br>
chance of breakthroughs? And yes, I want to boink leopard-head girl
<br>
:-)

<p><em>&gt; However, the real problem is:  &quot;Where are you going to get your programmers?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is why so many projects settle on C or Java, despite all their many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.  Even when you're paying good money most people are reluctant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn a new language.  (I'm currently finding myself reluctant to learn OCaML
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a somewhat similar reason.  It looks like a lot of effort for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertain return.)
</em><br>
<p>this is a fair point; while we all need a Linus (Ben Goertzel seems to
<br>
be our version of &quot;Pimpin' T&quot; here) we also need a development
<br>
community. Taking the Linux kernel as an example of a huge community
<br>
project, here's some stats for us all to think about:
<br>
# of Kernel contributors: 418 (2002,. from
<br>
<a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue9_6/tuomi/#t5">http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue9_6/tuomi/#t5</a>. Contrast this
<br>
however with significantly fewer at
<br>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/</a>; can anyone elaborate?)
<br>
# of SLOC: 6,000,000 (kernel; 2.6, from
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code</a>; take note that of
<br>
the Vista count: 50M!)
<br>
# of Linux kernel testers: google was not forthcoming - anyone?.
<br>
another interesting stat would be how many testers Microsoft employs
<br>
(I read an older Mac figure of 500) and how many beta testers they
<br>
supply CTP's to
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, they're a bit slow.  If you use them, figure you'll need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twice the CPU cycles to reach breakthrough as with an efficient language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like C, D, or SML.
</em><br>
<p>Moore's law makes efficency kind of irrelevant. If the language has
<br>
the potential to deliver the goods in terms of 'it turns out to be so
<br>
much easier to develop AGI bootstrap code in language x' then it
<br>
should be considered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, why include Perl?  It deserves to be dismissed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same reasons, and to the same degree, as Python and Ruby.
</em><br>
<p>Perl does have a pretty impressive API; even outside the standard
<br>
distribution there's another 10,000 modules on CPAN
<br>
(<a href="http://cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html">http://cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html</a>). Also, the Parrot VM
<br>
they're building for Perl6 has lofty goals both for the language
<br>
(check out the Synopses, Apocalypses and Exegeses) and for the Parrot
<br>
VM the interpretable language list includes Python &amp; Lisp and would
<br>
you know it - Basic :-) (from: <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/languages/">http://www.parrotcode.org/languages/</a>)
<br>
and it's also been implemented in Haskell (<a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">http://www.pugscode.org/</a>)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No comments on C#, but if you don't consider programmer availability, then I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plunk clearly for D (unless you go for something experimental like Alice).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do... SIGH ... it's pretty much GOT to be C, C++, or Java.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the gcj subset of Java (so it's actually compileable to native code).
</em><br>
<p>I'd posit there a plenty of perl hackers out there; remember when it
<br>
was the only 'write (carefully) once, run anywhere' game in town
<br>
before Java came along? And if Parrot can eventually run all the
<br>
languages it says it will (these include .NET/Java bytecode) then
<br>
maybe we _don't_ need to select a langauge per se as opposed to a VM
<br>
or framework.
<br>
<p>Having said that, .NET supports 40 languages, including pretty much
<br>
_all_ the usual suspects
<br>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET#.NET_languages">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET#.NET_languages</a>) and the
<br>
number of coders who can write windows apps must outnumber non-windows
<br>
developers by some kind of ridiculous margin, significantly increasing
<br>
the potential developer pool...
