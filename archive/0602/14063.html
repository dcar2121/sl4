<p><em>&gt; And yet, considering that kind of growth in faith belief, the

<p><p>Yes.  I see it as a self-limiting problem.  In an evenly heterogeneous
<br>
environment, the net effect of any one faction's efforts are easily
<br>
absorbed/dampened by the others'.  In a nearly homogeneous environment, the
<br>
unified effort of the mass can be subtly perturbed by influences from the
<br>
minority.  So what if there are only 2 Singularitarians per million on this
<br>
planet?  A rational &quot;nudge&quot; in world affairs can have greater impact in the
<br>
long term than orders of magnitude greater misapplied force.  Navigating a
<br>
sail-boat in a strong cross-wind could be dangerous, but with appropriately
<br>
trimmed sails the pilot can achieve greater speed than in a favorable light
<br>
breeze.
<br>
<p>Imagine a scenario where not long after the first glimmers of AGI
<br>
<em>&gt; start to appear the christian right get up in arms about creating an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI being equivalent to 'playing god' and the whole field ends up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being the same political lamb that stem cells has become.
</em><br>
<p><p>yeah, that would suck.  .. especially if there is only one &quot;leader&quot; of AGI
<br>
research, contentedly abiding by the laws of a church-owned state.   For all
<br>
the reasons nature has shown that diversity is the key to survival, AGI
<br>
research must be  distributed.  This will ensure  there is no single point
<br>
of failure.   That's also a good argument for why FAI must be done right the
<br>
first time - once it reaches critical mass there is no way to &quot;pull the
<br>
plug&quot; from a distributed intelligence.  (ex:  I don't think it would work to
<br>
&quot;take down&quot; the Internet to stop a Worm's propagation today, as it may have
<br>
15+ years ago)
<br>
<p>that faith has thrown up in this blighted city. The 21st century,
<br>
<em>&gt; Dawkins argues, should be an age of reason but we are threatened by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who see unreason as a positive virtue. Faith is an indulgence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationality that is nourishing extremism, division and terror.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So the believers line up to receive their programming from an establishment
<br>
that is/was created by non-believers for the express purpose of subjugating
<br>
a trusting mass of otherwise rationally free-thinking and wary sceptics.
<br>
How is this much different from the role of the &quot;establishment&quot; (religious
<br>
or political) at any other point in history?
