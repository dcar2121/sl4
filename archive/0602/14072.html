<br>
<em>&gt; That quote seems to me to be an appealing one for people who are more able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to endure unpleasent truths than their contemporaries, but it is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humane preference.  That people can be made unhappy by correct knowledge
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; well as by incorrect is a classic literary theme, and obviously one with
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; least some truth behind it.  Even relatively rational people might want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know neither their opponent's poler hand nor the time of their future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable death, and for the bulk of humanity even a spouses's
</em><br>
extramarital
<br>
<em>&gt; attractions or the mythologized status of a historical hero can be painful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with little attendant benefit.  I would be extremely reluctant to accept a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity that eliminated people's right to ignorance as &quot;Friendly&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that incautiously embraced the preferences of a person's extrapolated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informed self and forced that person to live with the choices implied by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those preferences.
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting point. Personally, I consider that knowledge is
<br>
always preferable to happiness. The typical situation that comes to mind is
<br>
that of people living close to a volcano. Of course, there are items of
<br>
knowledge not as important or vital as that.
<br>
<p>I'd say though, that if knowledge makes you unhappy, you're dysfunctional.
<br>
And yes, I'm probably dysfunctional for a certain domain of things, like say
<br>
thermodynamics. Ignorance on extramarital attractions or the truth behind
<br>
heroic myths seem to me to do actual harm rather often though, but I won't
<br>
get stuck on the example.
<br>
