</em><br>

<em>&gt; The easiest way to know whether n programs halt (without empirically

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the maximum number of bits of Phi and hence number of known or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provably friendly programs is bounded by the length of your starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program. It would be less than that because you would have to take
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your bit of Phi into a program and other things you want your program
</em><br>

<em>&gt; I hope I haven't covered ground already well trodden, I couldn't find

</em><br>
<p>Well, that definitely isn't a constructive proof, but even worse you can 
<br>
substitute practically any undefined term for friendly in that &quot;proof&quot; and 
<br>
have something equivalently meaningful.  And I'm not certain the term needs 
<br>
to be undefined, except in context.
<br>
<p>Try:
<br>
The number of parity preserving programs a program can safely
<br>
&nbsp;self transform itself into is bounded by the length of the program.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Let us posit a number Phi which is equivalent to Omega but for
<br>
parity. That is bit 1 is 1 iff the shortest program expressible
<br>
&nbsp;in a programming languages (breaking ties in a defined fashion) is
<br>
even and has parity maintaining transformations. And so on
<br>
&nbsp;with the second bit and the second shortest program. And omega is bit
<br>
&nbsp;1 is 1 iff program 1 halts (I don't know whether this is the classical
<br>
&nbsp;definition)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Knowing a bit of Phi is 1 is equivalent to knowing a bit of Omega is
<br>
&nbsp;1, unless not halting is even.
<br>
<p>You could probably also substitute &quot;stupidity&quot; or &quot;virtue&quot; (both of with have 
<br>
approximate definitions), but for parity it's true by inspection, so we can 
<br>
see what the argument means.
