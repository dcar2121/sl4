<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, if the starting program is allowed to increase its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; algorithmic information over time via adding new physical compute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resources, then things get more complicated -- but this doesn't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around the basic problem and obvious I've cited above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *blink blink*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben, adding new physical compute resources, without absorbing new bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the environment, doesn't change the algorithmic information at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  A webcam increases your algorithmic complexity.  Adding 10^36 CPUs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't change it at all.  The formalism assumes a Turing machine with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbounded tape.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I guess I didn't phrase things precisely enough.
<br>
<p>There are a lot of ways to formalize the intuitive argument I
<br>
presented before, here I will try out one of them...
<br>
<p>Here is the computational framework I want to consider right now...
<br>
<p>I assume that we have a physical computer with a fixed amount M of
<br>
memory at its disposal.  In current computer-architecture terms we may
<br>
consider this to be the amount of RAM it has, or if we want to be
<br>
really generous the amount of RAM plus the amount of hard disk space. 
<br>
In this approach there is no infinite tape.
<br>
<p>I then argue that this computer is going to have trouble doing proofs
<br>
about programs P with algorithmic information &gt; M, because these
<br>
programs P cannot be computed by any program that fits in M.
<br>
<p>Hooking a web-cam up to the computer doesn't help with this problem.
<br>
<p>If the computer gets more memory in the future, then it can run
<br>
programs P with algorithmic information &gt; M [of course, not all its
<br>
programs need to have algorithmic information &gt; M, but some of them
<br>
may well.]  There is no way that any program running on the initial
<br>
version of the computer will be able to prove theorems about these
<br>
programs running on future versions of the computer.
<br>
<p>Your point about the webcam is well taken, because in order for the
<br>
future version of the computer with extra memory to *get* a program
<br>
with algorithmic information &gt; M, it needs to get extra information
<br>
from somewhere besides the computer's initial program (which
<br>
necessarily had algorithmic information &lt;M).  This extra information
<br>
may come from the external world, through a webcam or other sensory
<br>
organs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So does this change, at all, the long argument you delivered about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recursive self-improvement being impossible?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I definitely did not claim that recursive self-improvement is impossible!
<br>
<p>What I suggested is that it is impossible for a program/computer
<br>
combination to recursively self-improve its hardware and software in
<br>
such a way that it can both
<br>
<p>a) increase dramatically the algorithmic information of its software
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>b) prove, based on its initial hardware configuration (or any  minor
<br>
variation with a comparable amount of algorithmic information), that
<br>
its far-future improved versions (with substantially greater
<br>
algorithmic information) will be Friendly.
<br>
<p>Recursive self-improvement is definitely possible -- it's the
<br>
provability of properties of future versions of oneself with massively
<br>
more algorithmic information than one's current self that poses
<br>
difficulties....
<br>
<p>The only way around this problem seems to be to control recursive
<br>
self-improvement in such a way that the algorithmic information
<br>
content of future revisions is bounded by M.  This is not necessarily
<br>
unworkable but it may prove overly restrictive.
<br>
<p>For example, the AIXI and AIXItl and Godel Machine AGI architectures
<br>
are extremely powerful (if one sets aside computational efficiency
<br>
considerations), but have very low algorithmic information (they can
<br>
be coded very briefly).  On the other hand, they are way too slow to
<br>
ever be useful, and it may well be that, in the spectrum of
<br>
pragmatically useful AGI architectures, there are ones that have
<br>
algorithmic information massively more than any M we humans can build
<br>
into our machines in the near future, and that are massively superior
<br>
in intelligence and ethicalness to anything with algorithmic
<br>
information &lt; this &quot;humanly achievable M.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also, the mere absorption of large amounts of data from the external
<br>
world may boost the algorithmic information of future AI's above the
<br>
level of humanly achievable limits.  To understand the world, a future
<br>
AI may wish to store a lot of data about the world in its active
<br>
memory in order to mine this data, and the physical world certainly
<br>
contains interesting data with algorithmic information exceeding
<br>
humanly achievable limits.
<br>
<p>A more exact and careful version of the above arguments would have to
<br>
consider run-time as well as program length.  I have finessed this
<br>
issue in part by assuming the computer has a fixed finite amount of
<br>
memory M, which in effect means that this is all the memory it can
<br>
access within a feasible amount of time (so that the runtime
<br>
complexity of programs run on it using memory beyond the limit M would
<br>
be infeasibly excessive).  But I am quite confident that even if you
<br>
consider runtime in detail, the same sort of argument will hold....
<br>
<p>What this  means to me, qualitatively, is that the criterion of
<br>
provability is too stringent in the face of massive ongoing
<br>
hardware/software self-improvement.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
