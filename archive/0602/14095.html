</em><br>
<p>Just to jump in - this is one of my interests.
<br>
It seems to me that the majority of evidence shows that
<br>
the rate of technological and scientific progress, and of
<br>
social change, has been slowing down since 1970,
<br>
possibly earlier.  I don't need to get into an argument
<br>
about it, just let it be noted that I do not accept this
<br>
assertion without an argument, and that I hope others
<br>
will stop repeating this mantra which has never
<br>
been demonstrated empirically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is good reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to expect it to continue to accelerate in the near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The inherent intelligence of humans is not changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast on a time scale of hundreds of years
</em><br>
<p>(Actually, it appears to be increasing rapidly, as measured
<br>
by a wide variety of IQ tests.  See &quot;Flynn effect&quot;.  (Also,
<br>
the number of mental illnesses people develop is increasing
<br>
rapidly.  I had previously thought this was due to environmental
<br>
degradation, but the high correlation between high IQ and
<br>
mental illness suggests another factor.))
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Of those humans, an increasing fraction are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receiving advanced education, leading to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists and engineers
</em><br>
<p>There are 2 popular ways of trying to evaluate the rate of
<br>
progress.  One involves measuring inputs: number of
<br>
PhDs granted, number of scientific journals, etc.
<br>
This generally shows an exponential increase (although
<br>
the datapoints from the 19th century to make that
<br>
exponential appear to have been made up out of thin
<br>
air by de Solla Price (/Little Science, Big Science/ (1963)),
<br>
by calculating the curve for the 20th century and
<br>
extrapolating backwards).
<br>
<p>Another involves measuring
<br>
outputs, by trying to evaluate the significance of advances,
<br>
counting papers with above a certain number of
<br>
references to them, evaluating the
<br>
changes in people's lives, or lifespan or leisure
<br>
time or wealth increase.  This latter generally shows a
<br>
rate of change that is linear over time, decreasing since
<br>
about 1970, and exponentially decreasing at all times
<br>
going back thousands of years when phrased
<br>
in terms of change per person or effective output per
<br>
researcher.  See &quot;Rescher's law of logarithmic returns&quot;,
<br>
which states that the outputs achieved to date in any
<br>
technical field are a logarithmic function of the inputs
<br>
that have so far been devoted to it.
<br>
<p>The notion that the rate of change is increasing is
<br>
appealing, but has no basis in fact as far as I know.
<br>
It is a claim that can be made only in complete
<br>
ignorance of history.
<br>
Compare 1970 to 2006 - that's a 36-year timespan.
<br>
Then compare 1934 to 1970, or 1888 to 1934,
<br>
or 1852 to 1888, or 1816 to 1852, or 1780 to 1816,
<br>
or 1744 to 1780, or 1708 to 1744, or 1672 to 1708 -
<br>
I don't think that anyone with any knowledge of any
<br>
one of those time periods could say anything but
<br>
that the technological, epistemological, and cultural
<br>
change during them - in Western society - was
<br>
greater than during the period 1970-2006.
<br>
<p>I think something else - probably the time devoted
<br>
to life overhead such as taxes, automobile maintenance,
<br>
PC maintenance, college education, etc. - is what
<br>
is actually increasing, causing stress and the
<br>
impression that the world is changing ever faster.
