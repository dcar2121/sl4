<p>
I point I don't understand is why anybody thinks there is an AGI &quot;race&quot;
<br>
<p>Would it be valuable for a soup kitchen to boast that it will be the one to
<br>
feed the most hungry people this year?  Or would a women's shelter brag
<br>
about having cared for the largest number of domestic violence victims?  It
<br>
seems ludicrous to allow pride and ego to overshadow noble goals like
<br>
humanitarian efforts.  If the proposed benefits of super-intelligence (as
<br>
recursively self-modifying AI will quickly become) are not  humanitarian*
<br>
efforts, then nothing about AGI would be.  If I understand the stated goal
<br>
of reaching the Singularity correctly (which may be debated) then it should
<br>
not be about Intellectual Property Rights or hubris or ego-driven ideology
<br>
that moves us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the madness to be the &quot;first&quot; throws cautious reason to the wind, there
<br>
will be nothing remotely like &quot;Friendliness&quot; involved in the resulting
<br>
product of such a method.  Maybe I haven't posted much in terms of &quot;P&quot; this
<br>
or O() that and it may be that my additions to this list have been 'mere'
<br>
philosophy, but it just seems like good sense.  The obsession with
<br>
denouncing others' attempts at achieving &gt;something&lt; can not be helping
<br>
anybody.  Having a community for the sake of casually claiming our own
<br>
proprietary code is better than someone else's seems like an unproductive
<br>
waste of time.  Where are the links to shareable modules that illustrate
<br>
either potentially useful concepts or explanations of why the apparent
<br>
promise will ultimately fail?  We're not in a cold-war (i hope) so we should
<br>
not be protecting ourselves from each other's critical review.  I would love
<br>
to be involved.  So far the only open call for employment I've seen has said
<br>
I would not be smart enough or crazy enoough.  For the record, I would like
<br>
some way to prove or disprove even THAT assumption.
<br>
<p>*humanitarian:  in the sense that it helps benefit humans, or the group
<br>
collectively believed to be &quot;US&quot; -which may include sentient non-humans or
<br>
such technology-assisted biological intelligence that it no longer passes
<br>
the regular test for &quot;human&quot;
