<p>
The Singularity Institute's 2006 $100,000 Challenge with Peter Thiel, the
<br>
former CEO of PayPal, will expire this Sunday, February 19. Any donation you
<br>
make will be matched dollar-for-dollar. So far, SIAI has matched $93,486. 
<br>
<p>You can donate and track our progress here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.singularitychallenge.com">http://www.singularitychallenge.com</a>
<br>
<p>Personal checks postmarked by Sunday will be matched. If you send a donation
<br>
by check, please let us know so we can keep the donation total accurate.
<br>
<p>Matching the Challenge is really crucial for our growth. Below is a summary
<br>
of our present projects, which I hope gives you a sense of our dedication. 
<br>
<p>Your tax-deductible Challenge gift will support:
<br>
<p>* The production and promotion of the Stanford Singularity Summit, a
<br>
conference to educate up to 1700 people in Silicon Valley about the
<br>
singularity hypothesis - representing an unprecedented chance to promote and
<br>
further the nascent fields of singularity and global risk studies. A
<br>
well-executed conference will increase the interest of gifted students,
<br>
raise the legitimacy of the research, and expand the range of investors. 
<br>

<br>
<p>* Our second full-time Research Fellow. We are looking for someone
<br>
exceptional to collaborate with Yudkowsky on the challenge of a workable
<br>
theory for self-improving, motivationally stable Artificial Intelligence.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.intelligence.org/employment/researchfellow.html">http://www.intelligence.org/employment/researchfellow.html</a> 
<br>
<p>* A remarkable Development Director and Communications Director. I'm now 
<br>
looking for skilled and dedicated collaborators to scale the Institute.

<br>
<p>* Our forthcoming monthly speaker series, the Future of Humanity Forum, at
<br>
Stanford Hewlett Teaching Center (its main lecture hall seats 500). The
<br>
Forum will be an ongoing series to complement and expand on the Singularity
<br>
Summit. Date and time for the inaugural event will be announced shortly. 
<br>
<p>* Yudkowsky's Friendly AI theory and design work, conference presentations,
<br>
and published writing. He completed recently his two chapter drafts for Nick
<br>
Bostrom and Milan Cirkovic's Global Catastrophic Risks (forthcoming): the
<br>
first on cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks,
<br>
the second on the unique global risks of Artificial Intelligence. 
<br>
<p>* The Singularity Institute Partner Network. Later this year, we'll begin
<br>
approaching potential inaugural partners to be our cornerstone for building
<br>
a network of companies, foundations, individuals, and organizations
<br>
committed to advancing beneficial AI, singularity, and global risk studies.
<br>
<p>* Medina's academic presentations. In January, Medina was awarded full
<br>
financial support to attend a workshop on Bayesian inference, nonparametric
<br>
statistics, and machine learning at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical
<br>
Sciences Institute in North Carolina. One of the most popular academic
<br>
conferences on the interdisciplinary study of the mind, Tucson VII - Toward
<br>
a Science of Consciousness, has accepted his proposal for a talk on the
<br>
ethics of recursive self-improvement in April. He will also speak on
<br>
Artificial General Intelligence ethics at AGIRI's first workshop on moving
<br>
from narrow AI to AGI, and at Stanford Law School on a new problem for
<br>
personhood ethics in light of human enhancement technologies, both in May. 
<br>
<p>* Our organizational identity and website overhaul, after the Summit.

<p>Additional news:
<br>
<p>* Yudkowsky will give a talk on February 24 at the Bay Area Future Salon at
<br>
SAP Labs (attendance ranges from 70-100), to discuss the implications of
<br>
recursive self-improvement for Friendly AI implementation, and the unique
<br>
theoretical challenge that recursive self-improvement poses.
