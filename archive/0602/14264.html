<p>That is the great thing about science - it does not rely on whether claims 
<br>
seem true, but on evidence indicating they correspond well with reality. The 
<br>
literature clearly supports my post - if you are skeptical then go check it 
<br>
out. When the choice is between anecdotal evidence and scientific result, 
<br>
I'll go with science every time.
<br>
<p>In regard to your anecdotes about immigrants' difficulty with English... It 
<br>
has been found that several factors (in addition to time and effort) 
<br>
influence success for adults learning a second language.  They are: 
<br>
intelligence, motivation, anxiety and self-confidence, and specific aptitude 
<br>
for language learning.
<br>
<p>Anecdotes aside, one would expect adults to have an easier time learning a 
<br>
language than children as they have a greater ability to organize their 
<br>
learning, already have another language to draw analogies with, and the 
<br>
ability to use a dictionary. Adults can use their greater experience to 
<br>
advantage.
<br>
<p>This will also be true for many types of AGI: greater experience will be 
<br>
strongly correlated with greater learning abilities.
