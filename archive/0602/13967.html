<p>Moot?  As in irrelavent?  I don't see how.  There will always (I sincerely 
<br>
hope) be differences and potential differences between species and within 
<br>
species, in regards to intelligence, goals and many other attributes. 
<br>
Dealing with such differences is something humanity already handles in 
<br>
various ways (eg: laws, social norms).  I don't see this speculation 
<br>
becoming moot in anything but a distopia of eternal sameness.

</em><br>
<p>This might be true if a Lamarckian process was an accurate model of some 
<br>
process in the world.  But, so far, no such process exists.  Are you 
<br>
suggesting one will come into being and apply universally to all &quot;humans, 
<br>
animals, or rocks&quot;?

<p><p><em>&gt; Post-biological intelligences may retain vestiges of

<p>Agree.  We may.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; but that will ultimately be of no real consequence

<p>On what do you base this prognostication?  And what did you mean when you 
<br>
wrote 'mode of cognitive being'?
