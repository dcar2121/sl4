</em><br>
<p>I can't properly respond to this without going into greater length than 
<br>
I can afford right now.  On the approach I am presently taking, 
<br>
information about the external world would mix into the AI's cognitive 
<br>
dynamics, but that extra complexity would still orthogonalize out of the 
<br>
Friendly invariant that got verified.  Only the nature of the mix, the 
<br>
structure of how the mix happened, would be part of what was verified as 
<br>
the Friendly invariant.  The AI would prove about itself that its future 
<br>
self would keep following a certain specification of mixing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; A cellular automaton could give rise to a whole universe full of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but it cannot do so within a brief period of time.
</em><br>
<p>You don't actually know that.  You have not checked all simple CAs.  I 
<br>
agree with your intuition, mind you, but it is not a known fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I conjecture that one would need to build a system with a pretty high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic information...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but what you are alluding to is an intelligence process that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like AIXItl or evolutionary learning in that it is a simple algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carrying out a sort of semi-exhaustive, heuristically-guided program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space search.
</em><br>
<p>I am alluding to a core that is a properly structured full intelligence. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't throw brute force at problems I don't understand.  Neither do 
<br>
I say, &quot;I bet this requires a lot of algorithmic complexity and highly 
<br>
specialized components.&quot;  When I run into something I don't understand, 
<br>
I keep gnawing away until it ceases to be a mystery unto me.  Then, 
<br>
generally speaking, the resolved mystery turns out not to require 
<br>
massive amounts of hardware, massive amounts of specialized code, 
<br>
massive amounts of knowledge, or any of the other things that people 
<br>
imagine being necessary when they run into a problem that *feels* 
<br>
extremely difficult because they have no idea or very vague ideas of how 
<br>
it works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that AGI's need to have this aspect, but they also need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole bunch of more specialized and space-intensive code, in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their intelligent behavior may have reasonable time-complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of your comments are addressing the issue of tradeoffs between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space and time complexity, which I believe are conceptually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental.
</em><br>
<p>Your objection rests upon personal conjectures which are not known 
<br>
mathematical results and which I do not share.  I think there can be a 
<br>
core of bounded algorithmic complexity which decompresses itself into a 
<br>
powerful AI in reasonable time.  If you think this requires vast amounts 
<br>
of additional startout complexity to run in reasonable time, you could 
<br>
be right, but I would be surprised.  And even so it would only present a 
<br>
problem for FAI if you couldn't run the optimized algorithms through a 
<br>
core checker simple enough to be reliable.  I will cross that bridge 
<br>
only if I must come to it.
<br>
<p>Don't forget to identify which parts of your argument are math and which 
<br>
parts are your personal intuition; I wouldn't want people to think there 
<br>
was a known mathematical problem with FAI.  Please remember that others 
<br>
may not trust your intuitions as much as you do.
