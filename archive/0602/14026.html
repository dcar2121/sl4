<em>&gt;It's possible to talk about, but it takes a major, *cooperative* effort, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from people who genuinely want to avoid having the conversation degenerate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into politics,
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a Meta discussion of what politics *is* either here or on some list 
<br>
set up for it might be useful.
<br>
<p>The main tool for building AIs--friendly or otherwise--is human 
<br>
brains/minds that are unavoidably stuck in social primates and have been 
<br>
shaped by an evolutionary history.
<br>
<p>It seems worth the attempt (somewhere) to understand the flaws in the tool 
<br>
and how one might try to get around them.  I am not at all optimistic that 
<br>
understanding the flaws would have a practical use though.  :-(
<br>
<p>Of course even if a group of sharp people came to such an understanding 
<br>
they would have the devils own time spreading out their knowledge to the 
<br>
rest of the social primates who were shaped by evolution *not* to 
<br>
understand certain things about themselves.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You can take the conversation to extropy-chat or wta-talk, depending on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your taste, where it will instantly degenerate into useless shouting.
</em><br>
<p>Attempts at meta level discussion seems to invoke blank incomprehension, or 
<br>
at least no exchanges.  The most I ever had in this area was with Aaron 
<br>
Lynch--who has completely dropped out of sight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I suspect that it is not possible to talk about politics in a grown-up way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without a grown-up moderator independently approving each message which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obeys the spirit and the letter of the rules, denying all others; and I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not willing to put forth this effort for the SL4 mailing list.
</em><br>
<p>You are probably right--given the nature of humans.
