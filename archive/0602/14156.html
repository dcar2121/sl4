Why do we need to influence it during the design process beyond specifying an initial question?  To communicate the design, all it prints out is an engineering blueprint for a really efficient ion thruster or a series of chemical equations leading to a cheapie solar cell.  Anything that looks like it might destabilize the vacuum or create an UFAI, we don't build.  There are many fields of engineering we know enough about to be assured the product effects of a given blueprint won't be harmful.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To significantly reduce most extinction threats, you need to monitor all bio/chemical lab facilities and all computers worldwide.  A means of military/police intervention must be devised to deal with violators too.  Obviously there are risks of initiating WWIII and of introducing tyrants to power if the extinction threat reduction process is goofed.  Obviously an AGI may kill us off.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a volume of probability space where the AGI intends to be unfriendly, yet blueprints some useful product technologies (that we can use for manually reducing extinction risks) before we realize it is trying to kill us and pull its plug.  I also realize this is a recipe for an AGI that can be used to take over the world regardless if it is friendly or not.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer hardware design I was thinking of is here:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/mechano.html">http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/mechano.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it uses mechanical rods and not electricity, the possibility of available AGI magic is reduced.  I wouldn't think such a computer would be on the market for two or three decades.  Unfortunately, 10 paragraphs from the end it is mentioned in addition to heat and phonon waste energy signatures, there are also gravity waves emitted.  I'll be studying diamond rod logic architectures in more detail later.

<p>There is necessarily a user interface if we are using the AI to design systems.

We need to influence it to direct the design process, and it needs to 
<br>
influence us to communicate the designs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And nothing but mechanical

<p>This scenario is effectively equivalent to the standard AI box; the box 
<br>
necessarily has a hole to allow communication between human and AI.
<br>
<p>There is nothing to stop the AI producing a design which convinces the human 
<br>
reading it to release the AI (e.g. by connecting it to the internet). It is 
<br>
difficult to state with certainty there is no such design as the space of 
<br>
possibilities is exponentially huge and humans are knowably imperfect.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, the AI could design a useful machine which looks definitely 
<br>
harmless to a human but in actuality releases the AI. As the space of 
<br>
possibilities is exponentially huge, and as humans have limited ability to 
<br>
predict a design's true effect, a sufficiently smart AI may be able to invent 
<br>
such a design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the AGI is friendly, we lose out on a great deal of its immediate

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unfriendly, we are saved. It doesn't matter how smart an entity is if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jail permits no key.
</em><br>
<p>In any AI boxing scenario humans form a lock, to which any influence the AI has 
<br>
on us (e.g. any time we look at anything it's produced) gives it access. The 
<br>
smarter the entity the better it is at cracking locks.

<p>If successful this wouldn't implement Friendless, as SIAI defines it, but a form

of &quot;safe&quot; usefulness. Such an AI has no protection against humans getting what

<p>Incidentally, which limited set of computer operations?
