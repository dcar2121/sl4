Opps.  Looks like I may have put my foot in my mouth
<br>
again on the Extropy list.
<br>
<p>Look, it's well known I strongly disagree with the
<br>
Sing Inst approach, but Brian Atkins , Eliezer etc
<br>
deserve historical recognition for all their vision
<br>
and hard work.  I apologise for any and all offensive
<br>
remarks about the Singualrity Institute and co.
<br>
<p>Eli did bring some of the bad comments on himself you
<br>
know.  In the old days he and Wilson made remarks
<br>
about many other people that were abusive and
<br>
defamatory.  I really got the impression they'd like
<br>
to shoot all the other AI researchers and hobbyists in
<br>
the world.  I notice they've stopped denouncing
<br>
everyone ele's ideas but I'm not sure there's been any
<br>
real change of heart.
<br>
<p>Any way, it just doesn't pay to argue.  Every one's
<br>
gonna go full steam ahead and do it their own way you
<br>
know, not matter how much time you spend screaming and
<br>
shouting.
<br>
<p>Look, all that stuff about me trying to beat 'em and
<br>
launch an AGI soon was just me crapping of course.  I
<br>
was pissed at their earlier nastiness.  I am NOT in
<br>
fact EVER going to try launching my own AGI.  Like I
<br>
said earlier on the list, I'm not really crazy you
<br>
know.
<br>
<p>Any way, I'm exhausted and shattered from thinking
<br>
about all the AGI stuff.  Way way way way too hard.  I
<br>
had no idea.  Sado-Masochism really man.  Will give it
<br>
a rest and move on to something else.  My advise to
<br>
other hobbyists thinking about giving it a go:  Just
<br>
forget it.  Like I said, I'm bowing out for the
<br>
present.
<br>
<p>See ya round.
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;Till shade is gone, till water is gone, into the shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder’s eye on the last day”
