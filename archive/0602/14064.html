<em>&gt; &gt; Singularitarian goals also require faith, IMO.  It's two sides of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same coin - the human coin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the great thing about a free society; everyone is entitled to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own opinion, no matter how wrong.
</em><br>
<p>For my part, I'm a big flip-flopper on issues of faith and the
<br>
possiblity of 'higher power'. universal conciousness?
<br>
inter-dimensional gaia? unified quantum wave-front?  post-singularity
<br>
xeno-beings playing god with us? Eh but I know full well I'm just a
<br>
stinking carcass waiting to happen. Thing is, I've been so damn lucky
<br>
so many times, and seen so many others get hosed, that this faith
<br>
business creeps up on me when I least expect it.
<br>
<p>- but this is the position I take on religion (and a bunch of other issues):
<br>
<p>agressively in oppostion, in order to balance the playing field. I
<br>
seem to see science and technology forever being sidelined by
<br>
dominating forces: be they politics, religion or business (global
<br>
warming is an example of science telling us what we need to know and
<br>
it's voice being ignored - however religious folks are firmly on
<br>
science's side in this one I think).
<br>
<p>my 'aggressive in opposition' approach is like 'affirmative action'
<br>
for science; I don't believe equal rights would have gotten anywhere
<br>
without militant feminists, and I don't believe technology enthusiasts
<br>
will get anywhere without militant rationalists; rational (liberal)
<br>
thought is just too wishy-washy. (to qualify the washiness moniker,
<br>
compare the mob-chant characteristics of  'respect the cultural
<br>
heritage of others in order to foster a mutually harmonious society'
<br>
versus 'fuck the niggers')
<br>
<p>The idea is that society is dominated by non-rational forces; fear
<br>
stoked by a go-with-what-rates media, a go-with-what-polls leadership,
<br>
that kind of thing. To get to a  halfway-point where both faith and
<br>
rationailty are accorded equal measure, we can't promote the equal
<br>
measure as the deal we seek; if we do so we'll end up compromising to
<br>
halfway between what we want and what we have, which means a quarter
<br>
rational versus three-quarters not; still no balance, and a continued
<br>
marginalization of critical thinking.
<br>
<p>By fighting for 100% rationality, the dickering process should
<br>
hopefully playout to 50/50 rationalism/faith, which is OK with me.
<br>
People seem to object to 'Darwins Rottweiler' as being too extreme,
<br>
but I think 'Fundamentalist Futurists' are exactly what is needed.
<br>
<p>Militant rationalism people - Can we get a poster of 'Uncle Eliezer
<br>
wants YOU!' pointing at us? :-)
