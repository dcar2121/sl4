</em><br>

<em>&gt; The hypothesis that humans lose the ability to easily absorb languages as we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The difficulty younger children have in acquiring language is often
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily for the similar investment of time and effort.
</em><br>
<p>What I vaguely remember and was refering too was the age of around 9 being the
<br>
optimal time to learn a language. Is this wrong?
<br>
<p>Wikipedia would suggest otherwise. That at keeping the ability to
<br>
learn a language later on requires learning a language early on.

<br>
<p>&quot;However, there exists emerging evidence of both innateness of
<br>
language and the &quot;Critical Period Hypothesis&quot; from the deaf population
<br>
of Nicaragua. Until approximately 1986, Nicaragua had neither
<br>
education nor a formalized sign language for the deaf. As Nicaraguans
<br>
attempted to rectify the situation, they discovered that children past
<br>
a certain age had difficulty learning any language. Additionally, the
<br>
adults observed that the younger children were using gestures unknown
<br>
to them to communicate with each other. They invited Judy Kegl, an
<br>
American linguist from MIT, to help unravel this mystery. Kegl
<br>
discovered that these children had developed their own, distinct,
<br>
Nicaraguan Sign Language with its own rules of &quot;sign-phonology&quot; and
<br>
syntax. She also discovered some 300 adults who, despite being raised
<br>
in otherwise healthy environments, had never acquired language, and
<br>
turned out to be incapable of learning language in any meaningful
<br>
sense. While it was possible to teach vocabulary, these individuals
<br>
seem to be unable to learn syntax.&quot;
