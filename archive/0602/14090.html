<p>
First, you've been rather eloquent in defending this point. I still stand
<br>
where I did, but I'll think further on it.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Michael Vassar&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:michaelvassar@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Faith-based%20thought%20vs%20thinkers">michaelvassar@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Truly bizarre.  You assert that you believe knowledge is *always*
</em><br>
preferable
<br>
<em>&gt; to happiness, and support it with a datum showing that knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *sometimes* preferable to happiness, e.g. in the volcano example.
</em><br>
<p>I'd agree with you except for the qualifier &quot;sometimes&quot;. I'd say knowledge
<br>
is most often good, and when it conflicts with happiness it is still often
<br>
preferable. I didn't choose that example as proof, just as illustration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is in fact a trivial consequence of game theory that knowledge can make
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; group of individuals worse off in net, or that an individual's knowledge
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; often more costly to others than it is beneficial to himself.
</em><br>
<p>I can see the second point easily enough, not sure about the first. Part of
<br>
the disagreement is rooted in my beliefs about knowledge as inherently
<br>
desireable, I suppose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the supposed dysfunction of the 6 billion or so humans who can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made unhappy by having knowledge (Technically, what else *could* someone
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; made unhappy by.  People are information, their unhappiness is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, and is in fact, among other things, the knowledge that they
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; unhappy) so what?  Declaring people to be dysfunctional because they fail
</em><br>
to
<br>
<p>Sure, people are information, everything is, or at least it looks that way
<br>
to me. Knowledge is not exactly information though, it is information that
<br>
represents something external. That the Sun is an AU away from Earth is
<br>
knowledge, that I am enjoying myself is part of my internal state. That the
<br>
Sun is 2 AU away from Earth is information, but not knowledge, it does not
<br>
represent an external truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; meet certain standards that you set for them is definitely not humane.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me to be more like the vindictive preference of one of
</em><br>
evolution's
<br>
<em>&gt; creations that the environment should impose selective stresses which he
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; atypically well equipped to handle, not unlike the hope that a strong man
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; a tribe might hold that wars and wild beasts will come and enable him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translate his strength into status and differential survival relative to
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt; weaker peers.
</em><br>
<p>I could always say that I don't think that's the case, that my ability or
<br>
presumed ability to deal with knowledge other people might find troublesome
<br>
has nothing to do with this view of mine, but you could always answer that
<br>
it might affect my way of thinking about the issue, and I suppose it might,
<br>
so I can't answer this objection effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A culturally benighted person, prehaps from an Islamic country, could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made worse off by knowing that his daughter is not a virgin. (honor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killings)
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but in the context of more knowledge this person would know that their
<br>
cultural standards are bogus, and that the virginity of their daughter is of
<br>
little importance. Limited knowledge isn't necessarily good, that much I
<br>
agree with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A sensitive, philosophical Westerner of Christian background, IQ 125, high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; openness, and high neuroticism could be made a great deal worse off by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing that there is no reason to believe in his mythology (existential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispair possibly leading to clinical depression).
</em><br>
<p>And thereby write some interesting Kierkegaard style philosophy of some
<br>
value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can be saddened by your cursory familiarity with thermodynamics (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little knowledge is a dangerous thing, learn it for real, with the math,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; I think you will feel better), but appearently not by the Scylla and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charybdis of chaos and determinism which one must also pass before
</em><br>
becoming
<br>
<em>&gt; comfortable with GAI.
</em><br>
<p>I can't say that my knowledge of thermodynamics is a lot more than cursory,
<br>
but I'd imagine the inevitable cessation of subjective experience in a
<br>
global scale would make some people rather unhappy. Insofar as the maths
<br>
point at this, I don't think there's much need to understand more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Michael Wilson could hypothetically find himself in a situation where very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent people very badly want him to program a seed AI for them before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendlyness theory is complete.  In such a situation he would not be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to comply with their wishes, and would be made worse off by knowing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of what his friends and family were experiencing as a result.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about this. Knowing that one's family is being hurt can make
<br>
one unhappy, but not knowing what happens to them can do so too. Also,
<br>
arguably seing the way his family is hurt would advice him of the ethical
<br>
level of those people and help him choose for better utility not to
<br>
cooperate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each of these scenarios involves people falling along a continuum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing mental resiliance, but ultimately I believe that they differ by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree, not by kind.  A FAI would not suffer in any of these situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it cannot suffer and is not a person, but I would be deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptical of any supposedly Friendly output which rapidly lead to people
</em><br>
who
<br>
<em>&gt; were not vulnerable to the fourth scenario.  (ignoring issues of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invulnerability due to the implausibility of the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-singularity).
</em><br>
<p>So, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that you would consider the
<br>
ability to detach our happiness from outcomes to others Unfriendly. This is
<br>
to say, that breaking of empathy, or conferring control to a subject of what
<br>
makes them happy, or their emotional attachments, would be Unfriendly. I
<br>
disagree here.
<br>
<p>As I said before, though, you've raised good points, and I'll think further
<br>
on this.
<br>
<p>--David.
