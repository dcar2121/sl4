<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Determining friendiness may be as hard as determining whether a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; program halts.  I don't know.  Why would friendliness imply that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; program halts?  I don't see any connection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No? If a program doesn't halt it doesn't output (in the classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; formulation of halting). If it doesn't output it doesn't do anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most definitions of friendliness definitely imply that programs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supposed to do something. This may be non-obvious, because as  Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Loosemore we tend to think of AI programs as being infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outputting, so it might be clearer if I talked about whether a program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hangs or not rather than halts. However this discussion with you is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consuming the time that I can devote to that endeavour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an interesting way of interpreting the formalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, think of the application.  Any competent AI, friendly or not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be a non-halting program.  If you consider only halting programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of how you define &quot;output&quot;, you have defined away the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting part of the problem.  You can't say that you're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow reify all of the outputs produced by an AI over time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interacting with its environment into one single output, and then make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it halt.
</em><br>
<p>The approach I am going to take would be change the problem into an
<br>
equivalent non-hanging problem.
<br>
<p>while (1)
<br>
{
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;output = performFunction(input)
<br>
}
<br>
<p>Where output and input are variables connected to effectors and effectors.
<br>
<p>If performFunction halts on all inputs then the system never hangs. 
<br>
So if we can prove that the system will never hang then we can prove
<br>
that performFunction will never halt.
<br>
<p>Veronica Becher has apparently done some work towards this sort of
<br>
problem but I can't find a reference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know how to address the problem of applying this sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis to programs that accept input from the environment as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run, particularly input whose values are conditional on the prior acts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (outputs) of the program.
</em><br>
<p>The method I outlined above can cope with this but can't cope with
<br>
programs that store previous inputs. Proof systems don't tend to have
<br>
inputs, or if they do they are generally considered oracles for
<br>
uncomputable values so this may or may not be a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As all the bits of the Omega Series have no relation to each other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are random so the shortest way of storing them is the direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information. And so because it is as hard or harder to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friendliness Phi must be equally random.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A proof system and axioms is a way of storing information about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world, we shall call a starting program with embedded proof system and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; axioms S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How many other programs can S prove the friendliness of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have said the bound on the number of programs a proof system can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have knowledge that they are friendly is the number of bits in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Otherwise it has found some hidden relation between the bits of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phi so that it can be compressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, you're assuming, in advance, that there is no such thing as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; proof system, but that instead, all the bits of Phi must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; enumerated.  A proof system is generative, and a proof system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; finite size can prove, for example, that an infinite number of numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are either prime or not prime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This has no bearing on determining properties of strings that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interpreted as programs. Primeness of a finite string can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determined in finite time by a finite algorithm. Halting, and I argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friendliness, cannot be. I would advise you to read some Chaitin if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you haven't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes it does.  As I understand it, you have essentially said that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program of length S can tell you only whether S different programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halt or not, because there's no way of testing for halting, so really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;program&quot; is just a lookup table.  Hence, a program of S can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell you only whether S different programs halt or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that what you're saying boils down to that Friendliness is undecidable.
</em><br>
<p>Did I not say that when I said that determining friendliness is as
<br>
hard or harder than determining whether a program halts?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you restate what exactly you're trying to prove?
</em><br>
<p>I am attempting to find the limits of what a formal proof system can
<br>
transform itself into whilst trying to maintain an undecidable
<br>
property. In this case friendliness. I am interested in things that
<br>
change the system in meaningful ways, hence why transforming itself
<br>
into an infinite number of systems that do the same thing is
<br>
uninteresting.
<br>
<p>What I have said previously is my first attempt at doing so.
<br>
<p>What I am saying has nothing to do with systems that experiment such
<br>
as GP or OOPS however GP and OOPS do not completely self-modify, in
<br>
the sense of a SeedAI, but it would be relevant to the Goedel Machine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is known about probabilistic approaches to undecidable problems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it possible to probabilistically solve the halting problem - that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, let us say, to be able to create a program that estimates whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any given program halts, where a measure of error per guess of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions can be made arbitrarily low?
</em><br>
<p>Not that I know of. These are my thoughts on the subject.
<br>
<p>The Probabilistic approach gains you little. If you start
<br>
experimenting then you are evaluating machines and not strings and so
<br>
undecidability is not the same. Without experimentation there is no
<br>
way to update your prior. So only the amount of information your prior
<br>
held would be relevant.
<br>
<p>With experimentation, by definition the bits of omega or equivalent
<br>
number are random, so knowing one bit will have no bearing on the
<br>
others so I wouldn't expect any improvement. Unless of course you
<br>
expect improvement on predicting which face of a die the next roll
<br>
would give, given the previous rolls. You can get better at knowing
<br>
the probability an arbitrary program will halt or not, by getting
<br>
better approximations of Omega (the number this time). But this
<br>
doesn't help much because this doesn't give you any better information
<br>
on which program to self-modify to.
<br>
<p>AIXI which has the sort of bounds on error you want, only works on
<br>
computable sequences.
