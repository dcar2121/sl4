Hi,

<em>&gt; I don't see Rice's Theorem as directly relevant here, because it

</em><br>

</em><br>
In the example given, the AI output a piece of source code.  Being able to
<br>
check whether this arbitrary piece of source code is Friendly is something
<br>
that Rice's theorem says you cannot do.  It definitely applies here.
<br>
It *does* describe &quot;the quality of probabilistic reasoning achievable by
<br>
practical intelligent systems under realistic resource limitation&quot; because
<br>
that's a special case of computer programs in general.
<br>
<p>In order for it not to apply, the piece of code must not to be arbitrary.
<br>
Not being arbitrary means that we have more usefull information.  For
<br>
example, a log of deductions the AI performed in order to reach its concusion
<br>
(in this case, a piece of code) would definitly be usefull.
<br>
<p>If the piece of information given is not a string of deductions, it must be
<br>
something which can be translated into such a string of deductions at a
<br>
reasonably low cost.  Otherwise, the verifier must go proof hunting, which is
<br>
expencive, if not down right impossible in principle
<br>
(In the case of the AI quining itself it must produce a theorem about a piece
<br>
&nbsp;of code.  The only thing that makes the code non-arbitrary is the
<br>
&nbsp;information given, and therefore the information must yield the proof.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To put it less formally, we'd be giving our Friendliness module the use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a genie which is somewhat unreliable and whose reliability in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular decision is, for all intents and purposes, difficult to check.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True
</em><br>
Right.  Doesn't this stike you as dangerous?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Knowledge of the AI proper's decision is not sufficient here.  The Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; module would also need the reasoning behind the decision in order to verify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have not demonstrated this statement or even argued for it, you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just stated it...
</em><br>
See above.  The log of deductions is what I meant by &quot;the reasoning behind it.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, if the AI proper has a non-verifiable architecture, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge may only exist in a crippled form, or, in extreme cases like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary programming, not at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea that evolutionary programming is somehow &quot;nontraceable&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its production of results is a misconception.  Ev. prog. is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterministic algorithm and if the intermediate steps in the evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process are logged, then it is perfectly possible to mine these logs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and understand why a given answer was arrived at.  In fact, mining and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyzing such logs (albeit usually in relatively simplistic ways) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the principle underlying Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important subfield of ev. prog. today.
</em><br>
<p>I never said evolutionary programming was &quot;nontraceable&quot;.  What I said was
<br>
&quot;nonverifiable&quot;.  I am not splitting hairs, as these are completely different
<br>
things.  No program is nontraceable!  You can just emulate the CPU and
<br>
observe the contents of the registers and memory at any point in time.  With
<br>
that said though, you can probably see why this sort of traceability is not
<br>
good enough.  What needs to be traceable is not the how the bits were
<br>
shuffled but how the conclusion reached was justified.
<br>
<p>In the case of evolutionary programming, it should be clear we have the
<br>
former type of traceablity but not the latter type.  Mining Evolutionary
<br>
Programming's population logs will never give you a why.  The only why
<br>
evolution ever gives us is &quot;it worked when I tried it.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The only rescue from this mess is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make the &quot;Friendliness module&quot; smarter than the so-called AI itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) you have not demonstrated this or even argued for it, just stated it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) I don't know how you are defining &quot;smarter than&quot; in this statement...
</em><br>
Let me explain what I meant here.
<br>
<p>What I meant was that when B proposes an action, A can either verify that B
<br>
did the correct thing or point out a flaw in B's choice.
<br>
<p>The statment above is sufficient but not necessary to show that A is smarter
<br>
than B, in the colloquial sence of the phrase.
<br>
<p>To illustrate, suppose Alice is helping Bob play chess.  Whenever Bob
<br>
suggests a move, she always says something like &quot;I agree with your move&quot; or
<br>
&quot;Yikes!  If you go there, he'll fork your rooks in two moves! You overlooked
<br>
this move here.&quot; If she can always do this, it should be absolutely clear
<br>
that Alice is a better chess player than Bob.
<br>
<p>This is why the Friendliness Module must be smarter than the AI itself.
<br>
<p>However, suppose instead that whenever Bob suggests a move, he gives Alice
<br>
a pain-staking blow by blow explanation of why he did it starting from
<br>
propositions about chess that they both agree on (some of which can be
<br>
probabilistic statements, to avoid a brute force search.) This time
<br>
though, Alice doesn't have to be a chess pro to say whether Bob reasoned
<br>
correctly.  She just has to say either &quot;proof succeed&quot; or &quot;parse error on
<br>
line &lt;number&gt;&quot;.  Alice might well be a relatively simple computer program
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>I hope I've clarified things sufficiently.
