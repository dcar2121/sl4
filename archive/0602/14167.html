</em><br>
<p>You weren't making wrong moves that you could understand were wrong
<br>
with your limited-depth, shallow-search knowledge of the board
<br>
position, but that he could plainly see were wrong with his
<br>
expandend-depth knowledge of the board. His moves may have been
<br>
inscrutable (while not obviously bad) to you, but that doesn't mean
<br>
they weren't brilliant, at least compared to your less capable
<br>
playing. So, in a sense, you *were* making wrong moves, and he *was*
<br>
making brilliant moves.
<br>
<p>Or, did you mean, you weren't making blunders (isolated moves of much
<br>
lower quality than average), and he wasn't making isolated, especially
<br>
good moves?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point is that an advanced AI will be planning and producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schemes that we have no chance of understanding. We will see the moves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that won't help much.
</em><br>
<p>We'll see the actions, but we won't know how they could possibly fit
<br>
into a larger plan. Indeed, if we were told the plan we might not even
<br>
be able to keep it all in our heads at once, let alone begin to
<br>
understand it.
<br>
<p>I do think, though, that the experience of being good at chess, of
<br>
being able to win consistently against other knowledgable players, and
<br>
then playing someone much better than you, who squeezes your position
<br>
quickly and inexorably, and who has a tactical trap around every
<br>
corner, and who can beat you consistently by the midgame, is probably
<br>
something that induces the same sort of attitude we ought to take
<br>
towards a superintelligence, only much more so. Chess has a closed
<br>
search space, unlike real life. In real life, rules are provisional,
<br>
and &quot;breaking the rules&quot; just means discovering and exploiting holes
<br>
in your opponent's knowledge of reality.
<br>
<p>And, yes, we should be careful with our chess metaphors.
