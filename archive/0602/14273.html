<p><em>&gt; &gt; Determining friendiness may be as hard as determining whether a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; No? If a program doesn't halt it doesn't output (in the classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation of halting). If it doesn't output it doesn't do anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most definitions of friendliness definitely imply that programs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to do something. This may be non-obvious, because as  Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Loosemore we tend to think of AI programs as being infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outputting, so it might be clearer if I talked about whether a program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hangs or not rather than halts. However this discussion with you is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consuming the time that I can devote to that endeavour.
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting way of interpreting the formalism.
<br>
However, think of the application.  Any competent AI, friendly or not,
<br>
will be a non-halting program.  If you consider only halting programs
<br>
because of how you define &quot;output&quot;, you have defined away the
<br>
interesting part of the problem.  You can't say that you're going to
<br>
somehow reify all of the outputs produced by an AI over time
<br>
interacting with its environment into one single output, and then make
<br>
it halt.
<br>
<p>I don't know how to address the problem of applying this sort of
<br>
analysis to programs that accept input from the environment as they
<br>
run, particularly input whose values are conditional on the prior acts
<br>
(outputs) of the program.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As all the bits of the Omega Series have no relation to each other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are random so the shortest way of storing them is the direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; information. And so because it is as hard or harder to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; friendliness Phi must be equally random.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A proof system and axioms is a way of storing information about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; world, we shall call a starting program with embedded proof system and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; axioms S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How many other programs can S prove the friendliness of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have said the bound on the number of programs a proof system can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; have knowledge that they are friendly is the number of bits in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Otherwise it has found some hidden relation between the bits of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Phi so that it can be compressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, you're assuming, in advance, that there is no such thing as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proof system, but that instead, all the bits of Phi must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enumerated.  A proof system is generative, and a proof system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; finite size can prove, for example, that an infinite number of numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are either prime or not prime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has no bearing on determining properties of strings that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted as programs. Primeness of a finite string can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined in finite time by a finite algorithm. Halting, and I argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendliness, cannot be. I would advise you to read some Chaitin if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you haven't.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it does.  As I understand it, you have essentially said that a
<br>
program of length S can tell you only whether S different programs
<br>
halt or not, because there's no way of testing for halting, so really
<br>
the &quot;program&quot; is just a lookup table.  Hence, a program of S can also
<br>
tell you only whether S different programs halt or not.
<br>
<p>It seems that what you're saying boils down to that Friendliness is undecidable.
<br>
<p>Can you restate what exactly you're trying to prove?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This was distinctly beyond the scope of what I was arguing. It is fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method if you accept that this has an arbitrary chance of having your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program hang or never halt as it replaces itself with new ones. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give you a brief argument, if it can be shown that your heuristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly assigns over 50% chance of halting to those programs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halt and under 50% for those that don't halt for more programs than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its length, then it would lead to violation of the limits of knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega. If we can't or don't show this link then the correspondence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the heuristic with reality is arbitrary.
</em><br>
<p>What is known about probabilistic approaches to undecidable problems? 
<br>
Is it possible to probabilistically solve the halting problem - that
<br>
is, let us say, to be able to create a program that estimates whether
<br>
any given program halts, where a measure of error per guess of its
<br>
predictions can be made arbitrarily low?
