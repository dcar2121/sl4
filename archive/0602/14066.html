<em>&gt;P.C. Hodgell said: &quot;That which can be destroyed by the truth should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be.&quot; I have never heard a declaration of rationality which is both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simpler and better than this.
</em><br>
<p>That quote seems to me to be an appealing one for people who are more able 
<br>
to endure unpleasent truths than their contemporaries, but it is not a 
<br>
humane preference.  That people can be made unhappy by correct knowledge as 
<br>
well as by incorrect is a classic literary theme, and obviously one with at 
<br>
least some truth behind it.  Even relatively rational people might want to 
<br>
know neither their opponent's poler hand nor the time of their future 
<br>
inevitable death, and for the bulk of humanity even a spouses's extramarital 
<br>
attractions or the mythologized status of a historical hero can be painful 
<br>
with little attendant benefit.  I would be extremely reluctant to accept a 
<br>
singularity that eliminated people's right to ignorance as &quot;Friendly&quot; or 
<br>
that incautiously embraced the preferences of a person's extrapolated 
<br>
informed self and forced that person to live with the choices implied by 
<br>
those preferences.
