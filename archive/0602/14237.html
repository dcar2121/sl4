<p>What you are really saying is that we have no way of
<br>
measuring utility, since dollars are our only numeric
<br>
way of measuring it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;$600K invested at 6% real return yields a more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimum-wage lifestyle for you and a stream of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descendants or family members.  The accumulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stream of happiness (not having to work at a job)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually would be enough to exceed the cost.
</em><br>
<p>I think most lottery winnings are paid in installments, not as a lump
<br>
sum, so the person can't invest that million dollars.  (In other
<br>
words, the person told that they've won a million dollars has really
<br>
won something closer to, I don't know, $250,000 (before taxes).)
<br>
<p>More to the point, this argument ignores the fact that
<br>
the dollars spent on lottery tickets also would have
<br>
yielded interest.  If we can measure utility in dollars,
<br>
and my expected number of dollars after an action
<br>
is lower than my expected number without that action,
<br>
then the expected utility after accruing interest is
<br>
still lower.  If we can't measure utility in dollars,
<br>
you can appeal to the thrill of gambling, but you
<br>
can't appeal to the accrued interest on dollars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real reasons people buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lottery tickets is (a) they derive positive mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings from the hope of winning and the excitement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of watching the results, and (b) humans are bad at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimating the probability of low probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events.
</em><br>
<p>This is the usual explanation given - people are stupid.  I have just
<br>
presented an explanation of how buying lottery tickets and becoming
<br>
addicted to crack may be rational actions.  My explanation lets us
<br>
understand crack addiction in terms of economic theory, and hence lets
<br>
us know how to reduce crack addiction, whereas the &quot;people are stupid&quot;
<br>
theory does not.
