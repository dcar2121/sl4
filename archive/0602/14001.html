<p>
&nbsp;Nineteenth Century Socialist
<br>
<em>&gt; philosophers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly thought they had a firm _scientific_ basis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong. How can we be sure that we are different?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joshua
</em><br>
<p>Friedrich Engels wrote &quot;Socialism, Utopian and
<br>
Scientific&quot; in 1880.  It became, along with the
<br>
&quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;, the most influential popular
<br>
presentation of the Marxist position in the late
<br>
19th century.  In it he states that socialism became
<br>
a science with two discoveries attributed to Marx.
<br>
<p>The first is that history can be explained by the
<br>
economic relations between classes which derive
<br>
from the technical means of production.  The second
<br>
is that capitalism functions by paying workers less
<br>
than the full value of their labor.
<br>
<p>We consider a theory scientific if it explains
<br>
historical observations and makes correct predictions
<br>
of future observations.  The above 'discoveries'
<br>
are of the nature of observations.  They are not
<br>
in a form that we can use to test them against
<br>
past and future observations.
<br>
<p>So while Engels thought there was a scientific basis
<br>
for socialism, we would not consider it so.
<br>
<p>Ludvig von Mises, in his &quot;Human Action&quot; (1949)
<br>
proposed a theory of human action.  It states that
<br>
humans do things because they are not perfectly
<br>
satisfied.  What they do at any given moment is
<br>
determined by what they think will give them the
<br>
most increase in satisfaction.  Different people,
<br>
or the same person at different times, have
<br>
differing expected increments of satisfaction
<br>
from various activities.  These are caused by
<br>
differences in inclinations, physical circumstances,
<br>
experience, etc.  Thus we don't all do the same 
<br>
things or individually the same thing all the time.
<br>
<p>This theory is testable in that you can look for
<br>
counterexamples (people who act against their
<br>
expected satisfaction) and do experiments.  It
<br>
is thus a scientific theory.
<br>
<p>Different people on this list have different ideas
<br>
about the Singularity, so I am only talking about
<br>
my own here.  That there is a time of fastest
<br>
technological change is a mathematical certainty.
<br>
Whatever you use to graph level of technology, 
<br>
somewhere on the graph it will have maximum positive
<br>
slope.
<br>
<p>Whether that time of fastest change, which is what
<br>
I call the Singularity, is still in the future, and
<br>
whether it involves rapidly self-improving AI, is
<br>
in my mind open to debate.
