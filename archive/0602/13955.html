<em>&gt; One problem with most experimental languages is that they arn't compiled,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say C++ because the inline methods/functions give you high level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract code that can compile directly down to an instruction or two of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembly. GCC these days is quite good at peeling away the layers of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly the same code that a direct assignment does.
</em><br>
<p>To me this sounds like &quot;premature optimization&quot;.  Almost all of the languages 
<br>
either have or develop an FFI interface that lets one get down to C (not 
<br>
usually C++) code, and developing at a higher lever is much faster.  You can 
<br>
often pay a price in speed of execution, but usually a profiler will let you 
<br>
trace that to small pieces of the code that can then be optimized.  (One of 
<br>
the great disappointments that I had with Pyrex is that even though it links 
<br>
Python and C in a very nice way, it was specifically announced that the 
<br>
developer had no intention in using this to create optimized code.  So you 
<br>
still need to optimize in C and then link it into Python.)  What I'm 
<br>
currently experimenting with is Ruby (in my opinion the nicest of the 
<br>
languages...but SLOW [so you need a faster machine]).  Ruby has a way of 
<br>
embedding C code within it (small chunks only, probably, but that's enough to 
<br>
handle the calls), so when an application gets to the point of optimizing, 
<br>
then you can profile &amp; optimize.  (AFTER checking your algorithms!)
<br>
<p>I've also started wondering about using Apache to handle parallelism.  I 
<br>
haven't looked into the process at all, so this may be totally unreasonable 
<br>
(or have unreasonable overhead), but Apache is noted for handling lots of 
<br>
requests at once with unpredictable synchronization between the requests.  A 
<br>
lot of things can be served over the web, not just html, and the mechanism 
<br>
for dispatching dynamically created web pages could probably be used in lots 
<br>
of other ways (XML is used to represent entire databases...I generally think 
<br>
of this as a bad idea, but it would make a dandy method for communicating 
<br>
between processes that weren't necessarily physically connected...and someone 
<br>
else has already *done* most of the work).
