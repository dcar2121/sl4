</em><br>
<p>But really, all these &quot;null hypotheses&quot; are just BS, right?  I guess
<br>
we all understand that....
<br>
<p>To pick a single counterargument to your argument: If the Singularity
<br>
is totally opaque to us, then why should we assume that probability
<br>
theory (which is ultimately an abstraction from human experience,
<br>
which is very limited in the grand sense) applies to the
<br>
post-Singularity world?
<br>
<p>As a side point: After all, the general applicability of classical
<br>
probability theory is *already* in question even within the human
<br>
world, via Youssef's quantum probability theory...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Singularity is not totally opaque to us because we expect it to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the result of goal-oriented cognition, so we can expect the post-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity world to maximize some utility function.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with this implication, which has merely been stated
<br>
rather than argued for
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a hard time believing that a randomly-selected utility function,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when maximized, could result in human life, because humanity is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex.
</em><br>
<p>And I have a hard time accepting that this kind of reasoning, based on
<br>
human concepts abstracted from humans' limited experience, is
<br>
meaingfully applicable to the post-Singularity domain.
