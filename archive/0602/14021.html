</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very very different from &quot;highly likely&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, I'm not sure the Singularity is highly likely either. I can't put a
<br>
number on it, but the probability that we'll reach it might for all I know
<br>
be either more or less than 50%.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1. De facto world government forms, with the result that progress goes the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We'll put this under &quot;regulation&quot;, then, shall we?
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes; it wouldn't necessarily have to be a single polity like China after the
<br>
Ming Dynasty or Japan under the Tokugawa Shogunate; separate over-regulation
<br>
in a sufficiently large proportion of the countries with an advanced
<br>
industrial base could have the same effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. Continuing population crash renders progress unsustainable. (Continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;progress from a technology base as complex as today's requires very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;populations to be economically feasible.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This could be categorised more generally as a contributing factor to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; severe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic recession.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes. A modern chip factory for example costs several billion dollars, and
<br>
the cost rises with each generation of semiconductors; this sort of
<br>
development is only sustainable with the markets a large, thriving economy
<br>
can provide.
<br>
<p>Similarly (4) - &quot;total catastrophe&quot; - doesn't have to be anything like an
<br>
<em>&gt; existential threat.  Sufficient economic recession will impede
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development, particularly AI development.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yep. A catastrophe such as a major nuclear war or another Dinosaur Killer
<br>
wouldn't wipe us out completely; but it could make recovery slow enough that
<br>
other factors such as the next Ice Age could start applying, resulting in a
<br>
downward spiral from which we never emerged.
<br>
<p>7) Engineering challenges on AGI - a variant on (5) - unforseen limit
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't say.  I don't know that anyone else can reasonably deny with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient knowledge:  There may be impediments that slow the development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI by many many decades.  By this stage, other forms of technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development may be advanced enough so that the &quot;rapid takeoff&quot; element of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI won't have the same disjunctive impact that it would in the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, I don't think hard takeoff is possible, so I think 7 definitely
<br>
applies. I don't see that as a problem though; a slow takeoff Singularity
<br>
could work fine.
