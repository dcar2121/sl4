<p>I see no reason why this is desirable.  It is desirable to improve the 
<br>
veracity of one's knowledge base in ways that accurately mirror external 
<br>
reality, which may increase algorithmic information.  Recursive 
<br>
self-improvement to make your internal algorithms smarter and more 
<br>
efficient at manipulating knowledge about the external world, does not 
<br>
require increasing algorithmic information.  I think you are confusing 
<br>
technical algorithmic complexity with the intuitive sense of complexity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A cellular automaton could give rise to a whole universe full of 
<br>
sentient creatures and superintelligent AIs, while still having almost 
<br>
trivial algorithmic complexity.  An AI can do extraordinarily complex 
<br>
things in the service of its goals, which to humans would look like 
<br>
immense complexity on the surface, without increasing its algorithmic 
<br>
complexity beyond that of the search which looked for good methods to 
<br>
accomplish its goals.  Anything you can do which predictably makes a 
<br>
program better at serving the utility function has no greater 
<br>
*algorithmic* complexity than the criterion you used to decide that the 
<br>
program would be better, even though it may look immensely more complex, 
<br>
and be immensely more efficient.  Like a cellular automaton producing a 
<br>
universe, or natural selection coughing up a human, such a process can 
<br>
produce an AI of vast surface complexity and fine-tuned efficiency 
<br>
without increasing algorithmic complexity in the technical sense.

</em><br>
<p>I don't see why future vastly improved versions need have greater 
<br>
algorithmic information, aside from their improved knowledge base.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, if we imagine - I don't think this way, but it's the sort 
<br>
of thing you keep suggesting - that an outside source presents a 
<br>
Friendly design plus a proof that the design is Friendly; then the AI 
<br>
can verify the proof and the outside Friendly design can have greater 
<br>
algorithmic complexity than the original AI.  The original AI doesn't 
<br>
even need to keep the whole design or the whole proof in RAM, so long as 
<br>
it can keep all the intermediate results necessary to verify that each 
<br>
proof step is valid.
