<p><p>While it may be easier to chant &quot;fuck the honkies&quot;, the two don't cancel
<br>
each other out to produce a non-racist society; all you get is the
<br>
replacement of one form of racism with another, or indeed a society that
<br>
contains aspects of both forms simultaneously.
<br>
<p>Similarly, presenting your crusade as rationality versus faith just tells
<br>
people who have faith in God or whatever that they're being irrational,
<br>
which makes them defensive and angry; and the one time people are _not_
<br>
going to be rational is when they're defensive and angry. Frankly, I don't
<br>
think people like Dawkins are doing the cause of rationality any favors at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>If you want to defeat racism, you shouldn't campaign against white people,
<br>
but against racism. If you want to defeat irrationality, campaigning against
<br>
religion in general is counterproductive; it would be better to campaign
<br>
against irrationality. And I think the best way to do that is to show that
<br>
there is no conflict between having faith in metaphysical concepts like God
<br>
on the one hand, and holding rational beliefs about the world we live in on
<br>
the other.
