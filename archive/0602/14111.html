<em>&gt; The Internet, 94-2005. Not arpanet or bbs's, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usenet-&gt;www-&gt;im/p2p/web2.0. The current usage exceeds one billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens - i.e a 6th of world's population (from:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm</a>. another good page:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://mmogchart.com/">http://mmogchart.com/</a>). From thousands to over a billion users in 12
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years is a fairly hefty technological+cultural shift, I would think.
</em><br>
<p>Remember that I'm speaking only of change in &quot;the West&quot;.
<br>
<p>The Internet is the only great change since 1970.  I believe the Internet
<br>
is the major reason that technological progress has slowed.  This is
<br>
according to Rescher's law of logarithmic progress.
<br>
<p>People have often said that technology is driven by war.
<br>
Actually, if you look at the technological achievements made
<br>
over a timeline, you find fewer advances made during wars.
<br>
This is because, during a war, a society's resources are
<br>
focused into a small number of scientific fields.  Within
<br>
those fields, you get a large number of visible advances -
<br>
jets, radar, bombs, etc.  But the output per dollar /within a field/
<br>
decreases as you invest more resources in it.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the Internet (and now biotech) are sucking up all
<br>
the capital lately.  Advances are made, but the decreasing
<br>
number of inventions per dollar means there are fewer advances
<br>
made than if investment were spread across a wide variety
<br>
of technologies.
<br>
<p>Even given that, the change wrought by the Internet is still
<br>
less than the change brought by many techs in the past -
<br>
the RailNet, the HighwayNet, the Phone Net, the TV Net, for
<br>
example.  Also, the adoption has been slower.  The essential
<br>
technology for building home radios was invented in 1920,
<br>
and half of all US families had a radio by 1929.  The essential
<br>
technology for the internet was invented in 1969.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Science,Engineering,Nanotech, 94-2005. I'm not a super science geek,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a tech nerd, so I can't give an even near fair accout of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realm, but here's a few:  X-Prize. Mars rovers. Carbon composite,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kevlar, Polymers. 45nm chip fab processes. Synthetics - drugs, sugar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textiles. Hubble, Cosmological imaging advances and theory changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Climate modelling. Ever taller towers - Petronas, 101 etc. Huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure projects, especially in Asia. Buckytubes. The latest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triumph sports bike. The stealth fighters/bombers.
</em><br>
<p>This list is, first, inaccurate - almost everything on this list -
<br>
carbon composites, Kevlar, Buckytubes, polymers, synthetic drugs,
<br>
nutrasweet, texttiles, the Hubble, the stealth bomber, tall towers,
<br>
climate modeling - was discoverd, or invented and deployed, before
<br>
1994.  More importantly, it is sad and pathetic compared to a list
<br>
made for the 1920s or 1930s.  The Triumph sports bike?  Please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Medicine,Biotech 94-2005. Again, I'm far from an expert: Researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capturing video from cat's brains. Human genome. Cloning. Biotech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cancer cures. Brain imaging. Transplant advances. everything as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keyhole surgery. RNA interference. Gene therapies. Quadraplegics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling mice via in-brain chips. plastic surgery. drugs for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything - the brain enchancing drugs are a great example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1528069,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1528069,00.html</a>).
</em><br>
<p>Again, almost everything on this list is pre-1994, except the human
<br>
genome, neural implants, and RNAi.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Captain Kirk is still as much a fanstasy now as he was then...
</em><br>
<p>He was never my fantasy.  :)
