If a 'node' of the AGI brain were a web server in one instance, an SQL
<br>
server in another instance, or an embedded API in a cell phone, what
<br>
difference would it make to the overall &quot;thinking&quot; process?
<br>
<p>If we accept that &quot;real-time&quot; to a human-biological brain, &quot;real-time&quot; to a
<br>
human-enhanced brain, and &quot;real-time&quot; to a substrate-independant Jupiter(?)
<br>
brain are all very different scales, then it should not matter who fires the
<br>
most neurons or processes the most simultaneous threads.  What matters (to
<br>
me) is that some new idea is contributed to the pool of humanity's
<br>
knowledge.  Along the way, it will be the developers of AGI that are making
<br>
the contribution.  'Success' will be when the AGI makes its first
<br>
significant contribution.

<em>&gt; &gt; One problem with most experimental languages is that they arn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compiled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or if are don't have the low level access to the machine that C++ does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I say C++ because the inline methods/functions give you high level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abstract code that can compile directly down to an instruction or two of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assembly. GCC these days is quite good at peeling away the layers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abstraction. For example an inline getter/setter method usually produces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exactly the same code that a direct assignment does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me this sounds like &quot;premature optimization&quot;.  Almost all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either have or develop an FFI interface that lets one get down to C (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually C++) code, and developing at a higher lever is much faster.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often pay a price in speed of execution, but usually a profiler will let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trace that to small pieces of the code that can then be optimized.  (One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the great disappointments that I had with Pyrex is that even though it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; links
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Python and C in a very nice way, it was specifically announced that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developer had no intention in using this to create optimized code.  So you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still need to optimize in C and then link it into Python.)  What I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently experimenting with is Ruby (in my opinion the nicest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages...but SLOW [so you need a faster machine]).  Ruby has a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedding C code within it (small chunks only, probably, but that's enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle the calls), so when an application gets to the point of optimizing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you can profile &amp; optimize.  (AFTER checking your algorithms!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've also started wondering about using Apache to handle parallelism.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't looked into the process at all, so this may be totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or have unreasonable overhead), but Apache is noted for handling lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requests at once with unpredictable synchronization between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requests.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of things can be served over the web, not just html, and the mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for dispatching dynamically created web pages could probably be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other ways (XML is used to represent entire databases...I generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this as a bad idea, but it would make a dandy method for communicating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between processes that weren't necessarily physically connected...and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else has already *done* most of the work).
