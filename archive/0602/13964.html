</em><br>
<p><p>George, if you had said &quot;ultimately moot&quot;, I might have accepted that,
<br>
however in a different sense than you intended, but in the immediate future,
<br>
comprehension of ethical issues involving agents with diverse viewpoints and
<br>
capabilities is becoming increasingly relevant in terms of effective social
<br>
decision-making impacting our quality of life and our prospects for
<br>
continued survival and development.
<br>
<p><p>Uplifted intelligences, whether they are
<br>
<em>&gt; descended from humans, animals, or rocks, will, in a Lamarckian process,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly accelerate towards a common fitness peak.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>When you include everything from humans to rocks in your uplift scenario and
<br>
suggest that they develop toward a common state of intelligence, I wonder if
<br>
you have thought deeply about about the role of diversity as a driver of
<br>
development.  While I suspect you envision some form of ultimate
<br>
nirvana-like supreme intelligence, it seems to me that realistically, the
<br>
end state you describe corresponds to equilibrium and stagnation.
<br>
<p>When you speak of a fitness peak, it must be relative to a given
<br>
environment, whether real or virtual.  If &quot;advanced intelligence&quot;
<br>
corresponds with advanced capability to effect desired change within a given
<br>
environment, then I think you might consider that advanced intelligences can
<br>
be expected to differ with regard to their optimization for introspection or
<br>
exploration, service toward a particular cause, or generally expanding and
<br>
exploring branches of the ever widening space of possibilities.
<br>
<p><p>Post-biological
<br>
<em>&gt; intelligences may retain vestiges of their pre-post-biological brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (much like we still retain the reptilian part of our brain), but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will ultimately be of no real consequence as all advanced intelligences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will gravitate towards roughly the same mode of cognitive being.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>What are your thoughts on the tendency of increasing intelligence to develop
<br>
increasingly diverse and creative solutions, in effect broadening the
<br>
possibility space of their &quot;cognitive being&quot;?
