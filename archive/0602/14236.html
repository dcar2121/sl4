<p>I don't think humans are self-improving in a Seed AI sense. It is much
<br>
weaker and probably better thought of as self-specialisation. For
<br>
example during human development we lose our ability to absorb
<br>
languages like sponge early on, so we can devote resources (energy or
<br>
computational) to other processes.
<br>
<p>What the weaker form of self-transformation is, is obviously an open
<br>
question. My theory at the moment say local (rather than the global
<br>
understanding of Seed style transformations), specialised, and bounded
<br>
so that one section of the brain cannot become the mental equivalent
<br>
of cancer if it makes a mistake in the transformation.
<br>
<p>All this means is that we can expect that Seed AI sense
<br>
self-improvement will be of different length to humans.
