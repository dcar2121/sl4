In fact I know of a number of individuals/groups in addition to myself
<br>
who fall into this category (significant progress made toward
<br>
realizing a software implementation whose design has apparent AGI
<br>
potential), though I'm not sure which of them are list members.
<br>
<p>In addition to my Novamente project (www.novamente.net), I would
<br>
mention Steve Omohundro
<br>
<p><a href="http://home.att.net/~om3/selfawaresystems.html">http://home.att.net/~om3/selfawaresystems.html</a>
<br>
<p>(who is working on a self-modifying AI system using his own variant of
<br>
Bayesian learning) and James Rogers with his
<br>
algorithmic-information-theory related AGI design (James is a list
<br>
member, but his work has been kept sufficiently proprietary that I
<br>
can't say much about it).  There are many others as well...
<br>
<p>Based on crude considerations, it would seem SIAI is nowhere near the
<br>
most advanced group on the path toward an AGI implementation.  On the
<br>
other hand, it's of course possible that those of us who are &quot;further
<br>
along&quot; all have wrong ideas (though I doubt it!) and SIAI will come up
<br>
with the right idea in 2008 or whenever and then proceed rapidly
<br>
toward the end goal.

<em>&gt; &gt;===== Original Message From P K &lt;<a href="mailto:kpete1@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Singularity%20Institute:%20Likely%20to%20win%20the%20race%20to%20build%20GAI?">kpete1@hotmail.com</a>&gt; =====

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, I know that they are working on _Friendly_ GAI. But my question is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;What reason is there to think that the Institute has any real chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;winning the race to General Artificial Intelligence of any sort, beating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;out those thousands of very smart GAI researchers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There is no particular reason(s) I can think of that make the Institute more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;likely to develop AGI than any other organization with skilled developers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It's all a fog. The only way to see if their ideas have any merit is to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them out. Also, I suspect their donations would increase if they showed some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proofs of concept. It's all speculative at this point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;As for predicting success or failure, the best calibrated answer is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;predict failure to anyone attempting to build a GAI. You would be right most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the time and wrong probably only once or right all the time (o dear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;heresy).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That doesn't mean it isn't worth trying. By analogy, think of AGI developers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;as individual sperm trying to reach the egg. The odds of any individual are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;incredibly small but the reward is so good it would be a shame not to try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Also, FAI has to be developed only once for all to benefit.
