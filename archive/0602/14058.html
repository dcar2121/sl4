<br>
<p>just thought of this in response to:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe in any religion, new- or old-age, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can find 'significant' dates to fit almost any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you like.
</em><br>
<p>I've had a great time showing this documentary to religious and/or
<br>
spiritual friends/family of  late; make sure you browse for the
<br>
torrent of part two.
<br>
<p>As a list discussion, how does the SIAI community feel about managing
<br>
to pull together around 1000 US members (according to an article
<br>
linked earlier today) as opposed to the Evangelicals pulling ~140
<br>
Million (according to CNN) yankee-doodles?
<br>
<p>What's the ratio of new singularitarians to people born again every
<br>
week - 2 for every 100? every 1000?
<br>
<p>The premise that I seem to finding myself arguing with the spiritual
<br>
sorts is that technology has had and will have a far greater positive
<br>
impact on society than spiritualism and faith ever will.
<br>
<p>And yet, considering that kind of growth in faith belief, the
<br>
technology/transhumanist/singularitarian message obviously stinks. are
<br>
we still going to be able to pull this thing off in a world becoming
<br>
less and less secular?
<br>
<p>Imagine a scenario where not long after the first glimmers of AGI
<br>
start to appear the christian right get up in arms about creating an
<br>
AGI being equivalent to 'playing god' and the whole field ends up
<br>
being the same political lamb that stem cells has become.
<br>
<p>I think maybe in that scenario the nascent AGI work being done could
<br>
be decapitated at the grant budget and the development timeline sent
<br>
into terminal slippage; an AI 'nuclear' winter.
<br>
<p>All very much sci-fi novella-ish, but this is a great scenario for
<br>
development being driven underground, with the consequence of a
<br>
shorter split on the unfriendliness dice-roll...
<br>
<p>summary copy for the link-click challenged:
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Professor Richard Dawkins, Chair of the Public Understanding of
<br>
Science at Oxford and world-renowned evolutionary biologist, is no
<br>
stranger to controversy. His outspoken views on religion and his
<br>
championing of evolutionary theory have earned him the nickname of
<br>
&quot;Darwin's Rottweiler&quot;, an epithet he wears with pride. In this
<br>
controversial two-part series, Dawkins describes God as the most
<br>
unpleasant fictional character of all and launches a wholehearted
<br>
attack on religion as the cause for much of the pain and suffering in
<br>
the world. In the light of overwhelming scientific evidence that shows
<br>
a supreme being cannot exist, and in a world in which religious
<br>
conflict and bigotry are increasingly centre stage, he believes that
<br>
for the good of humanity, religion needs to be challenged and
<br>
dismissed. In this first film, Professor Dawkins confronts the march
<br>
of militant religious belief across the world. In the American &quot;Bible
<br>
Belt&quot;, he meets Ted Haggard, the President of the American National
<br>
Association of Evangelicals, who believes that science will one day
<br>
prove the Bible's Creation story right. In Jerusalem, where the
<br>
terrible certainties of faith began and still rage, he challenges the
<br>
Grand Mufti of Palestine and discusses with Yousef Al Khattab, a
<br>
Jewish settler turned Muslim fundamentalist, the implacable hatreds
<br>
that faith has thrown up in this blighted city. The 21st century,
<br>
Dawkins argues, should be an age of reason but we are threatened by
<br>
those who see unreason as a positive virtue. Faith is an indulgence of
<br>
irrationality that is nourishing extremism, division and terror.
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p>Enjoy this refreshing (and sadly still subversive even in this day and
<br>
age!) examination of the irrationality behind religious faith and of
<br>
the dangerous rise in religious extremism in the 21st century. I guess
<br>
if you're used to the utter stupidity and pablum on the US mainstream
<br>
corporate media, and the ridiculous pandering to the Christian right
<br>
in America, both in the media (CNN actually has a &quot;Faith and Values&quot;
<br>
correspondent now!) and in the political culture, you might find this
<br>
really radical. Definitely NOT coming to a television station near you
<br>
if you live in the US, where instead they would rather air programs
<br>
about hard-hitting subjects such as: Barbara Walters Presents -
<br>
&quot;Heaven: Where Is It? How Do We Get There?&quot;. Richard Dawkins pulls no
<br>
punches here. He is a strict rationalist and he is brutally direct and
<br>
honest about his opinions on religion and its deluded believers. You
<br>
have been warned.
