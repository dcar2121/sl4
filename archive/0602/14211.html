<p>Richard -
<br>
<p>You make a valid point, within the context you intended.
<br>
<p>However, within a broader context of discussion, at least two
<br>
additional points do appear to be significant:
<br>
<p>(1) Any AI capable of interacting effectively with our world would not
<br>
be not fully defined by its own internal code, and especially not its
<br>
seed code, just as any human is not fully defined by its genetic
<br>
legacy.  Development plays a very large role, and is highly dependant
<br>
on the environment.  In a very real sense, there is &quot;intelligence&quot;
<br>
encoded in the environment as a result of long evolutionary processes,
<br>
and this external &quot;intelligence&quot; plays a large role in what we
<br>
perceive as intelligent behavior exhibited by what we perceive as an
<br>
independent agent.
<br>
<p>I have expanded on this in the past, talking about the illusion of a
<br>
discrete Self, but I appreciate that such topics can be seen as &quot;mere
<br>
philosophy&quot; and not applicable to practical AI.
<br>
<p>(2) I do think that a valid comparison can be made between the the
<br>
algorithmic complexity of our genetic code and the algorithmic
<br>
complexity of seed AI code, with the understanding stated in (1)
<br>
above, that development within a given enviroment plays a large role
<br>
in what we come to see as intelligent (and largely heuristic) behavior
<br>
within that environment.
<br>
