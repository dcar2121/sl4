<br>
<em>&gt; Here's a list for 1970-present:
</em><br>
<p>This list looks incredibly whittled down away from reality, Phil.
<br>
You've left out so many great developments, and yet included nonsense
<br>
like &quot;McCarthyism&quot; (you really can't think of equally significant
<br>
instances of blacklisting BS pre-1934 and post-1970?) and &quot;affordable
<br>
air travel&quot; (you really can't think of loads of great technologies
<br>
that became affordable post-1970?) and postmodernism and
<br>
psychoanalysis (both steps *backwards*, not progress) as significant
<br>
in the pre-1970 list.
<br>
<p>Some examples that lead me to the view that your take on this is
<br>
skewed follow, mostly inline with your list, but more in the areas I
<br>
tend to know more about (list-creator bias, as elaborated on a bit
<br>
later in this paragraph). Note that I have *not* done exhaustive
<br>
research on overall technology acceleration/deceleration trends, and
<br>
don't go touting my opinion in either direction. Really, my underlying
<br>
point in responding is not that you're wrong, Phil (though I think you
<br>
probably are); it's that technological, scientific, &amp; cultural
<br>
development has far too many data points for any list created by a
<br>
single person to be useful for showing anything other than that
<br>
person's background knowledge and biases, with some relatively
<br>
negligible randomness injected for the genuine attempt at searching
<br>
through history texts in attempts to create an unbiased list.
<br>
<p>And, further, why all the emphasis on whether or not technology *is*
<br>
accelerating? If a person is enthusiastic about possible future
<br>
technological developments, he or she should *work on or donate to or
<br>
otherwise support* accelerating those developments whether or not the
<br>
trend-without-your-contribution is accelerating or decelerating,
<br>
instead of sitting around debating how fast the
<br>
great-technology-they're-not-helping-advance is or isn't advancing,
<br>
no?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transportation: airline deregulation, Space Shuttle
</em><br>
<p>SpaceShipOne; automated ground vehicle transport (cf., DARPA Grand
<br>
Challenge success); GPS and interactive, real-time map systems in cars
<br>
for the public; commercially viable electric and hybrid cars
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Theory: QED, nanotechnology, global warming
</em><br>
<p>Quantum computation theory; inflationary cosmology; quantum cosmology;
<br>
Fermat's Last Theorem; the Standard Model of Physics (how'd you miss
<br>
this? did you try at ALL to do anything other than validate your
<br>
intuition? wtf?); high-temperature superconductivity; vulnerability of
<br>
the ozone layer discovered; chaos &amp; fractals; de Gennes' polymer &amp;
<br>
liquid crystal theory; SENS; WMAP &amp; COBE; punctuated equilibrium;
<br>
fluid mosaic model of the cell; RNA evolution; prions; proof of the
<br>
Four Color Theorem; non-commutative geometry; polynomial time
<br>
primality testing; Bierbach conjecture; classification of finite
<br>
simple groups
<br>
<p>Also, you attribute string theory to pre-1970, but only the original
<br>
notion was pre-1970 (1968, to be exact). The VAST majority of
<br>
development &amp; discovery in the field is post-1970. Supersymmetry,
<br>
M-theory, D-branes, loop quantum gravity, superstring theory,
<br>
gravitons, etc., are all post-1970.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Invented: high-temperature superconductors, smart materials, quantum wells
</em><br>
<p>Scanning tunnelling microscope; genetic algorithms; field-programmable
<br>
gate arrays; object-oriented design patterns; silicon chips available
<br>
for computer memory; Apple II &amp; IBM PC; Compact Discs; viable
<br>
human-interface silicon chip transponders (Warwick); first use of the
<br>
laser in surgery; videophones; limited sight returned to the blind
<br>
(and in general many brain-computer interface advancements); and
<br>
saying &quot;the Internet&quot; is BS, like saying &quot;physics&quot; and thinking you've
<br>
gone into enough detail -- there are many significant advances in
<br>
internet technology worth enumerating based on the
<br>
level-of-significance you've set down in your list by example; quantum
<br>
computation implementations; DNA computing tech; Bose-Einstein
<br>
condensate synthesized; Jeffreys' genetic fingerprinting.
<br>
<p>Discoveries of interstellar carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen in
<br>
space. Reverse transcriptase. Synthetic vitamin B-12. Non-aqueous
<br>
enzyme function. First virus produced &quot;from scratch&quot;. Dubnium,
<br>
Seaborgium, Bohrium, Meitnerium, Hassium, Darmstadtium, Roentgenium,
<br>
Ununbium, Ununquadium, Ununhexium.
<br>
<p>Microcomputers; RSA encryption; Boyer-Moore string search; Lempel-Ziv algorithms
<br>
Simulated annealing; C and C++; Dynamic RAM; UNIX; e-mail; first
<br>
portable electronic calculator; first computer with a parallel
<br>
architecture;
<br>
<p>Vaccines for rubella, chicken pox, pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis B,
<br>
flu (HiB), hepatitis A, lyme disease, rotavirus.
<br>
<p>First successful separation of occipital craniopagus twins; IVF
<br>
pregnancy; artificial heart
<br>
<p>Ethernet; Heimlich maneuver; Scramjet; Gore-Tex; laserdisc; polymerase
<br>
chain reaction; DVDs; iPod; digital satellite radio
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Society: Iraq wars, Watergate, gay rights, end of cold war, globalization, AIDS
</em><br>
<p>The animal rights movement; fall of the Berlin wall / German
<br>
re-unification; fall of the USSR; Hubble becomes operational; Milgram
<br>
experiment; Godel Escher Bach; cyborg feminism; transhumanist movement
<br>
(we remember that one, don't we?); Anarchy State and Utopia; and so
<br>
very much else, but I'm off to do something more useful now.
<br>
<p>Best,
