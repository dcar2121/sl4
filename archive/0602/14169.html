Cribbing from Chaitin mercilessly....
<br>
<p>The number of friendliness preserving programs a program can safely
<br>
self transform itself into is bounded by the length of the program.
<br>
<p>Let us posit a number Phi which is equivalent to Omega but for
<br>
friendliness. That is bit 1 is 1 iff the shortest program expressible
<br>
in a programming languages (breaking ties in a defined fashion) is
<br>
friendly and has friendliness maintaining transformations. And so on
<br>
with the second bit and the second shortest program. And omega is bit
<br>
1 is 1 iff program 1 halts (I don't know whether this is the classical
<br>
definition)
<br>
<p>Knowing a bit of Phi is 1 is equivalent to knowing a bit of Omega is
<br>
1, unless not halting is friendly :)
<br>
<p>The easiest way to know whether n programs halt (without empirically
<br>
checking them) is to have them encoded in an n bit number. Each bit
<br>
representing one bit of omega, so similarly for Phi. Quite often this
<br>
is expressed as knowing the first n bits of omega, but as we are not
<br>
interested in the ordering of Phi we shall treat them as arbitrary
<br>
bits of Phi and hence arbitrary length* programs.
<br>
<p>So the maximum number of bits of Phi and hence number of known or
<br>
provably friendly programs is bounded by the length of your starting
<br>
program. It would be less than that because you would have to take
<br>
into consideration the bit requirement of the machinery to transform
<br>
your bit of Phi into a program and other things you want your program
<br>
to do. But tightening the bound is not of much interest I don't think.
<br>
<p>Anything wrong with this semi-formal proof?
<br>
<p>I hope I haven't covered ground already well trodden, I couldn't find
<br>
anything explicitly positing an equivalent of Omega for the
<br>
friendliness quality and not much on Omega and Chaitin together apart
<br>
from some stuff by Geddes and a very early one by Mitchell Porter.

<br>
<p>* But not arbitrary kolmogorov complexity programs, by definition.
<br>
<p>Note
<br>
This is a rejoin. I am going to try and not argue with people about
<br>
their approaches to AI or hard take off and so not flog the poor
<br>
deceased equines. I will limit myself strictly to self-improvement
<br>
theory and intend to automatically ignore a large percentage of list
<br>
traffic.
<br>
<p>My own work isn't AGI it has evolved into defining a parallel hardware
<br>
system that can be used as a metaphor for the system like the brain
<br>
including equivalents to neurovascular coupling and the like. As such
<br>
I don't see my hardware likely capable of hard take off (quite apart
<br>
from my theoretical dislike for it) as I expect if or when human level
<br>
software is implemented on it it, decades from now or possibly never,
<br>
it would only be able to modify its own software and goal system in
<br>
the same way humans can i.e locally and not totally.
