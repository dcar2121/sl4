<p>The hypothesis that humans lose the ability to easily absorb languages as we 
<br>
grow older has long been proven false (MacNamara, 1973; McLaughlin, 1977). 
<br>
The difficulty younger children have in acquiring language is often 
<br>
underestimated.  Older children and adults learn languages faster and more 
<br>
easily for the similar investment of time and effort.  The only advantage 
<br>
younger children appear to have is in the accurate expression of basic 
<br>
phonemes.  This allows younger children to learn specific pronounciation and 
<br>
accent more easily.
