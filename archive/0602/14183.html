</em><br>
<p>I agree, although I would strengthen this.  We can never allow a nonFriendly AGI 
<br>
to exist.  Bottling an entity smarter than us seems like a lost cause. 
<br>
Explicitly allowing it to influence us, in the hopes getting it to work for us, 
<br>
is even worse!  (This is assuming an abitrary AGI design; if the design is 
<br>
already safe, we don't have a problem.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I didn't mean to suggest limiting the output of an AGI as the only safeguard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I meant that it might be safer to tack it on top of whatever programmed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; embark upon a full-throttle engineering project.  
</em><br>
<p>Ah, ok.  It might be absolutely safer, assuming this didn't cause humans to feel 
<br>
safer and thereby relax their guard, but the improvement is probably tiny. 
<br>
Intelligence is a powerful thing, it can achieve ends through rather indirect 
<br>
means.  Focusing on boxing the AI can distract us from the more important, but 
<br>
harder to discuss, issues of designing AGIs that are actually safe (or, at 
<br>
least, safe enough to be worth building).
<br>
<p>Restricting output like this can protect against accidental error on the AI's 
<br>
part, which is important.  I don't think we can remove the AI's ability to 
<br>
manipulate humans, especially given that humans will scrutinise its output.  Not 
<br>
unless we reduce the AI's total influence over reality to a small number of bits 
<br>
(which is probably impossible, given EM radiation leaks etc).
<br>
<p>Reducing its influence correspondingly reduces its ability to be useful.  If we 
<br>
want it to invent things it requies a large space of outputs, e.g. the space of 
<br>
valid blueprints.  This is the risk with trying to use an unsafe AGI (i.e. not 
<br>
explicitly constructed and known to be safe) to do work.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, safety measures within the AGI, e.g. explicitly building an 
<br>
AGI that doesn't &quot;want&quot; to escape, are an entirely different matter.  Although 
<br>
these are considerably more complex (e.g. you have to understand how the AGI 
<br>
actually works) they offer the only reasonable ability to create safe AGIs 
<br>
smarter than us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems far from certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me that we can't screen out all of an AGI's magic.  It still has to obey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws of physics.  As a thought experiment, imagine an AGI entombed within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a collapsing hollow sphere of mini blackholes.  Such an AGI is toast no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how smart it is if massive engineering precursors don't accompany it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Believing in the certainty of AGI magic means that you believe for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes of AGI architectures, that its own substrate material offers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient resources for it to escape.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, that AGI is probably toast (it's still hard to be certain).  But any AGI 
<br>
we're milking for our benefit isn't in that situation, and is in a fine 
<br>
situation to influence the universe indirectly through humans.
<br>
<p>It's not believing in the certainty of AGI magic, just the possibility.  Any 
<br>
situation where the AI isn't entirely boxed, i.e. encased in concrete with no 
<br>
information channels connecting it to us (that includes peeking at its internal 
<br>
state), explicitly has potential resources for escape: humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can't even define this discussion until we identify what AGI magic is.  
</em><br>
<p>AGI magic is the AGI doing something we didn't expect it could do (e.g. by 
<br>
failure of intelligence or imagination).  There is no restriction on the methods 
<br>
it can use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't suggest a safer output medium than engineering blueprints if I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what the risks are.  What are they?
</em><br>
<p>The general risk is its ability to influence reality.  I don't think this 
<br>
problem can be fixed, given that we don't know all the possible loopholes -- 
<br>
especially those in humans -- it could exploit.  For instance, perhaps we try to 
<br>
exclude the AI's ability to apply persuasive arguments by ensuring its output 
<br>
contains no recognisable letters.  This doesn't stop the AI influencing us 
<br>
through concepts, since the process of understanding any design it produces will 
<br>
invoke them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Inducing a spiritual experience and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hynotism via sensor imput to humans?  Mutating nearby virii with EM radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make mini robots?  Manipulating nearby power grids?  I know our physics is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presently incomplete.  Give me a hint, will the AGI attempt to utilize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gravity magic or everything else combined?
</em><br>
<p>Whatever works.  There is a fundamental limit on the escape avenues and methods 
<br>
we can see, due to the difference in intelligence levels.  That's the crux of 
<br>
the matter.
