<em>&gt; &gt; The writings at intelligence.org have made quite an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Though I am no expert, it appears to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Institute is a thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leader in the definition and the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; FAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But let me ask: Why does the Institute believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it has a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of leading the world in the construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a GAI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What SIAI in general and Eliezer in particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are focused on is not merely making a GAI but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making a Friendly one, that won't extinct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enslave, stultify or otherwise ruin us. It's that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;By analogy, there are fifty groups trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to build a car, but who else is trying to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brakes, belts, and airbags?
</em><br>
<p>ALL of the car builders are building safety features into their cars these 
<br>
days. The fact is, these things won't save your life. They might 
<br>
statistically reduce the number of deaths in car accidents, but they don't 
<br>
functionally prevent fatal car accidents. If SingInst were building cars- 
<br>
well, they aren't. They are building a seed AI. Which can functionally 
<br>
prevent all fatal car accidents. To say the least.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; But let me ask: Why does the Institute believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it has a reasonable....
</em><br>
<p>Well, what's the alternative? Believe you really don't have a chance? What 
<br>
would they do in that case? It seems like they would be doing pretty much 
<br>
the exact same things, minus obviously actually trying to create FAI.
<br>
<p>If that were the case... their purpose would be more like &quot;Please make sure 
<br>
you don't exterminate everybody with your technology&quot; instead of &quot;Here's how 
<br>
we are going to try to stop everybody from being exterminated with 
<br>
technology&quot;
<br>
<p>It's not a matter of believing in your chances, it's a matter of accepting 
<br>
the responsibility that reality forces upon you. What a STRANGE question.
