Marcello,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's the problem.  If you didn't know what algorithm the AI proper was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using, and you had no log file, you would run up against Rice's theorem here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we do know what algorithm the AI is using and we might have a log
</em><br>
<em>&gt; file.  These are the only things preventing us from running into Rice's theorem.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, this means there must exist some reasonably efficient translation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm for our AI's algorithm which will take in a conclusion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optionally a  log file and output a deductive justification, which can then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be checked.  But, this is precisely what I meant by verifiable, so you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do that for a non-verifiable architecture.
</em><br>
<p>I don't find the language or reasoning in the above paragraph
<br>
sufficiently clear.
<br>
<p>Let me try one more time to spell out the specific sort of situation I
<br>
have been trying to discuss.
<br>
<p>Suppose we have a system with a goal G, and suppose it arrives at a
<br>
theorem Q of the form
<br>
<p>Q = &quot;Executing subprogram S starting at a time point in interval T
<br>
will achieve goal G with probability at least p, based on
<br>
knowledge-base K&quot;
<br>
<p>Suppose it proves this theorem Q using a proved-to-be-correct
<br>
theorem-proving subsystem.
<br>
<p>Suppose that the goal G embodies within itself an agreeable notion of
<br>
Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Now, suppose that the theorem Q was found via a hard-to-predict
<br>
algorithm such as some variant of evolutionary programming, or some
<br>
sort of heuristic, abductive inference train involving metaphorical
<br>
leaps, etc.
<br>
<p>What is your claim about this kind of AI architecture?
<br>
<p>Are you claiming that it cannot be proved Friendly, even if the
<br>
algorithmic information of the whole thing is less than that of the
<br>
agent doing the proof?
<br>
<p>I don't see why.  It seems to me that one might be able to prove this
<br>
kind of system is reasonably able to achieve the goal G, as compared
<br>
to other sorts of AI systems operating with similar amounts of
<br>
computational resources.
<br>
<p>In fact, my conjecture is that given a certain finite amount of
<br>
computational resources, the best AI systems involving hard-to-predict
<br>
hypothesis-generation subsystems will be *better* than the best AI
<br>
systems that don't involve such ---- thus suggesting that the
<br>
Friendliest AI's (best able to optimize the Friendliness goal G)
<br>
constructible given a certain amount of computational resources may be
<br>
the ones involving hard-to-predict hypothesis-generation subsystems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember that if you do end up building a powerful enough AI system, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burden of proof regarding its safety lies with you.  If you don't use a nicely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalized architecture, this step looks way harder.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this statement, however, it is not the case that using a
<br>
hard-to-predict hypothesis-generation subsystem implies using a
<br>
non-formalized or non-nicely-formalized architecture.  Evolutionary
<br>
programming and estimation of distribution algorithms, for example,
<br>
are quite thoroughly formalized.
<br>
