</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity is not totally opaque to us because we expect it to be

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a hard time believing that a randomly-selected utility function,

</em><br>

</em><br>
A utility function selected randomly with respect to what distribution? A
<br>
decision system describing the world only on the level of atoms would be
<br>
blindingly unlikely to choose a configuration corresponding to continued
<br>
human existence, but would also not be capable of hard takeoff. An AI
<br>
capable of recursive self improvement must have a concept of mind, and if it
<br>
ends up with a random goal, something that includes the utility of systems
<br>
like itself as part of its utility function (not necessarily with the sign
<br>
we would want) seems to me although unlikely, more in the range of winning
<br>
the lottery than a whirlwind in a junkyard assembling a functioning
<br>
airplane.
