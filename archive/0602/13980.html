I understand that you have good intentions with AGI.  My worry 
<br>
involves -accidentally- creating an unfriendly AGI (And this worry applies 
<br>
to anybody who builds an AGI).  You can have good intentions and still 
<br>
create an unfriendly AI because of some design flaw (even if it appears to 
<br>
be a great design).  I am worried because no one really knows how a Seed AI 
<br>
will function when it is turned on, and whether it will be friendly or not. 
<br>
There are so many things that can go wrong.
<br>
<p>This is why I think that the system and it's safety should be analyzed, and 
<br>
go through at least several phases of testing before activation is even 
<br>
considered.
<br>
<p>I would also feel better if these tests are conducted by a team of 
<br>
independent AGI researchers rather than just one firm, or RGE Corp. by 
<br>
itself.  You can have many shots at creating a Seed AI, but you only get one 
<br>
shot at creating a friendly one.  If this is the Seed AI that is successful, 
<br>
then I say make that friendly shot count.  Since you want to be open with 
<br>
the technology, I think that it is an idea worth considering.
