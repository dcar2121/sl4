<em>&gt;Subject: RE: Hard takeoff [WAS Re: JOIN: Joshua Fox]

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;but you can't use that fact to predict that it will escape to create a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hard take-off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It sounds like you think hard take-off is bad or undesirable. The only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation where hard is less desirable than soft is when you are doing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crappy job of ensuring Friendliness. In which case you are probably screwed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyway.
</em><br>
<p>It is my gut feeling (with a few supporting ideas) that a Friendly AI would 
<br>
probably not create the hardest takeoff it could.
<br>
<p>I 'suppose' that ve would most likely soften things a _lot_ for the sake of 
<br>
other extant sentients
<br>
<p>I will comment further on this anon, but I think that the principle of 
<br>
&quot;think before you act&quot; gives a good hint of why.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Computational resources are not the only limiting factor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Factors that influence how hard the takeoff &quot;knee&quot; is include:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1) Computational resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really!?
</em><br>
<p>I said &quot;factors include&quot;, not &quot;other factors&quot;.  You were just searching for 
<br>
something to criticise, and flailed wildly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;2) Other resources - particularly nanotech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    - it doesn't have to be replicators.  Tunnelling electron 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;microscope-level nanotools etc will make it much easier for a &quot;runaway AI&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to create replicators
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would nanotech be a necessary resource for hard take off, other than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibly for computational resources? It's wouldn't be.
</em><br>
<p>Because it _determines_ availability of computational resources.
<br>
<p>Nanotech is not necessary for awakening.  Existing nanotech is also not 
<br>
necessary for expanding computational resources, but will make a huge impact 
<br>
on how things turn out a few &quot;steps&quot; of change beyond awakening.
<br>
<p>Scenario 1:  &quot;Runaway AI 1&quot; at 9AM is awake and has access to all computing 
<br>
power on Interweb.  It uses Nanolab to develop nano-assembly techniques.  At 
<br>
10AM, &quot;runaway AI 1&quot; has figured nano-assembly out, and sets about creating 
<br>
nano-assemblers.  At 10:30 AM, nano-assemblers are busily creating big 
<br>
nano-computer.  At 10:45, &quot;Runaway AI 1&quot; is now not only increasing its code 
<br>
efficiency, but is also rapidly expanding its computational resources.
<br>
<p>Scenario 2: &quot;Runaway AI 2&quot; at 9AM is awake and has access to all computing 
<br>
power on Interweb. There are already nanoassemblers. At 9AM, &quot;Runaway AI 2&quot; 
<br>
sets about using them to create a big nano-computer. At 9:15, &quot;Runaway AI 2&quot; 
<br>
is now rapidly expanding its computational resources.
<br>
<p>Two different hard takeoff scenarios.  Same available computing resources, 
<br>
same initial code efficiency.  Different takeoff knees.  Scenario 2 has a 
<br>
much harder knee.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;3) &quot;first instance efficiency&quot; - I know there's a better term, but I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;remember it.  If the first code only just gets over the line, and is slow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and clunky --&gt; slower takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ie. need more computational resources.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is the offset.  My point is that there is more than one factor.
<br>
<p>That is:
<br>
<p>(takeoff hardness) is not only a function of (computational resources)
<br>
<p>All other things being the same, there is a functional relationship, but 
<br>
function might look more like
<br>
<p>(Takeoff hardness) = derivative of {(initial efficiency)x(goals)+(additional 
<br>
resources)}^(computational resouces).
<br>
<p>That formula is probably very wrong - my math sucketh -  but hopefully you 
<br>
get my drift.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;4) AI goals (how much it wants to improve)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The only concievable case in which an AI's goals would limit its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-improvement would be some programmer enforced boxing, which is a bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>How it goes about self-improvement is a limiting factor.
<br>
<p>Converting all nearby matter to computronium-of-the-moment is the most rapid 
<br>
way to self-improve in the short term.
<br>
<p>Sitting back (self improving, without assimilating more resources), gives an 
<br>
expantive AI time to think about which resources it needs to assimilate now, 
<br>
which resources should be left till later, and which &quot;resources&quot; have merit 
<br>
in existing untouched.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Self-improvement is good for any goal in general.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but aquiring resources for improvement, although fast, is not 
<br>
necessarily the best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In summary, if you have an intelligent system, hard take-off is both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desirable and probable.
</em><br>
<p>I refute that.  Firstly, you haven't said &quot;Friendly&quot;.  Secondly, &quot;hard 
<br>
take-off&quot; encapsulates a number of scenarios that, even if the AI is 
<br>
friendly to sentients, are otherwise undesireable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;where the necessary and sufficient factor is computational resources.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Furthermore, the amount of computing power necessary for hard take-off is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unknowable except with direct reference to the specifications of the actual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent system.
</em><br>
<p>I concur.
