<p>Political brain driven by emotion
<br>
By Stephen Benz

<br>
<p>Selected quotes:
<br>
<p>The subjects were easily able to spot the contradictions of the
<br>
opposing party's candidate. How they encountered the contradictions of
<br>
their own candidates, however, is what interested the researchers.
<br>
<p>Rather than analyzing the candidate's statements with the rational
<br>
parts of their brain, partisans tended to process the contradictions
<br>
of the candidate from their party with parts typically associated with
<br>
emotion.
<br>
<p>Drew Westen, the lead researcher and director of the clinical
<br>
psychology department, said this is how the brain deals with
<br>
politically-based facts.
<br>
<p>&quot;When people draw conclusions about political events, they are not
<br>
just weighing the facts, they are weighing what would make them feel
<br>
better, no matter what the facts are,&quot; he said. &quot;Essentially, it
<br>
appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they
<br>
get the conclusions they want, and then they get massively reinforced
<br>
for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and
<br>
activation of positive ones,&quot; Westen said in a press release.
<br>
<p>Westen said in an interview that some groups already take advantage of
<br>
people's tendency to make emotionally based judgments. He said some
<br>
cable talkshows, such as CNN's &quot;Crossfire,&quot; take advantage of
<br>
emotionally-based thinking to attract an audience.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have grown accustomed to hearing two versions of every story, one
<br>
from the left and one from the right, as if the average of two
<br>
distortions equals the truth,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;
<br>
Unfortunately, this format of 'from the left, from the right'
<br>
capitalizes on a design flaw in the brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>End quotes.
