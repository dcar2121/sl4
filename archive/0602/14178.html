<p>
I want to expand on Ben's comments (even though he may or may not agree 
<br>
that this constitutes an expansion).
<br>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the whole point of the &quot;Halting Problem&quot; is 
<br>
that we can ask a slew of interesting questions about whether certain 
<br>
programs can ever be proved to run to completion and stop.  All well and 
<br>
good for programs that are supposed to compute something useful and then 
<br>
stop, but what if the program is not designed to stop?  An AGI program 
<br>
is such a program:  it does not compute a final result and then 
<br>
terminate, it just does certain kinds of things indefinitely.
<br>
<p>An AGI program can be structured (and probably would be) so that it 
<br>
could add to or subtract from to its own code routinely, and do so in a 
<br>
way that was sensitive to its interactions with the environment, in such 
<br>
a way that these changes were non-deterministic.  So now we have a 
<br>
program that is not only not designed to halt, but which spends its life 
<br>
doing something that looks like a random walk through the space of 
<br>
programs of arbitrary length (this is a variant of what Ben was saying, 
<br>
below and in other posts).  The concept of &quot;halting&quot; is obviously 
<br>
getting stretched well beyond breaking point here:  the structure of the 
<br>
program is time-dependent and non-deterministic.
<br>
<p>But of course, none of us really cares if this kind of program &quot;halts&quot;, 
<br>
so this is all fine, and nobody disagrees.....
<br>
<p>But now we seem to be discussing another question about these programs: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;we are trying to find out if they are &quot;Friendly&quot;.  Oh, and by the way, 
<br>
they must also be &quot;Intelligent.&quot;  We are looking for ways that a given 
<br>
example of an Intelligent system can be proved to be Friendly, and to 
<br>
not depart from being Friendly even though it might be able to self modify.
<br>
<p>The concept of &quot;Friendly&quot; is vague.  The concept of &quot;Intelligent,&quot; 
<br>
ditto.  I am not even sure someone could *ever* come up with a clear 
<br>
definition of either of these concepts that we would all feel compelled 
<br>
to subscribe to.
<br>
<p>The concept of &quot;Halting,&quot; on the other hand, is extremely well defined - 
<br>
but even *it* does not seem applicable to the general class of AGI programs.
<br>
<p>So here we have the story:
<br>
<p>1) There are some programs for which the concept of Halting is perfectly 
<br>
sensible, and of these, Godel, Turing and Chaitin say:  don't hold your 
<br>
breath, folks, because you will not always be able to prove that they 
<br>
actually do halt.
<br>
<p>2) Then there are some programs (like the AGI class) of which the 
<br>
concept of Halting is not even meaningful.  Godel, Turing and Chaitin, 
<br>
at this point, are heading out the door saying &quot;Too rich for us:  we're 
<br>
outta here.&quot;
<br>
<p>3) Then there are some properties of programs, like Intelligent and 
<br>
Friendly, that we cannot even define in a crisp way, and maybe never 
<br>
will be able to define.  G, T and C are now cracking each other up, in 
<br>
some other coffee house across town, picking random words from a 
<br>
dictionary - Hermeneutic? Smelly? Virginal? Obstreperous? - and asking 
<br>
if programs provably have these properties.
<br>
<p>*****
<br>
<p>Joking aside, folks, I think the concept of Friendliness is interesting, 
<br>
but not if it is treated as something provable, like Halting.
