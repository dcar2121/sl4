<em>&gt; The number of friendliness preserving programs a program can safely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self transform itself into is bounded by the length of the program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us posit a number Phi which is equivalent to Omega but for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendliness. That is bit 1 is 1 iff the shortest program expressible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a programming languages (breaking ties in a defined fashion) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly and has friendliness maintaining transformations. And so on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the second bit and the second shortest program. And omega is bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 is 1 iff program 1 halts (I don't know whether this is the classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition)
</em><br>
<p>Omega is the sum, over all programs that halt, of 1/(length of program
<br>
in bits), when programs are expressed in a way so that no program is a
<br>
prefix of another program (necessary so that the sum of the lengths of
<br>
all programs would be 1).  What you've defined works only if, for
<br>
every n, there is exactly 1 program of length n.  Fortunately there
<br>
are more than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Knowing a bit of Phi is 1 is equivalent to knowing a bit of Omega is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1, unless not halting is friendly :)
</em><br>
<p>We are leaving halting out of it, I think.  Actually, halting would be
<br>
friendly, or at least neutral - a program that had halted couldn't goo
<br>
you.  Anyway, the point is, Phi is about friendliness, not halting;
<br>
don't confuse the two.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The easiest way to know whether n programs halt (without empirically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checking them) is to have them encoded in an n bit number.
</em><br>
<p>???
<br>
You are saying that you arbitrarily assign one bit per program.  This
<br>
will not tell you whether they halt, unless an oracle magically
<br>
provides the proper bit in each case.  I think you mean something
<br>
other than &quot;the easist way to know (learn)&quot;; possibly, &quot;the easiest
<br>
way to denote&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing one bit of omega, so similarly for Phi.
</em><br>
<p>Can't parse this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quite often this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is expressed as knowing the first n bits of omega, but as we are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in the ordering of Phi we shall treat them as arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits of Phi and hence arbitrary length* programs.
</em><br>
<p>I can't resolve your anaphors in general.  &quot;Them&quot; here appears to mean
<br>
bits of Phi, but then you are saying we shall treat bits of Phi as
<br>
bits of Phi.  I can't parse a lot of this post.
<br>
<p>In any case, there is no 1-1 correspondence between bits of Phi, and
<br>
programs.  The cardinality of the set of bits of Phi is aleph-null;
<br>
the cardinality of the number of programs is 2^(aleph-null).  Well,
<br>
technically you could construct a 1-1- correspondence, if you take the
<br>
continuum hypothesis as false, but there's no obvious way to take a
<br>
bit of Phi and find the program for it, or vice-versa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the maximum number of bits of Phi and hence number of known or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provably friendly programs is bounded by the length of your starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program.
</em><br>
<p>How does this bounding follow from anything you said before?
<br>
Especially since you've never referred to a &quot;starting program&quot;.
<br>
I don't know what that phrase is supposed to refer to.
<br>
My best guess is that your &quot;starting program&quot;
<br>
is a program to generate Phi, and that you are wrongly
<br>
assuming that a program cannot generate a stream
<br>
of bits longer than itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be less than that because you would have to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into consideration the bit requirement of the machinery to transform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your bit of Phi into a program and other things you want your program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do. But tightening the bound is not of much interest I don't think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anything wrong with this semi-formal proof?
</em><br>
<p>Two key problems:
<br>
<p>1.  Each bit in Phi does not correspond to a program.  If you want
<br>
each bit to correspond to a program, you have to construct Phi in a
<br>
different manner.  If you want Phi to be a number (a sequence of
<br>
bits), then you must be aware that claiming that you can make each bit
<br>
in a sequence of bits correspond to one of the set of possible
<br>
programs, is claiming that the continuum hypothesis is false.
<br>
<p>2. This last bit about the maximum number of bits being bounded by
<br>
your starting program.  That doesn't seem to connect to anything else
<br>
in the proof.
