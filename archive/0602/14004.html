<em>&gt; Greetings,

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read Vinge's fiction years ago and enjoyed it. Only recently, however, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read the works of Yudkowsky and Kurzweil, and the idea clicked. I get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Details about me are at <a href="http://www.joshuafox.com">http://www.joshuafox.com</a>. As my initial 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity theory, in order to be intellectually honest, takes a hard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at all possible objections. Though we can try to consider all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objections to details of the theory, we have to be sure that we are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deluding ourselves. One way to understand how the whole theory might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong is to find historical parallels to the meta-features of the theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialist theory of the late 19th Century and Singularity theory of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early 21st both believe that inevitable forces of history take the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through successively more evolved phases, which must inevitably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culminate--within a few decades of the time of the theorizing--in an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate Utopian phase. Nineteenth Century Socialist philosophers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly thought they had a firm _scientific_ basis, and they were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong. How can we be sure that we are different?
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Joshua,
<br>
<p>In general, I agree with other comments about your question:   those 
<br>
Nineteenth Century Socialist philosophers used the word &quot;scientific&quot; 
<br>
ill-advisedly.
<br>
<p>Personally, I base my opinions about the Singularity purely on the 
<br>
development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).   I think that 
<br>
current predictions about when &quot;human-level&quot; AGI will become a reality 
<br>
are based on extrapolations from known techniques, and are deeply 
<br>
pessimistic because I don't think a known technique is what will make it 
<br>
happen.  I put little stock by Kurzweil's analysis of historical trends, 
<br>
I am afraid:  this is good background, but there is no reason at all why 
<br>
those beautiful exponential curves of *general* technological progress 
<br>
should not simply hit a wall.
<br>
<p>I also disagree with many about the idea of Unfriendly AI (UFAI).  Some 
<br>
talk as if this is almost inevitable, and say that we will have to work 
<br>
like crazy to avoid it.  I think they base this UFAI-inevitability idea 
<br>
on their own particular take on how to build an AGI, and I dispute their 
<br>
methods.  In short, I am of the opinion that the approach to AGI they 
<br>
espouse is going to lead to an AGD (Artificial General Dumbtelligence), 
<br>
which will never reach the level of human intelligence even after many 
<br>
more decades of painstaking work, and hence will never be a threat.
<br>
<p>My position is (ahem) hotly disputed in some quarters.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
