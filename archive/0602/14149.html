<p>There is necessarily a user interface if we are using the AI to design systems. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to influence it to direct the design process, and it needs to 
<br>
influence us to communicate the designs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And nothing but mechanical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer components; no danger of physics tricks.  A purely mechanical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer log.  Yes I know AI Boxing talk is passe, but can someone quickly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out why this architecture would fail?
</em><br>
<p>This scenario is effectively equivalent to the standard AI box; the box 
<br>
necessarily has a hole to allow communication between human and AI.
<br>
<p>There is nothing to stop the AI producing a design which convinces the human 
<br>
reading it to release the AI (e.g. by connecting it to the internet).  It is 
<br>
difficult to state with certainty there is no such design as the space of 
<br>
possibilities is exponentially huge and humans are knowably imperfect.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, the AI could design a useful machine which looks definitely 
<br>
harmless to a human but in actuality releases the AI.  As the space of 
<br>
possibilities is exponentially huge, and as humans have limited ability to 
<br>
predict a design's true effect, a sufficiently smart AI may be able to invent 
<br>
such a design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the AGI is friendly, we lose out on a great deal of its immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering prowess building only safe product designs it spits out.  If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unfriendly, we are saved.  It doesn't matter how smart an entity is if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jail permits no key.
</em><br>
<p>In any AI boxing scenario humans form a lock, to which any influence the AI has 
<br>
on us (e.g. any time we look at anything it's produced) gives it access.  The 
<br>
smarter the entity the better it is at cracking locks.

<p>If successful this wouldn't implement Friendless, as SIAI defines it, but a form

of &quot;safe&quot; usefulness.  Such an AI has no protection against humans getting what
