<p>I'm not sure that it is. The population is rising, so having more born
<br>
to religious families than to secular doesn't mean the religious
<br>
population is growing. As a matter of fact, it is probably true that,
<br>
percentage-wise, the world is getting more religious, since
<br>
religiosity and birth rate (per country, at least) appear to be
<br>
correlated positively. On the other hand, economic/political influence
<br>
from an international perspective is tied much less to population than
<br>
it is to the strength of the economy, and the strongest economies in
<br>
the world tend to be more secular countries (with the US as an
<br>
interesting outlier). What's more, and what should be obvious to
<br>
everyone on this list, is that the factors that drive economic success
<br>
are very rational, technical factors. While the correlation isn't as
<br>
strong as I'd like it to be, I think the technically adept do tend to
<br>
be the less religious.
<br>
<p>I hold out hope that the world will become more secular over time, and
<br>
that religion will become irrelevant in conditions of decreasing
<br>
scarcity, and especially, of increasing knowledge. I'll try to do my
<br>
part to convince people. I think one productive line of argument is to
<br>
let people know, using resources like this[1], how incredible
<br>
irrational the human mind is. (Don't use that word, though.) Then show
<br>
them why science is necessary to overcome these biases, and how
<br>
various common superstitions are only plausible as a result of these
<br>
biases.
