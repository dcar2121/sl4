*...copying/pasting in a palsied effort to be OT
<br>
<p>[snip]...examples of what I might in the course of developing 'workhorse'
<br>
AGI
<br>
code need to do:
<br>
<p>- write code that will parse the pixels of a scanned exponential
<br>
graph, generate the data model it represents and call various math
<br>
functions against the result
<br>
<p>- fire off a gazillion threads on multiple servers across the globe
<br>
which share resources and scheduling to achieve a given computation
<br>
result; the initiation of which can instantaneously load and run new
<br>
code segments without requiring user tweaking of the distributed
<br>
clients (e.g. stopping the target application server on the
<br>
distributed client, updating the class library and restarting - I'd
<br>
consider this to be a pretty severe disadvantage)
<br>
<p>- parse the source code and OS/chip specific binaries of all known
<br>
languages to define a functional model that can be applied against
<br>
mathematical proofs and then regenerated in any other language
<br>
<p>- text transliteration, conversion and parsing supporting unicode
<br>
languages and all known file formats
<br>
<p>- web/net spidering to grok every online resource possible via every
<br>
known protocol/stream; tcpip, p2p, X.25, SOAP, SNMP, codecs, distillers,
<br>
scrapers etc
<br>
<p>- mature persistent storage support incl. database connection pooling
<br>
and driver/api support for the big rdbms', LDAP,bdb etc
<br>
<p>what this comes back to is that I want to leverage the
<br>
(give-me-a-better-word-for) infosphere. I want my workhorse code to provide
<br>
interfaces for sensors/input streams that will grok and manipulate the
<br>
greater planetwide digisphere/infosphere/insert-s
<br>
ummary-word-for-all-the-bit-stacks-everywhere-and-the-things-you-c
<br>
an-do-with-them.
<br>
<p>I believe that it will be absolutely necessary to have the 'brain' code. But
<br>
I don't think sitting down and coding up a bunch of sexy self-replicating
<br>
algorithms in your academically superior but API library deficient
<br>
programming is the way to go about it; at least not initially, not for me.
<br>
<p>If we can get code that does all and more of my wishlist above, then we have
<br>
filled in a pretty important gap; _input_. i.e.
<br>
<p>+-------+   +------------+   +--------+
<br>
| input |--&gt;| processing |--&gt;| output |
<br>
+-------+   +------------+   +--------+
<br>
<p>which in our case means:
<br>
<p>+--------------------+   +-----+   +---------------------------------+
<br>
| everything digital |--&gt;| AGI |--&gt;| stuff that a human would output |
<br>
---------------------+   +-----+   +---------------------------------+
<br>
<p>I think the right way to go about this is to do the input stage first, or at
<br>
least in parallel; because if we can simulate the external sense-world of
<br>
our future AGI, then I think we have an easier path to maybe simulating
<br>
_him_.
<br>
<p>In this way we can provide a framework in which the psynet guys can drop in
<br>
their algorithms, pattern builders and
<br>
other-stuff-im-way-too-n00b-to-comprehend and start seeing some output.
<br>
<p>We can refine the lossiness of our inputs over time until we can be sure
<br>
that we're providing the non-workhorse 'thinking' code everything it needs
<br>
to be able to simulate the best observations we as humans can make.
<br>
<p>I think we can then tweak the little buggers' brain until he starts to think
<br>
like we want him to; and then maybe we'll be getting somewhere.
