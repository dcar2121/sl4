<p>
About this discussion of AGI motivation (which is what it is)....  I am 
<br>
astonished at the wild guesses being thrown around.
<br>
<p>What a sentient creature *does* will depend on the motivational system 
<br>
(call it a &quot;goal system&quot; if you like:  I have reasons for wanting to 
<br>
generalize to the term &quot;motivation&quot;) that is designed into it.   It does 
<br>
not get to *be* an AGI unless someone designs a motivational system to 
<br>
make it do things.
<br>
<p>So what an AGI will feel compelled to do will depend totally on a design 
<br>
factor, and the answer to all these questions about whether they will 
<br>
kill everything, be friendly, not be friendly, etc, is...... &quot;well, tell 
<br>
me what its designer designed it do, and I'll tell you.&quot;
<br>
<p>Does anyone know that back in the early days of telephones, they used to 
<br>
think maybe that if they made one connection too many in the worldwide 
<br>
network of wires, the phone system might become intelligent?  It took a 
<br>
while before people realized that intelligence doesn't just pop up out 
<br>
of nowhere when there are enough wires.
<br>
<p>Same with AGI motivation.  You don't ust build an intelligent system and 
<br>
then switch it on and find out what motivates it:  you don't get 
<br>
motivational systems for nothing (&quot;no free lunch for motivational system 
<br>
engineers&quot;).  If there is no motivational system in it when you switch 
<br>
it, it's just a lump of expensive porridge.
