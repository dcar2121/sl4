Am not quite sure which direction you were pointing with this?
<br>
<p>I read the study when it came up before.  Alas, this is almost a 
<br>
paradigm case of bad science.  (Or it would be, if not for the fact that 
<br>
we get one of these every couple of weeks).
<br>
<p>It was flawed because it seemed to contain the usual oversimplistic jump 
<br>
from neuroscience to psychology (see signals, label brain area with 
<br>
nearest available psychologically-loaded  words).  Just for the record, 
<br>
there is a community of people within the cognitive psychology community 
<br>
who are tearing their hair out because of this reckless use of brain 
<br>
imaging data:  it is certainly not just me.
<br>
<p>And it was flawed because of the simplistic jumping to conclusions about 
<br>
what goes on in the minds of the human subjects when they respond to 
<br>
information that is political.
<br>
<p>There was some (I thought) valid commentary from the researcher about 
<br>
the way people behave in the American political climate, but inasmuch as 
<br>
it was valid, it seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with 
<br>
conclusions that might have stemmed from the experiment.  But this was 
<br>
obscured by other, extremely naive editorializing.

<em>&gt; Political brain driven by emotion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Stephen Benz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Contributing Writer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; February 03, 2006
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Selected quotes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The subjects were easily able to spot the contradictions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposing party's candidate. How they encountered the contradictions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own candidates, however, is what interested the researchers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than analyzing the candidate's statements with the rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of their brain, partisans tended to process the contradictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the candidate from their party with parts typically associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drew Westen, the lead researcher and director of the clinical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology department, said this is how the brain deals with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically-based facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When people draw conclusions about political events, they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just weighing the facts, they are weighing what would make them feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, no matter what the facts are,&quot; he said. &quot;Essentially, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the conclusions they want, and then they get massively reinforced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activation of positive ones,&quot; Westen said in a press release.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Westen said in an interview that some groups already take advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's tendency to make emotionally based judgments. He said some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cable talkshows, such as CNN's &quot;Crossfire,&quot; take advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally-based thinking to attract an audience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We have grown accustomed to hearing two versions of every story, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the left and one from the right, as if the average of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distortions equals the truth,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, this format of 'from the left, from the right'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalizes on a design flaw in the brain.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; End quotes.
