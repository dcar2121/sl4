<p>
&nbsp;I shall address these (and other peoples comments) more fully once I
<br>
have had a chance to get to the library to read Omega. This is a stop
<br>
gap solution.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1.  Each bit in Phi does not correspond to a program.  If you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each bit to correspond to a program, you have to construct Phi in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different manner.  If you want Phi to be a number (a sequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits), then you must be aware that claiming that you can make each bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a sequence of bits correspond to one of the set of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs, is claiming that the continuum hypothesis is false.
</em><br>
<p>I think the confusion comes in (and it is my fault) is because when
<br>
people talk about knowing a bit of Omega, they mean knowing one of the
<br>
outcomes of the infinite sum. I got a little confused. Thanks for
<br>
catching me on this. However it doesn't change the argument much. When
<br>
I talk about knowing a bit I shall mean knowing a bit of the omega
<br>
series rather than knowing a bit of the omega number
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. This last bit about the maximum number of bits being bounded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your starting program.  That doesn't seem to connect to anything else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the proof.
</em><br>
<p>By programs in the following I shall mean programs whose kolmogorov
<br>
complexity is equal to there length. That a program can know that an
<br>
infinite number of programs that all do the same thing have the same
<br>
halting likelyhood or friendliness is not interesting.
<br>
<p>The thrust of the argument is this. Determining friendliness (or other
<br>
desired property) of a program is as hard or harder as determining
<br>
whether a program halts or an infinite looping program has finite
<br>
output (whether it hangs or not).  Friendlyness implies (in a logical
<br>
sense) the program halts.
<br>
<p>As all the bits of the Omega Series have no relation to each other,
<br>
they are random so the shortest way of storing them is the direct
<br>
information. And so because it is as hard or harder to prove
<br>
friendliness Phi must be equally random.
<br>
<p>A proof system and axioms is a way of storing information about the
<br>
world, we shall call a starting program with embedded proof system and
<br>
axioms S.
<br>
<p>How many other programs can S prove the friendliness of?
<br>
<p>I have said the bound on the number of programs a proof system can
<br>
have knowledge that they are friendly is the number of bits in it.
<br>
Otherwise it has found some hidden relation between the bits of the
<br>
Phi so that it can be compressed.
<br>
<p>I would like to make this more concrete and also try and talk about
<br>
proof systems that take in bits from the environment so you will have
<br>
to be patient.
