<em>&gt; &quot;In other words, some of us maverick AI theorists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been saying for a while that using just ONE number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (typically probability) to measure uncertainty is not
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this probability (or to put it differently, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;confidence&quot; one has in the probability) -- are needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a cognitively meaningful algebra of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what Ben means by that, since &quot;confidence&quot; in AI is
<br>
merely a term that means &quot;this is a number like a probability, but
<br>
that does not follow Bayesian rules because my logic engine acts
<br>
stupidly if I try that&quot;.
<br>
<p>But I agree that you need a bunch of numbers, because there are a
<br>
bunch of different types of uncertainties that you need to consider. 
<br>
Consider a field commander told that &quot;Grid section Q32 contains a
<br>
defensive formation of twenty tanks&quot;.  You should be interested in
<br>
<p>- Confidence: How certain is the source of their information?  This
<br>
should be expressed as a probability distribution (for instance, a
<br>
mean and a variance), not as a probability.
<br>
<p>- Reliability of the information source - Is this coming from
<br>
satellite data, or an informant of dubious loyalty?
<br>
<p>- Measurement accuracy:  How accurate are the sensors used?  This
<br>
should also be expressed as an error distribution for the sensor,
<br>
rather than as a single value.  In the example, the question is
<br>
whether &quot;40&quot; is an exact number, or an approximation.  If it is an
<br>
approximation, we might suppose the informant has rounded to the
<br>
nearest 10, giving us a uniform distribution from 35 to 44.
<br>
<p>- Typicality:  In the statement &quot;a defensive formation&quot;, how good a
<br>
defensive formation is it?  This one is hugely important when dealing
<br>
with natural language, but has never been made use of.
<br>
<p>- Age:  When was the observation made?
<br>
<p>I did a project back in 2001 or so in which I developed a logic system
<br>
that assigned each statement an age and a probability distribution,
<br>
rather than a probability.  It was obvious, in the domain (fire
<br>
prediction), that you needed to assign a probability distribution to
<br>
each assertion rather than simply a probability, but again, I'm not
<br>
aware of anyone else having done so.
