To clarify, there would be no user interface.  And nothing but mechanical computer components; no danger of physics tricks.  A purely mechanical computer log.  Yes I know AI Boxing talk is passe, but can someone quickly point out why this architecture would fail?  If the AGI is friendly, we lose out on a great deal of its immediate engineering prowess building only safe product designs it spits out.  If it is unfriendly, we are saved.  It doesn't matter how smart an entity is if the jail permits no key.

In concert with a relatively inert computer substrate such as a molecular computer, how could it cause harm?  We could still benefit from such a limited architecture a great deal.
