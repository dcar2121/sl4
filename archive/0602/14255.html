<em>&gt; This is a key problem with Friendly AI, though... You have to test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your programs to learn anything, to progress towards AI.  You will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to have programs that learn, for you to progress towards AI.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may very well reach the point where we need to build self-modifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs, in order to progress further towards AI, long before those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs are actually smart enough to be dangerous.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is my strong suspicion...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Computer scientists always think their programs are going to be much,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much, MUCH smarter than they end up being.  If we stop turning our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs on when we think they might be smart enough to be dangerous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would probably be 2 decades too soon.  So how are we ever to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress?
</em><br>
<p>Progress on AGI via pure theory with minimal or no experimentation may
<br>
be possible ... but I don't think it will be the way superman AGI
<br>
comes about -- because progress with a combination of theory and
<br>
experiment will almost surely be faster, so the theorist/experimenters
<br>
are almost sure to outpace the pure theorists...
