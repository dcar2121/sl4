Odd.  The thought of such technologies being under a central agency that 
<br>
WASN'T friendly is one of the reasons I feel an AGI is *necessary*!!!  Of 
<br>
course, it also slightly raises the stakes on getting it correct in the first 
<br>
place, but it's a bit hard to raise practical infinity in any meaningful way.
