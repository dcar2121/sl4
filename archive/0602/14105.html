I have to agree with Kevin here. I grant you that 1934 to 1970 saw
<br>
monumental changes but 1970 to 2006 saw unprecedented changes. I say this as
<br>
an obsessive history buff who knows a great deal about the history of the
<br>
20th century. I wont even waste my time making the argument - I'm shocked
<br>
that any intelligent and educated person doesn't recognize the obvious
<br>
exponential advancement of technology. Put it this way - if a person from
<br>
1934 were to travel to 1970 they would probably experience far less future
<br>
shock then a person from 1970 travelling to 2006.

<em>&gt; &gt; one of those time periods could say anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the technological, epistemological, and cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change during them - in Western society - was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater than during the period 1970-2006.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to disgaree outright, and without postulating any kind detailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis, but there does seem to have been a fair whack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'technological, epistemological, and cultural change' in last 36
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To go on anecdotal terms for a third of that timespan, the 12 years up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until now since I graduated high school have seen a fair few changes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Internet, 94-2005. Not arpanet or bbs's, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usenet-&gt;www-&gt;im/p2p/web2.0. The current usage exceeds one billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens - i.e a 6th of world's population (from:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm</a>. another good page:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://mmogchart.com/">http://mmogchart.com/</a>). From thousands to over a billion users in 12
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years is a fairly hefty technological+cultural shift, I would think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft, 94-2005. We went from a few PC's in some offices at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning of  94 to a PC on every desk in every office by the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 05. from 3.1, to 95, to 98, and now XP. The addition of a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer to the effective intelligence of these users is a huge leap,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially for the solitaire|myspace|msoffice-level of user population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who in previous eras had far less input into the realms of culture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media and technology. For more tech/culture love think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cellphones, PDAs, laptops, digital cameras, 3D video cards, iPods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today vs. the end of 93...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Science,Engineering,Nanotech, 94-2005. I'm not a super science geek,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a tech nerd, so I can't give an even near fair accout of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realm, but here's a few:  X-Prize. Mars rovers. Carbon composite,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kevlar, Polymers. 45nm chip fab processes. Synthetics - drugs, sugar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textiles. Hubble, Cosmological imaging advances and theory changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Climate modelling. Ever taller towers - Petronas, 101 etc. Huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure projects, especially in Asia. Buckytubes. The latest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triumph sports bike. The stealth fighters/bombers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medicine,Biotech 94-2005. Again, I'm far from an expert: Researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capturing video from cat's brains. Human genome. Cloning. Biotech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cancer cures. Brain imaging. Transplant advances. everything as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keyhole surgery. RNA interference. Gene therapies. Quadraplegics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling mice via in-brain chips. plastic surgery. drugs for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything - the brain enchancing drugs are a great example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1528069,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1528069,00.html</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Culture, 94-2005. I probably can't come even close to capturing this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but here goes. I'm a drum'n'bass nut. Do you guys have any idea of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of techno genres? From garage to darkstep to happy hardcore to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trance and dozens in between. Mashups. Raves.  Ecstasy and marijuana
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use - the amount of young people off their face every weekend in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; western cities is truly staggering. Group teenage sex. Piercing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branding, implanting. Guerilla art (e.g. banksy). Blogging. Stay at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home dads. Metrosexuals. Same sex marriage. Neoconservatism. Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanaticism. Steroids. Reality TV. Celebrity porn (e.g. Pam,Paris)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's got to be a host more of these kinds of examples in all sorts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of arenas, and not to say in any way that some of these things didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist prior to 94; but their manifestation now is a very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal. The pace of change doesn't seem to be slowing down as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going down different pathways. The lack of manned moon/space missions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may annoy space opera aficionados (trekkies) but the fact is they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless in the short term and we should have always been sending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines. But when I think of the life, technology use and culture of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 13 year old girl in 70's versus one of today, I think maybe that her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world has definitely moved forward, even in Captain Kirk is still as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much a fanstasy now as he was then...
</em><br>
