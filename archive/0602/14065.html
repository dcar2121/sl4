Hi Philip,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes AI unique in this context is that it could cause our extinction apart from anyones desire for world domination/extinction. It need only be poorly programmed. So, in that sense, it poses a greater risk. On the other hand, I think our only real chance to avoid massive worldwide deaths is with a very-near-term friendly AI in responsible hands. This AI could disable, or destroy if necessary, such psychopathic &quot;world-reformers&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff

&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous people on this list are truly alarmed at the prospects of AIs
<br>
wiping out humanity. It seems to me that it would be easier to
<br>
develop existential-threat diseases than to develop AI. For instance,
<br>
it is already known how to make a 100%-lethal
<br>
vaccine-and-antibiotic-and-natural-resistance-resistant smallpox. If
<br>
someone were to modify it further to have a latent period - say, of
<br>
three years after infection - we would be looking at something that
<br>
could kill pretty much everyone on the planet.
<br>
<p>Humans are prone to imagine utopian social orders, and to believe that
<br>
they know the one true way how to order society so as to cure all its
<br>
ills. Such schemes have always failed. I think it is inevitable that
<br>
some new world-reformer will decide that their favorite social order
<br>
will work this time, if they can only start from a clean slate, with
<br>
no other competing social orders. This person, not the military
<br>
invader or the religious zealot, is the most dangerous; unlike our
<br>
other homicidal nutcases, they have an incentive to kill EVERYONE on
<br>
the planet except a selected few.
