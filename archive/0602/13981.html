<p><em>&gt; Yes, that Lamarckian fitness peak in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of advanced engineering technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will surely result in the extinction of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences.
</em><br>
<p>Opening up possibility space would mean not
<br>
extinction but inclusion of all intelligences,
<br>
uploaded or simulated, in an intelligence which
<br>
includes all possible states of those
<br>
intelligences as part of a larger whole. As Nick
<br>
Bostrom says, &quot;at least one of the following
<br>
propositions is true: (1) the human species is
<br>
very likely to go extinct before reaching a
<br>
“posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization
<br>
is extremely unlikely to run a significant number
<br>
of simulations of their evolutionary history (or
<br>
variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly
<br>
living in a computer simulation.&quot;
<br>
<p>If an intelligence explores possibility space
<br>
beginning with our light cone, it would logically
<br>
exhaust simulations of that familiar environment
<br>
before moving on to others, for ours is the most
<br>
complexity-friendly universe (let's call that a
<br>
CFU) we know. Such a simulating intelligence may
<br>
find that ours is one of the simplest CFU's
<br>
available, or even that there is no theory which
<br>
can give rise to CFU's much more optimized than
<br>
the one we know.
<br>
<p>By CFU I mean fine-tuned universe constants, the
<br>
ones that give us stars and atoms:
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe</a>
<br>
Because what the constats are really all about,
<br>
ahtropically speaking, is that they create an
<br>
arena for complex interactions and complex
<br>
patterns (up to and including life and mind)
<br>
where a poorly tuned universe, for these
<br>
purposes, collapses or empties out or has too few
<br>
ways for entities to interact, produces only
<br>
non-complexity-friendly vacuums or physical
<br>
singularites or only one kind of matter, and so
<br>
on.
<br>
<p>To reiterate: an expanding intelligence which
<br>
emerges in a CFU, seeking to explore possibility
<br>
space (complexity) would have reason to conserve
<br>
or simulate its native CFU, with as much
<br>
complexity as possible, which means including all
<br>
existing intelligences. Even the humble: as Dr.
<br>
Kinsey noted, even the gall wasps are all
<br>
different.
