<em>&gt;Subject: Why playing it safe is the most dangerous thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2006 23:33:09 -0500
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was just... (snip)  An idea that occurred to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me, during the section on government regulation, is that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- The worst possible outcome of the Singularity is arguably not total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extinction, but a super-Orwellian situation in which the people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power dictate the thought and actions of everyone else --  and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ultimately, George W. Bush or some equivalent wins the singularity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes the only remaining personality in the solar system.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;the people in power?&quot; At least, if they decided to enslave us, they'd bring 
<br>
on some /human/ conception of slavery.
<br>
<p>As it stands, most people in power don't want some form of slavery, although 
<br>
many want Power.  They want to control things, but they want 'players' 
<br>
against which to pit themselves.
<br>
<p>There's no reason for Powermongers to make people suffer, unless they do 
<br>
something that pisses the Powermongers off.
<br>
<p>Nihilist humans, by default, have empathy.  Even psychopaths tend to get 
<br>
enough conditioning so they generally only cause suffering where it gives 
<br>
them some advantage.
<br>
<p>By contrast, AIs have by default no empathy.  Nothing remotely resembling 
<br>
empathy means no restraint.  An experimental-minded AI would have reason to 
<br>
investigate all the facets of a human suffering, merely as a matter of 
<br>
curiosity.
<br>
<p>It's not like the idea of an AI dictator is something new.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- We've already seen, with genetics, what happens when, as a society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we &quot;take time to think through the ethical implications&quot;.  We convene
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a panel of experts - Leon Kass &amp; co. on the President's Bioethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Committee - and, by coincidence, they come out with exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recommendation that the President wants.
</em><br>
<p>As a rule, they come out with an academic version of society's status quo.  
<br>
Not quite the same as &quot;what the president wants&quot;.  Typically, a committee 
<br>
says &quot;individual case decisions should be made by a committee&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- The internet is the decentralized, difficult-to-control thing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is only because the government wasn't prepared for it, and wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to supervise its construction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- If we consider, on the one hand, that the internet, developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rapidly with little regulation, worked out well and egalitarian; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the other, that a cautious approach is practically guaranteed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lead to the worst possible outcome...
</em><br>
<p>I dunno - a lot of things got hacked. .  I'd rather not have my brain hacked 
<br>
because I didn't know that Norton's Anti -UFAI was blitheringly useless.
<br>
<p>The internet might feel egalitarian to you, but a lot of people don't find 
<br>
it so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- ... we must conclude that the SAFEST thing to do is to rush into AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the Singularity blindly, without pause, before the Powers That Be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can control and divert it.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, you know what?  A nano-dictator would be a terrible thing.  Worst 
<br>
Possible Outcome - well, nearly.  So let's encourage researchers to abandon 
<br>
MMI's and the Foresight Institute's guidelines, and make sure that we beat 
<br>
the nano-dictators to creating universal replicators!
<br>
<p>I think that quoting the Bronze rule is an appropriate way to finish:
<br>
<p>Do unto others... before they do unto you
<br>
