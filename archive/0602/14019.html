<em>&gt; Russell,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is pure political baiting:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	World government is a threat?
</em><br>
A world government would be likely to retard technological progress.  This 
<br>
will not stop the singularity, but makes a hard take-off more likely.
<br>
<em>&gt; 	European Union is a potential threat?
</em><br>
Agreed, this isn't very serious.  The US being an unopposed superpower is much 
<br>
more dangerous.  (To everything, not just to technological progress.)
<br>
<em>&gt; 	We need very large populations?
</em><br>
We do need very large populations.  About 1/10 of the current world 
<br>
population, however, should easily suffice.
<br>
<em>&gt; 	Worried about weapons of mass destruction?
</em><br>
Anyone who isn't worried about weapons of mass destruction needs to open his 
<br>
eyes.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These sound like a catalog of neoconservative buzz-concepts.
</em><br>
<p>Ad hominem arguments aren't particularly sound.  The points are valid, but 
<br>
don't generally seem likely to stop the singularity.  (Barring, that is, a 
<br>
catastrophe of some nature.  State it generally.  E.g., giant meteor impact 
<br>
was omitted.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that the world faces serious problems that might sabotage a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial Singularity.  But your list looks like it is designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provoke a NO POLITICS! stomp-down by the list sniper.  Because of that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll only say that I totally disagree with your analysis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richard Loosemore
</em><br>
<p>The presumptions that the singularity will be likely to be beneficial is quite 
<br>
questionable.  If I didn't think our current institutions were leading us 
<br>
blindfolded off a cliff, I would want to oppose it.  I can't think of any way 
<br>
that isn't disastrous, however, and the current government (for at least the 
<br>
last 5 decades without significant change!) makes me feel that dangerous as 
<br>
it is, the singularity is likely to be safer.
