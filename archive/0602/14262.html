<em>&gt; The hypothesis that humans lose the ability to easily absorb languages as we

<em>&gt; The difficulty younger children have in acquiring language is often
</em><br>

<p>I am very skeptical of this claim.  I have known far too many adults
<br>
who moved to America after their childhood, who quickly reach a
<br>
plateau of capability with English that they then never move beyond,
<br>
despite years of trying.  For instance, I have a Chinese friend who
<br>
has developed a great vocabulary and has spoken English fluently for
<br>
years, but still uses &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; interchangeably, despite this
<br>
being pointed out to her many, many times.  (People will overlook
<br>
almost any grammatical error that doesn't hinder comprehension, but
<br>
for some reason they always jump on anyone who attributes gender
<br>
improperly, even if the meaning is clear.)
