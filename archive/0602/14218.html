<p>Comparing the relative size of two bitstrings is a valid indication of 
<br>
their relative Kolmogorov complexity if and only if they run on the same 
<br>
(or equivalent) Turing machine.
<br>
<p>In the case of DNA vs contemporary machine code, the convoluted Turing 
<br>
machine that is our physical reality which brought about life is likely 
<br>
vastly more complex than the Turing machine that is a contemporary Von 
<br>
Neumann computer, making invalid any direct size comparison (e.g. 700MB 
<br>
of DNA vs 700MB of machine code). To make a valid comparison, the 
<br>
lengths of entire bitstrings describing the respective Turing machines 
<br>
must be included. Does anyone have even a wild guess of the relative 
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity between a given meaningful amount DNA code 
<br>
(+environment) vs machine code (+environment) given a similar size code 
<br>
chunk? How many orders of magnitude difference between them?
<br>
<p>In relation to the broader thread topic, I see two possibilities:
<br>
<p>1) An intelligent system cannot prove the Friendliness of a larger 
<br>
intelligent system (more information at greater density / Kolmogorov 
<br>
complexity, i.e. the larger system being the output of recursive 
<br>
self-improvement), forcing us to make do with 99.999% &quot;probably 
<br>
Friendly&quot; rather than 100% &quot;provably Friendly&quot;
<br>
<p>2) An intelligent system can prove the Friendliness of a larger 
<br>
intelligent system, but only within certain narrow bounds including only 
<br>
certain types of small incremental increases in information size and 
<br>
density.
<br>
<p>But this is really just academic, since in either case the growth rate 
<br>
of any intelligence under strong self-modification would be severely 
<br>
slowed compared to an unconstrained intelligence, arguing yet again for 
<br>
an AI-building race (i.e. an FAI must be built first, to detect and 
<br>
mitigate unconstrained SAIs before they become larger than the FAI).
