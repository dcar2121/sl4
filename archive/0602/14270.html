<em>&gt; &gt; 2. This last bit about the maximum number of bits being bounded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your starting program.  That doesn't seem to connect to anything else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the proof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By programs in the following I shall mean programs whose kolmogorov
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity is equal to there length. That a program can know that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite number of programs that all do the same thing have the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halting likelyhood or friendliness is not interesting.
</em><br>
<p>If you limit yourself to programs whose K-complexity = their length,
<br>
then you have destroyed the point of the exercise.  A program has 1
<br>
K-complexity, so I think you are saying that &quot;The length of programs
<br>
of length n that programs of length n can be transformed into is
<br>
bounded by n&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The thrust of the argument is this. Determining friendliness (or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desired property) of a program is as hard or harder as determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether a program halts or an infinite looping program has finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; output (whether it hangs or not).  Friendlyness implies (in a logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense) the program halts.
</em><br>
<p>Determining friendiness may be as hard as determining whether a
<br>
program halts.  I don't know.  Why would friendliness imply that the
<br>
program halts?  I don't see any connection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As all the bits of the Omega Series have no relation to each other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are random so the shortest way of storing them is the direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. And so because it is as hard or harder to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendliness Phi must be equally random.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A proof system and axioms is a way of storing information about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, we shall call a starting program with embedded proof system and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many other programs can S prove the friendliness of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have said the bound on the number of programs a proof system can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have knowledge that they are friendly is the number of bits in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise it has found some hidden relation between the bits of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Phi so that it can be compressed.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're assuming, in advance, that there is no such thing as a
<br>
proof system, but that instead, all the bits of Phi must be
<br>
enumerated.  A proof system is generative, and a proof system of
<br>
finite size can prove, for example, that an infinite number of numbers
<br>
are either prime or not prime.
<br>
<p>If you assume that there is no way to prove that a program is
<br>
friendly, even then, it doesn't follow that you have to list one bit
<br>
per program you know, because you may have heuristics that allow you
<br>
to produce a prior probability for each program under consideration.
