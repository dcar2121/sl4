</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you mean the sum over 1/2^{length of the program in bits} for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halting programs, here.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The modified definition of omega, with each bit describing whether a program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halts, is actually also used (well, I've done exercises about it anyway!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although one can compute each bit sequence from the other, modified omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires a lot less computation time to deal with than omega itself.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm - I wonder if the requirement that programs be specified in a way
<br>
so that no program is the prefix of another program, means that there
<br>
are less than 2^(aleph-null) of them.  That would be necessary for
<br>
such an omega even to exist, if you don't take a stance on the
<br>
continuum hypothesis, which states that 2^(aleph-null) &gt; aleph-null
<br>
(the number of bits in omega).
<br>
<p>Yes, I think that is the case.  If, for instance, you define your
<br>
language so that a 1 bit means &quot;keep on adding more bits&quot; and a 0 bit
<br>
means &quot;end of program&quot;, the cardinality of programs is aleph-null.  My
<br>
intuition says you could show that any change in the rules that
<br>
preserved the condition that no program was the prefix of another
<br>
program did not change the number of possible programs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's true that there's no 1-1 correspondence between bits of Omega and whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual programs halt in the standard omega.  However, you can compute one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the other (basic idea: from omega you can compute the number of n-bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs that must halt, say k, from this number you can compute the actual set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of halting programs by running all n-bit programs until k of them halt).  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a correspondence between bits of Phi and programs by its definition.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think its construction was really defined.  To quote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; bit 1 is 1 iff the shortest program expressible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a programming languages (breaking ties in a defined fashion)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is friendly and has friendliness maintaining transformations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And so on with the second bit and the second shortest program.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;and so on with the second bit and the second shortest program&quot;
<br>
indicates there is only 1 program of each length.  I think he must
<br>
mean &quot;smallest&quot; (when the bitstring is interpreted as a number) rather
<br>
than &quot;shortest&quot;.  Although that introduces the possibility of having
<br>
to compare program &quot;000101&quot; to &quot;101&quot;, so we must order first by
<br>
length, then numerically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cardinality of the set of programs (prefix-free or not) *is* aleph-null i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the set of programs are countable.  This is becase there are countably many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite bitstrings.  There are uncountably many infinite bitstrings, but we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use these as programs.
</em><br>
<p>I was assuming the infinite case - out of habit, probably.  I suppose
<br>
the finite case makes more sense, even though we don't know how large
<br>
our largest bitstring will be.
