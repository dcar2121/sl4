<em>&gt;&gt;The number of friendliness preserving programs a program can safely

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Let us posit a number Phi which is equivalent to Omega but for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;friendliness. That is bit 1 is 1 iff the shortest program expressible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in a programming languages (breaking ties in a defined fashion) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;friendly and has friendliness maintaining transformations. And so on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with the second bit and the second shortest program. And omega is bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1 is 1 iff program 1 halts (I don't know whether this is the classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;definition)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega is the sum, over all programs that halt, of 1/(length of program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in bits), when programs are expressed in a way so that no program is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefix of another program (necessary so that the sum of the lengths of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all programs would be 1).  What you've defined works only if, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every n, there is exactly 1 program of length n.  Fortunately there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more than that.
</em><br>
<p>I think you mean the sum over 1/2^{length of the program in bits} for all 
<br>
halting programs, here.  In this model the set of all halting programs is prefix 
<br>
free to ensure this sum be less than or equal to 1 (that this is so is the 
<br>
content of Kraft's theorem).  Programs have to be self-delimiting if you want to 
<br>
generate them simply through successive coin clips: the computer has to tell you 
<br>
when to stop flipping the coin.
<br>
<p>The modified definition of omega, with each bit describing whether a program 
<br>
halts, is actually also used (well, I've done exercises about it anyway!). 
<br>
Although one can compute each bit sequence from the other, modified omega 
<br>
requires a lot less computation time to deal with than omega itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Knowing a bit of Phi is 1 is equivalent to knowing a bit of Omega is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1, unless not halting is friendly :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are leaving halting out of it, I think.  Actually, halting would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly, or at least neutral - a program that had halted couldn't goo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.  Anyway, the point is, Phi is about friendliness, not halting;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't confuse the two.
</em><br>
<p>Yah, I don't see the direct connection between Phi and Omega like this. 
<br>
Although halting programs could still be dangerous, if they ran long enough.
<br>
<p>One *can* generalise Omega from the probability a program halts (or 
<br>
modified-omega: the bitsequence of halting programs) to any non-trivial property 
<br>
of programs, for instance the Friendliness of a program's behaviour.  Then, by 
<br>
Rice's theorem (an analog of the halting theorem), these generalised omega's 
<br>
have the same properities as the original (I think).
<br>
<p>I don't see how this helps you, however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, there is no 1-1 correspondence between bits of Phi, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs.  The cardinality of the set of bits of Phi is aleph-null;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cardinality of the number of programs is 2^(aleph-null).  Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technically you could construct a 1-1- correspondence, if you take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuum hypothesis as false, but there's no obvious way to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit of Phi and find the program for it, or vice-versa.
</em><br>
<p>It's true that there's no 1-1 correspondence between bits of Omega and whether 
<br>
individual programs halt in the standard omega.  However, you can compute one 
<br>
from the other (basic idea: from omega you can compute the number of n-bit 
<br>
programs that must halt, say k, from this number you can compute the actual set 
<br>
of halting programs by running all n-bit programs until k of them halt).  There 
<br>
is a correspondence between bits of Phi and programs by its definition.
<br>
<p>The cardinality of the set of programs (prefix-free or not) *is* aleph-null i.e. 
<br>
the set of programs are countable.  This is becase there are countably many 
<br>
finite bitstrings.  There are uncountably many infinite bitstrings, but we don't 
<br>
use these as programs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;It would be less than that because you would have to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;into consideration the bit requirement of the machinery to transform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;your bit of Phi into a program and other things you want your program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to do. But tightening the bound is not of much interest I don't think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Anything wrong with this semi-formal proof?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two key problems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Each bit in Phi does not correspond to a program.  If you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each bit to correspond to a program, you have to construct Phi in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different manner.  If you want Phi to be a number (a sequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits), then you must be aware that claiming that you can make each bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a sequence of bits correspond to one of the set of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs, is claiming that the continuum hypothesis is false.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't a problem, as I've argued above...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. This last bit about the maximum number of bits being bounded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your starting program.  That doesn't seem to connect to anything else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the proof.
</em><br>
<p>...but this is.  More detail here, please.
