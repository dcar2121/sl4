<p>I think of it as combination because you don't have one part (the compressed 
<br>
code) working without the other (the system/environment).
<br>
<p>If we think of music files, you can have one compression format such as a WAV 
<br>
file where the music data is converted directly from an analog source into a 
<br>
simple binary format that can later be replayed essentially directly back 
<br>
through a simple hardware DAC to reproduce a close approximation of the original 
<br>
analog signal.
<br>
<p>But if you look at the MP3 format, the original analog information is compressed 
<br>
much further into a digital file size 12x or more smaller than a WAV. This is 
<br>
possible because the encoder has built in prior knowledge of the expected final 
<br>
use environment (your ears/brain), knows what it can throw away safely from the 
<br>
original signal, and also knows it will have the use of special playback 
<br>
software so it can compress the data further by encoding it in a special way for 
<br>
that specific playback software.
<br>
<p>The end result of either case for the average music listener is they hear the 
<br>
same song, but even in this simple case there are very different methods used 
<br>
and 12x different data file sizes. Now attempting to go to an example even 
<br>
further apart such as DNA vs. computer programs attempting to generate an 
<br>
intelligence as the output, I am guessing the file size differences may be even 
<br>
more than 12x, but it's hard to tell as far as I can see currently.
