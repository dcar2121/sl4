<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view has nothing to do with faith healing, but my version of the 
<br>
singularity has a lot to do with spirituality and psychedelia, as well as 
<br>
technology.  We are talking about a *universally* important event, which 
<br>
will lead to a spike of altered states of consciousness and higher states of 
<br>
consciousness.  Technology is only a means to this event.  I take this very 
<br>
seriously.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that it will happen in 2012 is speculation, but there is always 
<br>
the possibility that it could happen then, as with any other date.  There is 
<br>
also a remote possiblity that some kind of religious event could happen on 
<br>
that date, and there is also the remote possibility that the earth will 
<br>
spontaneously explode tomorrow.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have felt (especially more recently) that a lot of past, present, and 
<br>
future events and occurances happen for the Singularity.  You can look at it 
<br>
as the Singularity 'reaching out' to the past, beckoning the world to come 
<br>
forward, or you can look at it as the Singularity existing in all times, and 
<br>
not just the future.  This is just another unfounded speculation, so I do 
<br>
not try to persuade this idea onto others.  After all, it isn't science.  I 
<br>
think this way because it is an interesting way to look at things, and there 
<br>
is a bit of truth in this thought because we are moving closer to the 
<br>
singularity and not backwards.
