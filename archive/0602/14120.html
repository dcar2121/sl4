Phil, I think it is important to look at the actual cause of technological
<br>
change and try to determine if those causes are themselves accelerating in
<br>
growth. Now of course this is controversial but I think that the cause of
<br>
technological acceleration is the growth of the number and dissemination of
<br>
ideas. The growth and dissemination of ideas corresponds directly to the
<br>
number of human minds and how well those human minds are interconnected via
<br>
communication. Science is a community effort and no one can deny that that
<br>
community has grown exponentially since its inception. The Internet is not
<br>
just an invention - it is an example of the dramatic evolution of
<br>
communication that has been taking place since the advent of language and it
<br>
continues to evolve at an exponential rate. This list is just one example of
<br>
what I am talking about. It is a simple enough technology but it is very
<br>
powerful in that it allows a large group of highly intelligent and educated
<br>
people to remain in continuous real time dialogue with an aim toward solving
<br>
a very complex and important problem. During the time period before the
<br>
advent of the Internet this would not be at all possible. The closest thing
<br>
would be snail mail but the list of people receiving mail would be far
<br>
smaller and the discussion would move far more slowly. Do you understand
<br>
what I'm saying? It's all about communication and IT - and the technologies
<br>
of communication and information tech are undoubtedly growing at an
<br>
exponential rate as is the sociological enterprise that we call Science.

<em>&gt; &gt; Here's a list for 1970-present:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This list looks incredibly whittled down away from reality, Phil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've left out so many great developments, and yet included nonsense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like &quot;McCarthyism&quot; (you really can't think of equally significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instances of blacklisting BS pre-1934 and post-1970?) and &quot;affordable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air travel&quot; (you really can't think of loads of great technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that became affordable post-1970?) and postmodernism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychoanalysis (both steps *backwards*, not progress) as significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the pre-1970 list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some examples that lead me to the view that your take on this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skewed follow, mostly inline with your list, but more in the areas I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to know more about (list-creator bias, as elaborated on a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later in this paragraph). Note that I have *not* done exhaustive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research on overall technology acceleration/deceleration trends, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't go touting my opinion in either direction. Really, my underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point in responding is not that you're wrong, Phil (though I think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably are); it's that technological, scientific, &amp; cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development has far too many data points for any list created by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single person to be useful for showing anything other than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's background knowledge and biases, with some relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negligible randomness injected for the genuine attempt at searching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through history texts in attempts to create an unbiased list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, further, why all the emphasis on whether or not technology *is*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating? If a person is enthusiastic about possible future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological developments, he or she should *work on or donate to or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise support* accelerating those developments whether or not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trend-without-your-contribution is accelerating or decelerating,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of sitting around debating how fast the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great-technology-they're-not-helping-advance is or isn't advancing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transportation: airline deregulation, Space Shuttle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SpaceShipOne; automated ground vehicle transport (cf., DARPA Grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Challenge success); GPS and interactive, real-time map systems in cars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the public; commercially viable electric and hybrid cars
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Theory: QED, nanotechnology, global warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quantum computation theory; inflationary cosmology; quantum cosmology;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fermat's Last Theorem; the Standard Model of Physics (how'd you miss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this? did you try at ALL to do anything other than validate your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuition? wtf?); high-temperature superconductivity; vulnerability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ozone layer discovered; chaos &amp; fractals; de Gennes' polymer &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquid crystal theory; SENS; WMAP &amp; COBE; punctuated equilibrium;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluid mosaic model of the cell; RNA evolution; prions; proof of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Four Color Theorem; non-commutative geometry; polynomial time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primality testing; Bierbach conjecture; classification of finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, you attribute string theory to pre-1970, but only the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion was pre-1970 (1968, to be exact). The VAST majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development &amp; discovery in the field is post-1970. Supersymmetry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M-theory, D-branes, loop quantum gravity, superstring theory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitons, etc., are all post-1970.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; laser in surgery; videophones; limited sight returned to the blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and in general many brain-computer interface advancements); and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;the Internet&quot; is BS, like saying &quot;physics&quot; and thinking you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone into enough detail -- there are many significant advances in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet technology worth enumerating based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level-of-significance you've set down in your list by example; quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation implementations; DNA computing tech; Bose-Einstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condensate synthesized; Jeffreys' genetic fingerprinting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Society: Iraq wars, Watergate, gay rights, end of cold war,

<em>&gt;
