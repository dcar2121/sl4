<em>&gt; Compare 1970 to 2006 - that's a 36-year timespan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then compare 1934 to 1970, or 1888 to 1934,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or 1852 to 1888, or 1816 to 1852, or 1780 to 1816,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or 1744 to 1780, or 1708 to 1744, or 1672 to 1708 -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that anyone with any knowledge of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of those time periods could say anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the technological, epistemological, and cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change during them - in Western society - was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater than during the period 1970-2006.
</em><br>
<p>not to disgaree outright, and without postulating any kind detailed
<br>
analysis, but there does seem to have been a fair whack of
<br>
'technological, epistemological, and cultural change' in last 36
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>To go on anecdotal terms for a third of that timespan, the 12 years up
<br>
until now since I graduated high school have seen a fair few changes:
<br>
<p>The Internet, 94-2005. Not arpanet or bbs's, but
<br>
usenet-&gt;www-&gt;im/p2p/web2.0. The current usage exceeds one billion
<br>
citizens - i.e a 6th of world's population (from:
<br>
<a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm</a>. another good page:
<br>
<a href="http://mmogchart.com/">http://mmogchart.com/</a>). From thousands to over a billion users in 12
<br>
years is a fairly hefty technological+cultural shift, I would think.
<br>
<p>Microsoft, 94-2005. We went from a few PC's in some offices at the
<br>
beginning of  94 to a PC on every desk in every office by the end of
<br>
05. from 3.1, to 95, to 98, and now XP. The addition of a personal
<br>
computer to the effective intelligence of these users is a huge leap,
<br>
especially for the solitaire|myspace|msoffice-level of user population
<br>
who in previous eras had far less input into the realms of culture,
<br>
media and technology. For more tech/culture love think of the
<br>
cellphones, PDAs, laptops, digital cameras, 3D video cards, iPods of
<br>
today vs. the end of 93...
<br>
<p>Science,Engineering,Nanotech, 94-2005. I'm not a super science geek,
<br>
just a tech nerd, so I can't give an even near fair accout of this
<br>
realm, but here's a few:  X-Prize. Mars rovers. Carbon composite,
<br>
Kevlar, Polymers. 45nm chip fab processes. Synthetics - drugs, sugar,
<br>
textiles. Hubble, Cosmological imaging advances and theory changes.
<br>
Climate modelling. Ever taller towers - Petronas, 101 etc. Huge
<br>
infrastructure projects, especially in Asia. Buckytubes. The latest
<br>
triumph sports bike. The stealth fighters/bombers.
<br>
<p>Medicine,Biotech 94-2005. Again, I'm far from an expert: Researchers
<br>
capturing video from cat's brains. Human genome. Cloning. Biotech.
<br>
Cancer cures. Brain imaging. Transplant advances. everything as
<br>
keyhole surgery. RNA interference. Gene therapies. Quadraplegics
<br>
controlling mice via in-brain chips. plastic surgery. drugs for
<br>
everything - the brain enchancing drugs are a great example
<br>
(<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1528069,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1528069,00.html</a>).
<br>
<p>Culture, 94-2005. I probably can't come even close to capturing this,
<br>
but here goes. I'm a drum'n'bass nut. Do you guys have any idea of the
<br>
number of techno genres? From garage to darkstep to happy hardcore to
<br>
trance and dozens in between. Mashups. Raves.  Ecstasy and marijuana
<br>
use - the amount of young people off their face every weekend in
<br>
western cities is truly staggering. Group teenage sex. Piercing,
<br>
branding, implanting. Guerilla art (e.g. banksy). Blogging. Stay at
<br>
home dads. Metrosexuals. Same sex marriage. Neoconservatism. Islamic
<br>
fanaticism. Steroids. Reality TV. Celebrity porn (e.g. Pam,Paris)
<br>
<p>there's got to be a host more of these kinds of examples in all sorts
<br>
of arenas, and not to say in any way that some of these things didn't
<br>
exist prior to 94; but their manifestation now is a very different
<br>
animal. The pace of change doesn't seem to be slowing down as much as
<br>
going down different pathways. The lack of manned moon/space missions
<br>
may annoy space opera aficionados (trekkies) but the fact is they're
<br>
pointless in the short term and we should have always been sending
<br>
machines. But when I think of the life, technology use and culture of
<br>
a 13 year old girl in 70's versus one of today, I think maybe that her
<br>
world has definitely moved forward, even in Captain Kirk is still as
<br>
much a fanstasy now as he was then...
