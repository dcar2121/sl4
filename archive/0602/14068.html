I extend my sympathies to those who live in societies dominated by faith.
<br>
<p>I don't get that feeling around here.  Australian society is hardly 
<br>
rational, but fideism fortunately doesn't hold the majority.
<br>
<p>If people are worried about kooky religious ideas dampening AGI research, 
<br>
there are plenty of societies that are dominated by all sorts of other 
<br>
whacky paradigms.
<br>
<p>As far as I can see, secular societies haven't got this way by a series of 
<br>
catchy slogans and populism.  They got that way by robust debate
<br>
<p>(more)

<em>&gt;- but this is the position I take on religion (and a bunch of other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agressively in oppostion, in order to balance the playing field.
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone recall the Galilean dialogues on FAI... 
<br>
<a href="http://www.sl4.org/wiki/DialogueOnFriendliness">http://www.sl4.org/wiki/DialogueOnFriendliness</a> ,
<br>
<p>Cathryn says that next time, she's changing her preferences from an even 
<br>
part of the cake to ALL of the cake, in order to offset Dennis's preference 
<br>
for all of the cake?
<br>
<p>Overshooting the mark with rationality's place in society is the same thing. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like a school board actually prescribing the teaching of Flying 
<br>
Spagghetti Monsterism for the sake of balance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;my 'aggressive in opposition' approach is like 'affirmative action'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for science; I don't believe equal rights would have gotten anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without militant feminists, and I don't believe technology enthusiasts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will get anywhere without militant rationalists;
</em><br>
<p>I'm suddenly reminded of Tom Lehrer:
<br>
<p>&quot;there are some people in this world who do not love their fellow human 
<br>
beings, and I HATE people like that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;rational (liberal)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought is just too wishy-washy. (to qualify the washiness moniker,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compare the mob-chant characteristics of  'respect the cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heritage of others in order to foster a mutually harmonious society'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;versus 'fuck the niggers')
</em><br>
<p>The problem is not being moderate.  The problem is your slogan writer.
<br>
<p>Some nicer pro-multicultural slogans are:
<br>
<p>&quot;Celebrate cultural diversity!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Unity in diversity!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Reject the myths of Racism!&quot;
<br>
or even
<br>
&quot;Fuck the niggers!&quot; ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The idea is that society is dominated by non-rational forces; fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stoked by a go-with-what-rates media, a go-with-what-polls leadership,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that kind of thing. To get to a  halfway-point where both faith and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationailty are accorded equal measure,
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, who wants a 50/50 emphasis on faith and rationality?  I sure as hell 
<br>
don't.
<br>
<p>It's NOT rational to accord Faith equal measure as Rationality.
<br>
<p>Get the goals straight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;we can't promote the equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measure as the deal we seek; if we do so we'll end up compromising to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;halfway between what we want and what we have, which means a quarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational versus three-quarters not; still no balance, and a continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt;marginalization of critical thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By fighting for 100% rationality, the dickering process should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hopefully playout to 50/50 rationalism/faith, which is OK with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People seem to object to 'Darwins Rottweiler' as being too extreme,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but I think 'Fundamentalist Futurists' are exactly what is needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Militant rationalism people - Can we get a poster of 'Uncle Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants YOU!' pointing at us? :-)
</em><br>
<p>Well, I want a picture of Eliezer doing the chicken dance, but I don't know 
<br>
what good it would do.  Neither of those pictures is going to help the 
<br>
Singularity Institute.
