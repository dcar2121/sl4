This *ISN'T* a sharp distinction.
<br>
<p>We have actually ALREADY reached the point where many computer programs 
<br>
self-modify.  I can practically guarantee that they aren't friendly, as they 
<br>
don't even have any model at all of the world external to the computer.  It's 
<br>
hard to be friendly if you don't know that anyone's there.  (A chain of 
<br>
increasingly less relevant examples of self modifying code follows.)
<br>
<p>P.S.:  Check out: Evolutionary algorithms, Genetic Programming, Self 
<br>
Optimizing Systems, and Self Organizing systems.  You might also look into 
<br>
Core War and Tierra.  These are all (currently) quite primitive, but they are 
<br>
actual self-modifying code.
<br>
<p>P.P.S.:  For another example, out of my own experience, back around 1975 I had 
<br>
the occasion to study a sort library being used at LBL (we were renting time 
<br>
on their computer).  A piece of it was coded in assembler, and when I 
<br>
investigated it, it turned out that one particular instruction within it 
<br>
would be modified when it was called to do different comparisons depending on 
<br>
input values.  I.e., the assembler code re-wrote itself.   This was the first 
<br>
time that I encountered it, but it was considered a very &quot;elegant&quot; thing to 
<br>
do, to save a few words of run-time memory by using self-modifying code.  It 
<br>
was hard to do it in a High Level Language, like Fortran, however, so the 
<br>
routines that would do it were usually in assembler.
<br>
<p>Additionally:  Pretty much every LISP program I've ever encountered used 
<br>
self-modifying code.  It's one of the basic techniques.  When the program is 
<br>
a list, and your language CALLS itself a list processor, it just begs to be 
<br>
used that way.  Think of this WRT every language that has an EVAL command, 
<br>
but it can even be done in C if you work at it a bit.  (At most you need to 
<br>
execute a shell script that compiles and links code that your program 
<br>
modifies while it's running.)
