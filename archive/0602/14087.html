<em>&gt; The dictionary definition of faith is &quot;a firm belief

<em>&gt; There is copious evidence that the rate of

I understand your opinions, and pretty much agree with them.  OTOH, the 
<br>
previous time I speculated wildly based on a trend curve, I was considerably 
<br>
disappointed.  It was a simpler model, but that doesn't imply that the more 
<br>
complex one is necessarily correct.
<br>
<p>Most people projecting the singularity say something like &quot;baring a 
<br>
catastrophe&quot; or &quot;if this goes on&quot;.  It seems to me that this is the correct 
<br>
attitude, and with that attitude it isn't a question of faith, but projection 
<br>
without certainty.  Once you try to create certainty about what the future 
<br>
will bring, you enter the realm of faith.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, there are uncertainties.  Maybe improvements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in computers will hit a brick wall before you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough power to run an AI.  But to claim we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on faith, i.e. with no evidence to back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our beliefs, is to ignore all the progress in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science and technology to date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DRN
</em><br>
<p>So the distinction between whether it's faith or theorizing without complete 
<br>
information comes down to whether or not you claim certainty.  If you do, 
<br>
then it's faith based.  If not, not.  (Not being faith based isn't equivalent 
<br>
to being scientific.  But it does make it possible to hold a conversation.)
