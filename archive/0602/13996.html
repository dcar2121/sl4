</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure we're different. I don't think the Singularity is inevitable.
<br>
In fact, I can think of three plausible scenarios in which it never happens,
<br>
and there might be a fourth and fifth for all I know.
<br>
<p>I will claim the Singularity is _possible_. Parallel: socialism was
<br>
certainly possible; check.
<br>
<p>Desirable? Socialism is a political state, and turned out to be undesirable
<br>
for political reasons. The Singularity is a technical state; whether or not
<br>
it's desirable will depend entirely on the associated politics. Parallel:
<br>
not applicable; this is a separate question.
<br>
<p>Necessary? Yes. Without the Singularity, we die. Maybe early, maybe later,
<br>
but die nonetheless. Again, parallel not applicable, because this is _not_ a
<br>
prediction of the future. In the absence of a Singularity, the loss of
<br>
everything we value will occur _independently_ of the reasons why it didn't
<br>
happen, because the reasons for this fate are not about the contingencies of
<br>
history; they are about the shape of the adaptive landscape. Put simply,
<br>
neither civilization nor humanity as we know them are stable; they are not
<br>
even in equilibrium. The current state of affairs isn't persistent; like a
<br>
rocket flying through the air, we will either keep going up, or we will go
<br>
down, but the one thing we won't do is just hang suspended in mid air.
<br>
<p>I think that adequately addresses the parallels.
