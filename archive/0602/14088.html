</em><br>
<p>Their chances are better if they try than if they don't.  The possible 
<br>
benefits if they succeed are quite large.  The possible costs if the first AI 
<br>
out of the bottle is unfriendly are quite high.
<br>
<p>If you want to bet on another group to produce a friendly AI, go for it.  The 
<br>
chances of any one group are quite small.  (And in my estimation, the actual 
<br>
initial AI will be unintentional, and rather task focused.  I.e., not have 
<br>
instincts that will cause it to attempt to take over everything.  But what if 
<br>
I'm wrong?  And if I'm right, what about the second one?)
<br>
<p>We have the best chances for survival if the first AI is friendly, and has 
<br>
instincts that attempt to ensure that any dominant AI will also be friendly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though it might be a very bad thing for nonFriendly GAI to emerge first,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; if so, perhaps the Institute needs to put all its resources into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researching and evangelizing Friendliness, then teaming up with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's leading GAI researchers -- whether at MIT, Stanford, or wherever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are -- to add Friendliness to their development program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joshua
</em><br>
<p>No.  Most of those working on AIs are working on task focused AIs, and will 
<br>
not be susceptible to evangelizing.  Therefore, while it's reasonable for 
<br>
them to devote some amount of time and effort to &quot;spreading the word&quot;, this 
<br>
amount should be strictly limited.  Most of it should be left to those who 
<br>
AREN'T working on building an AI.
