<p>
Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're trying to solve a decision problem: whether to try for FAI or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rush for the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I am not trying to solve exactly that decision problem; I am
<br>
working on AGI and FAI at the same time and trying to understand the
<br>
relation between them....
<br>
<p>At some point my colleagues and I may need to try hard to solve that
<br>
decision problem in a more rigid sense -- if I have a powerful AGI on
<br>
hand and I have to decide whether to set a switch that will let it
<br>
start self-modifying and hence potentially move toward hard takeoff. 
<br>
I am not at that point now....
<br>
<p>I have however decided to spend more of my time working on AGI design
<br>
and engineering than on FAI theory...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In order to solve a decision problem, you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to apply a decision theory.
</em><br>
<p>This is not necessarily true, actually...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The most powerful and general decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory we have is based on Bayesian Probability Theory.
</em><br>
<p>Well, probability theory is very valuable when one has enough data to
<br>
feed into it.  In the case of the particular decision you cite, I
<br>
don't think there is enough data that current probability-theory
<br>
methods are very helpful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe you think that BPT-based decision theory is imperfect, but your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indifference-based decision theory is weaker and less powerful than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian decision theory.
</em><br>
<p>I am not basing any of my own personal or professional decisions on an
<br>
&quot;indifference-based decision theory,&quot; at least not consciously or
<br>
explicitly.
<br>
<p>I cited the indifference principle very explicitly as part of a
<br>
(possibly misguided) attempt to clarify SOMEONE ELSE'S ARGUMENT made
<br>
on this list, not as part of a presentation of my own point of view. 
<br>
I'm sorry that this led to misunderstanding.  I believe I was quite
<br>
explicit in my wording, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're not confident enough in Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision theory to solve this problem, then you need to develop a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger decision theory, not a weaker one!
</em><br>
<p>In fact I have spent a fair bit of effort working on ways to augment
<br>
probability theory with heuristics that are effective in cases when
<br>
there is not enough data to apply current probabilistic methods.  (In
<br>
principle I consider this a weak way out, because I have a feeling
<br>
that &quot;purer&quot; probabilistic methods probably do suffice for all cases
<br>
of pragmatic reasoning in the classical-physics domain: but
<br>
probability math is far from fully developed, and in practice there
<br>
are a lot of practical decision problems where there is not enough
<br>
data to make judgments using known probability methods.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As a side point: After all, the general applicability of classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability theory is *already* in question even within the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world, via Youssef's quantum probability theory...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I talk about Probability Theory, I mean in the Bayesian sense. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's a conflict between QM and Bayesian Probability Theory, you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to point it out to me.
</em><br>
<p>The precise nature of the conflict depends on the QM formalism that you choose.
<br>
<p>You can choose quantum logic + classical probability theory, or you
<br>
can choose Boolean logic + complex probability theory.
<br>
<p>See the papers here
<br>
<p><a href="http://physics.bu.edu/~youssef/quantum/quantum_refs.html">http://physics.bu.edu/~youssef/quantum/quantum_refs.html</a>
<br>
<p>for information on the latter option
<br>
<p>Either approach formalizes the way in which the quantum world violates
<br>
standard probability theory.
<br>
