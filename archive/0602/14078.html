<em>&gt;Yes, I know that they are working on _Friendly_ GAI. But my question is: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What reason is there to think that the Institute has any real chance of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;winning the race to General Artificial Intelligence of any sort, beating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out those thousands of very smart GAI researchers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There is no particular reason(s) I can think of that make the Institute more 
<br>
likely to develop AGI than any other organization with skilled developers. 
<br>
It’s all a fog. The only way to see if their ideas have any merit is to try 
<br>
them out. Also, I suspect their donations would increase if they showed some 
<br>
proofs of concept. It’s all speculative at this point.
<br>
<p>As for predicting success or failure, the best calibrated answer is to 
<br>
predict failure to anyone attempting to build a GAI. You would be right most 
<br>
of the time and wrong probably only once or right all the time (o dear, 
<br>
heresy).
<br>
<p>That doesn't mean it isn’t worth trying. By analogy, think of AGI developers 
<br>
as individual sperm trying to reach the egg. The odds of any individual are 
<br>
incredibly small but the reward is so good it would be a shame not to try. 
<br>
Also, FAI has to be developed only once for all to benefit.
