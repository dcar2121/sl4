<p>
Recommendation, seriously study some game theory and decision theory (you 
<br>
should anyway).  The first point is a well known discovery.  Lots of logic 
<br>
puzzles/games are based on it.
<br>
It's best that the belief that knowledge is inherently desirable be
<br>
a) probablistic
<br>
b) non-exhaustive, e.g. other values that might sometimes be desirable can 
<br>
sometimes conflict with knowledge
<br>
c) dependent on the relevant definition of knowledge
<br>
and
<br>
d) recognized as dependent on the relevant utility function
<br>
In fact, for most common situations and most common utility functions, 
<br>
knowledge when defined in certain ways is extrinsically desirable.  For a 
<br>
much smaller set of utility functions it is intrinsically desirable.  Since 
<br>
humans don't have utility functions, the actual situation is very 
<br>
problematic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that you would consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability to detach our happiness from outcomes to others Unfriendly. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to say, that breaking of empathy, or conferring control to a subject of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes them happy, or their emotional attachments, would be Unfriendly. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disagree here.
</em><br>
<p>I don't say that outright.  I say that I would be very skeptical of a FAI 
<br>
dynamic that did this in a rapid and thorough fashion.  It's not proof of 
<br>
Unfriendlyness, but is evidence for subtle failure of friendlyness.  Making 
<br>
all humans FAIs is almost definitely Unfriendly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As I said before, though, you've raised good points, and I'll think further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on this.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  I hope it leads to something useful.
