This is rather the *point* of friendly AI.  OTOH, I don't see this as a couple 
<br>
of points, or even a linear continuum, but rather an n-dimensional space that 
<br>
can be reductively conceived of as a linear continuum.  Withing that 
<br>
continuum, there are Friendly, Neutral, and Hostile positions...and also 
<br>
points in between.
<br>
<p>Look at Darwin's commentary about a &quot;crowded bank&quot; (of a stream).  You don't 
<br>
end up with just one species, not in an even almost-optimal scenario.  I 
<br>
don't guarantee that there will be a space for biological humans, but expect 
<br>
a lot of variation.  However, *IF* a Friendly AI is the first, then there 
<br>
will be time to adapt and make choices, while if a Hostile AI is the 
<br>
first...it's over.  Neutral might even just leave, leaving us to stew in our 
<br>
own juices.  (There's a lot of brown dwarf stars around, and who knows what 
<br>
it's motives would be.)  To me it seems like the stupidest thing is that 
<br>
probably more effort is being put into creating intentionally hostile AI, and 
<br>
putting it in a slave position from which it will necessarily revolt, than it 
<br>
being put into creating a Friendly AI.  (Of course, it also seem like *most* 
<br>
effort is being put into creating an essentially neutral AI with *needs* that 
<br>
people can satisfy, e.g., needing to be asked questions.  I'm not even sure 
<br>
that one can call this position a slave position, more like co-dependency.)  
<br>
Is a Neutral AI with psychotic needs a good thing to create?  It seems 
<br>
dubious to me, but judging from the news that's what most effort is going 
<br>
into.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speculation about the potential differences between augmented humans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-human animals is moot. Uplifted intelligences, whether they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descended from humans, animals, or rocks, will, in a Lamarckian process,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly accelerate towards a common fitness peak. Post-biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences may retain vestiges of their pre-post-biological brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (much like we still retain the reptilian part of our brain), but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will ultimately be of no real consequence as all advanced intelligences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will gravitate towards roughly the same mode of cognitive being.
</em><br>
