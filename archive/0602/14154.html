<p>I'm glad you don't endorse him.  Gould's mathematics would suck if he 
<br>
had any, and he is widely regarded as not only a fool but dishonest in 
<br>
his presentation of evolutionary theory.  The actual cheerleader in real 
<br>
evolutionary biology against notions of inevitable convergence is George 
<br>
Williams, who knows the math and has an excellent reputation among real 
<br>
evolutionary theorists.
