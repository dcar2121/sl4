<p>You're trying to solve a decision problem: whether to try for FAI or
<br>
rush for the Singularity. In order to solve a decision problem, you need
<br>
to apply a decision theory. The most powerful and general decision
<br>
theory we have is based on Bayesian Probability Theory.
<br>
<p>Maybe you think that BPT-based decision theory is imperfect, but your
<br>
Indifference-based decision theory is weaker and less powerful than
<br>
Bayesian decision theory. If you're not confident enough in Bayesian
<br>
decision theory to solve this problem, then you need to develop a
<br>
stronger decision theory, not a weaker one!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a side point: After all, the general applicability of classical
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>When I talk about Probability Theory, I mean in the Bayesian sense. If
<br>
there's a conflict between QM and Bayesian Probability Theory, you'll
<br>
have to point it out to me.
