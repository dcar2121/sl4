<p>Agreed, but alternative environments and the ongoing presence of 
<br>
&quot;individuals&quot; will be the gravy of postbiological existence -- these 
<br>
will be the &quot;recreational&quot; spaces within which future intelligences will 
<br>
reside. Intelligences (or a meta-intelligent being) will still need to 
<br>
assume an optimized mode as it operates in the physical world, and it is 
<br>
within this space that I suspect a common optimized mode of cognitive 
<br>
being will be attained. Intelligences may be constrained and &quot;directed&quot; 
<br>
by the laws of physics and the social realities of living among other 
<br>
advanced agents. I know this smacks of environmental determinism, but I 
<br>
believe that to be the case.
<br>
<p>This discussion has reminded me of Stephen J. Dick who, in his 2003 
<br>
paper &quot;Cultural Evolution, the Postbiological Universe and SETI,&quot; put 
<br>
forth the &quot;Intelligence Principle,&quot; in which he declared that &quot;the 
<br>
maintenance, improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence 
<br>
is the central driving force of cultural evolution, and that to the 
<br>
extent intelligence can be improved, it will be improved.&quot;
<br>
<p>[sorry, out of time to respond to other comments, and I won't have 
<br>
access to a computer this weekend. I'll resume this on Monday]
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
George
