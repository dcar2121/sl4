<em>&gt;&gt; Now, I have a hypothesis that this hammer in my hand is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; illusion. An easy way to try to falsify that will be to swing it down
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on my hand and see if it hurts or not. (&quot;Ow!&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That pain doesn't prove the hammer is not an illusion -- not unless you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopting a very odd and narrow definition of &quot;illusion.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, it does not. The pan-critical rationalist knows he must
<br>
continuously test hypotheses. Merely because his measurement today
<br>
makes Newton look right does not mean in the future he will not find a
<br>
flaw that makes Einstein look more right.
<br>
<p>However, the pan-critical rationalist can test hypotheses only if they
<br>
are falsifiable. Non-falsifiable hypotheses don't work very well in
<br>
his epistemology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Now, we are presented with this idea of an Absolute Morality. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fascinating concept -- but sadly, non-falsifiable. Indeed, I'm told
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; about dozens of Absolute Moralities, all of which claim to be *the*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Absolute Morality and all of which seem to have this same property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; non-falsifiability. I therefore see it as a fine class of ideas to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ignore for the present, no matter how interesting they may be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as a scientist, I find that many non-falsifiable ideas are worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying attention to --- they can be quite inspirational conceptually....
</em><br>
<p>Can you give an example of an idea that is not falsifiable even in
<br>
principle that is conceptually inspirational?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Just as a rock has a kind of &quot;partial objectivity&quot; that distinguishes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; from more thoroughly subjective things like hallucinations and delusions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; so, perhaps, does compassion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can you give evidence for this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did arrive at this view through &quot;evidence&quot;, but the evidence is of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly squishy sort...
</em><br>
<p>I tend to prefer my evidence well baked -- if it is still batter, send
<br>
it back to the oven.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's experiential rather than empirical.  I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain these experiences in detail, but it would be a lot of work, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think it would be very useful to anyone in this forum.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, it is the heart of our discussion. Can you produce an
<br>
objective and absolute morality to feed in to the Friendly AI? If not,
<br>
the project seems to have a bit of rot right at the core.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; The question is never whether X has objective, absolute reality or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Nothing does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Again, most hypotheses are falsifiable. &quot;There is a gorilla in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; room&quot; can be tested by searching for the gorilla. &quot;Compassion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; universal&quot; could be checked by noting the quaint practices of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Innuit involving placing grandma on the ice floe when she couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; care for herself any more. &quot;There Is An Absolute Morality&quot; can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; checked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; And the point is not to argue that X is subjective, therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; meaningless -- that kind of nihilism was already found wanting by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and the whole proto-existentialist crew.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Nietzsche is just pietzsche by me -- why do you find him wanting? :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche was far from a falsificationist -- he believed that the powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind creates its own reality, and that scientific method is ultimately a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crutch for the weak-minded who, too lame to create reality, have to merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study it instead...
</em><br>
<p>I think that's a bit of an exaggeration. It would be better to say
<br>
that he felt that the strong create their own morality -- not that the
<br>
strong minded can will rocks into existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to agree with him on those points (though I guess you don't, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're evidently such a Popperian).  However, I find his moral philosophy a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit incomplete, and I find it amusing that he was a quite compassionate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual on a personal level, in spite of wrongly disparaging all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion as &quot;pity&quot; in some of his philosophical writings.
</em><br>
<p>I find that consistent. He was not arguing for cruelty -- he was
<br>
arguing against morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have read Karl Popper, and while I appreciated his work, I didn't find it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so compelling that I feel the need to fit all my ideas into his framework.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you familiar with the later philosophy-of-science work by Imre Lakatos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Paul Feyerabend (two friends who did not agree with each other, but both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had interesting and deep ideas about how science is actually done, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different in many respects from what Popper claimed).  I would be curious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you respond to their critiques of Popper's falsificationist perspective.
</em><br>
<p>I have heard of them but have yet to read them. I'd appreciate
<br>
recommendations of reasonable starting points in their works.
