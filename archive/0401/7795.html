<em>&gt;&gt; There is a popular conception of evolution &quot;bloody in tooth and

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; within the context that it is intended, but it leads to paradox due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the (misleading) implication that humans are somehow outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolution or about to transcend evolution.  True, evolution on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; planet has arrived at a new phase, where a higher level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; organization now allows for more effective progress than ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; before, but it's important to see that in the bigger picture this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just another phase in a process of evolution that has been going on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for as far back as we can see.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that it is confusing to claim that all just because we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resultant from an evolutionary process that everything that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequently become, no matter how chosen and directly shaped by us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still evolution at work.  It is not paradoxical to me in the least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to speak of transcending evolution.   The alternative to transcending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution is being evolution-determined forever.
</em><br>
<p>To clarify:  Humans are already well into transcending biological evolution,
<br>
but we are fully enmeshed in the more fundamental ongoing process of
<br>
evolution that I refer to.  It's not the gene that is central to the
<br>
process; it's the information that continues to evolve.  &quot;We&quot; are each a
<br>
temporary (and subjectively defined) instantiation of a portion of this
<br>
information pattern and now have the privilege (from our subjective point of
<br>
view) of being able to influence the direction of the process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Evolutionary science has identified various modes within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; biological model, but I think we're on the verge of understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the same underlying principle operates at the pre-biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; atomic and molecular levels, and at the post-biological level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human societies, and beyond. This principle seems (to me) to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same principle underlying the thermodynamic &quot;arrow of time&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; higher level instances of non-zero sum game theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are calling &quot;evolutionary science&quot; something much borader
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than is usually associated with the term &quot;evolution&quot;.  This leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion.  If you broaden the term enough you can of course stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything and everything under it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'm trying to make it clear that there is a deeper evolutionary
<br>
principle at work than the usual limited biological focus.  I think this
<br>
broader concept promotes greater understanding rather than the undefined
<br>
vagueness you referred to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think the idea of an &quot;objective morality&quot; is a misconception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Morality is context-dependent, and the universe will always present
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; us with a new layer of the onion when we're ready to see it.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because morality is context-dependent, a wider context generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; means a more consistent, more useful, understanding of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; moral.  Only in the ultimate &quot;god's eye&quot; view of a universe beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; space and time would there be an objective morality, but as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humans expand our understanding (our context) and become more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; godlike in our understanding of the universe it seems clear to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that we become more moral (by any useful definition of the word.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are confusing &quot;objective&quot; with &quot;context independent&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by implication confusing it with &quot;absolute&quot;.  All knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contextual, not just those aspects subsumed under Ethics.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge is contextual does not mean it is not objective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectivity exists within the context of what is known.  There are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite contexts just as there are no infinite real-world spacetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extents.  So to require such before one can claim that any knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is objective is unreasonable to the extreme.  This notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requiring an infinite context to be objective grew out of the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when philosophy was the &quot;handmaiden of theology&quot;.   We should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the mistake of falling back upon such assumptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, I of course agree that a greater context leads to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refined and widely applicable knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Evolution is not a random walk, but it is chaotic.  I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with a greater undertanding of non-linear dynamics, we will develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not an &quot;objective morality&quot;, but a &quot;science of morality&quot; that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be effectively applied to moral and political issues on a planetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (and eventually wider) scale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would you assume that objectivity rules out non-linear dynamics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or chaotic systems?
</em><br>
<p>I could have been a lot clearer in that last paragraph.  I'm not implying
<br>
anything like the way you took it.
<br>
<p>I was trying to use shorthand to say something more like this:
<br>
<p>The (more fundamental) evolutionary process involves randomness, but it is
<br>
not a random walk such as could be understood through common statistical
<br>
methods.  Likewise, as Hume pointed out, we could find a rule that would
<br>
properly define the current data set (the evolutionary history up until now)
<br>
but this would not allow us to predict with confidence the next state in the
<br>
evolutionary process.  However, through an improved understanding of
<br>
non-linear dynamics (complexity/chaos), which as a science is still in its
<br>
infancy, I think we will learn ways to much better characterize the nature
<br>
and bounds of the (more fundamental) process as evolution proceeds from the
<br>
biological domain made up of cells, to the social domain made up of
<br>
individual people and further to more complex levels of organization.
<br>
<p>The near-term practical value of this coming &quot;science of morality&quot; will be
<br>
that we will apply it to our understanding of moral and political issues on
<br>
a planetary scale, a domain where our current knowledge is woefully
<br>
inadequate and ineffective, such that our moral and political choices are in
<br>
better accord with the fundamental nature of which we will always be a part.
