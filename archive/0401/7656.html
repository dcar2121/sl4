<em>&gt; You can't separate the issue of the intensity of negative qualia from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of the intensity of positive qualia.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't trying to do that but to separate two different issues: the issue
<br>
of the moral desirability of getting rid of negative qualia with the issue
<br>
of moral desirability of maximizing positive qualia by whatever means
<br>
(orgasmium). Because the first is more urgent and less controversial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliminating negative qualia, at least in the context of human psychology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would eliminate positive qualia as well.  The extent to which this will
</em><br>
also
<br>
<em>&gt; be true for AI's is an interesting question.  There's no doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy like Nietzsche's, while deep and penetrating, is to an extent a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct reflection of aspects of human psychology.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From a humanistic perspective you are quite right, but I am talking in
</em><br>
strictly physical terms.
<br>
<p>There has got to be some mechanism, a phenomenon, that is associated with
<br>
negative and positive qualia. To make everything nicer, you remove the
<br>
physical cause which generates negative emotions. No shrink can do it
<br>
obviously, because the brain was designed to work with this regulatory
<br>
mechanism called suffering firmly in place, and we grew up with suffering
<br>
playing an important part of our lives. So I see how your argument could
<br>
refuse a &quot;let's make the perfect society&quot; kind of proposal, but I don't
<br>
believe what you mentioned precludes the possibility of eliminating the
<br>
physical cause of negative qualia.
<br>
<p>An example: I know that when windows crashes I have a problem. I solve that
<br>
problem logically without experiencing negative qualia (until I think of
<br>
bill making money out of it). But take my foot. I can imagine experiencing
<br>
no pain, and know consciously that there is a fracture. I would then behave
<br>
rationally, avoid putting my weight on it, and seek medical assistance. On
<br>
the other hand you could preserve the sensation of soft, warm, etc. so your
<br>
pink fluffy slippers still feel good.
<br>
<p>Feeling that you have a fracture and feeling that you are wearing slippers
<br>
are very different qualia; the fact that different circumstances can trigger
<br>
them selectively indicates they can occur without the other one ever
<br>
occurring. Indeed, I was able to appreciate fluffy slippers before I ever
<br>
had a foot fracture. In the same way I suppose it could be possible for
<br>
people to experience health without being sick, experience friendship
<br>
without ever experiencing hate, and so forth. Common objection: but then we
<br>
won't know how valuable these things are because we will take them for
<br>
granted! Reply: great, I'm perfectly ok with not knowing what it is like to
<br>
live without a leg, and go on underappreciating the fact I have two. :)
<br>
<p>Of course I don't know anything about negative qualia except they suck so I
<br>
can't say for sure it is physically doable to remove them once you have a
<br>
goal system subject to negative reinforcement and a decently complex
<br>
self-centric simulation attached to it; but, if it can be done, I maintain
<br>
that it should be done and this should be the arrow of morality.
