<em>&gt; I don't think there can be an objective morality, but I wonder if there
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; be an &quot;objective&quot; (in some sense) set of system-theoretic criteria for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessing ethical systems (which would not pertain to the actual content
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; these systems).
</em><br>
<p>Isn't it the same thing? Having an objective way of determining which
<br>
subjective theories of morality are good and which are not, would amount to
<br>
being able to choose one objectively good morality. I suppose if you can
<br>
prove that an objective morality does not exist, then you would also have
<br>
proved that an objective way to choose good moralities also does not
<br>
exist....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But are you assuming that the evaluation of positive versus negative
</em><br>
qualia
<br>
<em>&gt; in the universe can be done in an objective, theory-independent way?  It
</em><br>
<p>It comes down to exactly this. I have no clue how to build a quale detector,
<br>
since we still don't know how qualia are generated. So _if_ this
<br>
conversation comes down to &quot;I agree in principle, but what to do in
<br>
practice?&quot; then I would suggest:
<br>
<p>We could first of all use the only data point we have (our own perception)
<br>
and apply it to similar systems (other people, mammals). Since I find a high
<br>
degree of correlation between experiencing negative qualia and certain
<br>
neuronal activation patterns in my brain, then even without a qualia
<br>
detector I can say with some degree of certainty (provided other people are
<br>
not zombies) that creating such patterns in other human brains is not right.
<br>
<p>So in the short term there won't be a big difference between common sense
<br>
morality and qualia-based morality. Except on some crucial issues (abortion
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p>In the long run however, IF we figure out qualia, we'd have a good tool to
<br>
really do what's good, an objective moral science, a supergoal spontaneously
<br>
arising from the parameters of our existence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; quality of an ethical system founded on positive-qualia-maximization (in
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; sense, with whatever complex provisos, etc.) is tied to the quality of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific research programme within which its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive-versus-negative-qualia-balance-estimation theoretical framework
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. The efficiency of a machine that maximizes A versus B depends on
<br>
how well these two variables are defined. My suggestion has been from the
<br>
beginning to have the AI have &quot;figure out qualia&quot; as an intermediate goal
<br>
before it starts doing big changes in the universe which will affect many
<br>
sentients...
