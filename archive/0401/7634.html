</em><br>
<p>Yup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that your key assumption is one of very cheap defense - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once one SI has grabbed some resources you seem to posit that there is

</em><br>
<p>I agree that this is a key assumption.  However, the assumption can fail
<br>
and still bar natural selection, if there is little variation in
<br>
preferences or little variation in resource-grabbing capacity or little
<br>
correlation between the two.  Since I suspect that intelligence would use
<br>
up almost all the potential variation before what we ordinarily think of
<br>
as heritable capacities had the chance to operate, natural selection would
<br>
not automatically follow even if there were frequent combats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given this, I suppose the rest of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario might plausibly follow, but I'm not sure why you believe this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption.
</em><br>
<p>I tend to suspect that between two similar intelligent agents, combat will
<br>
be too uncertain to be worthwhile, will consume fixed resources, and will
<br>
produce negative externalities relative to surrounding agents.  Let us
<br>
assume that loss aversion (not just in the modern human psychological
<br>
sense of aversion to losses as such, but in the sense of loss aversion
<br>
emergent in diminishing marginal utility) does not apply, so that a 50/50
<br>
chance of winning - which goes along with the argument of intelligent
<br>
optimization using up variation - does not automatically rule out combat.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there would still be a fixed cost of combat, probably extremely
<br>
high; and if we assume variation in preferences, there would probably be
<br>
negative externalities to any nearby SIs, who would have a motive to
<br>
threaten punishment for combat.  Negotiations among SIs are, I think, out
<br>
of my reach to comprehend - although I do have some specific reasons to be
<br>
confused - but I still suspect that they would negotiate.  The point about
<br>
large coalitions devouring single cells is interesting (although my
<br>
current thoughts about SI negotations suggest that *the choice to form a
<br>
predatory coalition* might be viewed as tantamount to starting a war).  If
<br>
we do have coalitions eating smaller cells, then we have a filterish
<br>
selection pressure that rules out all unwillingness or hesitation to form
<br>
coalitions - not necessarily natural selection unless there is heritable
<br>
variation, which correlates, etc.  But beyond that point, it would
<br>
essentially amount to gambling, more than combat - will you be part of the
<br>
latest coalition, or not?  Something like a tontine, perhaps, until there
<br>
are only two entities left standing?  But where does the non-random
<br>
selection come in?  What does it correlate to?
