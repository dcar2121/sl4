Samantha said&gt; So your position is that all forms of diversity are good just
<br>
because they are diverse?  Then all forms of utterly painful and
<br>
reprehensible conditions would also be part of the good as they are
<br>
different from (diverse) relative to even a state of the universe chock full
<br>
of diverse &quot;happier&quot; circumstances.
<br>
<p>The former is my position but I don't believe that your then follows  (Now
<br>
let's see if I can clearly explain why . . . .  :-)
<br>
<p>Either the universe is going to be composed of ALL possible conditions or
<br>
it's going to be composed of some subset of all possible conditions.
<br>
<p>The case of the universe being composed of ALL possible conditions is
<br>
uninteresting and I'm not going to address it because morality really has no
<br>
inherent meaning if everything is going to exist anyways.
<br>
<p>If the universe is only composed of a subset of all possible conditions AND
<br>
is continually moving towards a larger number of more diverse conditions,
<br>
then I would argue that in general painful and reprehensible conditions
<br>
ALWAYS lead to less of an increase in diversity than do happier
<br>
circumstances.  Or, in other words, the present value of increased diversity
<br>
by including painful and reprehensible conditions is HEAVILY outweighed by a
<br>
vastly reduced future value.
<br>
<p>&lt;am I making sense?&gt;
