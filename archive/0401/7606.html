<em>&gt;&gt; Why do we torture animals to produce tastier food? Because they can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fight back and we like tasty food. Is this moral or immoral? I unask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the question -- it is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perry, it's easy to argue that there is no objective morality, but so what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's easy to argue that there's no objective *anything*.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, that's what pan-critical rationalism is all about. You test
<br>
everything, and keep testing.
<br>
<p>Now, I have a hypothesis that this hammer in my hand is an
<br>
illusion. An easy way to try to falsify that will be to swing it down
<br>
on my hand and see if it hurts or not. (&quot;Ow!&quot;)
<br>
<p>It is of course possible -- even perhaps likely -- that we're all in a
<br>
simulation of some sort. However, absent a way to test that hypothesis
<br>
I leave it as an interesting idea that I can ignore from the point of
<br>
view of daily life.
<br>
<p>Now, we are presented with this idea of an Absolute Morality. A
<br>
fascinating concept -- but sadly, non-falsifiable. Indeed, I'm told
<br>
about dozens of Absolute Moralities, all of which claim to be *the*
<br>
Absolute Morality and all of which seem to have this same property of
<br>
non-falsifiability. I therefore see it as a fine class of ideas to
<br>
ignore for the present, no matter how interesting they may be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, to argue that killing cows is worse than killing bugs but better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing humans, you need to begin from some assumption, such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that causing pain to sentient beings is bad.
</em><br>
<p>But why should I make such an assumption? A Jain would not make it --
<br>
he would argue killing the cows or bugs is something to be avoided,
<br>
even at the cost of your own life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without making SOME assumption -- however abstract -- as to &quot;basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality&quot; one can't have a meaningful moral discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Correct! And indeed, I would fully argue that one can't have a
<br>
meaningful moral discussion and that we should abandon the attempt,
<br>
and with it the attempt to define a &quot;Friendly&quot; AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All discussions of morality must proceed within some common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework of moral understanding, and hence, as you say, morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not objective.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, to argue that the helium atom exists you also need to begin from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some assumptions, such as assumptions about the reliability of laboratory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instruments,
</em><br>
<p>And I can test such things repeatedly. &quot;Pan-critical rationalism.&quot; I
<br>
can't test for the &quot;Moral Fluid&quot; even once -- it seems as ephemeral as
<br>
Phlogiston.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not enough to argue that morality is subjective -- when you poke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything hard enough, even a big hard granite rock, it begins to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective (and I'm not even gonna get started on quantum philosophy right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now...).
</em><br>
<p>Kick it and see whether it is fully subjective. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, I'm not so sure that it is.  Much of morality is very subjective and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culturally-dependent.
</em><br>
<p>All of it, actually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, at the core of morality lies the core value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion, which may perhaps NOT be more subjective than the big hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; granite rock outside my window....
</em><br>
<p>Why would you argue that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as a rock has a kind of &quot;partial objectivity&quot; that distinguishes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from more thoroughly subjective things like hallucinations and delusions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so, perhaps, does compassion?
</em><br>
<p>Can you give evidence for this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question is never whether X has objective, absolute reality or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing does.
</em><br>
<p>Again, most hypotheses are falsifiable. &quot;There is a gorilla in the
<br>
room&quot; can be tested by searching for the gorilla. &quot;Compassion is
<br>
universal&quot; could be checked by noting the quaint practices of the
<br>
Innuit involving placing grandma on the ice floe when she couldn't
<br>
care for herself any more. &quot;There Is An Absolute Morality&quot; can't be
<br>
checked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the point is not to argue that X is subjective, therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningless -- that kind of nihilism was already found wanting by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and the whole proto-existentialist crew.
</em><br>
<p>Nietzsche is just pietzsche by me -- why do you find him wanting? :)
<br>
<p>Anyway, have a quick read of Karl Popper's &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot; and
<br>
then tell me how morals fit into that framework.
