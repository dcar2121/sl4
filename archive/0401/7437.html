<p>Please elaborate.

<p><em>&gt; If the limit really is just at the upper end of the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>My question is, of all the places where the limit
<br>
could be, wouldn't it be a very big coincidence thatn
<br>
the limit happened to be at almost the exact level
<br>
represented by the very first species we know of to
<br>
have achieved general intelligence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One problem here is that I don't know enough to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this argument, by a long, long way.  I've already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented my (relatively tenuous) evidence for this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'll recap it here for clarity: humans who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly intelligent seem to have a higher incidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mental disorder (i.e., insanity).
</em><br>
<p>First, I'd like to see a study or two confirm this.
<br>
Second, if it is true, it could be something limited
<br>
to our particular brain architecture. Third, it could
<br>
be something limited to Darwinistically evolved
<br>
organisms. Fourth, you have to distinguish people who
<br>
are 'insane' (which is bad) from people who simply
<br>
don't follow our semi-arbitrary social conventions
<br>
(which is probably good). There are probably more
<br>
reasons I can't think of.
