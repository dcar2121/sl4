<em>&gt;&gt; 1.  Why do you call Singularitarianism your &quot;new religion&quot;?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; know it's basically all in jest, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I define religion as a set of beliefs held in absence of evidence or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof.  Singularitarianism fits perfectly, regardless of how much I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might wish otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you should abandon it then. It is not healthy to hold views in
<br>
the absence of evidence.
<br>
<p>A friend of mine who has a great deal of experience with cults notes
<br>
that one of the things that makes things a cult is taking the &quot;and the
<br>
most important thing you can possibly do is promulgate X&quot;.  That is
<br>
the step that creates, in his terms, the &quot;virus for the human mind&quot;
<br>
that cults represent.  I get the impression that some in this group
<br>
feel that it is of paramount importance to go off and build their
<br>
Friendly AI and that all other goals must be subverted to it.  One
<br>
worries about such people -- a lot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; but thousands of people have already misinterpreted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Singularity as a result of the &quot;Singularity = Rapture&quot; meme, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, I really haven't found any way to present the ideas without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoking that comparison.  However, bear in mind that the reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone makes that comparison is because it's a perfectly *valid*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.  Seriously.  The only substantial difference between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity and the rapture is that no-one involved in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity claims to have had a vision from god.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, &quot;The Singularity&quot; just means the point after which we can't
<br>
predict much. Myself, though, I will make a strong prediction -- which
<br>
is that the laws of physics and the rules of math don't cease to
<br>
apply. That leads me to believe that evolution doesn't stop. That
<br>
further leads me to believe that nature -- bloody in tooth and claw,
<br>
as some have termed it -- will simply be taken to the next level. I
<br>
don't fear this particularly, but it isn't consistent with the
<br>
&quot;everything is going to turn up roses&quot; viewpoint.
<br>
<p>Tim May used to needle people for suffering too much from the disease
<br>
of &quot;Future Rapture&quot; -- &quot;all will be well after we gain all this
<br>
technological prowess&quot;.  I'm a very big fan of technology, and I'm
<br>
very much looking forward to the age when humans transcend themselves,
<br>
but it is unlikely that everything is going to suddenly be perfect
<br>
when we've got nanotechnology and know how to build honking big AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I *am* atheisitic and humanistic.  But that doesn't change the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have no proof, and barely any evidence, that the singularity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let alone the sysop scenario
</em><br>
<p>I encourage you, then, to drop the meme complex. You will be happier
<br>
if you base your activities on that for which you have strong evidence
<br>
or proof, rather than on religion, regardless of the flavor of religion.
