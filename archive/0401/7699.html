Samantha:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unless you are speaking of more than weak anthropic principles at work I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fail to take your point.  What does this have to do with relatively weak 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanisms of self-improvement leading to us being here versus relatively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strong means of self-improvment we can easily envision?    I don't see what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a supposed anthropic element has to do with it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the question (as raised by Paul Fidika) was, how do we
<br>
know that recursive self-enhancement is an accelerating process?
<br>
You could just as well argue that it slows down, because each
<br>
new improvement is harder to discover. Eliezer gave examples
<br>
from history, which suggest an accelerating tendency stretching
<br>
across biological, cultural and technological evolution. My idea was
<br>
indeed that this might all just be an artefact of the weak anthropic
<br>
principle: Any sentient being, when it investigates its origins, has
<br>
to find a world that went through all those transitions; but sentience
<br>
having been attained, WAP says nothing about further evolutionary
<br>
leaps being likely. We may be wrong to generalize about the
<br>
powers of evolution, on the basis of how it unfolded here on Earth.
<br>
<p>The paper by Robin Hanson on this subject (&quot;Must Early Life
<br>
Be Easy?&quot;) doesn't suggest any way that *acceleration* would
<br>
show up as an artefact, however. If there are hard and unlikely
<br>
steps on the path to sentience, they should be more or less
<br>
evenly distributed throughout the history leading up to it - that's
<br>
what his model says. A more complicated model might make a
<br>
different prediction, but then we are getting into Drake-equation
<br>
territory, making guesses about quantities whose actual values
<br>
we have no idea about.
