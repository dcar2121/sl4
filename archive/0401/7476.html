<p>I hope the rest of your post is not based on this premise, because it's flat

out wrong. Moore is about integration density, not performance. Performance,
<br>
unfortunately, does not linearly fit semilog plots, and hasn't been for quite
<br>
a while now.

<p>How do you know which sort of system is useful for AI work?
<br>
I happen to think you'd need a low latency packet switched signalling fabric,
<br>
and an CPU/FPGA core with very-large-bandwidth embedded memory.
<br>
<p>Can you tell me where I can currently buy such system? No?

<p>Ethernet is lousy latence-wise (30 us best case), but I wonder why you didn't
<br>
include GBit Ethernet in your comparison.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AMD processors when used in clusters reported in

</em><br>
<p>You can as well cite random numbers from the back of a cereal box.
<br>
While it is obvious, that AI is a large-scale numerics application, it is not at all
<br>
obvious which kind it is. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that many announced supercomputers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have higher costs per Gflop due to installation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software, and facility costs.  This is a best case
</em><br>
<p>Hardware costs do not feature prominently in large scale commodity clusters:
<br>
here power, air conditioning and administration dominate. You can partly
<br>
forego air conditioning by loose shelving in a hall with fans in the roof,
<br>
but the rest of the costs are not that easy to reduce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; lower bound for a self-assembled system.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If optimistic estimates of the required computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power for human-level AI are correct at 100 TFlop/s, 
</em><br>
<p>Tee-hee.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it presently costs $16.5M to buy a human's worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of computers. I have estimated an 'economic 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This assumes that 17 M$ worth of hardware achieves equivalent real-world
<br>
performance as a human. In other words, it assumes AI is a solved problem.
<br>
<p>Now this is a bit premature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The processing power to run a human-level AI is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 - 100,000 TFlop/s. Assume the most powerful 
</em><br>
<p>Please don't use garbage OPs. They're tied to a specific benchmark, and that
<br>
gives you another two zeroes to add to your estimate. 
<br>
<p>Computers are not just CPUs. These are usually memory-starved, and here
<br>
things like memory bandwidth, latency, network latency and crossection
<br>
bandwidth come into play.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The trend predicts highly automated production should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrive around 2020. At some point around then, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be possible to design replicating industrial 
</em><br>
<p>I notice that no one is currently attempting to build self-rep systems,
<br>
despite seminal work being about half a century past. It's useless to
<br>
speculate when something can be done, if the humanity collectively decides to
<br>
not pursue that particular path.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; systems, either single factories or networks of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factories, that can produce copies of themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as useful products with little human input. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Preliminary estimates indicate that these replicating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factories may have a time to copy themselves on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of 1 year, which is similar to the rate of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement of computer power, and much faster than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rates of economic growth we are used to (0-10%per 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore even if improvements in computer components
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slows down due to limits of semiconductor scaling,
</em><br>
<p>You're completely ignoring molecular circuitry, and scaling issues of very
<br>
large systems.
