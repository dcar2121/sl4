&quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Darwinian%20dynamics%20unlikely%20to%20apply%20to%20superintelligence">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt; writes:
<br>
<em>&gt; To sum up, natural selection *as we know it*, which is to say, natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection in any noticeable quantity, is not an automatic consequence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics.  It applies to butterflies, but not pebbles,
</em><br>
<p>Because pebbles cannot construct new pebbles that inherit their
<br>
characteristics. If one can build a Von Neumann Machine and launch it
<br>
out to spread its descendents throughout the universe, you can be damn
<br>
sure that natural selection applies to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Correspondingly, we can expect that any SI we deal with will exclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the set of SIs that immediately shut themselves down, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whichever SI we see will be the result of an optimization process that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was capable of self-optimization and preferred that choice.  But this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not imply that any SI we deal with will attach a huge intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility to its own survival.
</em><br>
<p>Then the other SIs out there somewhere that arrive eventually and
<br>
which *do* attach a huge utility to their own survival might end up
<br>
having an advantage over them. We do not control the set of all actors
<br>
that are participating in the experiment. (Indeed, we barely control
<br>
any of them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It follows that we have no reason to expect any SI we deal with to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attach a huge intrinsic utility to its own survival.
</em><br>
<p>Again, there will be (eventually) entire ecologies of new life that
<br>
arise outside of the area of our physical control that we'll have to
<br>
confront. I do not believe that your argument applies to all of them
<br>
even if it were to apply to a anything we ourselves build.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, for any optimization process that can configure matter in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways that it reckons will create instrumental utility, or fulfill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrinsic utility, or avoid expected negative utility, with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any possible aspect of its goal system, we should expect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization process to optimize all available matter, since that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action will be perceived as more desirable than the alternative,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming the entity implements some kind of expected utility equation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ordering preferences over choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For an extremely large class of SIs, they will *all* choose to absorb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all nearby matter.  So there is no reason to suppose that they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a particular desire to reproduce.
</em><br>
<p>It is difficult to control things at long distances -- the speed of
<br>
light gets in the way. That provides a powerful incentive to send out
<br>
other intelligences. In addition, in a large enough universe, we can
<br>
assume that someone, somewhere, will decide to build Von Neumann
<br>
machines eventually, and send them off to explore in all directions.
<br>
<p>It is also unclear that we'll deal with only one SI in our local
<br>
neighborhood, or that all people building such things will have the
<br>
same ideas about how to build them, or that they'll get built by us at
<br>
all, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And finally, there is no reason to suppose that the process whereby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIs absorb matter, optimize matter, or in other ways do things with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, would create subregions with (a) large heritable changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties, that (b) correlate to large differences in the rate at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which these regions spread or transform other matter, and that (c)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this process will continue over the thousands or millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations that would be required for the natural selection dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce optimized functional complexity.
</em><br>
<p>Even if we had any control over what shows up around here, we don't
<br>
have particularly good control over the entire reachable portion of
<br>
the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Almost any utility function I have ever heard proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will choose to spread across the cosmos and transform matter into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either (1) *maximally high-fidelity copies* of the optimization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control structure or (2) configurations that fulfill intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utilities.
</em><br>
<p>In the only experiment we've seen done on this -- the earth -- we
<br>
found neither condition to have been satisfied. I'm far from convinced
<br>
the future will necessarily work the way you propose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In short, under scenarios of the type I have seen discussed so far,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicator dynamics do not apply to SIs.
</em><br>
<p>So you keep asserting....
<br>
