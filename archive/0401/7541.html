<p>While I'm certain that evolution is here to stay, don't forget that the
<br>
scale at which it operates can change. The cells that make up our bodies
<br>
cooperate with each other. When a cell starts living by capitalist rules,
<br>
it starts rapidly dividing, consuming lots of resources, and eventually
<br>
kills itself along with all the other cells. Cancer, a minature version of 
<br>
the tragedy of the commons. There is no rule that all systems of organisms
<br>
must be internally competitive.
<br>
<p>Imagine a society of designer organisms where the experience of pleasure
<br>
was based on giving gifts, the amount of pleasure experienced being
<br>
proportional to the benefit that arises from the gift. If a gap in the
<br>
society needed to be filled, it would be filled because organisms would
<br>
experience great altruistic pleasure by filling it.
