</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The replicator dynamics, like all math equations, generally are provable 
<br>
and hence what people would call &quot;tautological&quot; when applied to the real 
<br>
world.  The question is whether the variables take on any interesting 
<br>
values.  Price's Equation is a tautology, and, therefore, always true; the 
<br>
question is whether it usefully applies.  You can apply it to pebbles on 
<br>
the seashore, for example, and lo, the change in the mean value of the 
<br>
&quot;blue&quot; characteristic for the pebbles will equal the covariance of the 
<br>
&quot;blue&quot; characteristic with the proportional change (fitness) of each color 
<br>
category of pebbles.  That is, it will be precisely, numerically equal, if 
<br>
you do the calculation.  But the correlation will end up being slight, and 
<br>
will probably change sign from generation to generation, because the 
<br>
covariance is noise and not the causal result of physically perseverant 
<br>
properties of the pebbles; and whatever categories you parse the pebbles 
<br>
into, it will be a function of an arbitrary classification system, and not 
<br>
physically copied genes.  And yet the math will still, technically, add up.
<br>
<p>Although the math holds true tautologically for any consistent set of 
<br>
variable definitions, it is not at all trivial to show that the math 
<br>
*applies* to some physical system in the sense of the variable definitions 
<br>
corresponding to simple physical properties, rather than being produced 
<br>
arbitrarily.
<br>
<p>And when the variable definitions in a replicator equation do correspond 
<br>
to simple physical properties, there is still the question of whether one 
<br>
is dealing with infinitesimal quantities that obey a replicator equation, 
<br>
or large quantities; small handful of generations, or millions of 
<br>
generations; whether there is enough selection pressure, over a long 
<br>
enough period of time, to produce complex information of the sort we're 
<br>
used to seeing in biology.
<br>
<p>To sum up, natural selection *as we know it*, which is to say, natural 
<br>
selection in any noticeable quantity, is not an automatic consequence of 
<br>
physics.  It applies to butterflies, but not pebbles, even though the math 
<br>
can be defined for both cases.  Even if blue pebbles survive some tiny 
<br>
amount better, it doesn't mean that in 20,000 years all the pebbles on the 
<br>
seashore will be intensely blue.
<br>
<p>We are more likely to see the longest-burning stars, and if you were to 
<br>
stretch the term far enough, you could insist that stars have 
<br>
&quot;generations&quot; because the debris of a nova ends up being incorporated into 
<br>
new stars, and so on, but because the &quot;heritable&quot; capacity is noise (even 
<br>
though it can still be defined as a mathematical quantity) and the number 
<br>
of generations so few, we do not see stars that are optimized to burn for 
<br>
trillions of years, even though we can expect that the stars we see will 
<br>
have been selected so as to exclude ones that fail to ignite or explode 
<br>
immediately.
<br>
<p>Correspondingly, we can expect that any SI we deal with will exclude the 
<br>
set of SIs that immediately shut themselves down, and that whichever SI we 
<br>
see will be the result of an optimization process that was capable of 
<br>
self-optimization and preferred that choice.  But this does not imply that 
<br>
any SI we deal with will attach a huge intrinsic utility to its own survival.
<br>
<p>If you have an optimization system, and that optimization system behaves 
<br>
something at least roughly like the expected utility equation, then, 
<br>
regardless of the particulars of the utility function, it seems 
<br>
straightforward to derive instrumental expected utility for the continued 
<br>
operation of an optimization system similar to the one doing the 
<br>
calculation, and the expected instrumental utility calculated in the 
<br>
present time will increase with the expected fidelity of the utility 
<br>
function.  This will hold true of a very large class of optimizers.
<br>
<p>It follows that we have no reason to expect any SI we deal with to attach 
<br>
a huge intrinsic utility to its own survival.  Why?  Because that's an 
<br>
extremely specific outcome within a very large class of outcomes where the 
<br>
SI doesn't shut itself down immediately.  There is, in other words, no 
<br>
Bayesian evidence - no likelihood ratio - that says we are probably 
<br>
looking at an SI that attaches a huge intrinsic utility to its own 
<br>
survival; both hypotheses produce the same prediction for observed behavior.
<br>
<p>Similarly, for any optimization process that can configure matter in ways 
<br>
that it reckons will create instrumental utility, or fulfill intrinsic 
<br>
utility, or avoid expected negative utility, with respect to any possible 
<br>
aspect of its goal system, we should expect that optimization process to 
<br>
optimize all available matter, since that action will be perceived as more 
<br>
desirable than the alternative, assuming the entity implements some kind 
<br>
of expected utility equation for ordering preferences over choices.
<br>
<p>For an extremely large class of SIs, they will *all* choose to absorb all 
<br>
nearby matter.  So there is no reason to suppose that they would need a 
<br>
particular desire to reproduce.
<br>
<p>I expect that most any optimization process including a Friendly SI, and 
<br>
certainly including myself, would choose to defend itself from a hostile 
<br>
optimization process - as an instrumental utility.  So there is no reason 
<br>
to suppose that any SI we see must have a particular desire to engage in 
<br>
combat.
<br>
<p>And finally, there is no reason to suppose that the process whereby SIs 
<br>
absorb matter, optimize matter, or in other ways do things with matter, 
<br>
would create subregions with (a) large heritable changes in properties, 
<br>
that (b) correlate to large differences in the rate at which these regions 
<br>
spread or transform other matter, and that (c) this process will continue 
<br>
over the thousands or millions of generations that would be required for 
<br>
the natural selection dynamic to produce optimized functional complexity.
<br>
<p>This last point is particularly important in understanding why replicator 
<br>
dynamics are unlikely to apply to SIs.  At most, we are likely to see one 
<br>
initial filter in which SIs that halt or fence themselves off in tiny 
<br>
spheres are removed from the cosmic observables.  Almost any utility 
<br>
function I have ever heard proposed will choose to spread across the 
<br>
cosmos and transform matter into either (1) *maximally high-fidelity 
<br>
copies* of the optimization control structure or (2) configurations that 
<br>
fulfill intrinsic utilities.  If the optimization control structure is 
<br>
copied at extremely high fidelity, there are no important heritable 
<br>
differences for natural selection to act on.  If there were heritable 
<br>
differences, they are not likely to covary with large differences in 
<br>
reproductive fitness, insofar as all the optimization control structures 
<br>
will choose equally to transform nearby matter.
<br>
<p>Natural selection operates on the *covariance* between heritable 
<br>
quantities and reproductive fitness, not the *correlation*, which means 
<br>
that the *amount* of variation is relevant.  (When you calculate the 
<br>
correlation you take the covariance between the two quantities and divide 
<br>
by the product of the two standard deviations of each quantity.)  If 
<br>
there's only a small amount of heritable variation, the covariance goes 
<br>
down.  If there's only a small amount of variation in reproductive 
<br>
fitness, the covariance goes down.  If you don't have thousands of 
<br>
generations, the amount of genetic information generated by the iteration 
<br>
of this covariance will be tiny, certainly not enough to account for 
<br>
complex adaptations.
<br>
<p>In short, under scenarios of the type I have seen discussed so far, 
<br>
replicator dynamics do not apply to SIs.
<br>
<p>Natural selection is not a binary thing that switches on or off depending 
<br>
on whether anything that can be called &quot;replication&quot; occurs.  Selection 
<br>
pressure can be quantified - and it is a surprisingly small optimization 
<br>
effect by our standards; for example, if each couple has an average of 8 
<br>
children then there can be *at most* 2 bits of information produced by 
<br>
natural selection per generation, to be shared among all the quantities 
<br>
subject to optimization.  With the scenarios extrapolated as usual, and 
<br>
the variable definitions that are usually offered, the amount of selection 
<br>
pressure that applies to SIs is infinitesimal, barring a possible initial 
<br>
selection filter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what sort of strategies does evolution favor? Quite a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, actually, but none of them can be characterized as &quot;pacifist&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>None of them can be characterized as conscientious objectors, barring 
<br>
those that are physically invulnerable.  I don't see that Friendliness 
<br>
requires being a conscientious objector to a generic optimization process 
<br>
that's trying to eat you, and I certainly don't see why a generic 
<br>
optimization process would choose to be a conscientious objector as an 
<br>
instrumental utility, barring an exotic utility function.
<br>
<p>Anyway, there's a heck of a difference between natural selection *building 
<br>
a goal system from scratch*, like where humans come from, and applying a 
<br>
anti-suicide filter to the set of SIs that are likely to pop up from 
<br>
ancestral civilizations (mostly the result of runaway recursive 
<br>
self-improvement, I expect, perhaps a Friendlyoid SI here and there if 
<br>
someone in the ancestral civilization was implausibly competent).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The struggle for resources is unlikely to end, because the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resource you can have in any finite volume remains finite.
</em><br>
<p>Replicator dynamics assume a (large, frequent) death rate.  If 
<br>
optimization processes compete to absorb *available* resources but hang on 
<br>
permanently to all resources already absorbed, the replicator dynamics are 
<br>
not iterated across thousands of generations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me to assume that we'll continue to see evolution take place as life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreads through the cosmos.
</em><br>
<p>If so, it will be because Friendly SIs (Friendliness being an exotic 
<br>
utility function created by the intervention of humans) contain 
<br>
environments with social scenarios to which replicator dynamics apply. 
<br>
Even this is not a necessary assumption, and replicator dynamics might 
<br>
apply to some social quantities and not others.  For example, if 
<br>
sociolegal dynamics fix the maximum number of children at, say, two 
<br>
children per couple, or one child every hundred years, and motivational 
<br>
variations are heritable, then natural selection might apply as a floor 
<br>
function that minimizes the number of sentient entities who want to have 
<br>
*less* children than that.  But natural selection would be powerless to 
<br>
optimize variables within the very large class of minds that chose to use 
<br>
their full allotment.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, *memes* might be around for a long, long time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That, in turn, leads me to assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll continue to see &quot;nature bloody in tooth and claw&quot;, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps it will become &quot;nature bloody in assembler and particle beam&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or other gadgetry far beyond our understanding.
</em><br>
<p>It looks to me like, whether humanity survives or fails, the era of 
<br>
natural selection as we know it - &quot;bloody in tooth and claw&quot; - is ending.
