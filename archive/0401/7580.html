I agree it's probably true that &quot;more complex brains experience more
<br>
intense/bigger qualia&quot;
<br>
<p>However, making statements like this rigorous is gonna be mighty tough, as
<br>
qualia and brains reside in different &quot;orders of being&quot;, so to speak...
<br>
(I've posted on this notion before.)
<br>
<p>And let's compare
<br>
<p>a) Curzio permanently hooked up to the Orgasmotron machine
<br>
b) Curzio in his current configuration and environment
<br>
<p>Which Curzio has bigger/more-intense qualia?  No doubt Curzio_a is less
<br>
complex, in terms of enacted brain-complexity (if not &quot;potential
<br>
complexity&quot;, i.e. he might return to something resembling his old self if
<br>
the Orgasmotron were shut off and hidden from him).
<br>
<p>I agree this is the right direction in which to think, if one seeks a real
<br>
advance in moral thought beyond the classical approaches.  But there's a
<br>
loooooooong way to go, as I guess we all know...

<em>&gt; Subject: c * (positive qualia -negative qualia) + (1-c)* (total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of pattern)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; c * (positive qualia -negative qualia) + (1-c)* (total complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pattern)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is exactly where my theory leads in the real world, in which you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitably produce both negative and positive qualia whenever you move a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About pattern complexity: unfortunately there is no way to test the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption behind your equation (although intuitively I think it's right),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, that more complex beings experience more powerful qualia. Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia are created by the brain, it would be reasonable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains = more qualia. However, it is possible that when we know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms do create qualia, we will discover they are present in most or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all animals with a nervous system or that they do not require very complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive architectures or that they don't scale proportionally with brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size. Since the strongest qualia are associated with very low-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-information responses (cutting off a limb, orgasms, fear) we may just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find that starfish are the most sensitive creatures in the known universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, if you look at other physical phenomena, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scalable with the size of the object. Gravity scales well with mass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnetic fields etc. all scale well, you don't find many effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world that are independent of the scale of the cause (of course one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name some exceptions such as nuclear reactions where obviously stuff is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantized).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So while my intuition is that qualia should scale with brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size, I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure of it, and it could very well depend on specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architectures. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative thing to do for now is look at how a being responds to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulus, and the stronger the response, the more intense the sensation it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably experiencing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another thorny issue is the positive qualia vs. negative qualia one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although they are opposite you can't really trade one for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other. Things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get more complicated when you have more than one individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved. Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to cut A's finger so that B's arm remains intact?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need a quick fix until we get enough technology to preserve both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finger and the arm, and then we'll be problem free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My quick fix is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Prioritize larger brain beings (us) only when a trade off between our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finger/their paw is absolutely necessary (kill the bear before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eats you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then you shouldn't have been there in the first place)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Great amounts of negative qualia inflicted to lower beings for sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher beings' positive qualia are immoral (no more frying of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live animals)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Small amounts of negative qualia inflicted to same or lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings for sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of same or higher beings' great amounts of positive qualia are justifiable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (take 1 billion $ away from bill gates and divide it up among the starving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; african tribes)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Moral imperative to create the technology that will make this quick fix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obsolete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will notice that &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot; are not objective terms, are they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not meant to be because this is a quick fix and not the definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality. Possibly, defining &quot;perfect objective morality&quot; is easier than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defining the arrow of morality. Perfect morality is when you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0 negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia in the universe and a lot of positive qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still don't know if this can be 100% objective but it satisfies me to at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least 90% and it's a lot better than current moral theories as far as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know.
