Hi,
<br>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about ethical theory, and I'm wondering if anyone
<br>
knows of an ethical theory that has the same kind of structure as Imre
<br>
Lakatos's theory of &quot;research programmes&quot; (in the philosophy of science).
<br>
<p>What I'm thinking of would be a theory of &quot;ethical systems&quot; rather than
<br>
ethical acts.  It would agree that any one act may be ethical or not
<br>
depending on the ethical system within which you view the act.  But it would
<br>
give some high-level criteria for judging ethical systems as wholes.  (These
<br>
criteria would NOT be of the form &quot;An ethical system is good if it includes
<br>
particular rule X, or rules of form Y, etc&quot; -- rather, they would pertain to
<br>
the dynamics of growth and change of the ethical system, or the abstract
<br>
structure of the ethical system.)
<br>
<p>I am working out an ethical theory of this nature myself (slowly, in my
<br>
spare time), but I am wondering if a theory of this nature already exists.
<br>
<p>Any references anyone has, would be appreciated.
<br>
<p>Let me elaborate my line of thinking a little further...
<br>
<p>One key point is that it's very hard to evaluate one act as ethical vs.
<br>
unethical.  The evaluation of an act's ethicalness occurs within some
<br>
system, and has to be understood in context.  This is similar to how it's
<br>
very hard to evaluate one scientific micro-theory, in isolate, as true or
<br>
false; the evaluation takes place within some system (some &quot;research
<br>
programme&quot;) and has to be understood in this context.  So the best level to
<br>
assess quality, in the philosophy of science, is on the level of research
<br>
programmes not small individual theories.  Similarly in ethics, the best
<br>
level to assess quality is probably the &quot;ethical system&quot; a person or group
<br>
follows, not the individual act.  In philosophy of science there is some
<br>
knowledge about what constitutes a &quot;good&quot; (&quot;progressive&quot; in Lakatos's terms)
<br>
research programme, e.g.
<br>
<p>-- it makes dramatic, surprising predictions that turn out to be true
<br>
-- in most cases, it accounts for new data without requiring highly
<br>
complicated workarounds and modifications to its core concepts
<br>
-- etc.
<br>
<p>These qualities of progressive research programmes can be used to compare
<br>
even research programs that are &quot;incommensurable&quot; like classical vs. quantum
<br>
physics, or vitalistic vs. molecular biology.
<br>
<p>So I was wondering what qualities there are that distinguish a good ethical
<br>
system from a bad one.  Is there a similar list of properties characterizing
<br>
a &quot;progressive&quot; ethical system, which can be used to compare even
<br>
&quot;incommensurable&quot; ethical systems?
<br>
<p>Clearly, some ethical systems have a badness that's tied in with regressive
<br>
(bad) scientific or quasiscientific research programmes [this could be said
<br>
about Marxist ethics, National Socialist ethics, etc.].
<br>
<p>Habermas's approach suggests that good ethical systems will have the
<br>
property that most people, if given the opportunity to freely express their
<br>
opinion in an appropriate situation, living in a society that imposes the
<br>
ethical system will agree that the ethical system is a good idea.  This kind
<br>
of &quot;democracy on the level of ethical systems&quot; is more what we have in
<br>
modern representative democracy than a democracy on the level of ethical
<br>
acts; because with the exception of super-big issues like abortion,
<br>
government makes ethical decisions without direct input from the population.
<br>
So we elect our rulers partly because we accept their ethical systems.  One
<br>
problem with Habermas's approach is that he seems to underestimate the
<br>
propensity of people to delude themselves and each other (of course, this is
<br>
a general weakness of democracy)... but I haven't read him that seriously,
<br>
so I'm not sure how he deals with this.
<br>
<p>Another way of looking at ethics is in terms of the psychological effect of
<br>
an ethical system on the person holding the ethical system... this ties in
<br>
with the Buddhist notion that one reason for being compassionate is because
<br>
doing so makes you a better person (because it decreases the illusory
<br>
boundary between self and other, which in Buddhist thought is one thing
<br>
holding us back from enlightenment).  Graves' ethical theory is along these
<br>
lines; he ties ethical systems in with Maslow's hierarchy of needs and says
<br>
that people necessarily have different ethical systems depending on where
<br>
they stand in the hierarchy of needs...
<br>
<p>So these are three characteristics of good ethical systems, then
<br>
<p>1) tied in with progressive rather than regressive research programmes
<br>
2) democratically supportable (a la Habermas)
<br>
3) tend to lead to positive psychological growth for the person holding the
<br>
system
<br>
<p>Maybe that's all one can say on the subject, but I was hoping for something
<br>
more interesting ;-)
<br>
<p>What started me thinking about this was some futuristic speculation about
<br>
the ethics of superhuman AI's....  I assume a superhuman AI will develop a
<br>
different ethical system than any human system, and it would be interesting
<br>
to have some way to think about which superhuman-AI ethical systems are good
<br>
versus bad...
<br>
<p>Ah well.. back to work..
<br>
<p>-- Ben
