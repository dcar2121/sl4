<p>I think you missed one of my points. Evolution *did* directly make us want
<br>
more children, not through genes, but through co-evolved symbiotic memes.
<br>
Hence my reference to the &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; passage in Genesis 1.
<br>
I think evolution was quite clever here, and came to the same conclusion
<br>
that Eliezer reached: the supergoal needs philosophical support. It could
<br>
not be provided in the genes and had to come from symbiotic memes because
<br>
genes can't evolve fast enough to defend against parasitic memes.  
<br>
Unfortunately for the genes, the parasitic memes are now evolving faster
<br>
because of greater communications bandwidth between non-relatives so that
<br>
even the symbiotic memes can't catch up.

</em><br>
<p>There are three possibilities that we can't rule out at this point. 1) Any
<br>
SI will have a natural tendency towards doing good. 2) An SI will always
<br>
find philosophical justifications for doing good convincing if we seed
<br>
it with the right initial philosophy. 3) An SI will find these
<br>
philosophical justifications silly in some situations. I'm arguing that
<br>
case 3 is likely, and therefore we need to reduce the likelihood or
<br>
frequency of those situations as much as possible. I'm pointing out that
<br>
in our own case we realized the silliness of the justifications for
<br>
maximizing the number of biological offspring after being &quot;infected&quot; with
<br>
parasitic memes, and therefore we should try to prevent the analogous
<br>
thing from happening with SIs.
<br>
<p>(Of course there's possibility 4, that an SI will always find
<br>
justifications for doing good silly, but there's not much point in
<br>
worrying about that one.)
