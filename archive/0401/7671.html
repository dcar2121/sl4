<em>&gt; I just wonder, for instance, how much of the joy of discovery would be
</em><br>
left
<br>
<em>&gt; if one removed the frustration of seeking the answer a while and not
</em><br>
finding
<br>
<em>&gt; it ;) ... Perhaps this is just a high-falutin' example of &quot;hitting your
</em><br>
head
<br>
<em>&gt; on the wall so it feels so good when you stop?&quot; -- or is it something
</em><br>
more?
<br>
<p>When you look for something and can't find it and get irritated, and then
<br>
find it and are happy to have found it, here pain and pleasure are in
<br>
temporal sequence but it is not pain causing pleasure; it is the way the
<br>
brain is set up, to give you reward when a painful activity gives good
<br>
results; otherwise we'd stop doing painful stuff that gives good results and
<br>
that would be the end. Of course it can't abolish the pain of doing painful
<br>
stuff either because then we'd never look for better ways. It does exactly
<br>
what it needs to do, create the pain/pleasure balance and activation
<br>
sequence that best fits the interests of the dna i carry.
<br>
<p>So, the mechanism creating that final feeling of satisfaction is independent
<br>
from the temporal sequence in which the brain chooses to activate it, I
<br>
believe. Imagine feeling happy every time you found something you never
<br>
misplaced. Every day would be a happy day :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And are there some kinds of insights into the universe that can only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieved by going through and transcending a period of existential angst?
</em><br>
<p>Good question; in the human world, indeed. But what I am suggesting is to go
<br>
beyond it and make so that this is not the case anymore, so the question is
<br>
would a world like this be worth living according to today's standards? If
<br>
so, there can hypothetically be a massive effort to reach that goal. If not,
<br>
then it is still possible that little by little we can get there, as the way
<br>
people think and feel about life changes, in a world that is made
<br>
increasingly comfortable and painless by technology.
