</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words the idiots in child psychology are finally noticing that nerds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; often share certain characteristics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It isn't just nerdyness. Asperger's is a real syndrome. Many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symptoms, such as body rocking etc., aren't just a question of &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>However not all autistics rock, nor do all non autistics not rock. Anyone
<br>
sufficiently overloaded, in pain or distressed is likely to rock. Its
<br>
simply one of many ways to fill the senses to try to mask bad emotions
<br>
or sensations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Try to find a really good scientist or engineer that doesn't have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good helping of autistic traits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the Temple Grandins of the world are just nerds, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you're doing them a serious disservice by pretending they might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be.
</em><br>
<p>The biggest disservice is that people pretend that Temple Grandin is a
<br>
great rarity. The thing which makes her most rare is not that she is a
<br>
high functioning autistic with a Phd, but that she is a high functioning
<br>
autistic who was actually recognized as such. In 15 years academic
<br>
institutions will have many Phds graduating who are officially considered
<br>
autistic, instead of being informally considered eccentric.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.grandin.com/inc/visual.thinking.html">http://www.grandin.com/inc/visual.thinking.html</a>
<br>
<p>This describes the way I think very well. Its a good example of a common
<br>
autistic trait which lends itself to high and/or unique intellectual
<br>
abilities. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, it is absolutely the case that there is a strong correlation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between high IQ and social dysfunction -- and I'm not talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Asperger's or autism here.
</em><br>
<p>You are and don't know it, your just noticing the tail end of the
<br>
autistic spectrum. Do these people make eye contact? Do they look
<br>
away or watch your mouth while you talk? Do they exhibit trouble
<br>
hearing you in a noisy environment, eventhough they are the first to
<br>
complain about noises other people don't hear, like computer power supply
<br>
whine from the high frequency switcher? Do they hate florescent
<br>
lights or see flicker on monitors most people can't? Are they picky
<br>
eaters avoiding many foods because of texture? Do they have unusually
<br>
high pain and/or cold tolerance? Are they pack rats?

<p>Autistic traits in the general population: a twin study.
<br>
<p>&quot;Levels of severity of autistic traits at or above the previously

&nbsp;published mean for patients with pervasive developmental disorder not
<br>
&nbsp;otherwise specified were found in 1.4% of boys and 0.3% of girls.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Given the continuous distribution of these traits, it may be arbitrary
