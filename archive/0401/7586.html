Well, in my brief lifetime I've seen biology move from a primarily
<br>
qualitative to a substantially quantitative science -- based on improvements
<br>
in data gathering technology, coordinated with improvements in computational
<br>
data analysis.  So, the fact that morality is NOW almost entirely
<br>
qualitative doesn't mean to me that it won't become substantially
<br>
quantitative one day.
<br>
<p>As for the abuses of GAAP --- of course, math can be abused just like
<br>
anything else.  I don't think quantitative morality will be more severely
<br>
abusable than qualitative morality.  In most parts of science (and I'm not
<br>
saying that morality is a science, though it may become one someday; I'm
<br>
just making an analogy), the move to a more quantitative approach has
<br>
decreased the amount of bias and abuse, rather than increased it.
<br>
<p>As for the Orgasmotron ... although I'm definitely not past the age for such
<br>
things, I still don't find the idea all that appealing.  There's something
<br>
rather nice about the bundling of that sort of pleasure together with the
<br>
right kind of human emotional interaction.  However, I still think the
<br>
Orgasmotron might be very beneficial in its place.  For example, living in
<br>
the DC area, about once a week I find myself sitting in stopped-up traffic
<br>
on the Beltway.  I usually spend the time listening to loud music, or
<br>
solving AI-related math puzzles in my head, or bashing my head against the
<br>
foundations of quantum mechanics.  But sometimes the traffic really starts
<br>
to get on my nerves -- and at those times, I think that a dashboard-embedded
<br>
Orgasmotron might really do the trick ;-D  [Not recommended for use while
<br>
actually driving however ... although I'd like my car to automatically
<br>
trigger the Orgasmotron in case of a collision, so if I have to die, I at
<br>
least enjoy the process!]

&lt;comment snipped to:&gt;
<br>
For some of us, expressing thoughts in mathematics is habitual, even in
<br>
cases where the tools of math aren't useful for proving anything....  I
<br>
assume everyone on this list is skeptic enough to understand that ...
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
Assumption noted.
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
I do believe, however, that for superhuman AI's in the future, mathematics
<br>
WILL be a useful tool for moral philosophy.  It's rarely useful for humans
<br>
in this context, simply because our ability to make precise calculations
<br>
regarding moral situations is generally very poor (usually due to data
<br>
gathering issues more than calculation-related issues).
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<p>Given the financial fraud based on &quot;Generally Accepted Accounting
<br>
Principles&quot; both in the US and Europe and the fact this was done
<br>
using arithmetic ... I hereby invoke previous assumption.  ;-)
<br>
Also I would say the &quot;data gathering issues&quot; may prove
<br>
exceedingly difficult.  And even when one can gather the data,
<br>
mapping to mathematical structures is going to be another
<br>
challenge.  One of the distinquishing characteristics
<br>
of qualitative data is its resistence to numerical analysis.
<br>
I think we can both agree that morality is &quot;qualitative&quot; with
<br>
a vengence.
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
<p>In fact, I can easily envision a future argument between super-smart AI's
<br>
regarding the optimal value of some parameter much like my &quot;c&quot; parameter....
<br>
Perhaps the outcome of the argument would be an adjustment to the amount of
<br>
time the human population gets to spend hooked up to the AI-created
<br>
Orgasmotron
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<p>As I am rapidly approaching the age wherein such things do not
<br>
have the same *uh* 'urgency' I will leave that to those
<br>
having a more *ah* 'interest' in the calculation.  :-)
<br>
