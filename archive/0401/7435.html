<p>There are lots of coincidences associated with being
<br>
the first species of persons in our past lightcone,
<br>
anyway, why would this seem more odd?
<br>
<p>If the limit really is just at the upper end of the
<br>
human spectrum, then it would follow that any mammal
<br>
brain which achieved human intelligence would be very
<br>
near or at the limit for similar structures.  Given
<br>
this, it would seem that your question boils down to
<br>
&quot;why should the limit be so low?&quot;, but if it is, the
<br>
question may not have an answer other than &quot;it's a
<br>
consequence of physical law&quot;.
<br>
<p>One problem here is that I don't know enough to have
<br>
this argument, by a long, long way.  I've already
<br>
presented my (relatively tenuous) evidence for this,
<br>
but I'll recap it here for clarity: humans who are
<br>
highly intelligent seem to have a higher incidence
<br>
of mental disorder (i.e., insanity).
