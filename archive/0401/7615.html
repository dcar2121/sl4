<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So what sort of strategies does evolution favor? Quite a number of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Not pacifist, but also not unreasoningly or overly aggressive.

<em>&gt;&gt; If you think ours is not an extraordinarily vicious and aggressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; race, I direct you to the nearest factory farm or slaughterhouse. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people are fully aware of where their food comes from, and yet we (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; general) have very little compunction about continuing to eat it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How the race on average is and what one's own choices are now and on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other side of a Singularity are very different things.   For a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time I was vegan.  It seemed moral and reasonable on multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.  Then I decided to add back in at least some animal protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (mostly seafood) as I seemed a bit sharper and more focused.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eventually I got to today where I limit intake of most meats but am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not as adverse to them.  Some of the premises of my earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuation changed.  In other places, like most humans, it was to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest simply more convenient to not buck the tide.   Does that mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am vicious and agressive?  No, I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly many animals would very actively resist if you attempted to
<br>
kill them personally to make them into a meal for yourself -- you'd
<br>
have to use fairly brutal means to carry it out. As it happens, you
<br>
get proxies to do it for you, but you might want to ask if, say, you'd
<br>
feel quite the same way about how peaceable you are if you had to
<br>
kill the steer yourself with a machete.
<br>
<p>A PETA member might claim that you're vicious and aggressive for
<br>
feeding yourself this way when alternatives exist. Myself, I make no
<br>
moral claims in this instance, as I don't make unqualified moral claims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; By the way, I will repeat a contention I've made pretty frequently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with a new example. There are people out there that say &quot;meat is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; murder&quot;. There are people who enjoy a good steak. Which of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;morally correct&quot;? What is the experiment we can conduct that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; answer this question?  I contend there is none, and that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; answer because absolute morality is an illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The form of the quesiton is probably too imprecise to be answerable.
</em><br>
<p>I think it has a fairly precise consequence. If meat is murder,
<br>
Mr. F. A. Intelligence will be called upon to prevent it. If it is
<br>
okay, presumably he'll go about assisting his charges in improving
<br>
their abattoirs. So, what is the experiment we conduct to determine
<br>
which path Mr. F. A. Intelligence should follow?
<br>
<p>By the way, I'm not actually that concerned with the animal rights
<br>
question. As a couple of people have accurately noted, it is merely a
<br>
proxy for a giant range of moral quandaries our hypothetical
<br>
Jovial Neighborhood Superintelligence might be faced with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Our race intelligently tends to stop being vicious only when self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defense is likely (as in when dealing with other humans) and tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be pretty brutal when dealing with life forms unable to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves effectively. Baboons can be pretty nasty creatures, but as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we've got the cages and they don't, guess who is used in who's vaccine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are a bit removed from raw primate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior and our acheivement of transhumanity requires us to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even more removed from those roots.   Otherwise I would have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest in the entire enterprise.  Super-powerful baboons are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my idea of a good time or soemthing I would want to have a hand in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brining into being. 
</em><br>
<p>I didn't mention super-baboons, although we do in many ways resemble
<br>
that. My point is that we have no absolute moral calculus with which
<br>
to ascertain, precisely, the answer to questions like &quot;is it okay to
<br>
experiment on animals&quot; or &quot;is it okay to execute a vicious criminal&quot;
<br>
or even &quot;is it okay to cheat on your wife&quot;.  Indeed, I'm not sure that
<br>
we have a way of unambiguously saying that meat is murder when the
<br>
meat in question is human.
<br>
<p>That makes the Friendly AI a bit difficult -- we don't have
<br>
particularly good ways of determining, a priori, what Friendly might
<br>
even *mean*, and certainly not without enough precision to know what
<br>
we'd be in for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That's not to say, by the way, that I draw any sort of absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; morality under which gluing the feet of geese to the bottoms of cages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and force feeding them to make their livers particularly tasty is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;evil&quot;. I don't believe there is an absolute morality, so I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; going to pretend that it is somehow &quot;wrong&quot; to turn geese into foie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gras. However, you would be pretty much incorrect if you thought the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; geese weren't pissed off about the process -- it is very obvious that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they're miserable. (One might argue if animals can suffer, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; arguments used to claim they can't could just as easily be applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; other people -- I'm going to stipulate that if a cat screams in pain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when you stick it with a hot iron that it is in fact suffering.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no argument about the obvious fact that most animals can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer.   Having heard how foie gras is achieved I most certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not eat it.  By my standards it is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but by my friend C.'s lights, it is a tasty meal and there is
<br>
nothing wrong with it at all. By what experiment in Absolute Morality
<br>
might I convince him of this? Or are you willing to concede that your
<br>
standards and my friend C.'s standards are not comparable by outside
<br>
means -- that is, that each of you has a purely relative morality
<br>
without claim to absolute moral truth?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; You will often see that predators have evolved strategies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid actual aggression, instead resolving disputes with a proxy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; aggression to assert dominance and territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *With each other*, since two members of the same species have nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same capacity for violence. It is rare that you will see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cheetahs negotiating with herds of antelope to try to non-violently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; settle their &quot;disputes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fortunately we have a much greater intelligence and ability to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other ways of being with one another than cheetahs do.
</em><br>
<p>Fortunately in that we'd end up leaving fewer offspring if we did not
<br>
find such such means to deal with EACH OTHER. However, it appears that
<br>
no such consequences arise from, say, clubbing a seal and then turning
<br>
it into a coat, or taking a turkey and raising it in a miniature pen
<br>
and then cutting its head off, so many of us do such things.
<br>
<p>We pretend to ourselves that there is something &quot;wrong&quot; about taking
<br>
our neighbor's child and eating him, but that it is &quot;okay&quot; to take a
<br>
calf and eat it. We further pretend that &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;okay&quot; are
<br>
written in the fabric of the universe. The truth, though, is that we
<br>
simply are assigning &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; values entirely relative to our
<br>
own interests, and that the universe itself is entirely value
<br>
free. There are no mile high letters on the far side of the moon that
<br>
tell us the &quot;Truth&quot; with a capital &quot;T&quot;. We just have a set of evolved
<br>
behaviors that we are comfortable with.
<br>
<p>When we accept that what we like and dislike is purely a consequence
<br>
of evolution and resulting taste, we rapidly see the foolishness of
<br>
asking what is the &quot;right&quot; answer to the animal rights question or the
<br>
abortion question or any other such question. There is no &quot;right&quot;
<br>
answer, and the question is meaningless, and we can abandon trying to
<br>
settle such questions via the application of pure moralities and
<br>
instead ask things like &quot;well, what are the consequences to us if we
<br>
sanction behavior X&quot; instead of pretending there's a moral answer
<br>
sitting out there.
<br>
<p>The whole system breaks down especially badly when we start dealing
<br>
with transhumanity and posthumanity. Sadly, some people are pretending
<br>
to themselves that, deep down, if there is no God who created them in
<br>
his image, they can at least create a new God in their own image. I
<br>
shudder to think of the consequences.
