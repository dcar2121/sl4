</em><br>
<p>Friendly AI is not about a bunch of humans writing up an &quot;objective and  
<br>
absolute morality&quot; and creating a mind with that morality. It's not  
<br>
about creating a mind with any given morality at all, although you will  
<br>
give it some starting ideas. If you go through Eliezer's writings on  
<br>
the matter (the local FAI expert) you'll find 1) he doesn't claim to  
<br>
have an objective and absolute morality and 2) he doesn't suggest you  
<br>
need one.
<br>
<p>FAI is more about creating an AI with has the ability to reason about  
<br>
right and wrong, about what its goals should be, as you can but other  
<br>
animals or AIs can't. Transferring something equivalent to the complex  
<br>
functional adaptations underlying human morality, the cognitive  
<br>
mechanisms humans implicitly use but never argue about (unless they're  
<br>
studying how brains work). Sharing altruism. You want to give the FAI  
<br>
the ability to understand human moralities, in all their divergent  
<br>
glory, and try and figure out ways to help, to improve things, where  
<br>
that's possible.
<br>
<p>The second paragraph is not a good characterisation of what Friendly AI  
<br>
is (it's a difficult problem which may not have a solution about which  
<br>
I still know little), but the first paragraph is a good description of  
<br>
what it isn't.
<br>
<p>On a different note, here's a falsifiable definition of objective  
<br>
morality. As humans grow up their morality (their sense of what is  
<br>
right and wrong, what kinds of things they think they should do, what  
<br>
kinds of things they want to do, etc) changes. Unfortunately, due to  
<br>
hardware limitations, humans don't get a change to really grow up. Not  
<br>
only do we die before we get a change, but we have hardware limitations  
<br>
to the kinds of growing up we can do (we can't even modify or  
<br>
understand the architecture of our own minds!). Suppose that all  
<br>
humans, when they grow up sufficently long and become sufficently  
<br>
smart, convergence on the same morality, the same sense of right/ 
<br>
desirable. This morality would be reasonably called &quot;objective&quot; or  
<br>
perhaps &quot;convergent&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't suppose this actually happens, although it could.
