<em>&gt; property that most people, if given the opportunity to freely express
</em><br>
their
<br>
<em>&gt; opinion in an appropriate situation, living in a society that imposes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical system will agree that the ethical system is a good idea.
</em><br>
<p>I find that most people who are living in a society that imposes some
<br>
ethical system
<br>
agree that the system is a good idea. There are of course evolutionary
<br>
reasons for this.
<br>
Most people in the middle ages agreed to burning witches...
<br>
North koreans are convinced people from the south seek refuge in the north
<br>
because people in the north have the &quot;purest water&quot; and they really love the
<br>
idea that everyone must wear a pin with kim's face even though he has
<br>
torture camps.
<br>
Chinese are convinced that a big and strong china is in their own interest,
<br>
therefore they do not oppose military occupation of taiwan even though the
<br>
same ideology and the same army slaughter their students with tanks.
<br>
Ethical systems that impose negative qualia on many individuals are commonly
<br>
accepted by bipeds who still haven't gotten burned.
<br>
Therefore I tend not to trust bipeds more than I trust quadrupeds...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with the Buddhist notion that one reason for being compassionate is
</em><br>
because
<br>
<em>&gt; doing so makes you a better person (because it decreases the illusory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boundary between self and other, which in Buddhist thought is one thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holding us back from enlightenment).  Graves' ethical theory is along
</em><br>
these
<br>
<p>Buddhist/zen parables are fun ... but if you get beyond the words (often
<br>
_not_ as fancy, in the original versions!!), to the content, they are just a
<br>
bunch of rules to let people become less aggressive more self confident and
<br>
perform better emotionally. In particular, I would like to point out that
<br>
enlightment is a content-free word used exclusively to appeal to human
<br>
desire for absolute stuff. The very few descriptions of what enlightment is
<br>
are a bit funny; the fact that enlightment is positive is taken for granted
<br>
and never justified.
<br>
<p>Also I'd like to point out that while philosophy was very advanced in asia,
<br>
human rights were (and are still) way behind what we consider acceptable in
<br>
the west. While the japanese were practicing &quot;nonexistence&quot; with zen, they
<br>
also boiled people alive.
<br>
<p>Everyone agreed this was a good idea ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) tied in with progressive rather than regressive research programmes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) democratically supportable (a la Habermas)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) tend to lead to positive psychological growth for the person holding
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; system
</em><br>
<p>How do you define positive psychological growth ? (especially for non humans
<br>
or humans in a very different environment, say 100 years from now)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What started me thinking about this was some futuristic speculation about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ethics of superhuman AI's....  I assume a superhuman AI will develop a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different ethical system than any human system, and it would be
</em><br>
interesting
<br>
<em>&gt; to have some way to think about which superhuman-AI ethical systems are
</em><br>
good
<br>
<em>&gt; versus bad...
</em><br>
<p>Indeed it is very important that a god knows what is right and wrong!
<br>
That is why I started to think about objective morality.
<br>
<p>Porting the scientific method to ethics is interesting, but the problem is
<br>
in the grounding. With science you can do experiments, if your theory
<br>
confirms the results it's probably right. With ethics, what experiments do
<br>
you do? There is a need for grounding, even if partial.
<br>
<p>I still think that qualia are not an arbitrary criterion equivalent to
<br>
maximizing pebbles.
<br>
A highly rational system will see through every self-interest driven
<br>
moralistic confabulation that humans put forth. It will seek real evidence.
<br>
If it finds real evidence, it will adopt this evidence and create an ethics
<br>
system based on this. If it finds none, then it will not see a need to
<br>
develop such system. unless we hardcode it in some way or another...
<br>
<p>I see qualia as the only possible grounding for a system without hardcoded
<br>
goals... without qualia, everything is a data structure; data does not have
<br>
right and wrong, only 0 and 1. qualia turn 0 and 1 into pain and pleasure.
