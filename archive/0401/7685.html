<em>&gt; But, your other examples are all EXTERNAL situations... whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;experiencing negative emotions&quot; is an internal, intrinsic property of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain/mind... the comparison is not so close, is it?
</em><br>
<p>Removing external factors to limit the amount of negative qualia produced in
<br>
a brain, and altering its cognitive architecture to remove those last
<br>
otherwise unavoidable annoyances to me are similar actions going toward a
<br>
same goal. I would also be happy with a completely external change if that
<br>
erased all negative qualia permanently. I only suggest we should change our
<br>
actual cognitive architecture because I know that external-only change is
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I tend to be an animist, I'm not so sure that qualia are unique to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.  I tend to think they're part of everything in the universe ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though with greater or lesser intensity....
</em><br>
<p>I thought animism was the theory that said that biological systems are
<br>
imbued with a mysterious life force that lets them move and speak and feel
<br>
stuff, that is not related to physical processes. Since you're into AI I
<br>
think that is not what you mean right?
<br>
I also believe at least the greater majority of animals have qualia (at
<br>
least those with a mammalian brain who live in groups and have social
<br>
interactions similar to ours).
<br>
<p>As for the intensity, I don't think animals have less intense qualia for
<br>
reasons I have explained earlier, namely
<br>
<p>1. to the being in question, the qualia it experiences is all there is, so
<br>
how can it feel milder than anything
<br>
<p>2. qualia evolved when there was no logical brain to plan smart responses.
<br>
Therefore it is likely that animals have just as powerful or more powerful
<br>
qualia since they lack bayesian reasoning powers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think that having qualia is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just about &quot;existing&quot; not specifically about &quot;being human&quot;....  But this
</em><br>
is
<br>
<p>that is what I believe too. I just extended &quot;human&quot; to everything that
<br>
exists, so as to remove the homo-sapiens-centric connotations from the word
<br>
we use so often to indicate what we think we are at the most basic level .
<br>
