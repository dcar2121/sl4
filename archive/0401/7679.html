<em>&gt; &gt;Even assuming we aren't living in a virtual reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;where getting something is as simple as snapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fingers, competition for resources is unlikely when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you can just disassemble Jupiter and turn it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stuff that people want. As a matter of fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that remove one of the main reasons for war, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have the technology for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;instant-mansions-just-add-water? People don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;compete with each other for water during a flood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 19C industrialization also created abundance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that abundance was not equally distributed among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From a historical perspective it seems the same will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go on for the 2nd industrialization (replacement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs by intelligent machines).
</em><br>
<p>Intelligent machines? What do you mean here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may take solace in that industrialization did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uplift living standards, and that over time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-distribution of wealth did take place.
</em><br>
<p>The first industrial revolution provided the capacity
<br>
for preexisting manufacturing processes to be
<br>
automated to some extent, thus making goods more
<br>
widespread. The Singularity, as a matter of fact even
<br>
just nanotech without superintelligence, will enable
<br>
us to convert rocks into goods. There is an inherent
<br>
limit as to how many shirts you can make, regardless
<br>
of the speed or number of factories, due to the
<br>
limited amount of raw materials. However, when you can
<br>
use anything (yes, literally, anything) as a raw
<br>
material, that problem kind of goes away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does a much better way of organization than free-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -market economy exist? I don't know but I do notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is some similarity between the free market and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, and please elaborate on said similarity.
