<em>&gt; What I'm thinking of would be a theory of &quot;ethical systems&quot; rather

</em><br>
<p>Yes!  That's certainly near the top of my list of fields worth study.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am working out an ethical theory of this nature myself (slowly, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my spare time), but I am wondering if a theory of this nature already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists.
</em><br>
<p>I've been searching and putting out feelers on this for a couple of years,
<br>
and even the latest literature I'm aware of doesn't attempt to take a broad
<br>
enough perspective, in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I was wondering what qualities there are that distinguish a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical system from a bad one.  Is there a similar list of properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterizing a &quot;progressive&quot; ethical system, which can be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compare even &quot;incommensurable&quot; ethical systems?
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that the ultimate measure of an ethical system is
<br>
consistency.  Within nested context levels, the consistency of ethical
<br>
principles should increase as the context becomes broader.
<br>
<p>This holds despite the perception of local minima within smaller scopes of
<br>
applicability and time. For the same reason, in short, that children often
<br>
don't agree with their parents' view of what is best.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Habermas's approach suggests that good ethical systems will have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property that most people, if given the opportunity to freely express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opinion in an appropriate situation, living in a society that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposes the ethical system will agree that the ethical system is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea.
</em><br>
<p>The above seems to be as far as most current thinking goes, and leaves man
<br>
as the measure of moral systems.  As we move in post-humanity we need
<br>
something broader.  My own current thinking is that there appears to be an
<br>
&quot;arrow of morality&quot; that may be deduced from (still to be expanded)
<br>
complexity theory.
<br>
<p>In agreement with those who say all ethical theory is based on survival
<br>
value, it seems to me that we have profound examples in the natural world of
<br>
the underlying nature of what &quot;survival&quot; means, and it's the survival -
<br>
actually the growth - of information that appears to be at the core, all the
<br>
way from thermodynamics through biological organisms to human societies and
<br>
beyond.
<br>
<p>The scary part, to most people, is that understanding this requires a
<br>
complete loss of the conventional boundries between self and other, and a
<br>
new concept of self at a higher level of organization.
