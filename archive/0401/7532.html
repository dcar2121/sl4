<p>Taking the most simplistic view of &quot;desires==good, aversions==bad&quot;, the
<br>
problem with doing heroin instead of working, is that the long term
<br>
outcome results in something most people are averse to. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I can tell, a lot more people

<p>Yes, but they know it will lead eventually to something they are very
<br>
averse to. But what if it didn't? What if big daddy AI shot you up with
<br>
the best drugs that existed, kept you alive (until the universe ran out of 
<br>
fuel), and no tolerance of any sort ever developed. The best sensations
<br>
the human brain could experience yours for 100 billion years.
<br>
<p>Is this a good thing or a bad thing. I know I'd have a hell of a hard time
<br>
saying no to that, eventhough in many respects it is simply a form of
<br>
death. In the singularity everything breaks down morality wise. So many
<br>
possibilities open up, so many different perspectives to view the new
<br>
world from, that good and bad will be very hard to define (or rather the 
<br>
difficulties in there definitions will become more apparent). Minor 
<br>
thoughts in the mind of a massive AI might vastly exceed the complexity 
<br>
and experience of our entire lives, and be born and wiped out at a whim, 
<br>
or even exceeding the complexity of the entire human race as it now 
<br>
stands.
<br>
<p>Yet from another perspective these are just electrons, photons, or other
<br>
particles being moved around in certain patterns, rather than other
<br>
patterns. Who is to say which pattern of energy usage is good? Of course
<br>
the patterns might say so, but how would we even know how to listen to 
<br>
them?
