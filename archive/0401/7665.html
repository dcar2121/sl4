<em>&gt; I agree that removing physical sources of negative qualia would be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea.  Please, take headaches and upset stomachs away!!!
</em><br>
<p>It's on my to-do list :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, removing *emotional* sources of negative qualia seems more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questionable... I'm afraid that would end up removing too much of the
</em><br>
<p>What are emotional sources of negative qualia? I distinguish between complex
<br>
emotional responses (associated with behaviour and often including positive
<br>
and negative qualia) and the real qualia-creating process (qm stuff going on
<br>
in the microtubules? I have no clue). So within this terminology there is no
<br>
emotional source of negative qualia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For instance -- Don't take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;woman-troubles away, I'm worried they're too bound up with the joys of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;love...!
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand this example, are women experiencing or creating trouble?
<br>
(probably both) :)
<br>
But I think your argument goes like this: since human life is very
<br>
intricately connected with all the kinds of pain we experience, removing all
<br>
pains would mean removing a good deal of what gives us the opportunity to
<br>
experience pleasure as well (to remove the cancer you must remove a lot of
<br>
good tissue too); removing pain would mean removing good part of all we
<br>
feel.
<br>
<p>This is a frequent argument and I am at work so regardless of whether it is
<br>
what you meant let me analyze it in due depth.
<br>
<p>As I said in my last message I believe you can be happy about something even
<br>
if you have never suffered because of its loss. I personally would gladly
<br>
part with &quot;I am happy because I won and others have lost&quot; and take a milder
<br>
&quot;I am happy because we all won&quot;. In this case removing evil has removed a
<br>
bit of good which comes to the individual when everyone else (except the
<br>
person in question) experiences evil but this IS the better scenario. You
<br>
can't very well create good for everyone when good comes from others getting
<br>
smacked. I am also happy to part with &quot;how good it feels when your head
<br>
stops hurting!&quot; and take a &quot;my head doesn't feel good nor bad I am just used
<br>
to having no headache problems&quot; plus an added bonus &quot;I can reprogram my
<br>
embedded nanites anytime to experience intense dopamine release similar to
<br>
mammalian brain cessation-of-pain situations&quot;. In this case we preserve the
<br>
ability to experience the pleasure that accompanies the cessation of pain,
<br>
AND get rid of the pain. I mean, when we have no headache anymore life
<br>
doesn't stop there, you can go ahead and try a million more fancy and
<br>
rewarding qualia that will make you forget about &quot;how good it feels when
<br>
your head stops hurting&quot;.
<br>
<p>So I do not see any reason to preserve even one painful experience. Right
<br>
now our situation is hopeless, we are subject to any nasty chemical our body
<br>
wants to secrete. And, it may help some to justify in some way this evil
<br>
that imbues our lives, to make it more bearable (giving things a reason to
<br>
be makes them inevitable and puts them outside of our scope of attention:
<br>
kids get killed by bombings, but the way of the lord are mysterious so it's
<br>
still a sad business but the anger is gone). But ultimately &quot;taking away
<br>
suffering deprives us of this and that&quot; is equivalent to a &quot;taking away
<br>
suffering creates suffering&quot; argument and if we have taken away suffering it
<br>
can't possibly be created. Concretely speaking: eliminate the need to have
<br>
things that can only be obtained through pain, do whatever, I mean this is
<br>
what it's all about we are going to have control. How many ways are there to
<br>
crack software protections? I tried them all, each one works most of the
<br>
time, do the same with the brain, eliminate stupid needs, satisfy them
<br>
through the backdoor, make it believe they are satisfied, eliminate the
<br>
coupling between these and the pain supposedly needed to create them... If
<br>
you can't figure out a way make an AI who can.
<br>
<p>You don't have to take the crap nature secretes for you any longer. It's
<br>
gonna be fun, good and long lasting, a care-free positive satisfying happy
<br>
existence, for everyone, forever, no compromise needed. This is not
<br>
paradise, it's the status quo. AFTER, we start talking about positive qualia
<br>
and orgasmium and music with 459 octaves 500 voices, paintings with 2
<br>
billion different colors, sex in 98 dimensions... (sorry the monkey here
<br>
just started talking about red bananas... I know we'll have better stuff
<br>
after we are augmented).
<br>
<p>This said, we can think about the philosophical implications of removing
<br>
every little bit of pain AFTER we have gotten rid of the big bulk of pain
<br>
which is undoubtedly immoral. As long as we agree that this is the moral
<br>
thing to do and that hitler's opinion is _not_ just as valid.
<br>
<p>Back to work .... &lt;secretion:boring&gt;squirt&lt;/secretion&gt;
