<p>Perry, it's easy to argue that there is no objective morality, but so what?
<br>
It's easy to argue that there's no objective *anything*.  That's not such an
<br>
interesting sort of argument, is it?
<br>
<p>Sure, to argue that killing cows is worse than killing bugs but better than
<br>
killing humans, you need to begin from some assumption, such as the
<br>
assumption that causing pain to sentient beings is bad.  Without making SOME
<br>
assumption -- however abstract -- as to &quot;basic morality&quot; one can't have a
<br>
meaningful moral discussion.  All discussions of morality must proceed
<br>
within some common framework of moral understanding, and hence, as you say,
<br>
morality is not objective.
<br>
<p>However, to argue that the helium atom exists you also need to begin from
<br>
some assumptions, such as assumptions about the reliability of laboratory
<br>
instruments, the meaningfulness of various chemical terms, etc.  In fact, to
<br>
even begin to have a conversation about helium atoms with someone, a whole
<br>
network of social preconceptions has to be shared.  Try talking about helium
<br>
atoms with an Amazonian tribesperson who has just barely emerged from the
<br>
jungle for the first time and has had little contact with Western
<br>
civilization....
<br>
<p>It's not enough to argue that morality is subjective -- when you poke
<br>
anything hard enough, even a big hard granite rock, it begins to look
<br>
subjective (and I'm not even gonna get started on quantum philosophy right
<br>
now...).  To make a nontrivial argument, you have to argue that morality is
<br>
MORE subjective than the rest of the world....
<br>
<p>And, I'm not so sure that it is.  Much of morality is very subjective and
<br>
culturally-dependent.  But, at the core of morality lies the core value of
<br>
compassion, which may perhaps NOT be more subjective than the big hard
<br>
granite rock outside my window....
<br>
<p>Just as a rock has a kind of &quot;partial objectivity&quot; that distinguishes it
<br>
from more thoroughly subjective things like hallucinations and delusions;
<br>
so, perhaps, does compassion?
<br>
<p>The question is never whether X has objective, absolute reality or not.
<br>
Nothing does.  And the point is not to argue that X is subjective, therefore
<br>
meaningless -- that kind of nihilism was already found wanting by
<br>
Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and the whole proto-existentialist crew.  The point is
<br>
to make the right pragmatic distinctions in the inbetween realm of &quot;partial
<br>
objectivity&quot; or &quot;semi-reality&quot; (Phil Dick) or &quot;polyphonic reality&quot; (Mikhail
<br>
Bakhtin) where actual living experience and actual science both lie...
<br>
<p>Or, anyway, there's your (free for nothin'!) dose of Goertzellian philosophy
<br>
for the day ;) ;-p
