<p>Otherwise known as autistic spectrum. Supposedly an epidemic, in other

words the idiots in child psychology are finally noticing that nerds

often share certain characteristics. If you have enough of these

characteristics you now qualify for a diagnosis and brain washing

(ABA therapy). The child psychology idiots moved the goal post

substantially and then started bleating about an epidemic. Try to find

autistic traits.

<p>Its still far from complete, and needs some more cross referencing and

organization, I'm only a little way into the literature. Much of which is 
<br>
a pile of psychobabble rubbish, and drug company funded speculation about

which expensive dangerous drugs created for schizophrenia will best make

autistic children (future engineers, scientists and musicians) sit

through a school day passively. But I've tried to pick out the stuff
<br>
which is applicable to biology. I'm collecting a large amount of data on
<br>
genetics which needs to be worked on more and isn't attached to that page

yet.
