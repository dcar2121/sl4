<em>&gt; &gt; Economics is just the study of how people act.  Discussing the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a bogus overbroad definition of economics.  By fiat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you declare all action of intelligent beings to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;economics&quot;.  Thus discussion the action of SIs (or any other 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think it is common for everybody to see the world in terms of what they
<br>
know.  The economist sees everything as economics.  The moralists sees
<br>
everything as moral decisions.  The evolutionist sees everything as
<br>
evolution.  The physicist sees everything as physics.  The politician sees
<br>
everything as politics.
<br>
<p>I do the same thing with my security consulting.  Security is the act of
<br>
controlling your assets.  You want to make them available to yourself, keep
<br>
them from being co-opted by others, make them reliable and trustable.  If we
<br>
count ourselves and our bodies as our primary assets, then all self-defense,
<br>
self-control, self-improvement, self-determination, etc. become security
<br>
issues.  The same holds true for communities and groups.  Longevity is
<br>
continuity planning for ourselves.  Cryonics is disaster recovery.  Diet is
<br>
firewalling incoming resources.  Mind copies are backups.
<br>
<p>It all makes sense to me that everything is &quot;security&quot;.  But then, I am a
<br>
security consultant.
