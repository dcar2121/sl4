Hi Andrew,  
<br>
<em>&gt; There is no looming practical limitation on speech that will have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real impact on any of these areas.  It is an excuse to make something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political that isn't.  Europe has far greater restrictions on speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the US, yet I fail to see how that has &quot;materially contributed&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to *anything* supporting or suppressing things related to AGI.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually all purposes related to AGI, restrictions on speech that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments typically implement are transparent. VERY few political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters have any genuinely significant ramifications for AGI, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few that I can think of are either so bizarre or improbable that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not worth wasting any time on.  There is little value in bundling in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other pet issues into the topic of AGI, particularly when it largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolves around &quot;what if&quot;s of dubious importance or probability. 
</em><br>
<p>There's plenty of paranoia and partisanship around, for sure.  And I 
<br>
have no special knowledge of this issue that is not available to the 
<br>
average citizen.
<br>
<p>But my thoughts run along these lines.....
<br>
<p>After September 11, changes have occurred in the US (more so than in 
<br>
Europe perhaps) that some people think are moving the US sharply in 
<br>
the direction of reduced civil liberties (according to this view free 
<br>
speech is just one dimension of this).  Whether this is going to be a 
<br>
continuing and perhaps intensifying trend I cannot say. Maybe it won't, 
<br>
maybe it will.  So let's keep our eyes posted to watch the trends.  
<br>
<p>If restrictions on civil liberties continue and intensify then you might 
<br>
want to consider the line of logic I develop below.  If the trend doesn't 
<br>
continue or it reverses, then throw this email into the recycling.
<br>
<p>The reason people restrict civil liberties is to restrict some people's 
<br>
power in order to enhance the first group's power.  AGI technology is 
<br>
expected by many on this list to be vital to opening up a cornucopia of 
<br>
capabilities.  It will, according to the more optimistic assessments of 
<br>
what it will enable, provide huge benefits and capabilities (ie. 'power').  
<br>
*If* a society is suffering a significant and continuing erosion of civil 
<br>
liberties then that is a sign that one group of people in that society is 
<br>
trying to increase its power relative to others.  If AGI technology is 
<br>
under development it is most likely that this group of people won't want 
<br>
the people they are restricting to have access to that AGI power.  So I 
<br>
would anticipate a strong move to control who does and who doesn't 
<br>
get access to AGI power.  If this restriction goes beyond the obvious 
<br>
sensible restrictions like trying to stop real terrorists and crime 
<br>
syndicates from getting AGI power then we have a situation where 
<br>
some humans are wielding their own power in a not very 
<br>
Friendly/friendly way.  In such a climate I doubt that much effort will go 
<br>
into making sure that the AGIs that *are* allowed will be scrupulously 
<br>
configured and trained to be Friendly/friendly.
<br>
<p>But this is just speculation.  Only time will tell.  Watch this space....as 
<br>
they say!  
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
