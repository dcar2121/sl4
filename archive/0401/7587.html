<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Even a population made up of exclusively altruistic individuals

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; order to find an optimal solution to goods distribution, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And why wouldn't a society where individuals worked only in others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interests not work? Imagine that the pleasure reward from service
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is proportional to the good done by the act.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you make that true?  Prices are one reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient way.  If you have another way, I'm willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear about it (but this list may not be the proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; venue).
</em><br>
<p>Its already true to an extent for humans, do something beneficial to
<br>
another person, or society as a whole and see how you feel. This is
<br>
one driving force behind free software, the feeling of satisfaction
<br>
from knowing that your software is being used by 1 million people, even
<br>
if only a few actually realize you had anything to do with it.
<br>
<p>Creatures seek pleasure, if you make &gt;&gt;effectively&lt;&lt; helping to solve 
<br>
others problems a source of pleasure, then there is no need for a monetary 
<br>
system. There is still a 'payment' of sorts, the creatures whose toilet 
<br>
you unplugged would acknowledge that it was highly beneficial to them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; For example while cleaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sewers is an unpleasant task, its a task which accomplishs a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deal of good (preventing sewer backup), and would be a highly desirable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; task for the altruistic minded organism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, but if no one ever considers their own needs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others have to guess at what those needs are, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will often guess wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying to absolutely ignore your own needs. If you observe
<br>
a particular need (your own or others) and are unable to take care of 
<br>
it you would broadcast it. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Toilet ID=34053683 is backing up&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a producer of goods or services, you only know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the service you produce is actually useful if others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are willing to pay for it.  
</em><br>
<p>Or because they acknowledge your service as useful. If you
<br>
give someone a gift of a truck load of dog poo, unless they
<br>
are a farmer they arn't even going to take delivery let alone
<br>
acknowledge that it has benefitted them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without this information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you may spend your time producing goods that no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants.  It doesn't matter how altruistic you are about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donating your time to producing sewer-cleaning tutorials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if no one wants them; you're just wasting your time.
</em><br>
<p>And you will quickly become discouraged because your pleasure
<br>
seeking has been fruitless, and will go onto a more pleasure
<br>
producing activity. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Humans as currently wired have a mix of self interest and altruistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pleasure. Even as we are altruistic pleasure can be one of the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pleasures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many times in your life has someone given you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a gift that they expected you to be overjoyed with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but which you were indifferent to, or simply didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like?  Now rule out all the instances where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told the person what you needed.
</em><br>
<p>There is no reason to keep needs secret. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine if you depended on others' gift-giving for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting everything you wanted.  You'd have to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what you needed all the time in order to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any great chance of getting something resembling it.
</em><br>
<p>No harder than shopping is now. If a particular gift, lets
<br>
say digital cameras proves useful, those who are skilled at
<br>
there production are going to make more in anticipation of
<br>
the pleasure of giving them away. And there would certainly
<br>
be nothing wrong with mentioning that one would be useful 
<br>
to you. A while later being shows up at your door with a digital 
<br>
camera, you describe how useful it will be to you, the being leaves
<br>
quite ecstatic (maybe even orgasmic) at the knowledge that
<br>
they have been of use. Those who make the components for digital 
<br>
cameras are going to make more because there is an observed need 
<br>
for them and so on.
<br>
<p>It would have many things in common with a capitalist system,
<br>
with payment in pleasure instead of cash. However there is no
<br>
fixed money supply, the available pleasure is always equal to
<br>
the need. Again I'm talking about a society of engineered beings, 
<br>
I don't think human brain wiring is up to this as it stands. If 
<br>
you have too many selfish beings the system collapses.
<br>
<p>However even as things stand hyper capitalists often overlook just
<br>
how much the modern world owes to altruism of this sort. Those who
<br>
did for the pleasure of giving rather than for financial gain.
