This is surely wrong.  Even the non-uploaded, unaugmented me can think 
<br>
of dozens of projects that would consume more than a solar system's 
<br>
worth of resources.   For starters, I would like a hundred planets so I 
<br>
can test the punctuated equilibrium account of evolution.  (You have a 
<br>
slightly different design for the experiment?  Go get your own hundred 
<br>
planets!)  And I would like to terraform Mars so I can restage the 
<br>
Trojan wars.  And then there is the life size Ring World museum and 
<br>
amusement park--Earth's orbit will do nicely.  And I want a few billion 
<br>
space probes to send in various directions to search the universe for 
<br>
whatever strikes my fancy.  Yes, I know the AI(s) will be sending their 
<br>
own, but I like control of my own data streams, thank you.
<br>
<p>Don't forget that the singularity, while greatly increasing the 
<br>
resources available to effective use, will also greatly increase the 
<br>
capabilities of consumers to use resouces.  There is one solar system, 
<br>
but billions of us.  The current me cannot make effective use of an 
<br>
asteroid, but given affordable nanotech and spacetravel, I could use it 
<br>
for data storage, or to make a large sculpture, or a huge number of 
<br>
other purposes.  Scarcity won't be just a matter of food, clothing and 
<br>
shelter, as it is for many people on earth now.  Every single person 
<br>
will have the capabilty to transform the solar system to match their 
<br>
dreams, except for a few billion fellow dreamers who will stand in the 
<br>
way.  
<br>
<p>The singularity will increase competition for resources.  What remains 
<br>
to be seen is whether that competition is economic, or political, or 
<br>
violent, or lobbying the sysop.
