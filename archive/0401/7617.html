<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about concensus morality here.  In fact it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; certain that the moral advice of a higher intelligence would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; widely accepted if communicated directly, but humans will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; persuaded by the indirect, but tangible fruits of following its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What if there are no answers that yield obviously superior results for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; society? There is no answer, for example, to the meat question -- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yet there is great rage among some about killing and eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; animals. Many thorny moral questions have no objective answer, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is why they are thorny in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you clearly state, there are no simple answers to what we call &quot;moral&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions.  These issues are context-dependent and the terminology we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customarily use confuses by presuming absolutes that can't be attained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discussion and understanding would be improved if we all talked in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals and utility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point in presenting the &quot;arrow of morality&quot; concept is to find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether we can agree that with increasing wisdom (intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge) comes increasing morality.  If we agree on this, then we can work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together intentionally to improve our part of the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that any amount of wisdom or intelligence can answer the
<br>
meat question or a myriad of other questions, because they have no
<br>
answers. I'm not sure there is an &quot;arrow of morality&quot; here, just a
<br>
tendency of more intelligent creatures to find themselves in
<br>
increasingly complicated situations that they need good rules of thumb
<br>
for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The statement &quot;morality is subjective&quot; often carries the implication that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is therefore meaningless to compare or evaluate the relative morality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various actions.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. It is. There is no test that will provide units of moral
<br>
measurement.
<br>
<p>It is not meaningless to ask &quot;will humans that cooperate with their
<br>
fellows rather than trying to kill them have a greater chance of
<br>
survival&quot; -- that has a measure on it and can be tested, at least in
<br>
theory. Asking &quot;is it more moral to leave other humans alone or to eat
<br>
them&quot; is meaningless, as there is no way to ascertain an answer except
<br>
via definitionalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This strikes me as very similar to the post-modernist view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that reality is ultimately subjective and all points of view are therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of equal value.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Value&quot; is subjective. Reality isn't, since one can test what is real
<br>
and what is not. (All of reality might ultimately turn out to be a
<br>
simulation, but that's another story and in no way invalidates tests
<br>
of the reality of particular propositions within the context of the
<br>
simulated system.)
<br>
<p>The folks you speak of in cultural theory and the like start with a
<br>
reasonable sense of ideas that they get from other fields and then,
<br>
largely because they're ill equiped to understand them, misinterpret
<br>
them and come up with ridiculous conclusions. (What do you expect
<br>
though -- they're largely in English departments -- they're not
<br>
philosophers.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not implying that you espouse the po-mo point of view -- far from it.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would suggest, however, that it may be more useful to say &quot;morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context-dependent&quot; than to say &quot;morality is subjective&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It is not per se context dependent (though for some persons it might
<br>
be) -- it is subjective. There is a difference. To some people, the
<br>
&quot;right thing to do&quot; doesn't change with context -- but what &quot;the right
<br>
thing to do&quot; is shifts between person to person. Thus, subjective, but
<br>
not (necessarily) context dependent.
