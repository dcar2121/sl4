</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How do you make that true?  Prices are one reasonably

<em>&gt;&gt; efficient way.  If you have another way, I'm willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to hear about it (but this list may not be the proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; venue).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its already true to an extent for humans, do something beneficial to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another person, or society as a whole and see how you feel. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one driving force behind free software, the feeling of satisfaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from knowing that your software is being used by 1 million people, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if only a few actually realize you had anything to do with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creatures seek pleasure, if you make &gt;&gt;effectively&lt;&lt; helping to solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others problems a source of pleasure, then there is no need for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system. There is still a 'payment' of sorts, the creatures whose toilet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you unplugged would acknowledge that it was highly beneficial to them.
</em><br>
<p>Right, but the monetary system works for both kinds of
<br>
entity, so why not use it?  To use a non-monetary system,
<br>
it seems you'd have to make selfishness nonexistent, but
<br>
to use a monetary system, you don't have to make altruism
<br>
nonexistent.  Money is more general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Without this information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you may spend your time producing goods that no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wants.  It doesn't matter how altruistic you are about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; donating your time to producing sewer-cleaning tutorials
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if no one wants them; you're just wasting your time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you will quickly become discouraged because your pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeking has been fruitless, and will go onto a more pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing activity.
</em><br>
<p>...or one in which you'll be just as fruitless.  The
<br>
selection pressure to be useful is less intense, so
<br>
we can expect less usefulness in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Humans as currently wired have a mix of self interest and altruistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; pleasure. Even as we are altruistic pleasure can be one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; pleasures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How many times in your life has someone given you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a gift that they expected you to be overjoyed with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but which you were indifferent to, or simply didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like?  Now rule out all the instances where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; told the person what you needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no reason to keep needs secret.
</em><br>
<p>Nor was I suggesting that you should keep needs
<br>
secret (!?).  I was trying to point out the problem
<br>
of limited information.  You don't know what the
<br>
people around you need unless they tell you.  Prices
<br>
are an efficient method for them to communicate their
<br>
needs in a way that prompts others to deal first with
<br>
the needs that are most important to the person who
<br>
needs them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would have many things in common with a capitalist system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with payment in pleasure instead of cash. However there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixed money supply,
</em><br>
<p>There isn't a fixed money supply now.  That's a very long
<br>
discussion, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the available pleasure is always equal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the need. Again I'm talking about a society of engineered beings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think human brain wiring is up to this as it stands. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have too many selfish beings the system collapses.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this last.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However even as things stand hyper capitalists often overlook just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much the modern world owes to altruism of this sort. Those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did for the pleasure of giving rather than for financial gain.
</em><br>
<p>The great thing about markets is that they easily accomodate those
<br>
who do things for the pleasure of giving.  Those people are greatly
<br>
rewarded (if they're really doing good) as a side effect, but I
<br>
don't see this as a bad thing.
