</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;ever so inscrutable SAI decides it must be so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I do not rule out that killing everyone off could

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In that case I will not help you with any project you may undertake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;By this statement you are a potential major enemy to much I hold dear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are being very honest and I respect your opinion as long as you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what you have said, i.e. that you have no choice in the matter since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are an evolved being programmed to value personal survival above all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else.
</em><br>
<p>Since such a choice is explicitly not in my interest I would be quite irrational to choose my own demise except for a higher goal.  Read again.  I did not say I am unable to choose differently.  I said I choose not to support someone who believes it is quite ok to kill off his entire species.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been dead for 20 billion years before I was born. That didn't feel too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad. I have broken a nail yesterday, got weird stuff around my fingernail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt not so good. Is being dead wrong, or is staying dead wrong, or is dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong? I am not sure. But let's drop the death discussion since it's too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial, my bad, shouldn't have mentioned it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I see.  It all centers in your mind around how you feel.  How unfortunately enlightening.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If reality itself doesn't meet his exacting standards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not mine, but the standards of a transhuman AI who has high confidence it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has achieved absolute moral knowledge, and who is faced with the necessity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of making a quick choice without the possibility of going back to try again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Wait!  You have previously claimed there is no absolute morality.  Thus there is no &quot;absolute moral knowledge&quot;.   How can there ever be a &quot;choice&quot; to choose to do away with reality itself which includes the &quot;choice&quot;, chooser and all context completely?  It could only be remotely justified by something outside of reality itself, yes?  Your position appears to be more and more incoherent.

<em>&gt; &gt;If the &quot;interpretation&quot; was what convinced you of the advanced civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; residing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a soap bubble in your bath, then it is certainly not true that you can now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drop your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mere needless interpretation and let the soap-bubble super-civilization go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not my theory, I just like it :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you read the essay and still are convinced that it is nonsensical, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can mail the author.

</em><br>
<p>If you aren't going to stand up for what you like and present as authoritative on a question then why bother to pretend to be answering?
