&lt;fifty bazillion posts snipped&gt;
<br>
<p>Ah, the Singularity List has discovered David Hume!
<br>
<p>&quot;Natural red in tooth and Claw&quot; is a direct quote and
<br>
the philosophy of subjective morality  from his
<br>
argument that morality is found in &quot;feelings&quot; not
<br>
&quot;knowing.&quot;  &quot;Feelings&quot; are, of course, subjective.  
<br>
&quot;Feelings&quot; are defined very specifically by Hume but it
<br>
is enough to say, in this context, that they are not mere
<br>
emotions but a set of options for human interaction
<br>
arising from a complex basis of reason, emotion,
<br>
experience, action and the results of action.
<br>
<p>(It was Hume who stung Emmanuel Kant into writing
<br>
'A Critique of Pure Reason' - contending &quot;categorical
<br>
imperatives&quot; (objective criteria) are the standards of
<br>
morality.  With what success I leave for others to decide.)
<br>
<p>Hume's answer to the problem pf morality is:  &quot;Custom
<br>
is the great guide of human life.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Customs and mores, as anthopologists can tell us, are a
<br>
set of guidelines a society uses to structure human action
<br>
and interaction.  These customs are generally in accordance
<br>
with the mythos of the culture the society has developed
<br>
although it does not necessarily mandate or guide
<br>
the actions of any  individual or group within that society.  
<br>
But even diverse societies have a remarkably consistent set
<br>
of moral guidelines as first outlined in Huxley's 'Perennial
<br>
Philosophy.' So much so that scholars have a label, The
<br>
Axial Age, for the period (roughly 200 BCE to 600 CE)
<br>
when these guidelines disseminated across the Eurasian
<br>
continent.  This still holds true today as a cursory examination
<br>
of modern groupings, from the Amish to Marxists to Zen
<br>
Buddhists,  will attest.
