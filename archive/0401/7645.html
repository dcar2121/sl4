<p><em>&gt; One of the foundations of SL4s attractiveness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me, is that it's explicitly not for 'rehashing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basics'. This is the expert's pool, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description page seems to say. But what exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do we experts agree upon? What are we experts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about? It sometimes seems that no conclusions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever reached, people just get tired of fighting.
</em><br>
<p><p>'...get tired of fighting.'  yes, I'm sure this sometimes happens.  But in
<br>
my experience the arriving-at-a-conclusion is not the most valuable part of
<br>
the discussions on the lists you mentioned.  Observing how the conclusions
<br>
are worked towards seems much more informative, especially when rational
<br>
argument is aired from actors with differing knowledge and experience.  Each
<br>
of us must reach our own conclusions in the long run, and therefore,
<br>
studying how we might work them out for ourselves by observing others
<br>
presenting their arguments, is instructive.  What?
