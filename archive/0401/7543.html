<em>&gt; I'm not an expert in psychometrics, but as far as I know, IQ measures

</em><br>
<p>That is the claim, but I recall a great many tests in standard IQ
<br>
suites that are perfectly improvable with learning -- everything from
<br>
pattern recognition to math questions. That's an aside, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, having high IQ should make both learning math/physics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning social skills easier.
</em><br>
<p>It isn't clear that IQ measures anything like &quot;social intelligence&quot;,
<br>
but in any case, just because one might have an easier time learning
<br>
something doesn't mean one is necessarily motivated to do it or even
<br>
aware that there is anything to learn. Most socially inept people I
<br>
know seem oblivious to the fact that it is possible to learn social
<br>
skills if one wishes -- and if they do know it, they don't seem to be
<br>
willing to put in the effort, and it is no smaller an effort than most
<br>
major fields of human skill.
