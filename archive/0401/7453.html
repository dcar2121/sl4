<em>&gt; Your arrogance in this e-mail has been truly astounding, but

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>FWIW...
<br>
<p>I think that's a little harsh :-)
<br>
<p>You did: 1) Write a personal essay on your new mindset, inviting 
<br>
comments. 2) State that you seriously consider your newfound mindset to 
<br>
be a religion since you claim it is based on unfounded (and therefore 
<br>
irrational) beliefs 3) Then proceed to say in the quote above that you 
<br>
otherwise and generally hold and prefer the typical atheistic/humanistic 
<br>
mindset that many here would say is based on rationalism.
<br>
<p>So you might expect someone to look at all that, and based on their own 
<br>
experiences/knowledge/interpretation, decide to offer you the bits of 
<br>
advice you got from Perry. It doesn't mean you have to take them as 
<br>
worth anything, but I don't think they were arrogant or even unexpected 
<br>
- in fact, you seemingly set yourself up for it explicitly - at least 
<br>
from my POV and apparently Perry's.
<br>
<p>Also, I find his comments regarding the possibility of post-Singularity 
<br>
life continuing to be a growth-of-the-fittest type scenario (although it 
<br>
need not necessarily be &quot;violent&quot;) to be quite possible, as I know 
<br>
others here do too. At any rate, for one who claims on one hand to have 
<br>
no strong basis for your beliefs you do appear to have latched quite 
<br>
firmly and defensively onto a very specific idea of how things will turn 
<br>
out, or at least this is the impression you are giving off.
