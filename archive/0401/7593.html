<em>&gt; Right, but if no one ever considers their own needs,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Luckily, of course, parasitism takes over and very rapidly the
<br>
altruists die, sucked to death by the others.
<br>
<p>However, it would be amusing to see two true altruists sitting in a
<br>
desert together with only enough food to keep one of them alive. Both
<br>
will starve, but unlike the donkey starving to death between two bales
<br>
of hay because of metastability, the result is not just predictable
<br>
but necessary. (Solutions like drawing straws will not work, btw --
<br>
the true altruist will refuse any solution that gives him a chance of
<br>
surviving when others might do so instead.)
<br>
<p>Rand satirizes this sort of stupidity very effectively, but it is
<br>
amazing how people who don't grok the economic way of thinking
<br>
continue proposing it through the ages even though the problems with
<br>
it are so utterly manifest.
<br>
<p>Anyway, Communism has been tried. It doesn't work.
