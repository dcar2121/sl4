</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to think one can logically rule this one out -- strong

</em><br>
<p>I'm not disputing this.  It's just that this is usually known
<br>
as &quot;weak&quot; superintelligence, since the mind so described cannot
<br>
think thought it couldn't have otherwise, and will not have a
<br>
higher limit on conceptual understanding than it's much slower
<br>
brethren. To use a trite example, a dog that is speeded up a
<br>
million times will not be able to think as well as a human that
<br>
isn't.  Faster doesn't automatically mean more intelligent.
<br>
<p>Clearly, a human is more intelligent than a dog in a &quot;can
<br>
understand more complex concepts&quot; way.  My assertion above
<br>
was that it might be that there is a soft limit on the
<br>
complexity of concepts that a mind can understand, independently
<br>
of the speed of any given mind.
