<em>&gt; If morality is subjective, then the morality which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says the Holocaust was the greatest thing in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is every bit as good as the morality which condemns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>Of course. And, had the Nazis won, that would have been the morality
<br>
being taught everywhere.
<br>
<p>As it turns out, I don't particularly like that morality -- it has a
<br>
bad effect of leading to people attempting to kill me -- but I can't
<br>
say there is some experiment we can conduct that demonstrates killing
<br>
Gypsies is &quot;wrong&quot; but killing Reindeer is &quot;okay&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Cheetahs and antelopes aren't sentient (that's another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; discussion entirely) aren't sentient and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; can't negotiatie, at least not in the way humans do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Humans rarely negotiate with tuna before turning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them into very tasty sushi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A negotiation, at least in the way we understand it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires that both parties be sentient.
</em><br>
<p>What does &quot;sentient&quot; mean? Perhaps to a Jupiter-brain, we won't seem
<br>
very sentient, but we *will* seem rather tasty.
<br>
<p>How different is it, after all?
<br>
<p>I try talking to a tuna about physics, it gives me no answer, and I
<br>
conclude it isn't &quot;sentient&quot; the way I understand the term and eat it,
<br>
ignoring its pain response as I slaughter it because, after all,
<br>
they're just &quot;animal reflexes&quot;.
<br>
<p>The Jupiter-brain tries sending me an advanced encoded signal asking
<br>
my opinion on the solution to an astoundingly difficult math problem
<br>
which won't even fit inside my skull when encoded 20 bits to the
<br>
atom. I give it no meaningful reply, it concludes I'm not sentient,
<br>
and it decides to eat me, ignoring my pain responses which are, after
<br>
all, just &quot;animal reflexes&quot;.
<br>
<p>By the way, Tommy, eat any good pate de foie gras lately? Mmm, tasty.
