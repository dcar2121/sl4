<em>&gt;&gt; Death is morally neutral. Only suffering is evil.
</em><br>
<p>I will argue this to my last breath.  Death is NOT morally neutral.  Death
<br>
is the END of something and that something is either good or bad.  I would
<br>
argue that A death is as good or as bad as the opposite of the thing that it
<br>
ends - - tempered by the good or the bad of the thing that replaces it.  I
<br>
would also posit that death is innately minorly bad when it reduces
<br>
diversity.  Given this premise, I would strongly argue that there is no way
<br>
that killing off everyone could possibly be a good idea.  Like abortion in
<br>
many instances, it might be the best idea in a series of bad trade-offs but
<br>
it will never be a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I take the moral law I have chosen to its logical extreme, and won't take
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; back when it starts feeling uncomfortable.
</em><br>
<p>You sound like a hardcore fanatic.  Maybe your feelings of discomfort are
<br>
telling you something valuable.  Looks to me like a case of righteousness
<br>
over integrity.

<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Be very careful here! The easiest way to reduce undesirable qualia is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kill off everyone who has the potential for experiencing them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want someone who is superintelligent, and that takes my basic premises
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; temporary truths, and who recursively improves himself, and who
</em><br>
understands
<br>
<em>&gt; qualia in and out, to decide whether everyone should be killed. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider this eventuality (global extermination) and rule it out based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your current beliefs and intelligence, you are not being modest in front
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; massive superintelligence. I do not rule out that killing everyone off
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; be a good idea. Death is morally neutral. Only suffering is evil. Of
</em><br>
course
<br>
<em>&gt; a transhuman ai could do better than that by keeping everyone alive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy, which will reduce negative qualia and also create huge positive
</em><br>
ones,
<br>
<em>&gt; so I do have good hopes that we won't be killed. What if the universe was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really an evil machine and there was no way of reversing this truth? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if, in every process you care to imagine, all interpretations of the
</em><br>
process
<br>
<em>&gt; in which conscious observers were contained, were real to these observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just like the physical world is real to us? What if there existed infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hells where ultrasentient ultrasensitive beings were kept enslaved without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility to die? Is this not one universe that can be simulated and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by virtue of this interpreted out of any sufficiently complex process (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler processes: read moravec's simulation/consciousness/existence)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I take the moral law I have chosen to its logical extreme, and won't take
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; back when it starts feeling uncomfortable. If the universe is evil overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unfixable, it must be destroyed together with everything it contains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd need very good proof of this obviously but i do not discount the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that a person's method for determining the desireable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality is based partially on instincts, partially on training, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are talking about different things, i have answered this previously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ... are you sure about that? Just how heavily do you want the AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weigh it's self interest? Do you want it to be able to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its self interest? at zero obviously, other than the fact that the
</em><br>
universe
<br>
<em>&gt; is likely to contain a lot more positive qualia than negative ones if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral transhuman AI stays alive, so in the end its own survival would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important than the survival of humans, if you consider the million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds with biologically evolved beings that may be out there and in need
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; salvation. So at a certain point the best it could do morally to work
</em><br>
toward
<br>
<em>&gt; the goals we have agreed could be exactly exterminating humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Remember, friendliness isn't Friendliness. The former would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;like making an AI friend, the latter is nothing like it. Where he says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Friendliness should be the supergoal&quot; it means something more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;is really right should be the supergoal&quot;. Friendliness is an external
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is Friendliness creating a machine that wouldn't do something we wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like? Or is Friendliness creating a machine that wouldn't do something we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't like if we were as intelligent and altruistic as it is?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is assuming that &quot;right&quot; has some absolute meaning, but this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only true in the context of a certain set of axioms (call them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am proposing qualia as universal parameters to which every sentient (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least evolved ones) can relate. That was the whole purpose, so we don't
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; into this &quot;relativity&quot; argument which seems to justify things that I am
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; ready to accept because they just feel very wrong at a level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introspection that is as close as it could be to reality and cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further decomposed (negative qualia).
