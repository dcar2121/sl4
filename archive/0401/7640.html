<p>
By the way, you're blue.  I'm not sure if that carries information
<br>
or if you're just glad to see me.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
<p>the fact that morality is NOW almost entirely qualitative doesn't mean 
<br>
to me that it
<br>
won't become substantially quantitative one day.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<p>I agree.  The Pythagorean and Plato would agree and that's pretty good 
<br>
company.
<br>
(Socrates himself is particularly missed, a lovely little thinker but a 
<br>
bugger when
<br>
he's pissed.)  Of course so would Numerologists and that's not so good. 
<br>
&nbsp;The danger
<br>
here is if the idea &quot;What counts easiest, counts most&quot; or, even worse, &quot;What
<br>
counts easiest, counts&quot; is established before enough experimental feedback
<br>
is accumulated to determine the Truth Value of the equations.  Given our
<br>
species predilection to take everything to its logical perversion, no matter
<br>
how much it hurts, I am not sanguine.  On the other hand, the potential of
<br>
developing  an objective schemata for making moral decisions does have an
<br>
attraction.  
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
<p>I don't think quantitative morality will be more severely abusable than 
<br>
qualitative morality.
<br>
<p>That _would_ be hard to conceive wouldn't it!?  Although it is very
<br>
easy to conceive it would be abused in the same way:  &quot;Your Social Moral
<br>
quotient is a sub-par 34%; therefore, we are going to shoot you.  It's 
<br>
For the
<br>
Good of Society.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
...math can be abused just like anything else.
<br>
In most parts of science (and I'm not saying that morality is a science, 
<br>
though it may become one someday; I'm just making an analogy), the move 
<br>
to a more quantitative approach has decreased the amount of bias and 
<br>
abuse, rather than increased it.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<p>This is a tricky one.  I note your qualifiers &quot;In most parts of&quot;  and 
<br>
&quot;decreased
<br>
the amount of.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Overall I agree this is the case in the Physical Sciences but the last 
<br>
century
<br>
has also provided depressing counter examples.  One of many is the misuse
<br>
of mathematics by certain post Modernist thinkers whom, in the most
<br>
generous estimate, are one toke over the line.  Mathematics has a certain
<br>
cachet these days in the half-educated graduates the liberal arts 
<br>
departments
<br>
and universities insist on churning out.  In the fields of literary 
<br>
criticism,
<br>
history, philosophy of science, sociology, and anthropology mathematics 
<br>
- even
<br>
when misunderstood or not understood at all - is used as a talisman to 
<br>
seal an
<br>
argument.  It is the convincing stamp of approval.  
<br>
<p>This is obviously an abuse of mathematics but it is rampant and there are
<br>
professors and instructors who will go into their classroom tomorrow and
<br>
tell their students (get this):  &quot;There is no reality or universal laws 
<br>
uncovered
<br>
by science.  The so-called laws they claim to discover are merely 
<br>
interpretations
<br>
and have no more validity than any other interpretation.&quot;  In this view 
<br>
the state-
<br>
ments &quot;the earth rotates on its axis&quot; and &quot;God Wills It&quot; are equally valid
<br>
explanations for why the sun rises.  To &quot;prove&quot; their thesis they will 
<br>
trot out
<br>
some bogus statistics, set theory, or quantum mechanics and students,
<br>
ignorant of statistics, set theory, or quantum mechanics alike, swallow 
<br>
this
<br>
nonsense as valid.  
<br>
<p>This is getting too off topic for my comfort level so I will let you have
<br>
the last word, should you desire, and then end the thread.
