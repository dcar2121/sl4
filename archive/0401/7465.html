<p>In brains designed within an evolved biological being, yes.  So what though?  Would you argue that only evolved biological beings can be intelligent?

</em><br>
<p>That is not precisely the reverse.  What we recognize as a person is a very different discussion from what is the limit of our possible intelligence which is a very different discusion from what is the limit of intelligence universally. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>

<p>Hmmm, this looks like another off-track bit of analogical cogitation to me.
