<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think there is a correlation between high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ and psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There most certainly is -- people with high IQs tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social problems. That's not to say I would prefer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be dumber, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course.
</em><br>
<p>Social problems? Our society is almost certainly not
<br>
the ideal one, and has a lot of arbitrariness, so
<br>
rejecting it could quite possibly be a good thing.
<br>
Perhaps it's simply that brain modifications which
<br>
enhance intelligence also enhance weirdness. Not
<br>
counting the fact that people who are smarter seem
<br>
weirder anyway; any elementary school kid will attest
<br>
to that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If there were, I guess it would likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascribable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difficulties associated from being too far away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the mean of society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any major dimension, rather than due to intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unclear. Many people who are possessed of high IQs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack &quot;social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence&quot;, and it may very well be a question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be put in to both problems simultaneously. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to be good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at things like deep math or physics problems without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being obsessive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them -- but if you are obsessive about them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending a lot less time learning about social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills, which can lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to things like having a lot more trouble doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things like attracting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mate.
</em><br>
<p>Social skills are some of the most useless things
<br>
society has adopted. Learning them and the other
<br>
arbitrary conventions of society is more often than
<br>
not a waste of time. Perhaps this would lessen
<br>
people's willingness to cooperate with you, but that
<br>
almost certainly doesn't carry over into
<br>
transhumanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the revolutions technological society has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought us is the rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of conditions in which socially inept people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain large amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources with the application of pure problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solving intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then gain reproductive success even absent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skill. One wonders if the rise in the population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; syndromes like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autism (especially in forms like Asperger's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Syndrome) is correlated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this shift -- though of course it might not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected.
</em><br>
<p>Every single disorder, mental and physical, that
<br>
you've ever heard of has only been applied to human
<br>
brains, and thus nothing says that it has to apply to
<br>
other minds, let alone minds-in-general. Transhumans
<br>
don't need to accept disorders they can change at the
<br>
snap of a programming session, they don't need to
<br>
learn social skills, and they most certainly don't
<br>
need to find a mate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doubtless, by the way, evolution would &quot;fix&quot; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things with time. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been pointed out, high intelligence is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon and there hasn't been so much time for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution to shake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bugs out.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but transhumans won't be using evolution (I
<br>
hope....)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, also doubtless, we aren't going to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much time for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary biological evolution to deal with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't likely that the cutting edge of evolution will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans for much longer.
</em><br>
<p>The cutting edge of evolution will soon be the cutting
<br>
edge of recursive self-inprovement, or some other
<br>
improvement technique we haven't thought of.
