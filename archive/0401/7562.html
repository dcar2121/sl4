Moore's law originally referred to cost optimal
<br>
number of components in an integrated circuit
<br>
doubling every year.  The trend for integrated
<br>
circuits subsequently has been about 18 months
<br>
per doubling.  A 'Moore's Law pace' is therefore
<br>
a change of a factor of two per 18 months, and
<br>
can refer to things other than the number of
<br>
components in an IC.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Performance,
<br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately, does not linearly fit semilog plots,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hasn't been for quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a while now.
</em><br>
<p>I beg to differ.  This chart:
<br>
<a href="http://www.top500.org/lists/2003/11/PerformanceDevelopment.php">http://www.top500.org/lists/2003/11/PerformanceDevelopment.php</a>#
<br>
<p>shows that supercomputer performance has in fact
<br>
been increasing in just such a fashion.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you know which sort of system is useful for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI work?
</em><br>
<p>I don't.  I'm guessing that something like attention
<br>
and short term memory can be handled by RAM and that
<br>
something like long term memory and synapse connection
<br>
tables can be handled by hard drives.  
<br>
<p>I do believe that building an AI requires both
<br>
adequate software and adequate hardware.  Since
<br>
many people on this list concern themselves with
<br>
software, I've decided to track hardware trends.
<br>
<p>I wonder why you didn't
<br>
<em>&gt; include GBit Ethernet in your comparison.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the motherboard I priced would
<br>
support that much LAN traffic.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If optimistic estimates of the required computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power for human-level AI are correct at 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TFlop/s, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tee-hee.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you laugh?  That figure comes from Hans
<br>
Moravec.  While I consider it optimistic, he has
<br>
what I think is a reasonable means of coming up
<br>
with the figure.
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This assumes that 17 M$ worth of hardware achieves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent real-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance as a human. In other words, it assumes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI is a solved problem.
</em><br>
<p>No it doesn't.  Economic crossover means a computer
<br>
can perform a specific job at a lower cost than
<br>
humans. This has already occurred for tasks like
<br>
payroll processing, where all that is required is
<br>
simple arithmetic.  As more powerful computers
<br>
become available, more and more jobs can be performed
<br>
by them cheaper than us.  Economic crossover for
<br>
engineers would occur when a computer can do our
<br>
job cheaper than us.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I notice that no one is currently attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build self-rep systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite seminal work being about half a century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past. It's useless to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculate when something can be done, if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity collectively decides to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not pursue that particular path.
</em><br>
<p>Although I've been working on the concept of a
<br>
replicating factory in the form of a single
<br>
unit that can copy itself, our society as a whole
<br>
has been working towards automating production.
<br>
<p>Imagine if you will that the railroads and shipyards
<br>
fully automate handling of shipping containers
<br>
(those 8x40 foot steel boxes).  That factories
<br>
automate the unloading and loading of those boxes
<br>
with raw materials and finished products, etc.
<br>
<p>Once all the pieces get automated, your entire
<br>
industrial infrastructure acts as an automated
<br>
system.
