<em>&gt;&gt; What does &quot;better&quot; mean when you say type A memes will do &quot;better&quot;?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Better means having more copies of the meme in existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And why would they do better?  Memetic fitness and evolutionary

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better memetically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're being unexpectedly dense here. If meme A contributes to genetic 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased genetic fitness implies more relatives for carriers of A and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore also helps increase A's frequency in the meme pool.
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure that this is a significant memetic fitness boost.  In your 
<br>
language, I expect that memes are mostly transmitted between non-relatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, if memes are mostly transmitted between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-relatives, then the increased genetic fitness does not help A's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memetic fitness much. Instead, type B memes do better because their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carriers spend less resources on childcare and more on propagating the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes in other ways.
</em><br>
<p>This is not an either-or situation.  Type A memes might have some tiny 
<br>
amount of fitness from boosting the reproductive fitness of their holders, 
<br>
while type B memes have some huge boost in fitness from converting their 
<br>
holders into evangelists, thus causing type B to easily outcompete type A. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;History suggests that this is what has happened.  Barring the existence 
<br>
of contraceptives, people do not need to be told to have lots of children, 
<br>
nor to care for them - evolution is already screaming that into every 
<br>
neuron; what can a mere philosophy do to improve on that?  How much can a 
<br>
philosophy *boost* evolutionary fitness, realistically speaking, again in 
<br>
an age before contraception; and even then an insane amount of 
<br>
evolutionary fitness might not amount to much as memes go.  But if a mere 
<br>
philosophy should divert lots of effort away from reproduction and towards 
<br>
spreading the philosophy, why, that philosophy might spread to hundreds or 
<br>
thousands of carriers.  I think it implausible that memes should beat 
<br>
evolution at its own game of increasing reproductive fitness.
<br>
<p>And indeed the memes around us tend to be those that had their birth, 
<br>
their origins, in their spread by dedicated evangelists; there's no 
<br>
obvious evidence that memes are pouring all their strength into convincing 
<br>
people to have more children, but plenty of obvious evidence that memes 
<br>
are being selected to convince people to evangelize the meme.
<br>
<p>Your idea seems to me to be as follows:  People are, in general, more 
<br>
vulnerable to memes, because in the ancestral environment there were lots 
<br>
of memes around that offered philosophical reasons to attempt to have 
<br>
children, because memes that offered philosophical reasons to have lots of 
<br>
children created such a large differential in reproductive fitness as to 
<br>
amount to significance on the scale of memetic fitness, assuming that such 
<br>
memes are faithfully transmitted to children.  Is this an accurate 
<br>
representation?  It strikes me as really unlikely.  It is so much more 
<br>
difficult to raise a baby than to talk to someone for ten minutes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Also, why hypothesize a gene that discriminates childcare promoting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *memes* as such and promotes greater susceptibility to them, rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than a gene that makes people like children, and hence (as a side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; effect) memes that tap into people's liking for children?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no reason why these genes can't both exist, is there? I see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of memes that try to promote child rearing as an obligation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also memes that try to promote it as an enjoyment, which I count as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that both of these kinds of genes exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think it's not plausible that a gene can discriminate between a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type A meme and a type B meme and promote the former, consider the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis that the earlier in life that you encounter a meme, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely it is to be a type A meme. If this is true (and I think it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably was in our environment of evolutionary adaptation, because in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childhood your parents tend to keep you away from type B meme 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carriers), a gene can promote type A memes simply by making the brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credulous in childhood and then increasingly skeptical as one grows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older.
</em><br>
<p>This is an extremely exotic, multistep explanation (with each additional 
<br>
step decreasing the conjunctive probability) for a well-known phenomenon 
<br>
with many simpler explanations, such as a child being around entities that 
<br>
generally care for its welfare, and an adult having to take part in tribal 
<br>
politics and discriminate new ideas.  In fact, I believe I recall reading 
<br>
about something of an arms race between parental information and child's 
<br>
credulity; initially parents have a motive to provide the child with 
<br>
useful information, so the children evolve to be credulous, but then the 
<br>
standard parent-child conflict of interest kicks in and parents start 
<br>
telling their children to share evenly with their siblings, giving 
<br>
children a reason to be skeptical, and so on...  This is much more obvious 
<br>
than the proposition that &quot;children are likely to be around type A memes&quot;.
<br>
<p>But most of my own skepticism here derives from the proposition that (a) a 
<br>
philosophical urge to bear children increases reproductive fitness by such 
<br>
a large amount (in the ancestral environment) that the increase in 
<br>
reproductive fitness amounts to a competitive increase in memetic fitness 
<br>
(when memes can also be transmitted by talking for ten minutes, instead of 
<br>
raising a child) and that this persisted reliably over ancestral durations 
<br>
giving rise to genes which urge credulity to memes in general.  Humans 
<br>
sometimes do appear to be credulous but in contexts that suggest a quite 
<br>
different cause, i.e., social sanctions for people who fail to believe in 
<br>
the locally popular religion.  There is no sign that &quot;Believe in X, 
<br>
because X implies you should have more children!&quot; switches off people's 
<br>
brains the way &quot;God commands it!&quot; does.
