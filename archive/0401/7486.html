<em>&gt; Actually, a semantic distinction between *problem* and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *yet unsolved task*, should be appropriate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tomorrow breakfast is a problem, if I am starving and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no guaranties, that it will be a breakfast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow. But I will (probably) have just to buy and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cook something, so the tomorrow breakfast is just an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsolved task for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After a successful Singularity, we may still have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormous number of task to solve, but not problems like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunger, disease ...
</em><br>
<p>There might very well be something like hunger. Given only a finite
<br>
supply of energy and matter in a given finite volume, not all entities
<br>
might have as much energy and matter as they might profitably use.
<br>
<p>The problem of disease seems unlikely to vanish -- just that it will
<br>
bootstrap into an era of unimaginably bad software security problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's the use of having a singularity, if things were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not essentially better after it?
</em><br>
<p>Why need it have a use?
<br>
<p>The idea of a &quot;singularity&quot; in history is one Vernor Vinge came up
<br>
with to explain why you can't write good science fiction about what
<br>
happens after humans start amplifying their own intelligence or
<br>
creating creatures more intelligent than we are. Such an event is
<br>
almost inevitable if our race survives much longer, but it is not
<br>
something that has a &quot;purpose&quot; any more than the advent of the
<br>
renaissance had a &quot;purpose&quot;. It is just a term used for a period of
<br>
history -- it need not have a &quot;function&quot;.
