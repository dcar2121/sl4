</em><br>

<em>&gt; One of the things that then happens, of course, is that you end up

<p>The cost of commonness is when, for a type X, dX/dt is sub-linear in X, 
<br>
meaning that growth is sub-exponential, and that new types can invade from 
<br>
rarity even if they cannot become predominant.  If dX/dt is more than 
<br>
linear in X, growth is superexponential and you have a first mover 
<br>
advantage - new types cannot invade from rarity even if they would have a 
<br>
better carrying capacity when predominant.  I've heard these situations 
<br>
respectively called &quot;survival of anybody&quot; and &quot;survival of the first&quot;, in 
<br>
contrast to &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; when dX/dt is linear in X.
<br>
<p>Please note that these cases both depend on particular evolutionary 
<br>
dynamics.  Where would a cost of commonness arise in SIs competing to, I 
<br>
don't know, take over each other's stars or something?  If indeed there 
<br>
was any war at all, which seems to me doubtful (see next post).
