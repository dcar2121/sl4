<p>Not pacifist, but also not unreasoningly or overly aggressive. Aggression
<br>
tends to bring self defense, making unnecessary aggression an evolutionary
<br>
disadvantage. You will often see that predators have evolved strategies to
<br>
avoid actual aggression, instead resolving disputes with a proxy aggression 
<br>
to assert dominance and territory. 
<br>
<p>However I will agree that I think its unlikely to see a total paradise
<br>
free from all aggression. Our best hope may be that aggression will rarely
<br>
escalate to true violence. Societies that tend to escalate aggression will
<br>
tend to be rapidly wiped out in acts of self defense. The stakes will be
<br>
very high, anti matter weapons, astroids, and all sorts of stuff we can't
<br>
start to imagine. Hopefully beings will be more rational, and more suited
<br>
for a universe where aggression brings terrible results. Sadly current 
<br>
humans are still largely wired for a world where aggression brings a few 
<br>
bruises rather than death or massive carnage. We fight way to easily for
<br>
our own good.
