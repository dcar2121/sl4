<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; So what sort of strategies does evolution favor?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; them, actually, but none of them can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterized as &quot;pacifist&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not pacifist, but also not unreasoningly or overly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think ours is not an extraordinarily vicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and aggressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race, I direct you to the nearest factory farm or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaughterhouse. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are fully aware of where their food comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from, and yet we (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general) have very little compunction about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing to eat it.
</em><br>
<p>This is an artifact of 1), needing food to survive,
<br>
2), the limitations of our digestive system, and #0,
<br>
Drawinian evolution, none of which applies to AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, I will repeat a contention I've made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty frequently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a new example. There are people out there that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say &quot;meat is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder&quot;. There are people who enjoy a good steak.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;morally correct&quot;? What is the experiment we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conduct that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer this question?  I contend there is none, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer because absolute morality is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to start a separate thread on objective
<br>
vs. subjective morality, please do. Underline separate
<br>
thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Aggression tends to bring self defense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our race intelligently tends to stop being vicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only when self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense is likely (as in when dealing with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans) and tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be pretty brutal when dealing with life forms unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves effectively. Baboons can be pretty nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures, but as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we've got the cages and they don't, guess who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in who's vaccine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments?
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure I could produce a thousand reasons why that
<br>
could be a good thing, but I'm not going to because of
<br>
my innate tendency to rationalize.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's not to say, by the way, that I draw any sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality under which gluing the feet of geese to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bottoms of cages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and force feeding them to make their livers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly tasty is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;evil&quot;. I don't believe there is an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality, so I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to pretend that it is somehow &quot;wrong&quot; to turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geese into foie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gras. However, you would be pretty much incorrect if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you thought the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geese weren't pissed off about the process -- it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very obvious that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're miserable. (One might argue if animals can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments used to claim they can't could just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily be applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people -- I'm going to stipulate that if a cat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screams in pain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you stick it with a hot iron that it is in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering.)
</em><br>
<p>Aha, so you agree that morality is at least partly
<br>
objective. I still think that you think that a lot of
<br>
it is subjective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You will often see that predators have evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; avoid actual aggression, instead resolving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disputes with a proxy aggression 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to assert dominance and territory. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *With each other*, since two members of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species have nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same capacity for violence. It is rare that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheetahs negotiating with herds of antelope to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to non-violently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settle their &quot;disputes&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Cheetahs and antelopes aren't sentient (that's another
<br>
discussion entirely) aren't sentient and therefore
<br>
can't negotiatie, at least not in the way humans do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution is not, however, free of aggression even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within species. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would direct you to the latest data on the behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our nearest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatives, the chimps and bonobos. They're pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty when they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can get away with it -- as, by the way, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. It is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that most creatures have evolved not to get into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fights they will lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they can help it, and thus there are fairly few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intra-species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combats compared to inter-species ones.
