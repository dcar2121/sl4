<em>&gt; I don't think there is a correlation between high IQ and psychological

</em><br>
<p>There most certainly is -- people with high IQs tend to have serious
<br>
social problems. That's not to say I would prefer to be dumber, of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there were, I guess it would likely be ascribable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulties associated from being too far away from the mean of society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any major dimension, rather than due to intrinsic problems associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Unclear. Many people who are possessed of high IQs lack &quot;social
<br>
intelligence&quot;, and it may very well be a question of how much effort
<br>
can be put in to both problems simultaneously. It is hard to be good
<br>
at things like deep math or physics problems without being obsessive
<br>
about them -- but if you are obsessive about them, it leads to
<br>
spending a lot less time learning about social skills, which can lead
<br>
to things like having a lot more trouble doing things like attracting
<br>
a mate.
<br>
<p>One of the revolutions technological society has brought us is the rise
<br>
of conditions in which socially inept people can gain large amounts of
<br>
resources with the application of pure problem solving intelligence,
<br>
and then gain reproductive success even absent significant social
<br>
skill. One wonders if the rise in the population of syndromes like
<br>
autism (especially in forms like Asperger's Syndrome) is correlated
<br>
with this shift -- though of course it might not be connected.
<br>
<p>Doubtless, by the way, evolution would &quot;fix&quot; such things with time. As
<br>
has been pointed out, high intelligence is a relatively recent
<br>
phenomenon and there hasn't been so much time for evolution to shake
<br>
the bugs out.
<br>
<p>However, also doubtless, we aren't going to have much time for
<br>
ordinary biological evolution to deal with this problem, since it
<br>
isn't likely that the cutting edge of evolution will be biological
<br>
humans for much longer.
