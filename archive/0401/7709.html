At one time there was talk of creating a computer based language parser 
<br>
(or maybe it existed?)  Does it exist?  One gradual step into computer 
<br>
understood language might be to have a parser for a full language, and a 
<br>
compiler/interpreter for the parts of the language that the computer 
<br>
knew how to deal with.  Thus &quot;See Spot run.  Run, Spot, run!&quot;  could be 
<br>
parsed, but to expect the computer to know what Spot was would be ... 
<br>
not the right place to start.  But if you said &quot;Jane, Jane!  What is one 
<br>
plus two?&quot;  The computer should be able to determine the answer to the 
<br>
question.  Also that somebody named Jane was being asked to give the 
<br>
answer.  It  might not know what kind of entity a Jane was, but should 
<br>
be able to determine that a Jane was expected to understand verbal 
<br>
interactions.  Possibly also that Jane was an instance rather than a 
<br>
class, i.e., some particular entity with the name Jane attached was 
<br>
being addressed.  Etc.
<br>
<p>I've often thought that this might be a good starting point, but the 
<br>
computer languages that I've examined have all been too inflexible to be 
<br>
extended in this way.  It's an interesting question just how much 
<br>
knowledge of the world is inherrent in the language that is used to 
<br>
describe it.  For most of the world the answer is probably &quot;it's a 
<br>
pretty high level abstraction&quot;, but when we get right down to math and 
<br>
engineering, then the levels of abstraction melt away, and a logic 
<br>
engine should be able to derive a lot about the nature of the world 
<br>
merely from the language usage.   I *think* the reason so much of it is 
<br>
at a high level of abstraction is because there's a usually valid 
<br>
assumption of a great deal of common experience and of a basic 
<br>
similarity of the underlying mental landscape.  But this won't be true 
<br>
of an AI of whatever kind.  And neither will the environment that it 
<br>
develops in be all that similar.  Mutual understanding is necessarily 
<br>
going to be quite difficult.  A shared language might help.  (And once 
<br>
one language was handled, it might be possible to learn to translate 
<br>
others.)
