</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It might be significantly easier to engineer an AI with a 20% or 1%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (say) chance of being Friendly, than to engineer one with a 99.99%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of being Friendly.  If this is the case, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; broad-physical-dispersal approach that I suggested makes sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  I doubt that it is &quot;significantly easier&quot;.  To get a 1% chance you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must solve 99% of the problem, as 'twere.  It is no different from trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build a machine with a 1% chance of being an internal combustion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engine, a program with a 1% chance of being a spreadsheet, or a document
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a 1% chance of being well-formed XML.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the analogies you're making are quite poor, because internal
<br>
combustion engines and spreadsheets and XML documents are not complex
<br>
self-organizing systems.  With Friendly AI, we're talking about creating an
<br>
initial condition, letting some dynamics run (interactively with the
<br>
environment, which includes us), and then continually nudging the dynamics
<br>
to keep them running in a Friendly direction.  This is a very different ---
<br>
and plausibly, much less deterministic -- process than building a relatively
<br>
static machine like a car engine or a spreadsheet.
<br>
<p>It may well be that it's not possible to create a program with more than x%
<br>
chance of being Friendly, where x=20% or 40% or 93.555%, or whatever.  I
<br>
don't have a strong intuition as to whether this IS or IS NOT the case...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2)  Ignoring (1), and supposing someone built an AI with a 1% real chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being Friendly, I exceedingly doubt its maker would have the skill to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculate that as a quantitative probability.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, that's true.  But it's also true that, if someone built an AI
<br>
with a 99.999% chance of being Friendly, it's maker is not likely to have
<br>
the skill to calculate that as a quantitative probability.  Making
<br>
quantitative predictions about this kind of system is next to impossible,
<br>
because the dynamic evolution of the system is going to depend on its
<br>
environment -- on human interactions with it, and so forth.  So to make a
<br>
rigorous probability estimate you'd have to set various quantitative bounds
<br>
on various environmental conditions, human behaviors, etc.  Very tricky ...
<br>
not just a math problem, for sure... (and the math problems involved are
<br>
formidable enough even without these environmental-modeling considerations!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3)  So we are not talking about a quantitative calculation that a program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be Friendly, but rather an application of the Principle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indifference to surface outcomes.  The maker just doesn't really know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the program will be Friendly or not, and so pulls a probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of his ass.
</em><br>
<p>There are a lot of intermediate cases between a fully rigorous quantitative
<br>
calculation, and a purely nonrigorous &quot;ass number.&quot;
<br>
<p>After all, should you ever come up with a design that you think will ensure
<br>
Friendliness, you're not likely to have a fully rigorous  mathematical proof
<br>
that it will do so ... there will be a certain amount of informal reasoning
<br>
required to follow your arguments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4)  Extremely extensive research shows that &quot;probabilities&quot; which people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull out of their asses (as opposed to being able to calculate them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantitatively) are not calibrated, that is, they bear essentially no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relation to reality.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but your statement doesn't hold when applied to teams of scientists
<br>
making careful estimates of probabilities events based on a combination of
<br>
science, math and intuition.  In this case, estimates are still imperfect --
<br>
and errors happen -- but things are not as bad as you're alleging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6)  And finally, of course, the probabilities are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent!  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best AI you can make isn't good enough, a million copies of it don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent chances of success.
</em><br>
<p>This depends a great deal on the nature of the AI.
<br>
<p>If you're creating an AI that is a dynamical system, and you're building an
<br>
initial condition and letting it evolve in a way that is driven partially by
<br>
environmental influences, then if you run many copies of it independently
<br>
<p>a) of course, the dynamics of the different instances are not
<br>
probabilistically independent
<br>
<p>b) nevertheless, they may be VERY far from identical, and may come to a wide
<br>
variety of different outcomes
<br>
<p>My dreamed idea (which wasn't so serious, by the way!) did not rely upon the
<br>
assumption of complete probabilistic independence between multiple evolving
<br>
instances of the AI.  It did rely upon the idea of a self-modifying AI as a
<br>
pragmatically-nondeterministic, environmentally-coupled system rather than a
<br>
strongly-deterministic system like an auto engine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's wrong with this picture:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a)  Confusing plausibility with frequency;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b)  Assigning something called a &quot;probability&quot; in the absence of a theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful enough to calculate it quantitatively;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c)  Treating highly correlated probabilities as independent;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; d)  Applying the Principle of Indifference to surface outcomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elementary interchangeable events; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e)  Attempting to trade off not knowing how to solve a problem for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confessing a &quot;1%&quot; probability of success.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I am definitely not guilty of errors a, c or d
<br>
<p>As for error b, I don't think it's bad to call an unknown quantity a
<br>
probability just because I currently lack the evidence to calculate the
<br>
value of the quantity.  b is not an error.
<br>
<p>As for e, there may be some problems for which there are no
<br>
guaranteed-successful solutions, only solutions that have a reasonable
<br>
probability of success.  You seem highly certain that Friendly AI does not
<br>
lie in this class, but you have given no evidence in favor of your
<br>
assertion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if you're wondering why I'm so down on this, it's because it seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me like yet another excuse for not knowing how to build a Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I *do* know how to build a Friendly AI.... ;-)
<br>
<p>[I wasn't so sure a year ago, but recent simplifications in the Novamente
<br>
design (removing some of the harder-to-control components and replacing them
<br>
with probabilistic-inference-based alternatives) have made me more
<br>
confident.]
<br>
<p>But I can't *guarantee* this AI will be Friendly no matter what; all I can
<br>
give are reasonable intuitive arguments why it will be Friendly.  The
<br>
probability of the Friendliness outcome is not easy to calculate, as you've
<br>
pointed out so loquaciously.
<br>
<p>And then I wonder whether that my &quot;reasonable intuitive arguments&quot; ---- and
<br>
*all* human arguments, whether we consider them rigorous or not; even our
<br>
best mathematical proofs --- kinda fall apart and reveal limitations when we
<br>
get into the domain of vastly transhuman intelligence.  So I tend to apply
<br>
(a mix of rigorous and intuitive) probabilistic thinking when thinking about
<br>
transhuman AI's that are just a bit smarter than humans ... and then rely on
<br>
ignorance-based Principle of Indifference type thinking, when thinking about
<br>
transhuman AI's that are vastly, vastly smarter than any of us.
