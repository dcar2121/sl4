<p>How do you ensure that the optimization control structures *remain*
<br>
high-fidelity copies over billions of years? Each control structure will
<br>
have to process environmental data as well as communications with
<br>
neighboring control structures and the so called &quot;configurations that
<br>
fulfill intrinsic utilities&quot; which I presume may be intelligent beings.
<br>
All of these will have local variations. Somehow the SI has to ensure that
<br>
processing these variations does not cause heritable differences. This
<br>
may or may not be possible, but as I suggested earlier the only way it can
<br>
succeed is if the SI imposes a strict limit on the kinds of communications
<br>
that can occur between neighboring control structures and between control
<br>
structures and the configurations that fulfill intrinsic utilities if they
<br>
are intelligent beings to prevent memes from being transmitted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there were heritable 
</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; will choose equally to transform nearby matter.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this. Whatever limitations the SI imposes on the control
<br>
structures in order to maximize their long term fidelity will have a
<br>
negative effect on their reproductive fitness when in competition with 
<br>
replicators that do not have such limits, and certainly the removal of 
<br>
these limits is a heritable difference.
