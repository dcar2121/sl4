<p>Amara Angelica has forwarded some of the recent discussion regarding
<br>
GFlops cost to me -- below are a few comments.
<br>
<p>I believe Daniel said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moore's law originally referred to cost optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of components in an integrated circuit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubling every year.  The trend for integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuits subsequently has been about 18 months
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per doubling.  A 'Moore's Law pace' is therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a change of a factor of two per 18 months, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can refer to things other than the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components in an IC.
</em><br>
<p>Fine -- but CPU speed isn't the problem!
<br>
Look at:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dongarra, J., &quot;Trends in High Performance Computing and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Computational Grid&quot;, Annual High Performance Computing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Communications Conference, April 2-4, 2002, Newport,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhode Island.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hpcc-usa.org/pics/02-pres/dongarra.pdf">http://www.hpcc-usa.org/pics/02-pres/dongarra.pdf</a>
<br>
Slide:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where DOes the Performance Go? or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why SHould I Care About the Memory Hierarchy?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pg 20 of 30).
<br>
<p>Shows the real problem is memory access time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I beg to differ.  This chart: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.top500.org/lists/2003/11/PerformanceDevelopment.php">http://www.top500.org/lists/2003/11/PerformanceDevelopment.php</a>#
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows that supercomputer performance has in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been increasing in just such a fashion.
</em><br>
<p>Supercomputers are a very poor measure of Moore's Law.  One
<br>
can fool yourself into thinking that performance is increasing by simply
<br>
throwing more processors at the problem.  And that is largely what they
<br>
have been doing.  But that has limits. You will find that companies like
<br>
SGI, now Cray, IBM and others are having to put at least as much
<br>
engineering into the data switches between processor nodes as they put
<br>
into the processors themselves.
<br>
<p>In fact (though I can't find it now) I've seen one chart for the next
<br>
Semiconductor Industry Road Map that shows traditional increases slowing
<br>
down.  I think this in large part is due to hitting the limits on chip
<br>
heat density without more sophisticated (and more expensive) cooling --
<br>
you also have to start asking how many pins its going to take to get 55
<br>
Amps (100W/1.8V) into a microprocessor?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I wonder why you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; include GBit Ethernet in your comparison.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the motherboard I priced would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support that much LAN traffic.
</em><br>
<p>Well then I think you may have a *big* problem.
<br>
Assume the brain contains ~60 billion neurons (a reasonably justifiable
<br>
number) producing 100 action potentials a second with a fanout (# of
<br>
synapses/neuron) per neuron of 1000 and a minimum data value per synapse
<br>
of 1 byte (i.e. how much information gets transmitted at each synapse
<br>
per action potential). With those parameters the internal brain
<br>
bandwidth is ~6000 TB/sec. You can juggle these numbers a bit but you
<br>
aren't going to change them by many orders of magnitude.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying you can't get this -- it works out to about the
<br>
*internal* data bandwidth of 10,000 Fuzion 150 high end graphics cards.
<br>
Note the stress on *internal*.  The external bandwidth is 2 orders of
<br>
magnitude lower.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do you laugh?  That figure comes from Hans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moravec.  While I consider it optimistic, he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I think is a reasonable means of coming up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the figure.
</em><br>
<p>Sure but it is primarily dealing with the processing power required to
<br>
match a limited subset of the brain.  He never goes into the problem of
<br>
getting power in, getting waste heat out and interprocessor and
<br>
internodal delays particularly when scaling up to human brain
<br>
capacities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although I've been working on the concept of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicating factory in the form of a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit that can copy itself, our society as a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been working towards automating production.
</em><br>
<p>Its already to a large extent been worked out.
<br>
For a general overview see:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines by Freitas and Merkle
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm">http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm</a>
<br>
and for the first serious study see:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Automation for Space Missions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.islandone.org/MMSG/aasm/">http://www.islandone.org/MMSG/aasm/</a>
<br>
Both of these are discussed on the Freitas web site:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rfreitas.com/">http://www.rfreitas.com/</a>
<br>
<p>But we already have self-replicating factories -- they are called cells
<br>
and they are extensively used in some types of drug production and
<br>
agriculture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine if you will that the railroads and shipyards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully automate handling of shipping containers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (those 8x40 foot steel boxes).  That factories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automate the unloading and loading of those boxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with raw materials and finished products, etc.
</em><br>
<p>This has largely alreaedy been done.  Visit a major shipping port like
<br>
Seattle.  The cost of the humans to operate the container moving cranes
<br>
is very small compared to the capital investment in the port, ships,
<br>
containers, flatcars, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once all the pieces get automated, your entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrial infrastructure acts as an automated system.
</em><br>
<p>The key point is *all* the pieces -- we are a long way away from that.
<br>
