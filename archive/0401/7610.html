<p>Such parasites would not be operating in there own self interest since

destroying the altruists would destroy themselves as well (or atleast

end there career as parasites).

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Going to the same degree of absurdity you could make the same claim
<br>
for capitalists, if you assume perfect symmetry. They would both likely
<br>
fatally injure each other fighting over the food. If anything in a
<br>
realistic scenerio the altruists are more likely to have one come out
<br>
alive.

<p><em>&gt; Rand satirizes this sort of stupidity very effectively, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazing how people who don't grok the economic way of thinking
</em><br>

<p>I understand it, and I also see its limits. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, Communism has been tried. It doesn't work.
</em><br>
<p>The so called communist countries where hardly a reasonable attempt.
<br>
Thats not to say it would work with humans as presently wired, just that
<br>
you can't point to a drastically flawed attempt and say that its 
<br>
universally impossible.
