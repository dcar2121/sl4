Ben, I want to take the other side to this.  Technical competence in at 
<br>
least some fields and at least a little effort to familiarize oneself 
<br>
with the background to sl1-4 is presumed on this list.  Such competence 
<br>
and effort may not be required when arguing moral philosophy here 
<br>
(although if friendliness is as important as we all think, perhaps it 
<br>
should be), but pointing out atrocious arguments about moral philosophy 
<br>
without mincing words is not a bad thing.
<br>
<p>In the midst of an argument whether there is an objectively correct 
<br>
moral theory, Metaqualia proposed the maximization of positive qualia 
<br>
and the minimization of negative qualia as an answer to the debate.  The 
<br>
debate has gone off in various directions since, and some of the 
<br>
subsidiary points are interesting, but his main argument commits three 
<br>
terrible philosophical howlers.
<br>
<p>First, it completely begs the question it set out to answer.  Instead of 
<br>
showing how moral arguments can be objectively justified, it offered a 
<br>
moral theory that makes judgments by counting purportedly objective 
<br>
events.  But there are an infinite number of similar theories, such as  
<br>
the theory that morality requires the maximization of the number of 
<br>
pebbles in the universe, and the minimization of furballs.  The 
<br>
objectivity of the justification of any such theory is separate from the 
<br>
objectivity of the things counted.  Trying to silence objections on the 
<br>
first level by deflecting attention to the objectivity of, for example, 
<br>
physiological pleasure and pain, is a common philosophical debating trick.
<br>
<p>Second, his theory does not achieve objectivity of even the lesser sort 
<br>
because &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; are not objective terms.  Indeed in 
<br>
the present context they are circular:  Morality asks, &quot;what is good?&quot; 
<br>
and the theory answers: &quot;Positive, that is, good qualia.&quot;     This is 
<br>
the most basic blunder in the field of moral philosophy: defining the 
<br>
good by merely giving a synonym.   Of course, if one gives a more 
<br>
detailed account of what a positive qualia is that provides content 
<br>
beyond &quot;a good qualia&quot;, then you have something to start a theory with. 
<br>
&nbsp;Unfortunately, when pressed, Metaqualia wrote that he did not have a 
<br>
more elaborate account of what makes a qualia positive.
<br>
<p>Third, his other key term, qualia, is not objective either.  Indeed, the 
<br>
modern philosophical use of the term began with the logical 
<br>
positivists,  who wanted to pick out subjective sense impressions with a 
<br>
term that carried no hint of (and thus contamination from) the objective 
<br>
causes of the sense impressions.  Qualia are the purely subjective 
<br>
aspect of sense impressions.  Once you get to the point of saying, &quot;I 
<br>
see an apple,&quot; you have left the qualia behind:  the judgement that the 
<br>
red splotch you see is an apple is a synthetic judgment (about a 
<br>
potentially objective state of affairs) that goes well beyond the 
<br>
subjective sense impression.  Or so the standard account goes.  Talking 
<br>
of the stream of consciousness as a qualia stream is also far outside 
<br>
the standard usage, because the stream of consciousness includes a lot 
<br>
of things other than sense impressions.
<br>
<p>If you just forget objectivity, is Metaqualia's theory of any interest 
<br>
as a moral theory?  Yes, but only because the most charitable way to 
<br>
read it is as a statement of a basic variant of utilitarianism.  And the 
<br>
arguments people are raising against him, over death for example, are 
<br>
the same arguments people raised against utilitarianism understood as 
<br>
increasing the ratio of pleasure to pain.  There is no doubt that, 
<br>
secondary effects aside, killing the most unhappy could improve the 
<br>
ratio.  Utilitarians refined their theory to avoid such arguments, and 
<br>
Metaqualia presumably will too, if he is pressed.  But the argument will 
<br>
be easier to follow if the misused jargon is just dropped.
<br>
<p>I do not mean to dismiss Metaqualia's participation in these threads. 
<br>
&nbsp;By all I can tell he is a clever and charming fellow.  But while you 
<br>
seem to think that the list is in danger of being too orthodox, I think 
<br>
the moral and economic discussions are in danger of losing all rigor and 
<br>
usefulness.   I would like to encourage people who think friendliness is 
<br>
important to take moral philosophy seriously, do some background reading 
<br>
and treat the field with some respect.  Ben, you and Mitchell Porter on 
<br>
this list are quite well read in the area, and Eliezer is deeply read in 
<br>
one part of the field, but you are rarities on this list.  There are a 
<br>
few people, like Samantha Atkins, who have enough common sense and a 
<br>
good enough bullshit detector to regularly see through theoretical 
<br>
folderol even in areas well outside her field.  Encourage others to be 
<br>
like you or her;  the takers of unorthodox positions need no 
<br>
encouragement.  The members of this list (including Metaqualia) are far 
<br>
to bright to settle for this level of argument on a topic they think is 
<br>
important.
<br>
<p>(Retired professor crawls back in his hole until spring; sorry for the 
<br>
rant.)
