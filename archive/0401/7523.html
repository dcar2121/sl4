<p>I'm not an expert in psychometrics, but as far as I know, IQ measures
<br>
something that has little to do with effort. Instead, having high IQ
<br>
should make both learning math/physics and learning social skills easier.  
<br>
Which subject one decides to devote more effort to is logically
<br>
independent of IQ.
<br>
<p>Let me advance the alternative hypothesis that smart people are 
<br>
socially excluded and/or persecuted when they are young *because of their
<br>
intelligent*, and the lack of social skills is a result, rather than a 
<br>
cause of social problems they face. Again, see

<br>
the game theory behind this idea.
