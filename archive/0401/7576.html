<em>&gt; c * (positive qualia -negative qualia) + (1-c)* (total complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern)
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly where my theory leads in the real world, in which you will
<br>
inevitably produce both negative and positive qualia whenever you move a
<br>
finger.
<br>
<p>About pattern complexity: unfortunately there is no way to test the
<br>
assumption behind your equation (although intuitively I think it's right),
<br>
namely, that more complex beings experience more powerful qualia. Since
<br>
qualia are created by the brain, it would be reasonable to believe that more
<br>
brains = more qualia. However, it is possible that when we know what
<br>
mechanisms do create qualia, we will discover they are present in most or
<br>
all animals with a nervous system or that they do not require very complex
<br>
cognitive architectures or that they don't scale proportionally with brain
<br>
size. Since the strongest qualia are associated with very low-level
<br>
low-information responses (cutting off a limb, orgasms, fear) we may just
<br>
find that starfish are the most sensitive creatures in the known universe.
<br>
On the other hand, if you look at other physical phenomena, most of them are
<br>
scalable with the size of the object. Gravity scales well with mass,
<br>
magnetic fields etc. all scale well, you don't find many effects in the real
<br>
world that are independent of the scale of the cause (of course one could
<br>
name some exceptions such as nuclear reactions where obviously stuff is
<br>
quantized).
<br>
So while my intuition is that qualia should scale with brain size, I am not
<br>
sure of it, and it could very well depend on specific architectures. So the
<br>
conservative thing to do for now is look at how a being responds to a
<br>
stimulus, and the stronger the response, the more intense the sensation it
<br>
is probably experiencing.
<br>
<p>Another thorny issue is the positive qualia vs. negative qualia one.
<br>
Although they are opposite you can't really trade one for the other. Things
<br>
get more complicated when you have more than one individual involved. Is it
<br>
right to cut A's finger so that B's arm remains intact?
<br>
<p>We need a quick fix until we get enough technology to preserve both the
<br>
finger and the arm, and then we'll be problem free.
<br>
<p>My quick fix is:
<br>
<p>-Prioritize larger brain beings (us) only when a trade off between our
<br>
finger/their paw is absolutely necessary (kill the bear before it eats you,
<br>
but then you shouldn't have been there in the first place)
<br>
<p>-Great amounts of negative qualia inflicted to lower beings for sake of
<br>
higher beings' positive qualia are immoral (no more frying of live animals)
<br>
<p>-Small amounts of negative qualia inflicted to same or lower beings for sake
<br>
of same or higher beings' great amounts of positive qualia are justifiable
<br>
(take 1 billion $ away from bill gates and divide it up among the starving
<br>
african tribes)
<br>
<p>-Moral imperative to create the technology that will make this quick fix
<br>
obsolete.
<br>
<p>You will notice that &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot; are not objective terms, are they
<br>
are not meant to be because this is a quick fix and not the definition of
<br>
morality. Possibly, defining &quot;perfect objective morality&quot; is easier than
<br>
defining the arrow of morality. Perfect morality is when you have 0 negative
<br>
qualia in the universe and a lot of positive qualia.
<br>
<p>I still don't know if this can be 100% objective but it satisfies me to at
<br>
least 90% and it's a lot better than current moral theories as far as I
<br>
know.
