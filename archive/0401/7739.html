<em>&gt; No, it is not &quot;modest&quot;.  However, as an evolved sentient being, I have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overwhelming supergoal of survival and the survival of my kind.  So I will
</em><br>
asked to be
<br>
<em>&gt;excused from lining up for the no doubt &quot;humane&quot; extermination of humanity
</em><br>
if the
<br>
<em>&gt;ever so inscrutable SAI decides it must be so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I do not rule out that killing everyone off could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be a good idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In that case I will not help you with any project you may undertake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By this statement you are a potential major enemy to much I hold dear.
</em><br>
<p>You are being very honest and I respect your opinion as long as you know
<br>
exactly what you have said, i.e. that you have no choice in the matter since
<br>
you are an evolved being programmed to value personal survival above all
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>I've been dead for 20 billion years before I was born. That didn't feel too
<br>
bad. I have broken a nail yesterday, got weird stuff around my fingernail,
<br>
felt not so good. Is being dead wrong, or is staying dead wrong, or is dying
<br>
wrong? I am not sure. But let's drop the death discussion since it's too
<br>
controversial, my bad, shouldn't have mentioned it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If reality itself doesn't meet his exacting standards
</em><br>
<p>Not mine, but the standards of a transhuman AI who has high confidence it
<br>
has achieved absolute moral knowledge, and who is faced with the necessity
<br>
of making a quick choice without the possibility of going back to try again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the &quot;interpretation&quot; was what convinced you of the advanced civilization
</em><br>
residing in
<br>
<em>&gt;a soap bubble in your bath, then it is certainly not true that you can now
</em><br>
drop your
<br>
<em>&gt;mere needless interpretation and let the soap-bubble super-civilization go
</em><br>
on its
<br>
<p>It's not my theory, I just like it :)
<br>
If you read the essay and still are convinced that it is nonsensical, you
<br>
can mail the author.
