<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think there is a correlation between high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; IQ and psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There most certainly is -- people with high IQs tend to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; serious social problems. That's not to say I would prefer to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dumber, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social problems?
</em><br>
<p>Social problems, yes -- often severe ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our society is almost certainly not the ideal one, and has a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrariness, so rejecting it could quite possibly be a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's fine so long as you don't care if you get the cooperation
<br>
of others towards achieving your goals. Unfortunately, as
<br>
accomplishing goals frequently requires that you get others to do
<br>
things you want -- getting them to work for you, have sex with you,
<br>
eat dinner with you, or a myriad of other things -- you might find
<br>
yourself wanting to get other people to like you or to do what you
<br>
want. That requires social skills.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Unclear. Many people who are possessed of high IQs lack &quot;social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence&quot;, and it may very well be a question of how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; effort can be put in to both problems simultaneously. It is hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be good at things like deep math or physics problems without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; obsessive about them -- but if you are obsessive about them, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; leads to spending a lot less time learning about social skills,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which can lead to things like having a lot more trouble doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; things like attracting a mate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social skills are some of the most useless things society has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopted. Learning them and the other arbitrary conventions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society is more often than not a waste of time.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on whether you want to get anything done involving other
<br>
people or not.
<br>
<p>I'll also point out that for many of us, good social interactions are
<br>
in and of themselves pleasurable -- but I suppose everyone has their
<br>
own tastes.
<br>
<p>By the way, let me note that the disparagement of social skills as
<br>
&quot;arbitrary conventions&quot; is rather off the mark -- they are simply a
<br>
mechanism of human communication, and a fairly important mechanism. It
<br>
is true that some specific conventions are arbitrary -- like the
<br>
choice of the word &quot;yes&quot; to mean the affirmative instead of &quot;oui&quot; or
<br>
&quot;hai&quot; or &quot;ken&quot; or &quot;da&quot;. However, one would not claim that learning
<br>
human language is worthless simply because the details of the
<br>
communication mechanism involve certain kinds of arbitrary coding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps this would lessen people's willingness to cooperate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, but that almost certainly doesn't carry over into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanity.
</em><br>
<p>I can't conceive of that.  Communication complexity rises as with the
<br>
complexity of the actors. Ants have a tiny repertoire of inflexible
<br>
communication. As one rises on the mental complexity scale,
<br>
complexity, flexibility and subtlety of communication only go
<br>
up. People have very complex social communications. One suspects that
<br>
subtlety of communication and cuing would, if anything, rise to
<br>
entirely new heights with with the complexity of transhuman minds and
<br>
the heightened stakes involved in the communications. BTW, that's one
<br>
of the reasons that asking for directions involves less social skill
<br>
than, say, determining if someone is interested in having sex with you
<br>
-- the stakes are on an entirely different level, so the subtlety of
<br>
the communicated cues changes a lot.
