<em>&gt;&gt; I can -- or at least, why it wouldn't be stable. There are several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; problems here, including the fact that there is no absolute morality (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thus no way to universally determine &quot;the good&quot;), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not see that there is any necessity for &quot;absolute&quot; morality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to acheive Friendly AI or any necessity for a unversally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determination of what is &quot;the good&quot;.   Friendliness (toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity) does not demand this absolute universal morality does it?
</em><br>
<p>How can one establish what is &quot;Friendly&quot; without it? We haven't been
<br>
able to produce Friendly People yet on a large scale, if you haven't
<br>
noticed. There is no universal notion of correct behavior yet among
<br>
*humans*. Who is to say that the AI won't decide to be more
<br>
&quot;Friendly&quot; towards the Islamic Fundamentalists, or towards Communists,
<br>
or towards some other group one doesn't like, without any way to
<br>
determine what &quot;Friendly&quot; is supposed to mean?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; that it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; obvious that one could construct something far more intelligent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yourself and still manage to constrain its behavior effectively, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I have read from Eliezer on the subject disavows any notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraining the behavior of the FAI explicitly.
</em><br>
<p>And I'm not very sure one could do it non-explicitly either. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; it is not clear that a construct like this would be able to battle it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; out effectively against other constructs from societies that do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; construct Friendly AIs (or indeed that the winner in the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; won't be the societies that produce the meanest, baddest-assed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligences rather than the friendliest -- see evolution on earth),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An argument from evolution doesn't seem terribly germane for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities that are very much not evolved but designed and iteratively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improved.  What exactly is meant by such a loose term as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;bad-ass&quot; in this context?
</em><br>
<p>Elsewhere in the universe, there may be entities evolving now that our
<br>
society would be forced to war with eventually -- entities that have a
<br>
different notion of The Good. There might, for example, be an entity
<br>
out there that wants to turn the entire universe into computronium for
<br>
itself, and doesn't care much about taking over our resources in the
<br>
process. Any entities we develop into or create to protect us would
<br>
need to be able to fight successfully against such entities in order
<br>
for our descendents to survive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Anyway, I find it interesting to speculate on possible constructs like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The Friendly AI, but not safe to assume that they're going to be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; one's future. The prudent transhumanist considers survival in wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; variety of scenarios.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what do you believe is the scenario or set of scenarios that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the maximum survivability and benefit with the least amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain/danger of annihilation of self and species?
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea. Prediction of a very chaotic system like the future
<br>
behavior of all the entities involved here is very very difficult. At
<br>
best I can come up with a few rules about what is likely to happen
<br>
based on the vaguest of constraints -- for example, making the
<br>
assumption that the laws of physics are what we think they are.
