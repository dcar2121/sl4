OK.  I'll ask it.  What the hell does all this fluff have to do with SL4?

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Right, but if no one ever considers their own needs,

<em>&gt; &gt; Luckily, of course, parasitism takes over and very rapidly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; altruists die, sucked to death by the others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such parasites would not be operating in there own self interest since

</em><br>
<em>&gt; end there career as parasites).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, it would be amusing to see two true altruists sitting in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desert together with only enough food to keep one of them alive. Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will starve, but unlike the donkey starving to death between two bales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of hay because of metastability, the result is not just predictable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but necessary. (Solutions like drawing straws will not work, btw --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the true altruist will refuse any solution that gives him a chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surviving when others might do so instead.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going to the same degree of absurdity you could make the same claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for capitalists, if you assume perfect symmetry. They would both likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fatally injure each other fighting over the food. If anything in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic scenerio the altruists are more likely to have one come out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Rand satirizes this sort of stupidity very effectively, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amazing how people who don't grok the economic way of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continue proposing it through the ages even though the problems with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it are so utterly manifest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand it, and I also see its limits.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, Communism has been tried. It doesn't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The so called communist countries where hardly a reasonable attempt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thats not to say it would work with humans as presently wired, just that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't point to a drastically flawed attempt and say that its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universally impossible.
</em><br>

<em>&gt;  Laughter-Confusion, Pleasure-Pain, Happyness-Sadness, Excitement-Fear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Love-Hate, etc. The true primary emotions, a modifier makes each into two.
</em><br>
