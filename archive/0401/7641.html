Yes, the fallacies of quantitative reasoning in the soft sciences are well
<br>
known to me.   So my example of biology as a sciences that's successfully
<br>
turned quantitative, was quite specifically chosen.
<br>
<p>My father is a sociologist and has written a number of papers on the misuse
<br>
of advanced statistics in sociology, see e.g.
<br>
<p><a href="http://crab.rutgers.edu/%7Egoertzel/mythsofmurder.htm">http://crab.rutgers.edu/%7Egoertzel/mythsofmurder.htm</a>
<br>
<p>He refers there to
<br>
&quot;... a pernicious form of junk science: the use of mathematical models with
<br>
no demonstrated predictive capability to draw policy conclusions. These
<br>
studies are superficially impressive. Written by reputable social scientists
<br>
from prestigious institutions, they often appear in peer reviewed scientific
<br>
journals. Filled with complex statistical calculations, they give precise
<br>
numerical &quot;facts&quot; that can be used as debaters' points in policy arguments.
<br>
But these &quot;facts&quot; are will o' the wisps. Before the ink is dry on one study,
<br>
another appears with completely different &quot;facts.&quot; Despite their scientific
<br>
appearance, these models do not meet the fundamental criterion for a useful
<br>
mathematical model: the ability to make predictions that are better than
<br>
random chance. &quot;
<br>
<p>The misuses of quantitative reasoning tend to be carried out in the service
<br>
of human political agendas and emotional biases.
<br>
<p>I'm hoping/suspecting/trying-to-make-it-so that AI minds will be far less
<br>
susceptible to inner-angst-driven inconsistencies and irrational biases than
<br>
human beings -- so that they will have less motivation to misuse their
<br>
quantitative reasoning ability in this sort of way....
<br>
<p>A quantitative moral calculus in the virtual hands of a reasonably wise,
<br>
emotionally well-balanced AI would be an excellent thing.  And as has been
<br>
argued frequently on this list, an unbalanced, unwise human-level-or-plus AI
<br>
is likely to stir up a lotta shit (to put it mildly ;p)

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, you're blue.  I'm not sure if that carries information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or if you're just glad to see me.  ;-)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben G:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact that morality is NOW almost entirely qualitative doesn't mean to
<br>
me that it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;won't become substantially quantitative one day.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree.  The Pythagorean and Plato would agree and that's pretty good
<br>
company.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Socrates himself is particularly missed, a lovely little thinker but a
<br>
bugger when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he's pissed.)  Of course so would Numerologists and that's not so good.
<br>
The danger
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;here is if the idea &quot;What counts easiest, counts most&quot; or, even worse,
<br>
&quot;What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;counts easiest, counts&quot; is established before enough experimental feedback
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is accumulated to determine the Truth Value of the equations.  Given our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;species predilection to take everything to its logical perversion, no
<br>
matter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;how much it hurts, I am not sanguine.  On the other hand, the potential of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;developing  an objective schemata for making moral decisions does have an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;attraction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben G:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think quantitative morality will be more severely abusable than
<br>
qualitative morality.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That _would_ be hard to conceive wouldn't it!?  Although it is very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;easy to conceive it would be abused in the same way:  &quot;Your Social Moral
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;quotient is a sub-par 34%; therefore, we are going to shoot you.  It's For
<br>
the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good of Society.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben G:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...math can be abused just like anything else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In most parts of science (and I'm not saying that morality is a science,
<br>
though it may become one someday; I'm just making an analogy), the move to a
<br>
more quantitative approach has decreased the amount of bias and abuse,
<br>
rather than increased it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tricky one.  I note your qualifiers &quot;In most parts of&quot;  and
<br>
&quot;decreased
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the amount of.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I agree this is the case in the Physical Sciences but the last
<br>
century
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has also provided depressing counter examples.  One of many is the misuse
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of mathematics by certain post Modernist thinkers whom, in the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;generous estimate, are one toke over the line.  Mathematics has a certain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cachet these days in the half-educated graduates the liberal arts
<br>
departments
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and universities insist on churning out.  In the fields of literary
<br>
criticism,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;history, philosophy of science, sociology, and anthropology mathematics -
<br>
even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;when misunderstood or not understood at all - is used as a talisman to
<br>
seal an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;argument.  It is the convincing stamp of approval.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously an abuse of mathematics but it is rampant and there are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;professors and instructors who will go into their classroom tomorrow and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tell their students (get this):  &quot;There is no reality or universal laws
<br>
uncovered
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by science.  The so-called laws they claim to discover are merely
<br>
interpretations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and have no more validity than any other interpretation.&quot;  In this view
<br>
the state-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ments &quot;the earth rotates on its axis&quot; and &quot;God Wills It&quot; are equally valid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;explanations for why the sun rises.  To &quot;prove&quot; their thesis they will
<br>
trot out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some bogus statistics, set theory, or quantum mechanics and students,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ignorant of statistics, set theory, or quantum mechanics alike, swallow
<br>
this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nonsense as valid.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is getting too off topic for my comfort level so I will let you have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the last word, should you desire, and then end the thread.
