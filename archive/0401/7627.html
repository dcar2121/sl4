<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Right, but if no one ever considers their own needs,

<em>&gt;&gt; Luckily, of course, parasitism takes over and very rapidly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; altruists die, sucked to death by the others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such parasites would not be operating in there own self interest since
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; end there career as parasites).
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary -- parasitism is not just reasonable under such
<br>
circumstances but is what is actually observed in the wild. I'll point
<br>
out that it is frequently a very successful strategy -- genetic tests
<br>
seem to indicate that a large fraction of the population of Eurasia
<br>
directly descends from the family of Genghis Khan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; However, it would be amusing to see two true altruists sitting in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; desert together with only enough food to keep one of them alive. Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will starve, but unlike the donkey starving to death between two bales
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of hay because of metastability, the result is not just predictable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but necessary. (Solutions like drawing straws will not work, btw --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the true altruist will refuse any solution that gives him a chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; surviving when others might do so instead.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going to the same degree of absurdity you could make the same claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for capitalists, if you assume perfect symmetry. They would both likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fatally injure each other fighting over the food.
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps just one would win. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Rand satirizes this sort of stupidity very effectively, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; amazing how people who don't grok the economic way of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; continue proposing it through the ages even though the problems with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it are so utterly manifest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand it, and I also see its limits. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Anyway, Communism has been tried. It doesn't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The so called communist countries where hardly a reasonable attempt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thats not to say it would work with humans as presently wired,
</em><br>
<p>There is a reason we're wired that way. Wire people another way and
<br>
you'll get even worse disasters.
