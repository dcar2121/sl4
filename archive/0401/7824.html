<p>I think the missing piece here is &quot;increasing consistency with *increasing
<br>
scope*&quot;
<br>
<p><p>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>Now, at the risk of creating confusion where you may have been satisfied
<br>
with the above, I will try to provide a bigger picture.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the axioms of such a natural ethical system may be (very
<br>
roughly) something like this:
<br>
<p>I.   Definition of &quot;Self&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;.
<br>
II.  Maximize growth (complexity) of Self (this is limited by energy into
<br>
the system, and some function of the interface between self and other.)
<br>
III. Maximize diversity (this is recursive, since it means more ways to
<br>
maximize growth)
<br>
... Others?
<br>
<p>Cooperation derives from II and III working to maximize the growth of Self.
<br>
<p>A lot of work is needed on the above, but I think it's headed in the right
<br>
direction because it seems to roughly model what we see in nature as systems
<br>
(Selves) act to dissipate energy while increasing the complexity of the
<br>
local system and maximizing the entropy of the universe.
<br>
<p>Back to your question:
<br>
<p>On a very fundamental level, Ben is the result of a long evolutionary
<br>
process that follows these natural laws, and if for some reason Ben turns
<br>
out to be a defective component, the overall process will still continue.
<br>
In that sense, he can't refuse to interact with Other. Or from another
<br>
viewpoint he can, but it will make absolutely no difference because the
<br>
process goes on.  His cells, his bodily organs, the ecology in which he
<br>
lives are all following natural laws based on the axioms above, or similar.
<br>
<p>On a human context level, Ben can choose to behave as &quot;to hell with everyone
<br>
else and value only Ben&quot; but his experience will be that it isn't very
<br>
effective or satisfying.  Why?  Because he exists as part of that long
<br>
evolutionary process and at the level of human relations he will simply be
<br>
an anomaly that will die out.
<br>
<p>The point of this ethical system is that we are already immersed in it, and
<br>
by learning and practicing it we will experience greater effectiveness
<br>
dealing with situations involving this class of complex interactions between
<br>
Self and Other at various scales. Just as Shannon's information theory led
<br>
to improved communication systems, systems that wouldn't even be possible
<br>
without understanding and then utilizing natural law in the design.
<br>
<p>Your thoughts?
<br>
<p>- Jef
