</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So what sort of strategies does evolution favor? Quite a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of them, actually, but none of them can be characterized as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;pacifist&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Not pacifist, but also not unreasoningly or overly aggressive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If you think ours is not an extraordinarily vicious and aggressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; race, I direct you to the nearest factory farm or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; slaughterhouse. Most people are fully aware of where their food
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; comes from, and yet we (in general) have very little compunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; about continuing to eat it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an artifact of 1), needing food to survive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2), the limitations of our digestive system,
</em><br>
<p>You don't need to eat animals to survive. You can live on a vegan diet
<br>
very well -- in fact, the objective evidence is that it is far more
<br>
healthy than an animal protein based diet. It is, of course, far
<br>
cheaper to live on a vegan diet, and uses fewer resources, so if one
<br>
is poor it is pretty much the sort of diet one lives on -- meat eating
<br>
is what the rich do, not what the poor do to survive.
<br>
<p>Even if we needed to eat animals to survive, which we don't, it would
<br>
be unnecessary to intentionally torture baby cows to produce more
<br>
tasty veal, or to torture geese to produce tasty goose livers.
<br>
<p>Why do we torture animals to produce tastier food? Because they can't
<br>
fight back and we like tasty food. Is this moral or immoral? I unask
<br>
the question -- it is meaningless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and #0, Drawinian evolution, none of which applies to AIs.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about this Drawin fellow, but you can as easily abandon
<br>
Darwin as you can abandon Einstein.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; By the way, I will repeat a contention I've made pretty frequently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with a new example. There are people out there that say &quot;meat is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; murder&quot;. There are people who enjoy a good steak.  Which of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;morally correct&quot;? What is the experiment we can conduct that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; answer this question?  I contend there is none, and that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; no answer because absolute morality is an illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to start a separate thread on objective vs. subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality, please do. Underline separate thread.
</em><br>
<p>I see no reason to do so -- the threads are identical. Without an
<br>
objective morality, you can't determine whether or not it is wrong to
<br>
allow someone to torture a calf in order to make it tastier to
<br>
eat, so a Friendly AI can't try to go off and enforce one or the other
<br>
behavior. Sadly, no objective morality exists, so it isn't possible to
<br>
program the &quot;Friendly&quot; AI to be perfect in its &quot;Friendliness&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That's not to say, by the way, that I draw any sort of absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; morality under which gluing the feet of geese to the bottoms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cages and force feeding them to make their livers particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tasty is &quot;evil&quot;. I don't believe there is an absolute morality, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm not going to pretend that it is somehow &quot;wrong&quot; to turn geese
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into foie gras. However, you would be pretty much incorrect if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thought the geese weren't pissed off about the process -- it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very obvious that they're miserable. (One might argue if animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can suffer, but the arguments used to claim they can't could just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as easily be applied to other people -- I'm going to stipulate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if a cat screams in pain when you stick it with a hot iron that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is in fact suffering.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aha, so you agree that morality is at least partly objective.
</em><br>
<p>No. I simply believe the question of whether or not geese or cats
<br>
experience pain is objective -- they exhibit pain responses.
<br>
<p>By the way, I don't see any experiment that would tell us that it is
<br>
wrong to torture you (yes, you!) in order to turn your liver into
<br>
tasty meat, either. As it happens, I wouldn't do it because my
<br>
personal behavior code doesn't go for that sort of thing -- but I
<br>
can't see any objective way to determine that it is wrong.
<br>
<p>What I'm getting at, of course, is that we can't even settle a very
<br>
simple question about whether or not it is okay to kill animals, and
<br>
claims are being made that an absolute moral code can be derived
<br>
suitable for loading into a substitute for God, God having
<br>
conveniently failed to exist on his own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; You will often see that predators have evolved strategies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid actual aggression, instead resolving disputes with a proxy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; aggression to assert dominance and territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *With each other*, since two members of the same species have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nearly the same capacity for violence. It is rare that you will see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cheetahs negotiating with herds of antelope to try to non-violently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; settle their &quot;disputes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheetahs and antelopes aren't sentient (that's another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion entirely) aren't sentient and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't negotiatie, at least not in the way humans do.
</em><br>
<p>Humans rarely negotiate with tuna before turning them into very tasty
<br>
sushi.
