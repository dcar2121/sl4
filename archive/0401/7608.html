Perry,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, I have a hypothesis that this hammer in my hand is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion. An easy way to try to falsify that will be to swing it down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on my hand and see if it hurts or not. (&quot;Ow!&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>That pain doesn't prove the hammer is not an illusion -- not unless you're
<br>
adopting a very odd and narrow definition of &quot;illusion.&quot;
<br>
<p>Illusions can hurt, as many veterans of the LSD experience will tell you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is of course possible -- even perhaps likely -- that we're all in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation of some sort. However, absent a way to test that hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I leave it as an interesting idea that I can ignore from the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of daily life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, we are presented with this idea of an Absolute Morality. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascinating concept -- but sadly, non-falsifiable. Indeed, I'm told
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about dozens of Absolute Moralities, all of which claim to be *the*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolute Morality and all of which seem to have this same property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-falsifiability. I therefore see it as a fine class of ideas to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore for the present, no matter how interesting they may be.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as a scientist, I find that many non-falsifiable ideas are worth
<br>
paying attention to --- they can be quite inspirational conceptually....
<br>
Most falsifiable ideas originated out of various networks of interesting
<br>
non-falsifiable ideas...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Just as a rock has a kind of &quot;partial objectivity&quot; that distinguishes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from more thoroughly subjective things like hallucinations and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so, perhaps, does compassion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you give evidence for this?
</em><br>
<p>I did arrive at this view through &quot;evidence&quot;, but the evidence is of a
<br>
fairly squishy sort... it's experiential rather than empirical.  I could
<br>
explain these experiences in detail, but it would be a lot of work, and I
<br>
don't think it would be very useful to anyone in this forum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The question is never whether X has objective, absolute reality or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nothing does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, most hypotheses are falsifiable. &quot;There is a gorilla in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; room&quot; can be tested by searching for the gorilla. &quot;Compassion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal&quot; could be checked by noting the quaint practices of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Innuit involving placing grandma on the ice floe when she couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care for herself any more. &quot;There Is An Absolute Morality&quot; can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And the point is not to argue that X is subjective, therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaningless -- that kind of nihilism was already found wanting by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and the whole proto-existentialist crew.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche is just pietzsche by me -- why do you find him wanting? :)
</em><br>
<p>Nietzsche was far from a falsificationist -- he believed that the powerful
<br>
mind creates its own reality, and that scientific method is ultimately a
<br>
crutch for the weak-minded who, too lame to create reality, have to merely
<br>
study it instead...
<br>
<p>I tend to agree with him on those points (though I guess you don't, since
<br>
you're evidently such a Popperian).  However, I find his moral philosophy a
<br>
bit incomplete, and I find it amusing that he was a quite compassionate
<br>
individual on a personal level, in spite of wrongly disparaging all
<br>
compassion as &quot;pity&quot; in some of his philosophical writings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, have a quick read of Karl Popper's &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then tell me how morals fit into that framework.
</em><br>
<p>I have read Karl Popper, and while I appreciated his work, I didn't find it
<br>
so compelling that I feel the need to fit all my ideas into his framework.
<br>
Are you familiar with the later philosophy-of-science work by Imre Lakatos
<br>
and Paul Feyerabend (two friends who did not agree with each other, but both
<br>
had interesting and deep ideas about how science is actually done, which is
<br>
different in many respects from what Popper claimed).  I would be curious
<br>
how you respond to their critiques of Popper's falsificationist perspective.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
