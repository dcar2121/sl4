<em>&gt;&gt;UN Predicts 9 Bln People by 2300, Many of Them Old

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The human race could have 9 billion people by 2300, Japanese will live to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;108, and Africa's population will explode while Europeans could dwindle, the
</em><br>

<em>&gt;I imagine that in 1700, predictions about the astounding improvements

If you mean that things like the China Clipper were predicted... they 
<br>
were not only predicted, they were built!  And simply as vehicles for 
<br>
navigation they were superior to the steam ships of the time.  But they 
<br>
became more expensive to operate, so slower and cheaper technologies 
<br>
replaced them.  But as technological achievements those steam ships were 
<br>
crude and ugly.  Far inferior to the lovely clipper ships.  (Well, also 
<br>
the clipper ships probably had taken the technology as far as it could 
<br>
go before, say, 1950 when new techniques and materials might have made 
<br>
them practical again, had not their purpose been eclipsed by airplanes.)
<br>
<p>Take this as fair warning:  being technically beautiful achievement 
<br>
isn't a guarantee of success.  They appear to be largely forgotten.
