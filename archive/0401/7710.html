Be very careful here! The easiest way to reduce undesirable qualia is to
<br>
kill off everyone who has the potential for experiencing them.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It seems to me that a person's method for determining the desireable
<br>
morality is based partially on instincts, partially on training, and
<br>
partially on self-interest. I've seen remarkable transformations in what
<br>
was considered moral occur when the self-interest of the decider has
<br>
shifted. Similarly, the morality that is desired seems to be very
<br>
subject to what other people insist is the right thing to do. War
<br>
propaganda is a very current example here. I include this modification
<br>
under the category of instinctual. People ARE herd animals...to an extent.
<br>
<p>So, when you are saying that the AI should use the process that you do
<br>
... are you sure about that? Just how heavily do you want the AI to
<br>
weigh it's self interest? Do you want it to be able to justify
<br>
intentionally killing off the entire human race? Or even not considering
<br>
that danger very important when calculating risks? (Note that people
<br>
frequently don't. I consider this one of our major failings as a species.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Remember, friendliness isn't Friendliness. The former would involve something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like making an AI friend, the latter is nothing like it. Where he says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Friendliness should be the supergoal&quot; it means something more like &quot;Whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is really right should be the supergoal&quot;. Friendliness is an external 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is assuming that &quot;right&quot; has some absolute meaning, but this is
<br>
only true in the context of a certain set of axioms (call them
<br>
instincts). And also from a particular point of view. Friendliness can
<br>
be friendliness, if that's what the instincts say is right. Remember
<br>
that your basic goals can't be choosen, but they must be describable in
<br>
very simple terms. And nearly all formulations are subject to failure
<br>
modes. E.g., Eliza would be much more willing to talk to it than any
<br>
person would, so having &quot;someone to talk to&quot; would be a bad choice of
<br>
supergoal. If you make it friendly to those with some particular DNA
<br>
characteristics (say something that specifies a particular protein
<br>
unique to humans), then it won't necessarily be friendly to uploads.
<br>
Etc. This is one of the more difficult things to get right. And getting
<br>
it right is crucial. Even better would be being able to *know* that you
<br>
got it right.
