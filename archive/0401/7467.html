<p>If we evolved to be credulous because of social sanctions for people who
<br>
fail to believe in the locally popular religion, we would have a much
<br>
different pattern of credulity than we actually do. We would just be
<br>
credulous about the locally popular religion, and have a normal amount of
<br>
skepticism about everything else.
<br>
<p>Instead, people are credulous about much more than religion. It seems to
<br>
be a general credulity rather than specific to any topic. For example,
<br>
consider people's beliefs about physics, economics, chemistry, biology,
<br>
etc., a few hundred years ago. They were so wrong about everything and yet
<br>
virtually no one saw any reason to doubt.
<br>
<p>Also, the local popularity of a religion seems to have little to do with 
<br>
how credulous we are to it. For example, people who move to a new 
<br>
neighborhood with a different popular religion seldom convert because of 
<br>
the move, and children of parents who follow a minority religion will tend 
<br>
to keep the parents' religion rather than the locally popular one.
<br>
<p>I've skipped the rest of your post because it seems to be based on a 
<br>
misunderstanding that I hope I've cleared up in my previous reply. Let me 
<br>
know if there's anything you still want to to respond to.
