Perry -
<br>
<p>Thanks for the discussion (one of many you've got going.)  For me it's the
<br>
start of a busy work week and I won't be able to give this the attention I'd
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>In any case, I agree with your points below as I think you intended them.
<br>
<p>I do suspect, however, that there's a meta-level of thinking about morality
<br>
that hasn't been properly addressed, and I'll try to organize and write out
<br>
my thoughts on this in a way that I hope will prevent getting bogged down in
<br>
the old arguments about absolute vs. subjective morality, and the confusion
<br>
between doing the &quot;right&quot; thing (values) and the &quot;optimum&quot; thing (utility
<br>
measured against goals) with maximal consistency between nested contexts.
<br>

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about concensus morality here.  In fact it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain that the moral advice of a higher intelligence would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; widely accepted if communicated directly, but humans will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; persuaded by the indirect, but tangible fruits of following its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; What if there are no answers that yield obviously superior results
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; for society? There is no answer, for example, to the meat question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- and yet there is great rage among some about killing and eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; animals. Many thorny moral questions have no objective answer, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; is why they are thorny in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As you clearly state, there are no simple answers to what we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;moral&quot; questions.  These issues are context-dependent and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terminology we customarily use confuses by presuming absolutes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can't be attained. Discussion and understanding would be improved if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we all talked in terms of goals and utility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; My point in presenting the &quot;arrow of morality&quot; concept is to find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whether we can agree that with increasing wisdom (intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; knowledge) comes increasing morality.  If we agree on this, then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can work together intentionally to improve our part of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that any amount of wisdom or intelligence can answer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meat question or a myriad of other questions, because they have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers. I'm not sure there is an &quot;arrow of morality&quot; here, just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency of more intelligent creatures to find themselves in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly complicated situations that they need good rules of thumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The statement &quot;morality is subjective&quot; often carries the implication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that it is therefore meaningless to compare or evaluate the relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; morality of various actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. It is. There is no test that will provide units of moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not meaningless to ask &quot;will humans that cooperate with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fellows rather than trying to kill them have a greater chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival&quot; -- that has a measure on it and can be tested, at least in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory. Asking &quot;is it more moral to leave other humans alone or to eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them&quot; is meaningless, as there is no way to ascertain an answer except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via definitionalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This strikes me as very similar to the post-modernist view
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that reality is ultimately subjective and all points of view are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; therefore of equal value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Value&quot; is subjective. Reality isn't, since one can test what is real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what is not. (All of reality might ultimately turn out to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, but that's another story and in no way invalidates tests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the reality of particular propositions within the context of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated system.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The folks you speak of in cultural theory and the like start with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable sense of ideas that they get from other fields and then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely because they're ill equiped to understand them, misinterpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them and come up with ridiculous conclusions. (What do you expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though -- they're largely in English departments -- they're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophers.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm not implying that you espouse the po-mo point of view -- far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from it.  I would suggest, however, that it may be more useful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; say &quot;morality is context-dependent&quot; than to say &quot;morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; subjective&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not per se context dependent (though for some persons it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be) -- it is subjective. There is a difference. To some people, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;right thing to do&quot; doesn't change with context -- but what &quot;the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to do&quot; is shifts between person to person. Thus, subjective, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not (necessarily) context dependent.
