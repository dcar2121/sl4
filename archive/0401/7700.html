<em>&gt; I feel I must note that true Zen (and Taoist) masters do not banish any
</em><br>
<p>I refrained from posting zen stuff on sl4 before but since it comes up
<br>
again...
<br>
Zen &quot;cool&quot; ko-an and parables tickle some software-level bugs in the human
<br>
brain such as desire for absoluteness, being surprised by a lateral thought,
<br>
tribal attraction toward the know-all shaman figure and so forth. They are
<br>
fun but to be taken as entertainment not a real path-to-not-suffering. The
<br>
only real path to not suffering is modifying the human brain at the level
<br>
suffering operates, i.e. neurons, microtubules, whatever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; emotion.  It is an &quot;Western&quot; idea that thinks that positive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative emotions/concepts are separable, but it is one side which
</em><br>
<p>exactly right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To use a simple example: on a light switch, there would be no concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 'off' if 'on' didn't exist.  Sure, human emotions also involve a
</em><br>
<p>a concept wouldn't be needed, if electricity didn't exist, there would be no
<br>
words for OFF and ON, but the situation would be equivalent to an &quot;off
<br>
without on&quot; as we presently understand these words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nothing against which to compare it, the pleasure becomes meaningless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without context.  Removing them gives us nothing to which we can
</em><br>
<p>You are talking philosophy, I am talking physical processes creating qualia.
<br>
The brain is programmed to notify us when we are in negative/positive
<br>
circumstances, of course the negativity and positivity of these
<br>
circumstances depends on our status quo and the presence or absence of
<br>
better/worse circumstances. But the qualia triggered as a result of this
<br>
brain evaluation, they are physical primitives. So _right now_ you can't be
<br>
happy all the time because the brain will adjust. After we mess with the
<br>
brain, that's a different story entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the debate about eliminating all suffering I think misses the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how an SI could *really* help humanity.
</em><br>
<p>No, it's addressing this problem squarely I think. Whether we agree on the
<br>
moral arrow is left to discussion, but I think the problem is being
<br>
addressed. What does &quot;helping&quot; mean if not to take some weight off another's
<br>
mind, in other words, to alleviate suffering and frustration?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's not to eliminate ANY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ALL bad feeling, it's to eliminate *unnecessary* human suffering -
</em><br>
<p>So what about &quot;necessary&quot; human suffering, ex. the necessity of someone to
<br>
lose in order for you to win - the necessity of amputating a leg when it
<br>
starts rotting, and so forth? This distinction does not make sense. All
<br>
suffering is unnecessary. That our primitive technology and current
<br>
biological substrate/social structure make some forms of suffering seemingly
<br>
unavoidable does not count as a counterargument when we consider arbitrarily
<br>
sophisticated technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or again we lose context to our own situation -- we would never know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how good we have it.
</em><br>
<p>I know I have it good when I look at starving children on tv with bugs in
<br>
their mouth. I don't need to have memories of having starved myself or to
<br>
starve every once in a while. Besides, why even keep a memory of how good
<br>
you have it when evil has been forgotten and all we have is infinite
<br>
positive emotions, infinitely more various and subtle than those we
<br>
experience today, all different and in so many variations you could spend
<br>
billions of years trying them all out?
<br>
<p>&quot;Remember when you were in pain, so you will feel good&quot; and &quot;look at that
<br>
guy he has it worse than you so you should be thankful&quot; are psychological
<br>
tricks aimed at increasing by 0.000001 your happiness quotient in a world
<br>
where happiness is the scarcest of resources. When one tries the orgasmium
<br>
pill, the pleasure of not feeling pain will seem so small and irrelevant it
<br>
will hardly be worth the time it takes to formulate the thought.
<br>
<p>Humans are genetically programmed to find a reason for evil and then decide
<br>
that evil itself is bearable/justifiable/necessary... whether this reason is
<br>
&quot;because I sinned&quot; or &quot;because you cant be happy without being sad&quot; is
<br>
irrelevant.
<br>
<p>It is an important psychological tool to forget about past suffering and
<br>
carry on spreading your dna, but it does not help you decide how to ground a
<br>
god's morality.
