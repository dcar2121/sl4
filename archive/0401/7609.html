<p>Yes, thats why it can't be created by force. The only time a communist

like system works is when like minded individuals come together and
<br>
make it work. But again humans as we presently exist can only go so
<br>
far in that direction for so long.

<p>Basically it comes down to containment of cancer. I'm not talking about a
<br>
pacifist society. Of course the solution need not be always violent, the 
<br>
designer could put in many layers of safeguards. For example it would make 
<br>
sense to tie the ability to reproduce to the knowledge that you have been 
<br>
useful. This would tend to select for creatures most able to make 
<br>
themselves useful. Given that these are designer beings, certain 
<br>
properties could be made very resistant to mutation. For example its
<br>
important that there ability to judge usefulness remain intact.
<br>
<p>Ultimately among a cosmos of these cultures those with the best anti
<br>
parasite protections would tend to be selected for. Those that succumb
<br>
to parasites would not be able to expand.
