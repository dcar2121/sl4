<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, but the monetary system works for both kinds of entity, so why

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Money is an imaginary artifact of the current system that highly

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reciprocity, differences in entities' relative valuation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; resources, and transformative labor.  Note that I do not say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;transactions&quot; because I consider a transaction to be a special case 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of voluntary action and reciprocal voluntary action where both

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would not be possible to uncautiously generalize from today's highly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; peculiar case of capitalism to capitalism under other conditions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not at all disagreeing that complex barter would work better, at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least for most things.  However, to make the system manageable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd expect there to be a need for a unit which all the others are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured in, and you might as well call that unit &quot;money&quot;.  Money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be ounces of gold, or &quot;US Dollars&quot;, or pinto beans.  These have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different characteristics, of course, and some may have better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long term usefulness than others...
</em><br>
<p>Along similar lines, it should be noted that currency (the general 
<br>
definition, not the one that means Dollars and Euros) is a more abstract 
<br>
notion than money and exists in many places where money is not 
<br>
prominent, including the open source community, even if only a currency 
<br>
of recognition in some cases. Much has been written about the 
<br>
fundamental nature of currency within free society (people will always 
<br>
need/want to exchange skills/goods, and a currency is simply a 
<br>
normalizing factor); I don't see how it would or could be any different 
<br>
for a free society of SIs or SIs/humans.
