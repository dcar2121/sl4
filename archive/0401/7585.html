Ben G:
<br>
&lt;comment snipped to:&gt;
<br>
For some of us, expressing thoughts in mathematics is habitual, even in
<br>
cases where the tools of math aren't useful for proving anything....  I
<br>
assume everyone on this list is skeptic enough to understand that ...
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
Assumption noted. 
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
I do believe, however, that for superhuman AI's in the future, mathematics
<br>
WILL be a useful tool for moral philosophy.  It's rarely useful for humans
<br>
in this context, simply because our ability to make precise calculations
<br>
regarding moral situations is generally very poor (usually due to data
<br>
gathering issues more than calculation-related issues).
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<p>Given the financial fraud based on &quot;Generally Accepted Accounting
<br>
Principles&quot; both in the US and Europe and the fact this was done
<br>
using arithmetic ... I hereby invoke previous assumption.  ;-)
<br>
Also I would say the &quot;data gathering issues&quot; may prove 
<br>
exceedingly difficult.  And even when one can gather the data,
<br>
mapping to mathematical structures is going to be another
<br>
challenge.  One of the distinquishing characteristics
<br>
of qualitative data is its resistence to numerical analysis.  
<br>
I think we can both agree that morality is &quot;qualitative&quot; with 
<br>
a vengence.  
<br>
<p>Ben G:
<br>
<p>In fact, I can easily envision a future argument between super-smart AI's
<br>
regarding the optimal value of some parameter much like my &quot;c&quot; parameter....
<br>
Perhaps the outcome of the argument would be an adjustment to the amount of
<br>
time the human population gets to spend hooked up to the AI-created
<br>
Orgasmotron ;-)
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<p>As I am rapidly approaching the age wherein such things do not
<br>
have the same *uh* 'urgency' I will leave that to those
<br>
having a more *ah* 'interest' in the calculation.  :-)
<br>
<p>Andy
