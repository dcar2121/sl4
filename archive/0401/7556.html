<p>How do you make that true?  Prices are one reasonably

efficient way.  If you have another way, I'm willing
<br>
to hear about it (but this list may not be the proper
<br>
venue).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example while cleaning

</em><br>
<p>Right, but if no one ever considers their own needs,
<br>
others have to guess at what those needs are, and
<br>
they will often guess wrong.
<br>
<p>As a producer of goods or services, you only know
<br>
the service you produce is actually useful if others
<br>
are willing to pay for it.  Without this information,
<br>
you may spend your time producing goods that no one
<br>
wants.  It doesn't matter how altruistic you are about
<br>
donating your time to producing sewer-cleaning tutorials
<br>
if no one wants them; you're just wasting your time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Humans as currently wired have a mix of self interest and altruistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure. Even as we are altruistic pleasure can be one of the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasures.
</em><br>
<p>How many times in your life has someone given you
<br>
a gift that they expected you to be overjoyed with,
<br>
but which you were indifferent to, or simply didn't
<br>
like?  Now rule out all the instances where you
<br>
told the person what you needed.
<br>
<p>Imagine if you depended on others' gift-giving for
<br>
getting everything you wanted.  You'd have to talk
<br>
about what you needed all the time in order to have
<br>
any great chance of getting something resembling it.
