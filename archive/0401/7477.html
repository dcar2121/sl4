<em>&gt;&gt; Myself, though, I will make a strong prediction -- which is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the laws of physics and the rules of math don't cease to apply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That leads me to believe that evolution doesn't stop. That further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; leads me to believe that nature -- bloody in tooth and claw, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some have termed it -- will simply be taken to the next level. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't fear this particularly, but it isn't consistent with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;everything is going to turn up roses&quot; viewpoint.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've taken one sample set, Earth, and implied from the course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution on Earth that it is a *law of physics* that violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not even tripe.
</em><br>
<p>I routinely hear arguments like that from socialists about why my
<br>
evidence for economic rules that contradict their religion must be
<br>
wrong. Generally, it comes down to &quot;I will choose to believe that what
<br>
you are mentioning doesn't generalize because it violates what I would
<br>
prefer to believe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Evolution isn't something you can avoid. Deep down, all it says is
<br>
&quot;you find more of that which survives and spreads itself&quot;, which is so
<br>
close to a tautology that it is damn hard to dispute. There is no
<br>
moral superiority to a bacterium that minds its manners over one that
<br>
overwhelms its competition. The universe on a deep level doesn't care
<br>
which one you find more of. However, almost axiomatically, the second
<br>
one is the one you'll find in every soil sample and the first will be
<br>
rare or extinct.
<br>
<p>So what sort of strategies does evolution favor? Quite a number of
<br>
them, actually, but none of them can be characterized as &quot;pacifist&quot;.
<br>
<p>The struggle for resources is unlikely to end, because the amount of
<br>
resource you can have in any finite volume remains finite. That leads
<br>
me to assume that we'll continue to see evolution take place as life
<br>
spreads through the cosmos. That, in turn, leads me to assume that
<br>
we'll continue to see &quot;nature bloody in tooth and claw&quot;, although
<br>
perhaps it will become &quot;nature bloody in assembler and particle beam&quot;
<br>
or other gadgetry far beyond our understanding.
<br>
<p>I might be wrong, of course, but I have no less cause to suppose any
<br>
of this than you have to believe in what you yourself term your
<br>
religion -- and I have some reasonable extrapolations quite firmly on
<br>
my side.
<br>
<p>By the way, I fully admit that I've been wrong before, I'm doubtless
<br>
wrong about some things that I think now, and I'll doubtless be wrong
<br>
about things I believe in the future, too.
<br>
<p>However, I think it is prudent to consider *all* scenarios, and to
<br>
stick to the path of evidence and reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; it is unlikely that everything is going to suddenly be perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when we've got nanotechnology and know how to build honking big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; AIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given that almost all large-scale human conflict has been over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, and nanotech changes the shape of resource allocation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely, it seems that at the very least the nature of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict must change to the point of unrecognizability.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. I doubt we would understand such conflicts any more than ants
<br>
would have understood the first Gulf War. That's not really the point
<br>
-- the point is simply that such conflict is unlikely to end, even if
<br>
on a radically unrecognizable scale.
<br>
<p>Resources remain finite, of course. Only so much matter is out there
<br>
in any given volume to build things with, and only so much energy is
<br>
out there in a given volume to drive the things we build.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I *am* atheisitic and humanistic.  But that doesn't change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; fact that I have no proof, and barely any evidence, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; singularity, let alone the sysop scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I encourage you, then, to drop the meme complex. You will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happier if you base your activities on that for which you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strong evidence or proof, rather than on religion, regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the flavor of religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your arrogance in this e-mail has been truly astounding, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing that you have any idea what constitutes happiness for me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really takes the cake.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps. Generally speaking, though, I've got a lot of general
<br>
knowledge about human beings and what makes most of them tick. Usually
<br>
it turns out that one can guess at what makes people happy and
<br>
depressed pretty easily. That's one of the reasons things like
<br>
cognitive therapy have a high success rate in curing clinical
<br>
depression, by the way -- because people tend to be pretty similar and
<br>
you can usually guess as to the mental patterns that are causing them
<br>
personal distress.
<br>
<p>Is it arrogant to think one can guess as to what will make people
<br>
personally happy? Perhaps, perhaps not. Is it reasonable to think that
<br>
one can make such guesses? Unquestionably yes, given the evidence at
<br>
hand.
