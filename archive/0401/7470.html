Robin:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think we have the luxury of assuming that &quot;Friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before strong nanotech&quot; is very likely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I went to great lengths to make it clear that I don't think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very likely at all.  That's why it needs working towards.
</em><br>
<p>If it motivates you... But I don't think it will happen, and
<br>
I also don't think it spells doom. Basically, in my view the
<br>
sequence of developments will be dumb grey goo, AI,
<br>
smart grey goo. Dumb goo just replicates blindly. Smart
<br>
goo is like Vinge's Blight. Dumb goo comes before AI
<br>
because it's simpler. AI comes before smart goo because
<br>
AI on a stable platform is easier. Humans have a chance
<br>
against dumb goo; they don't, against sufficiently smart
<br>
goo; but there'll be an opening for Friendly AI in between.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ah.  Do you have other terminology to offer in its place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;non-self-replicating nanotech&quot; is a bit of a mothful.  8)
</em><br>
<p>You could use Neal Stephenson's terms: Feed and Seed.
