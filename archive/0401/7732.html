<p>Actually, I'm trying to figure out what could be described as a basic 
<br>
goal (or, I suppose, supergoal).  The problem is that when this is 
<br>
described, the AI will have no world model to speak of, so most things 
<br>
that one would want to put in as a goal are impossible to describe to 
<br>
the AI.  I can think of how to define visual primitives (I'm thinking of 
<br>
writing a recognizer based around a superspecified *.xpm file format ... 
<br>
well, actually the original form will be an internal Python data 
<br>
structure that can be fed to gtk primitives, and can also be handled in 
<br>
Python.  I plan to start with vertical and horizontal line recognizers, 
<br>
and then work on corner recognizers.  Etc.)  I'm planning on useing 
<br>
Python for the introspective layer with Pyrex as an intermediate layer 
<br>
that connects to &quot;understood&quot; (i.e., compiled C code) modules.  I have a 
<br>
plan that evaluations (i.e., things which can be &quot;summarized as a single 
<br>
number of desireability&quot; ) should be in a topologically sorted list.  
<br>
(That's a bit of an oversimplification, which is why the topological sort.)
<br>
<p>I'm a bit more at sea about how to do the world models.  Direct sensory 
<br>
experience would be (eventually) anything that touched a port, but I 
<br>
intend to start of simple, with having it read e-mail.  I expect that 
<br>
I'll build in some initial guidance along the lines of &quot;thought chunks 
<br>
tend to split at white spaces, connections of thought chunks tend to 
<br>
split after periods that follow something that has been previously 
<br>
recognized as a though chunk.  Carriage returns are more definite 
<br>
splits, and two or more Carriage returns in succession are a very 
<br>
definite split.  And I'll probably build in a rule that lets it 
<br>
automatically peel the headers away from the body.  But all of these 
<br>
will be in a &quot;variable code&quot; section.  What the alternatives will be I 
<br>
don't know, but everything needs to be arranged so that switchable lists 
<br>
of routines that make sense can have simple substitutions.  The 
<br>
intention is that it will be amenable to genetic programming, either by 
<br>
me, if I get around to learning it first, or by the AI after it figures 
<br>
out how to do things.
<br>
<p>But how to structure the goals is something I haven't figures out the 
<br>
first thing on.  Except that:
<br>
1) They've got to be teleological
<br>
2) They've got to be rankable (that topological list again)
<br>
3) They've got to be callable as processes.  Either there will be a Goal 
<br>
class with methods, so some other way.
<br>
<p>In my view of things there are four basic processes of thought.  I could 
<br>
swipe terminology from CGJung, but I prefer to not carry his baggage, so 
<br>
I call them Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.
<br>
Air the computations that mimic the kinds of things Fortran was designed 
<br>
to handle.  Logic. 
<br>
Fire is the management of the sorted lists, letting you quickly 
<br>
determine whether you have previously decided that something is either 
<br>
very good or very bad.  (More complicated decisions, of course, take 
<br>
longer.)
<br>
Earth is modeling.  E.g., an xpm file as an analog of a retina... well, 
<br>
of visual perception, anyway.  This would also cover the transformation 
<br>
of such things into vector expressions and various manipulations (e.g., 
<br>
scaling, rotation, etc.)  But the actual techinques for doing the 
<br>
manipulations would be earth (this probably means &quot;they're expressed as 
<br>
programs rather than as data&quot;).
<br>
Water is goal seeking.  And here I get lost.  I know that in some sense 
<br>
Water is the opposite of Earth, as Air and Fire are opposites...but note 
<br>
that opposite doesn't mean that they directly conflict.  It's more like 
<br>
they use different data structures to represent the same things handled 
<br>
for different purposes.  (Fire makes decisions a lot more quickly than 
<br>
Air, but it has to &quot;know&quot; the decisions ahead of time.)
<br>
<p>Water's basics clearly need to be built in.  I.e., the first level goals 
<br>
have to exist, or, e.g., Fire can have no basis on which to order it's 
<br>
lists.  Air can evaluate probabilities of result based on data from 
<br>
Earth (here sensory perception), but it can't choose that one choice 
<br>
should be adopted rather than another without having some goal to 
<br>
measure it against.
<br>
<p>A lot of the basic work of Air has been done explicitly during the 
<br>
development of mathematics.  Ah, but how to apply it in any  particular 
<br>
environment!  Sensory perception (Earth) and the models that involve it 
<br>
(Earth + Air) can yield predictions as to likely outcomes.  But without 
<br>
goals to measure things against, it's meaningless.   If we have goals, 
<br>
intelligible goals, then we can use the predicted results and try to 
<br>
guess whether that brings us closer or sends us further from them.  This 
<br>
allows us to place actions/results in the desireable/undesireable 
<br>
rankings. 
<br>
<p>A tabula rasa may not be formally impossible, but it seems so nearly so 
<br>
as for the difference to be meaningless.  But I can't figure out how to 
<br>
start decent goals for an intelligent entity based on nothing but the 
<br>
information perceivable from inside a computer.    I think I could make 
<br>
a stab at goals for a specialized entity, say one that categorizes mail 
<br>
into self-similar groups.  But this is a different order of goal.
