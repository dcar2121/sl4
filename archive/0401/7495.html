</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No one's holding stock. :)
<br>
<p>As someone who doesn't understand what produces a mind, and
<br>
hasn't encountered anyone whom I'm convinced does understand
<br>
that, I'm skeptical of the possibility until I hear some
<br>
convincing case that humans *can* understand mind, or see
<br>
an example.  I'm willing to entertain the idea (else I
<br>
wouldn't be here, after all), but don't necessarily think
<br>
it's a given.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am also confused by the phrase &quot;the smartest possible humans&quot;.  Do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you mean &quot;smartest humans occurring naturally without augmentation to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date&quot; or what?
</em><br>
<p>Smartest person using the brain architecture that humans
<br>
use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now physical reality *does* place &quot;some ceiling&quot; or maximum possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, but that ceiling by all we know to date is comfortably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far on the other side of SAI.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not at all sure that your position is more defensible than the
<br>
one I've described, even by your own standards.  Perhaps you meant
<br>
&quot;maximum possible intelligence per cubic kilometer&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The exact boundaries of what is the maximal possible intelligence in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this physical universe is something that I doubt humans are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent enough to comprehend.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't incompatible with my statements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This might not seem very likely to you, but unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can logically rule it out, it isn't incompatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a technologically induced singularity (in the weak sense).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not rational to require logically ruling out each and every weak 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetical in order to assert the emptiness of an argument based on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the weak &quot;it might be possible that X&quot; form.   Proving an &quot;it might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible that&quot; is in fact impossible is generally equivalent to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proving a universal negative.
</em><br>
<p>The hypothesis I'm describing is of the same form
<br>
as &quot;it might be possible that physical law prevents
<br>
objects from moving at more than ~300,000 km/s.&quot;
<br>
<p>It isn't necessary to show that each particular object
<br>
is so bound, if you can show the rule.  Of course, I'm
<br>
not showing the rule, merely arguing that considering
<br>
such a rule possible is not incompatible with singularity-
<br>
aware discourse.
