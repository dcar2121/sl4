<em>&gt;unable to choose differently.  I said I choose not to support someone who
</em><br>
believes it
<br>
<em>&gt;is quite ok to kill off his entire species.
</em><br>
<p>That is how you interpreted it; I said that if an objective morality exists
<br>
and the AI gets there, then, whether the entire species should be killed is
<br>
a decision that can be made with that morality. I am not pro-killing humans.
<br>
I am against taking &quot;don't kill humans&quot; as the ultimate truth. It probably
<br>
will not become moral any time soon to kill humans. Just like netwonian
<br>
dynamics won't stop being useful any time soon, but we now know there is a
<br>
deeper level of reality from which newtonian dynamics arise. We know there
<br>
are some fancy cases in which newtonian dynamics cease to be valid. Get
<br>
close to the speed of light, newton stops working. Have to choose between
<br>
happiness and freedom, or between preserving Either the human race Or a race
<br>
of more numerous more intelligent beings, or between letting a person be
<br>
miserable for a lifetime Or dying painlessly, and regular human morality
<br>
_stops_ working. Not that the AI is likely to have to face such a choice,
<br>
but in principle it is possible. I made it as clear as it could possibly be,
<br>
and as I said it's highly controversial as a topic, with very few benefits
<br>
for the immediate future, so I won't explain this further for now. I will
<br>
answer private mails about it, if they contain no sarcasm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, I see.  It all centers in your mind around how you feel.  How
</em><br>
unfortunately
<br>
<em>&gt;enlightening.
</em><br>
<p>I hope it will be clear if you read my message and your answer once again
<br>
that that is not the case. I am proposing an objective morality to transcend
<br>
even the personal interest of humanity itself, while you are choosing to
<br>
stick to your evolved egocentric needs. Which is not a bad thing or an
<br>
insult, it's just what you have to do. But you can't quite accuse me of
<br>
everything centering around how I feel, that is illogical and backwards.
<br>
<p>Again, let's keep this non-personal and about the ideas, please. Attack my
<br>
ideas, not me. I just happen to experience the qualia of the brain that is
<br>
deterministically producing them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wait!  You have previously claimed there is no absolute morality.  Thus
</em><br>
there is no
<br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;yes?  Your position appears to be more and more incoherent.
</em><br>
<p>Are you reading what I write? This is all about me proposing that there is
<br>
an absolute, objective morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you aren't going to stand up for what you like and present as
</em><br>
authoritative on a
<br>
<em>&gt;question then why bother to pretend to be answering?
</em><br>
<p>Standing up for something requires effort, I am willing to put that in after
<br>
you have read the essay.
