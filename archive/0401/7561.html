</em><br>
<p>As you clearly state, there are no simple answers to what we call &quot;moral&quot;
<br>
questions.  These issues are context-dependent and the terminology we
<br>
customarily use confuses by presuming absolutes that can't be attained.
<br>
Discussion and understanding would be improved if we all talked in terms of
<br>
goals and utility.
<br>
<p>My point in presenting the &quot;arrow of morality&quot; concept is to find out
<br>
whether we can agree that with increasing wisdom (intelligence and
<br>
knowledge) comes increasing morality.  If we agree on this, then we can work
<br>
together intentionally to improve our part of the universe.
<br>
<p>The statement &quot;morality is subjective&quot; often carries the implication that it
<br>
is therefore meaningless to compare or evaluate the relative morality of
<br>
various actions.  This strikes me as very similar to the post-modernist view
<br>
that reality is ultimately subjective and all points of view are therefore
<br>
of equal value.  This is a dangerous meme because it leads to poor decision
<br>
making and leads one to bump into the sharp edges of reality rather harshly
<br>
(whether one realizes it or not.)
<br>
<p>I'm not implying that you espouse the po-mo point of view -- far from it.  I
<br>
would suggest, however, that it may be more useful to say &quot;morality is
<br>
context-dependent&quot; than to say &quot;morality is subjective&quot;.
