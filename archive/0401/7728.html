<em>&gt; That sounds to me like you're agreeing with Metaqualia that death in
</em><br>
itself
<br>
<em>&gt; is morally neutral.
</em><br>
<p>Except that I also posited that  &quot;death is innately minorly bad when it
<br>
reduces diversity&quot; and unless you're talking about exact clones with exact
<br>
memory states, etc., death will always reduce diversity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I think that by &quot;killing off everyone&quot; he means &quot;killing off all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans&quot; not &quot;killing off all beings and leaving the universe a completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blank void&quot;.  So the scenario he was hypothesizing was one in which a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman, highly moral AI came to a rational decision that killing off
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt; humans is the best thing to do.  Presumably because this action would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly lead to some other benefit.
</em><br>
<p>I took it as killing off all humans.  I think that that would be a shame
<br>
(and bad) because you would lose the diversity point occupied by humanity.
<br>
This criteria could conceivably be overwhelmed by some massive evilness of
<br>
humanity or some other criteria but I would argue that there are most
<br>
probably other actions that would also fulfill those criteria (changing
<br>
humans, etc. - yes, which moves the diversity point) without having to wipe
<br>
them out.
<br>
<p>BTW, I personally could countenance the destruction of humanity if that were
<br>
the ONLY way to save a more numerous, more advanced race but that is pretty
<br>
much the only circumstances that I could see where a superhuman, highly
<br>
moral AI might rationally do so.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Death is morally neutral. Only suffering is evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I will argue this to my last breath.  Death is NOT morally neutral.
</em><br>
Death
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the END of something and that something is either good or bad.  I
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argue that A death is as good or as bad as the opposite of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ends - - tempered by the good or the bad of the thing that replaces it.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would also posit that death is innately minorly bad when it reduces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; diversity.  Given this premise, I would strongly argue that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that killing off everyone could possibly be a good idea.  Like abortion
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many instances, it might be the best idea in a series of bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trade-offs but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it will never be a good idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I take the moral law I have chosen to its logical extreme, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; won't take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; back when it starts feeling uncomfortable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You sound like a hardcore fanatic.  Maybe your feelings of discomfort
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; telling you something valuable.  Looks to me like a case of
</em><br>
righteousness
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over integrity.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be very careful here! The easiest way to reduce undesirable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; qualia is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kill off everyone who has the potential for experiencing them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I want someone who is superintelligent, and that takes my basic
</em><br>
premises
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary truths, and who recursively improves himself, and who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; qualia in and out, to decide whether everyone should be killed. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consider this eventuality (global extermination) and rule it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; your current beliefs and intelligence, you are not being modest in
</em><br>
front
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; massive superintelligence. I do not rule out that killing everyone off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; be a good idea. Death is morally neutral. Only suffering is evil. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a transhuman ai could do better than that by keeping everyone alive
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; happy, which will reduce negative qualia and also create huge positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ones,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; so I do have good hopes that we won't be killed. What if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; really an evil machine and there was no way of reversing this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; truth? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; if, in every process you care to imagine, all interpretations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in which conscious observers were contained, were real to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; just like the physical world is real to us? What if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existed infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; hells where ultrasentient ultrasensitive beings were kept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enslaved without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the possibility to die? Is this not one universe that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulated and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; by virtue of this interpreted out of any sufficiently complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; simpler processes: read moravec's simulation/consciousness/existence)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I take the moral law I have chosen to its logical extreme, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; won't take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; back when it starts feeling uncomfortable. If the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evil overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and unfixable, it must be destroyed together with everything it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd need very good proof of this obviously but i do not discount the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that a person's method for determining the desireable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morality is based partially on instincts, partially on training, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; we are talking about different things, i have answered this
</em><br>
previously.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ... are you sure about that? Just how heavily do you want the AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weigh it's self interest? Do you want it to be able to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; its self interest? at zero obviously, other than the fact that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is likely to contain a lot more positive qualia than negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ones if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; moral transhuman AI stays alive, so in the end its own survival would
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; more important than the survival of humans, if you consider the
</em><br>
million
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; worlds with biologically evolved beings that may be out there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and in need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; salvation. So at a certain point the best it could do morally to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the goals we have agreed could be exactly exterminating humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Remember, friendliness isn't Friendliness. The former would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like making an AI friend, the latter is nothing like it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where he says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Friendliness should be the supergoal&quot; it means something more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is really right should be the supergoal&quot;. Friendliness is an
</em><br>
external
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is Friendliness creating a machine that wouldn't do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; like? Or is Friendliness creating a machine that wouldn't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't like if we were as intelligent and altruistic as it is?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is assuming that &quot;right&quot; has some absolute meaning, but this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only true in the context of a certain set of axioms (call them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am proposing qualia as universal parameters to which every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentient (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; least evolved ones) can relate. That was the whole purpose, so we
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get

<em>&gt; &gt; not
