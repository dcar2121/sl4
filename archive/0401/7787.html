<em>&gt; How so?  That everything is going to exist anyway doesn't say that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless for your or I to have a morality that guides what *we* choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.
</em><br>
<p>I'm trying to rule out the infinite multiple worlds view.  My arguments DO
<br>
rely on the premise that there is scarcity and that in many cases, the fact
<br>
that something exists means that it exists instead of something else.  Or,
<br>
in simpler words, I am aware that the infinite multiple worlds view implies
<br>
infinite diversity and therefore renders any discussion of morality
<br>
evaluation by diversity somewhat nonsensical.  Note, however, that I also
<br>
see this failure in other morality models (for example, those which have
<br>
been handled incorrectly in previous SL4 discussions by altering the
<br>
probabilities of infinite hells when arguments about post hoc probability
<br>
alteration are also provably moot when everything exists).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is such a guide pointless unless universally adhered to unfailingly?
</em><br>
<p>For the purposes of Friendly AI, I am leery of any guide that has edge
<br>
cases.  For normal purposes though, good general guidelines are never
<br>
pointless even if they are occasionally (non-catastrophically) incorrect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since your primary basis for morality was diversity without specifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything else about what kinds of &quot;diversity&quot; are acceptable, the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to be asked.  If there are criteria for what kinds of &quot;diversity&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable then it seems to me that &quot;diversity&quot; cannot be your primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral criteria.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with both your points and am trying to answer your question.  I am
<br>
not setting any criteria for what kinds of diversity are acceptable.  I am
<br>
making the statement, however, that I believe that certain kinds of
<br>
diversity lead to less future diversity.  Therefore, by the top level goal
<br>
of increasing diversity, these diversity-reducing diversities are less good
<br>
than diversity-increasing diversities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are begging the question as you are positing that the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity always comes from what you would consider happy or morally
</em><br>
correct
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions.
</em><br>
<p>Therefore, my arguments are falsifiable by showing where a happy or morally
<br>
correct condition by common sense/the real world) leads to lesser diversity
<br>
in the long run.  I invite you to provide such a counter-example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But since your measure of these happy conditions was &quot;diversity&quot; we go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; round in circles.  The greatest diversity comes from that which leads to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greatest diversity.
</em><br>
<p>I would argue that any good complete morality system has to be a tautology
<br>
within itself.  The trick is finding one which aligns with common sense/the
<br>
real world and provides evaluative/predictive value.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark
<br>
<p>P.S.  Am I getting any more convincing?    :-)
