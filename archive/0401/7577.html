<em>&gt; qualia in another sentient being is from the outside, or for that matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even from the inside? I'd generally say a creatures tendency to actively
</em><br>
<p>I wish I knew!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; resist something, I honestly can't tell you if tickling is a positive or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative qualia. If I'm being tickled seriously I struggle to get away,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then once I'm away I go back for more :)
</em><br>
<p>To me it is negative. I don't enjoy tickling and don't go back for more.
<br>
Of course it's possible that one stimulus triggers both positive and
<br>
negative qualia (eating with guilt, SM, lots more), this just tells you the
<br>
predicament we're in, being evolved mammals. These should be decoupled and
<br>
the negative qualia destroyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People climb Mt. Everest experiencing levels of suffering far greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a good tickling (toes falling off and stuff). Yet they go and seek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out that experience. Depending on the time scale, your toe freezing off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Mt Everest is either negative or positive qualia :)
</em><br>
<p>People are programmed to make sacrifices to gain social recognition. They do
<br>
this for their genes, but they are the ones to pay the price. Your toe
<br>
falling off is not negative or positive, the sensation of it falling off,
<br>
the sadness when you look in the mirror and you know you are deformed, these
<br>
are negative qualia. Of course, being at the top, feeling proud, signing
<br>
autographs, these involve positive qualia, once again these should be
<br>
decoupled and the negative qualia destroyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe the universe is already orgasmium if looked at from the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective?
</em><br>
<p>I really doubt it :)
<br>
And you don't have that kind of control over your cognitive architecture.
