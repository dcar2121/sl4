</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can't see any objective way to determine that it is wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please supply the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) what you understand morality or ethics is and what it is based on;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there really is such a thing. In general, we pick
<br>
rules of thumb for behavior to optimize our own goals (generally
<br>
things like survival). We pick such rules because it is impossible to
<br>
always consider all consequences of one's actions. Thus, one picks the
<br>
rule of thumb &quot;don't kill people except in self defense&quot; because it
<br>
happens to help you avoid getting into serious trouble that would lead
<br>
to your not surviving.
<br>
<p>As it turns out, most people share a set of common goals (surviving,
<br>
reproducing, etc.) and thus it is possible for us to come to a common
<br>
agreement on ground rules that allow us to eliminate the Hobbesian war
<br>
of all against all, settle down, and build Safeways and tract homes
<br>
without worrying they're going to be looted or that our children will
<br>
be slaughtered as soon as we leave the homestead. Most people benefit,
<br>
except for the ones that really like eating people's livers, but there
<br>
are fairly few of them and they don't leave many offspring anyway.
<br>
<p>We thus develop these elaborate personal senses of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;,
<br>
meaning, of course, &quot;that which promotes my goals&quot; and &quot;that which
<br>
retards my goals&quot;. As it turns out, many people often share goals, and
<br>
thus the phrases &quot;good for me&quot; and &quot;bad for me&quot; can get shortened
<br>
because often two people will share a sense of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; over a
<br>
wide variety of observables.
<br>
<p>The issue becomes when we reify these rules into &quot;Absolute
<br>
Moralities&quot;. Rather than recognizing one is dealing with evolved
<br>
rules of thumb that seem to work most of the time, one pretends that
<br>
they're universe-given absolutes that can be extended out of their
<br>
original context. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cease to be words used relative to
<br>
one's personal goals but instead Universal Absolutes.
<br>
<p>We then start getting into fascinating edge cases and wonder why they
<br>
are problems &quot;killing is wrong, therefore, killing a blastocyst is
<br>
wrong&quot; is one fabulous such example.
<br>
<p>Through the centuries, we've reified large bundles of rules of thumb
<br>
into &quot;moralities&quot;. So long as one understands their limitations, there
<br>
is no problem -- but few people seem to understand that subtlety.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) what you consider &quot;objective&quot; to mean in context of (a).
</em><br>
<p>What I was pointing out is that there isn't an objective
<br>
morality. Were there one, we could presumably measure the &quot;moral
<br>
fluid&quot; or do some other sort of experiment to assess whether nailing
<br>
Tommy's feet to the floor and force-feeding him to make his liver
<br>
tasty is &quot;morally wrong&quot;. However, no such experiments exist, and in
<br>
fact it is neither &quot;right&quot; nor &quot;wrong&quot; to do that, since such concepts
<br>
are not absolute but relative.
<br>
<p>What I was noting was that the absence of mechanisms that can
<br>
objectively settle moral dilemmas is evidence for moral relativism. It
<br>
is certainly not *conclusive* evidence, but a good Popperian dislikes
<br>
non-falsifiables, and Absolute Moralities have this problem that
<br>
they're not falsifiable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it is only a matter of taste, so to speak, whether it is ok to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only murder fellow sentients but torture them so one can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more pleasure out of eating them, then truly we would be in a dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world where only might makes right and everything else is mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective preference.
</em><br>
<p>It is all a matter of taste -- and perhaps Tommy's liver tastes very
<br>
good. (Maybe it doesn't -- I'm not a connoisseur of such things.)  By
<br>
the way, to a PETA member, we do live in a dark world -- one where
<br>
people seem to be willing to do that sort of thing to things they
<br>
consider to be worthy of protection, like geese.
<br>
<p>Now, why is it that most people don't find themselves the subject of
<br>
having their livers eaten, but many geese do? Largely because if you
<br>
try the experiment over and over again, you'll find that those humans
<br>
that are willing to eat other humans for dinner end up leaving fewer
<br>
offspring, and thus the impulse (whether genetic or memetic matters
<br>
little) seems to die out pretty quickly. However, no such consequence
<br>
appears to attach itself to eating goose livers, and thus the geese
<br>
get their feet cyanoed to the bottom of cages and become friends with
<br>
Mr. Funnel as they're force-fed into tasty-liverdom.
