<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I can -- or at least, why it wouldn't be stable. There are several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; problems here, including the fact that there is no absolute morality (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thus no way to universally determine &quot;the good&quot;), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I do not see that there is any necessity for &quot;absolute&quot; morality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; order to acheive Friendly AI or any necessity for a unversally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; determination of what is &quot;the good&quot;.   Friendliness (toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; humanity) does not demand this absolute universal morality does it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How can one establish what is &quot;Friendly&quot; without it? We haven't been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; able to produce Friendly People yet on a large scale, if you haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; noticed. There is no universal notion of correct behavior yet among
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *humans*. Who is to say that the AI won't decide to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Friendly&quot; towards the Islamic Fundamentalists, or towards Communists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or towards some other group one doesn't like, without any way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; determine what &quot;Friendly&quot; is supposed to mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dah.  But the point I was attempting to explore is that a definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Friendliness that covered the present and immediately forseeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation (friendliness toward humans) might be sufficient to speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Friendly AI.  A pan-sentient definition might also be possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and even natural but may not be required in the first attempt.    So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not clear to me that &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; morality, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even universal definitions of friendliness are required in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningfully proceed.
</em><br>
<p>I will grant that it is possible that someone will come up with a
<br>
working definition of &quot;Friendly&quot; that is good enough, and a way to
<br>
inculcate it into an AI they are building so deeply that it won't
<br>
slip. I similarly grant that it is possible some talented person will
<br>
come up with an algorithm that solves the traveling salesman in
<br>
polynomial time. I'm not holding my breath, though.
<br>
<p>I put it that way because this is not a new argument. The argument
<br>
over the nature of &quot;the good&quot; goes back thousands of years. I could
<br>
easily hand anyone who liked 50 fine books produced over the last
<br>
2500 years -- from The Republic through stuff written in the last year
<br>
or two -- exploring the question of how to make decisions about what
<br>
is and isn't &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, and no one has made much progress to
<br>
the goal, though they've explored lots of interesting territory.
<br>
<p>Absent a way to determine if, say, eating a cow is immoral, there will
<br>
be no way for The Friendly AI to determine if it should be protecting
<br>
cows from being eaten -- doubtless the PETA types would argue that it
<br>
is fundamental that they should not be, and the folks at Ruth's Chris
<br>
would argue otherwise, and perhaps they would both petition The
<br>
Friendly AI for resolution, only for none to be achieved.
<br>
<p>That might seem to be a fairly uninteresting dispute to you, but I
<br>
assure you that there are thousands of them floating around out there
<br>
waiting to bite the Friendly AI project in the gluteus maximus hard
<br>
enough to draw blood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it is not clear that a construct like this would be able to battle it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out effectively against other constructs from societies that do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; construct Friendly AIs (or indeed that the winner in the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; won't be the societies that produce the meanest, baddest-assed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; intelligences rather than the friendliest -- see evolution on earth),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; An argument from evolution doesn't seem terribly germane for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; entities that are very much not evolved but designed and iteratively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; self-improved.  What exactly is meant by such a loose term as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;bad-ass&quot; in this context?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Elsewhere in the universe, there may be entities evolving now that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; society would be forced to war with eventually -- entities that have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; different notion of The Good. There might, for example, be an entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; out there that wants to turn the entire universe into computronium for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; itself, and doesn't care much about taking over our resources in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; process. Any entities we develop into or create to protect us would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; need to be able to fight successfully against such entities in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for our descendents to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I guess that could be seen as loosely equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;baddest-assed&quot;. :-) But friendliness does not exclude being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend against agression.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. It seems the way we learned how to defend against
<br>
aggression was by learning to be highly unfriendly to anything that
<br>
got in our way. Perhaps there are other paths to such things -- I
<br>
don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, I find it interesting to speculate on possible constructs like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The Friendly AI, but not safe to assume that they're going to be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one's future. The prudent transhumanist considers survival in wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; variety of scenarios.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; But what do you believe is the scenario or set of scenarios that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; the maximum survivability and benefit with the least amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; pain/danger of annihilation of self and species?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I have no idea. Prediction of a very chaotic system like the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; behavior of all the entities involved here is very very difficult. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; best I can come up with a few rules about what is likely to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; based on the vaguest of constraints -- for example, making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; assumption that the laws of physics are what we think they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was not asking you to predict what you think would happen but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express what it is you would like to happen and believe worthwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work toward bringing into being.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to see strong nanotechnology and IA technologies, because
<br>
I could apply them to my own personal survival, but beyond that, I
<br>
don't know what the spectrum of things that could happen are, or how I
<br>
might choose among them meaningfully.
<br>
<p>I don't pretend I have the foresight to be able to guide history into
<br>
a direction I would like -- I don't even pretend to be able to guide a
<br>
small company with any certainty and I have at least operated those
<br>
enough to have understanding of the problem and feel like I can do a
<br>
reasonable job at it. The variables involved with an entire society on
<br>
the scale of the one we have are beyond my comprehension. That's why
<br>
I'm a libertarian, not a central planning freak.
