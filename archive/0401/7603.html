<em>&gt; &gt; If morality is subjective, then the morality which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; says the Holocaust was the greatest thing in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is every bit as good as the morality which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course. And, had the Nazis won, that would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been the morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being taught everywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As it turns out, I don't particularly like that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality -- it has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad effect of leading to people attempting to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me -- but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say there is some experiment we can conduct that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrates killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gypsies is &quot;wrong&quot; but killing Reindeer is &quot;okay&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cheetahs and antelopes aren't sentient (that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discussion entirely) aren't sentient and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can't negotiatie, at least not in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Humans rarely negotiate with tuna before turning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; them into very tasty sushi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A negotiation, at least in the way we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requires that both parties be sentient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does &quot;sentient&quot; mean? Perhaps to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jupiter-brain, we won't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very sentient, but we *will* seem rather tasty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How different is it, after all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I try talking to a tuna about physics, it gives me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no answer, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude it isn't &quot;sentient&quot; the way I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term and eat it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignoring its pain response as I slaughter it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because, after all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're just &quot;animal reflexes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Jupiter-brain tries sending me an advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encoded signal asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my opinion on the solution to an astoundingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult math problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which won't even fit inside my skull when encoded 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom. I give it no meaningful reply, it concludes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sentient,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it decides to eat me, ignoring my pain responses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, just &quot;animal reflexes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the way, Tommy, eat any good pate de foie gras
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lately? Mmm, tasty.
</em><br>
<p>I don't even know what that is. To rephrase: a
<br>
'sentient' organism is one that experiences qualia,
<br>
and thus has the opportunity to experience negative
<br>
qualia. I really don't have that good of an idea where
<br>
the dividing line is on Earth, and I am not too eager
<br>
to find out, because of people's tendency to
<br>
rationalize to justify hurting animals. I also think
<br>
that the question of objective vs. subjective won't be
<br>
decided until we understand qualia, since moralities
<br>
are usually defined in terms of them.
