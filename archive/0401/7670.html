<em>&gt; This begs the question of what it means to be &quot;human&quot;, doesn't it?
</em><br>
<p>What part of it did? :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be the nature of the *human* mind that, if it is openly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally engaged with the world, it is going to experience a certain
</em><br>
<p>It is the nature of evolved biological systems, a nature I'd gladly dispense
<br>
with.
<br>
If you say, being human involves experiencing negative emotions, ok that is
<br>
what it involves _today_. Being human 1 million years ago involved seeing
<br>
your children eaten by beasts during the night, 1 thousand years ago it
<br>
involved having to lift bricks of stones for a lifetime so that some jerk
<br>
could look cool in front of the gods, 1 hundred years ago (not sure) it
<br>
involved operation without anaesthesia. I hope in 100 years it won't involve
<br>
the painful things that it still involves today.
<br>
<p>But this is a philosophical issue that seems to assume that the scope of our
<br>
conversation is &quot;do we higher income geeks on sl4 want to get rid of pain or
<br>
not&quot;. Of course I've got a bunch of worries I'd rather live without, but I
<br>
think the first who deserve a hand are people living in crap countries
<br>
getting slaughtered, without medical attention, people exploited because
<br>
they are poor and uneducated, people who see their family in trouble, all
<br>
the miserable people that are in the world. Or anyone who, for lesser
<br>
causes, is experiencing just as powerful negative qualia. On this I kind of
<br>
go with Elizier's staring into the singularity where he talks about the
<br>
singularity in a humanitarian perspective.
<br>
<p>Aside from philosophical debate, I think the productive way of facing these
<br>
issues is to first get rid of the big evils everyone agrees on, and then
<br>
once we are a more relaxed species without constant thorns in our butts and
<br>
we can actually sit down still and think about problems with a more
<br>
altruistic perspective, then we will decide who wants to keep the mouth
<br>
sores and who doesn't.
<br>
<p>What it means to be human... I don't think this is out of topic on sl4. For
<br>
us, the question is what does it mean to be human to someone who has gone
<br>
through shock level 4? What is left of &quot;me&quot; once everything that can be
<br>
deterministically recreated has been recreated and broken down?
<br>
<p>Human beings need to cling to something to give their life meaning; it can
<br>
be being god's favorite people, or having a large brain, etc. - finding an
<br>
excuse gets increasingly harder once you know about technology (which seems
<br>
to discredit animism and so on) but in the end I think these are only
<br>
circumstances, details, things that happened in a certain way but would have
<br>
happened differently if we threw the dice again. If there is something that
<br>
we, as spontaneously generated patterns at the edge of order and chaos, can
<br>
claim to be unique about us it is the fact that we experience stuff
<br>
(qualia). Not that we experience some particular ones, but that we are able
<br>
to experience them as opposed to not experiencing anything at all.
<br>
<p>So I don't think being brainier, or stupider, or fatter, or having a shared
<br>
consciousness, or uploading ourselves into a strontium titanate substrate
<br>
would lessen our humanity. Not even becoming a dog would, provided there is
<br>
something it feels like for it to exist and do its thing. The only way of
<br>
losing one's humanity is to cease feeling anything at all. That happens when
<br>
you die or enter a japanese company. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's why, as discussed in some long-prior SL4 threads, I don't just want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to upload myself ---- I want a series of copies of future-Ben, one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staying human (though with minor fixes like removal of physical aches and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pains), one of them ascending to ultra-trans-humanity, etc. etc. etc.
</em><br>
<p>These are personal preferences you're certainly entitled to - I myself, as a
<br>
monkey, wouldn't mind living in a banana forest for a couple hundred years
<br>
before I became human and started listening to bach and eating banana
<br>
icecream (read: wouldn't mind spending the next couple hundred years in
<br>
virtual reality doing all kinds of crazy stuff before I got augmented and
<br>
started exploring the &quot;possibilities of existence&quot;).
