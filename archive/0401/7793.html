<em>&gt; Everything in the biosphere does not fit very well with &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description offered by evolution&quot;.   Evolution explains some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of the biosphere, nowhere near all.   That is no reason for

</em><br>
<p>There is a popular conception of evolution &quot;bloody in tooth and claw&quot; that
<br>
we expect to rise above.  This is a good and noble goal within the context
<br>
that it is intended, but it leads to paradox due to the (misleading)
<br>
implication that humans are somehow outside of evolution or about to
<br>
transcend evolution.  True, evolution on this planet has arrived at a new
<br>
phase, where a higher level of organization now allows for more effective
<br>
progress than ever before, but it's important to see that in the bigger
<br>
picture this is just another phase in a process of evolution that has been
<br>
going on for as far back as we can see.
<br>
<p>Evolutionary science has identified various modes within the biological
<br>
model, but I think we're on the verge of understanding that the same
<br>
underlying principle operates at the pre-biological atomic and molecular
<br>
levels, and at the post-biological level of human societies, and beyond.
<br>
This principle seems (to me) to be the same principle underlying the
<br>
thermodynamic &quot;arrow of time&quot; and the higher level instances of non-zero sum
<br>
game theory.
<br>
<p>I think the idea of an &quot;objective morality&quot; is a misconception.  Morality is
<br>
context-dependent, and the universe will always present us with a new layer
<br>
of the onion when we're ready to see it.  But because morality is
<br>
context-dependent, a wider context generally means a more consistent, more
<br>
useful, understanding of what is moral.  Only in the ultimate &quot;god's eye&quot;
<br>
view of a universe beyond space and time would there be an objective
<br>
morality, but as we humans expand our understanding (our context) and become
<br>
more godlike in our understanding of the universe it seems clear to me that
<br>
we become more moral (by any useful definition of the word.)
<br>
<p>Evolution is not a random walk, but it is chaotic.  I think that with a
<br>
greater undertanding of non-linear dynamics, we will develop not an
<br>
&quot;objective morality&quot;, but a &quot;science of morality&quot; that will be effectively
<br>
applied to moral and political issues on a planetary (and eventually wider)
<br>
scale.
