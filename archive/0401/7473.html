<p>
The cost of processing power continues to drop at 
<br>
a Moore's Law pace. Cost has dropped 22% 
<br>
in the past eight months and by one half 
<br>
in the past 20 months. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I've been tracking the cost of a node in 
<br>
a &quot;Sparse Flat Network Neighborhood&quot; type
<br>
cluster of commodity computers.  The basis
<br>
machine is described at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://aggregate.org/KASY0/">http://aggregate.org/KASY0/</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Their machine does not have much memory and
<br>
no storage, so for the purpose of tracking the
<br>
cost of a system useful for AI work, I track
<br>
nodes where the memory is kept at a ratio of
<br>
near 1 byte/Hz, and storage is 100 bytes/Hz. The best 
<br>
cost/performance nodes I have found are as follows: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Date $/Gflop/s 
<br>
Nov 01 600 
<br>
Jan 02 437 
<br>
Mar 02 397 
<br>
May 02 319 
<br>
Aug 02 272 
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Component prices are obtained from pricewatch.com, 
<br>
including shipping but not sales tax. Current 
<br>
configuration is as follows: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Case:       $20 Generic Mid-ATX w/300W power supply 
<br>
Motherboard: 38 MSI K7T Turbo 2 
<br>
CPU:         59 AMD Athlon XP2200 (1.8 Ghz) 
<br>
Memory:     128 3x512MB PC133 SDRAM 
<br>
Storage:    131 180 GB EIDE internal Hard Disk 
<br>
NIC:         14 4x10/100 Ethernet cards 
<br>
Wiring:       8 4x6ft Cat 5 cables w/RJ45 connectors 
<br>
Hub:         10 1/6x24 port fast ethernet switch 
<br>
<p><p>Total      $408/node 
<br>
<p><p>AMD processors when used in clusters reported in
<br>
the top500.org supercomputer list achieve about
<br>
1.375 Flop/Hz out of a theoretical 2 Flop/Hz. 
<br>
Therefore the performance/$ is:
<br>
<p>$408 / (1.8 GHz * 1.375 Flop/Hz) = $165/Gflop/s 
<br>
<p>Note that many announced supercomputers
<br>
have higher costs per Gflop due to installation,
<br>
software, and facility costs.  This is a best case
<br>
lower bound for a self-assembled system.
<br>
<p>If optimistic estimates of the required computer 
<br>
power for human-level AI are correct at 100 TFlop/s, 
<br>
it presently costs $16.5M to buy a human's worth 
<br>
of computers. I have estimated an 'economic 
<br>
crossover' of $3M for 100 TFlop/s when computers 
<br>
become generally cheaper than humans. This is 
<br>
based on a computer being able to put in 5x as 
<br>
many productive hours as an average human, a 5 year 
<br>
payback time on the hardware, and $120K as the total 
<br>
cost per year of a technical professional. We are 
<br>
therefore about 2.5 doublings in performance/$ 
<br>
away from economic crossover. At the recent trend 
<br>
of cost reduction, 3.3% per month, that would be 
<br>
reached in 52 months, or May 2008. 
<br>
<p>Economic crossover does not imply we would have 
<br>
human-level AI at that point, but rather that 
<br>
skilled human tasks which require lots of processing 
<br>
power would be cost-feasible. In particular, high 
<br>
level factory automation should be possible. This 
<br>
has implications in the social and economic realms. 
<br>
<p>The processing power to run a human-level AI is 
<br>
unknown, but is estimated to be in the range of 
<br>
100 - 100,000 TFlop/s. Assume the most powerful 
<br>
machine available for AI work is in the $3 M price 
<br>
range. Then the expected date of a human-level 
<br>
machine is 2008-2024. The expected date for 
<br>
superintelligent machines is 7.5 years later. This 
<br>
is calculated from a human taking about 20 years 
<br>
to train. A machine 8 times faster than a human 
<br>
is expected 5 years after a human-equivalent, and 
<br>
it would be expected to train in 20/8 = 2.5 years. 
<br>
<p>Once superintelligent machines are available, the 
<br>
time constant for doubling performance may drop to 
<br>
much shorter periods as superintelligent machines 
<br>
design their successors ever more rapidly. This 
<br>
singularity may occur in the 2015-2033 time period. 
<br>
<p>Labor productivity trends also point to a singularity 
<br>
in the ~2020 time period. From 1992 to 2003, labor 
<br>
input in durable goods manufacturing has fallen by 42%
<br>
<p>per unit of output. Durable goods are defined as 
<br>
having a useful life of over a year, as opposed to, 
<br>
say food, which gets consumed quickly.  In particular
<br>
factory equipment, such as machine tools, that are
<br>
used to produce durable goods, are themselves durable
<br>
goods. 
<br>
<p>The trend predicts highly automated production should 
<br>
arrive around 2020. At some point around then, it 
<br>
should be possible to design replicating industrial 
<br>
systems, either single factories or networks of 
<br>
factories, that can produce copies of themselves 
<br>
as well as useful products with little human input. 
<br>
Preliminary estimates indicate that these replicating 
<br>
factories may have a time to copy themselves on the 
<br>
order of 1 year, which is similar to the rate of 
<br>
improvement of computer power, and much faster than 
<br>
the rates of economic growth we are used to (0-10%per 
<br>
year). 
<br>
<p>Therefore even if improvements in computer components
<br>
slows down due to limits of semiconductor scaling,
<br>
their performance/cost ratio may continue to improve
<br>
due to highly automated production.
