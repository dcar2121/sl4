<p><em>&gt; And 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; memetically.  
</em><br>
<p>You're being unexpectedly dense here. If meme A contributes to genetic
<br>
fitness, and memes are mostly transmitted between relatives, then the
<br>
increased genetic fitness implies more relatives for carriers of A and
<br>
therefore also helps increase A's frequency in the meme pool. On the other 
<br>
hand, if memes are mostly transmitted between non-relatives, then the 
<br>
increased genetic fitness does not help A's memetic fitness much. Instead, 
<br>
type B memes do better because their carriers spend less resources on 
<br>
childcare and more on propagating the memes in other ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, why hypothesize a gene that discriminates childcare 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting *memes* as such and promotes greater susceptibility to them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than a gene that makes people like children, and hence (as a side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect) memes that tap into people's liking for children?
</em><br>
<p>There's no reason why these genes can't both exist, is there? I see plenty
<br>
of memes that try to promote child rearing as an obligation and also memes
<br>
that try to promote it as an enjoyment, which I count as evidence that
<br>
both of these kinds of genes exist.
<br>
<p>If you think it's not plausible that a gene can discriminate between a
<br>
type A meme and a type B meme and promote the former, consider the
<br>
hypothesis that the earlier in life that you encounter a meme, the more
<br>
likely it is to be a type A meme. If this is true (and I think it probably
<br>
was in our environment of evolutionary adaptation, because in childhood
<br>
your parents tend to keep you away from type B meme carriers), a gene can
<br>
promote type A memes simply by making the brain credulous in childhood and
<br>
then increasingly skeptical as one grows older.
