</em><br>
<p><p>Pity, that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; To rephrase: a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'sentient' organism is one that experiences qualia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus has the opportunity to experience negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia. 
</em><br>
<p><p>What is this qualia you speak of?  Am I sentient or not, if I don't believe
<br>
I have qualia?  You think you experience qualia, but do you really?  Maybe
<br>
you just *think* you do.
<br>
<p>The utility of this definition is obvious.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I really don't have that good of an idea where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dividing line is on Earth, and I am not too eager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find out, because of people's tendency to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalize to justify hurting animals.
</em><br>
<p><p>What makes you think sentience isn't a gradient, a continuous measure of
<br>
hardware capacity?
<br>
<p>I think a much simpler answer is that humans draw the line where it is
<br>
convenient for them to do so.  Some vegans exclude no animals, most humans
<br>
exclude all or most animals, some humans might excluded blacks or Jews, and
<br>
I could exclude everyone who is less intelligent than myself.  None of these
<br>
is more correct than any other because they are all based on the apparently
<br>
false premise that sentience is an &quot;obvious&quot; Boolean property of all living
<br>
things rather than a continuous measure of an intrinsic property of some
<br>
types of machinery.  I have yet to see a Boolean measure of sentience that
<br>
was anything but arbitrary.
<br>
<p>Where the line is drawn doesn't really matter; its existence largely serves
<br>
as a cheap moral justification when killing another organism.  No point in
<br>
sugar coating it or pretending that your line is objectively more special
<br>
than any other line.  The universe doesn't recognize your line regardless.
