<p>Selfishness has nothing intrinsically to do with capitalism's success.
<br>
Groups of individuals competing for some finite resource or striving toward
<br>
some complex goal (selfish or otherwise) form a dynamical system which is
<br>
more amendable to self-organization. Humans are innately more selfish than
<br>
not, so selfishness acting as a driving-force is sufficient for
<br>
self-organization in minds-in-general (particularly humans), but it is
<br>
hardly necessary for self-organization in minds-in-general. Capitalism works
<br>
because it uses the principles of self-organization, while command economies
<br>
explicitly attempt to stomp out all types of self-organization and replace
<br>
it with their own rigid systems, which, as evidenced by history, doesn't
<br>
work too well. This reminds me of sign-language; the sign-languages that
<br>
arise spontaneously are always much more expressive and easier to learn by a
<br>
deaf individual than any sign-language system ever created by some board of
<br>
&quot;experts.&quot;
<br>
<p>I expect that transhumans will still use capitalism-esque systems, probably
<br>
without the selfishness though, or whatever systems are easily amendable to
<br>
self-organization.

<p>Speaking of which, why is everyone on this list so confident that
<br>
recursive-self-improvement will even work? It seems to be tacitly assumed on
<br>
this list that the amount of intelligence it will take to create a new
<br>
intelligence will increase logarithmically or at least linearly with the
<br>
sophistication of the intelligence to be created, but what is this
<br>
assumption based upon? For example, if X is some objective and numeric
<br>
measure of intelligence, won't it be more likely that it will take X^2
<br>
amount of intelligence (either iterating over a certain amount of time or
<br>
multiple minds working in parallel) to create an X + 1 intelligence? Or
<br>
worse yet, might it take 2^X amount of intelligence to create an X + 1
<br>
intelligence? Perhaps 2^2^X amount of intelligence? If so, then there are
<br>
very definite limits on how far a super-intelligence will be able to go
<br>
before it &quot;runs out of steam,&quot; and it might not be all that far.
<br>
<p>I don't claim to be offering an argument that recursive-self-improvement
<br>
won't work well, but why does everyone here seem to be so convinced that it
<br>
will work at all?
