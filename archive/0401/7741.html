Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<em>&gt;I am underwhelmed.  The summation is an empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global assertion I would expect to see in a religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;text. The construct regarding every physical process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embodying all possible worlds is utterly non-sensical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The core notion above seems to amount to little more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than saying that all interpretations read into observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts are in a fundmental sense real or at least they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if the interpretation is &quot;complex enough&quot; to contain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-aware observers. If the &quot;interpretation&quot; was what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convinced you of the advanced civilization residing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a soap bubble in your bath, then it is certainly not true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you can now drop your mere needless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation and let the soap-bubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;super-civilization go on its way.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I don't think that Metaqualia explained panpsychism well at all when
<br>
he quoted Hans Moravec; what you're talking about above (and in Moravec's
<br>
quote) is more like some kind of &quot;quantum mysticism&quot; than panpsychism. I
<br>
consider myself a panpsychist at the moment, and all I mean by asserting
<br>
this is that I believe all things have qualia to a certain extent. A quale
<br>
is simply &quot;what it's like to be in some state,&quot; e.g. information, and
<br>
because all things, from rocks to raindrops, posses information and can
<br>
&quot;extract&quot; information from other sources (like when a rock extracts
<br>
information about a surface when it collides with it), this means they must
<br>
all have qualia. Of course, I'm definitely not asserting that rocks are
<br>
&quot;conscious&quot; or &quot;sentient&quot; by any reasonable definition of the word; they're
<br>
far too simple for that, all I've asserted is that there is something it is
<br>
like to be a rock, and probably not much at that. Though rocks absorb all of
<br>
their photons and soundwaves unfocused, unfiltered, and with no
<br>
pre-conceived notions, they &quot;see&quot; reality in full as it truly is; I suppose
<br>
there's a certain Taoistic virtue in that. ;-)
<br>
<p>My current working hypothesis is that the complexity and richness of qualia
<br>
corresponds directly to the complexity of the algorithm. If you had two Paul
<br>
Fidikas; myself and a &quot;Brute-Force Paul Fidika,&quot; who consisted simply of a
<br>
long list of IF Percept A, Then Action B rules. If Brute-Force Paul had
<br>
enough of these rules, like more than would reasonably fit into our
<br>
universe, and if these were carefully constructed to make Brute-Force Paul
<br>
do whatever I would do in any given situation, then we would both be
<br>
functionally equivalent. HOWEVER, I believe that Brute-Force Paul would have
<br>
much less qualia than I, in fact, no more qualia than a really long and
<br>
stupid list of switch-statements in C++, because that's &quot;all&quot; he is, after
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>Also for the record, Searle and his &quot;information relativism&quot; doesn't like
<br>
panpsychism (see Chapter six of The Mystery of Consciousness and his
<br>
exchange with David Chalmers therein), although all Searle can ever muster
<br>
up against it is &quot;my intuition suggests that panpsychism is a load of BS,
<br>
but I can't come up with even a remotely good reason as to why that would be
<br>
true.&quot; He doesn't actually come out and say that, but like any good
<br>
philosopher rambles on and on for a few pages about nothing (poor
<br>
fluent-aphasiac ;-p ).
