</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please elaborate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If the limit really is just at the upper end of the

<em>&gt;&gt; very
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; question may not have an answer other than &quot;it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consequence of physical law&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My question is, of all the places where the limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be, wouldn't it be a very big coincidence thatn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the limit happened to be at almost the exact level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented by the very first species we know of to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have achieved general intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>Here's an elaboration:  You are, no doubt, familiar with
<br>
the weak anthropic principle.  There are many specific
<br>
values of physical constants, which, if different by any
<br>
significant amount, would eliminate the possibility of
<br>
life as we know it, and therefore the knowing.  Now, one
<br>
can easily ask &quot;why would the strong nuclear force have
<br>
exactly the value it needs to have for us to exist?&quot;,
<br>
but there doesn't need to be any answer other than &quot;that's
<br>
just the way it is&quot;.  This isn't to say that there *isn't*
<br>
some other answer; just that there doesn't logically have
<br>
to be.
<br>
<p>In the case of intelligence, it might be that strong
<br>
superintelligence would inevitably overrun the universe
<br>
if it existed (this seems likely), but that human-level
<br>
intelligence is much more likely to be localized or
<br>
wipe itself out.  In this case, the first superintelligence
<br>
would preclude any other intelligence from ever arising.
<br>
<p>Now, I'm not really arguing that strong superintelligence
<br>
is impossible, though I emotionally favor the idea.  My
<br>
original argument was merely that the belief that strong
<br>
superintelligence is impossible is not incompatible with
<br>
singularitarianism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; One problem here is that I don't know enough to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this argument, by a long, long way.  I've already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; presented my (relatively tenuous) evidence for this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but I'll recap it here for clarity: humans who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; highly intelligent seem to have a higher incidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of mental disorder (i.e., insanity).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, I'd like to see a study or two confirm this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, if it is true, it could be something limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to our particular brain architecture. Third, it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be something limited to Darwinistically evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms. Fourth, you have to distinguish people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are 'insane' (which is bad) from people who simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't follow our semi-arbitrary social conventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which is probably good). There are probably more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons I can't think of.
</em><br>
<p>I have no particular quarrel with any of these.  Google
<br>
will gladly show you examples of studies about it.
