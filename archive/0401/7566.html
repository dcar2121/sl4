<p>I do not yet know how to calculate that curve directly.
<br>
<p>Problem is, the equations you're offering can't be fitted to the case of 
<br>
hominid evolution, or evolution, or to human culture, or to any of the 
<br>
other classic cases of accelerating complexity offered by John Smart, Ray 
<br>
Kurzweil, and the like.  Change may not be &quot;exponential&quot;, but there is 
<br>
certainly no evidence that it slows down over time.  For evolution, the 
<br>
rate of what we would call &quot;improvement&quot; seems to be *roughly* 
<br>
proportional to the size of the existing complexity base in a single 
<br>
organism, dC/dt going roughly as C, a *roughly* exponential growth in 
<br>
which new changes take less time.  The attempt to precisely fit curves, 
<br>
and the argument that these curves can be extrapolated to precise future 
<br>
times, strike me as bogus - see Ilkka Tuomi's refutation of Moore's Law, 
<br>
for example.  But in rough terms, the curve seems to belong more on an 
<br>
exponential graph than on a linear one.  Perhaps each additional gene 
<br>
offers an additional point for possibly good mutations to occur.  Perhaps 
<br>
evolution of evolvability accumulates, later organisms being more modular 
<br>
or expressing better phenotypic accomodations to mutations.  But the 
<br>
curve, even for an utterly wimpy blind-deaf-and-dumb optimization process 
<br>
like natural selection, is more exponential than linear, and it is 
<br>
certainly not logarithmic.  One could make up various equations that 
<br>
behave differently, but they don't fit hominid evolution, mammalian 
<br>
evolution, the saga of life on Earth, and so on, nor human cultural progress.
<br>
<p>I can see a lot of enormous wins in the design of intelligences, not yet 
<br>
taken because they're out of reach for natural selection.  So if the RSI 
<br>
curve should run out of steam, as a result of rapidly reaching 
<br>
near-perfect optimization and then hitting local resource bounds, it would 
<br>
still be far, far above the human ceiling.  Likewise there is no reason to 
<br>
rule out the whole process running to the ceiling in what looks to us like 
<br>
days, hours, perhaps seconds.  And if so that would firmly determine your 
<br>
actual experience in dealing with an AI, regardless of how the internal 
<br>
dynamics look in detail.
