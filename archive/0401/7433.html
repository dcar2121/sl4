<p><p><p>Since when do humans inherently want 'more' children?  To address about half
<br>
of the human population, men have always have been driven through the mating
<br>
game by a desire for sex, not offspring.  The advent of birth control didn't
<br>
bend any supergoal justification philosophies; it merely allowed men to get
<br>
what they want _without_ leaving behind a responsibility trail.  Evolution
<br>
gave us a host of motivations, many of which are driven by unconscious and
<br>
conceptually-indirect means.  Philosophical *justifications* are a fickle

signature of culture, not evolution.

<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree that our attempts at deceiving an SI will likely fall short. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that your attempted solution will likely fall short, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any other methods we try to think up (as described below). But why try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this in the first place? Why treat this SI as an adversary to be bound
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desire to do good, in a cooperative sense, rather than attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply corrections to some &quot;innate nature&quot;? In any case, the adversarial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attitude, as this stance is termed in CFAI, appears pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unworkable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are three possibilities that we can't rule out at this point. 1) Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI will have a natural tendency towards doing good. 2) An SI will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find philosophical justifications for doing good convincing if we seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it with the right initial philosophy. 3) An SI will find these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical justifications silly in some situations. I'm arguing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case 3 is likely, and therefore we need to reduce the likelihood or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequency of those situations as much as possible. I'm pointing out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our own case we realized the silliness of the justifications for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizing the number of biological offspring after being &quot;infected&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parasitic memes, and therefore we should try to prevent the analogous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing from happening with SIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Of course there's possibility 4, that an SI will always find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifications for doing good silly, but there's not much point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worrying about that one.)
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Lately, there's been too much talk on this list of what's technically
<br>
possible- and logical justifications to the wind.  Morality and intelligence
<br>
are both philosophically (and scientifically, if you're talking about
<br>
practical implementation) loaded guns, the former being a tangible property
<br>
only in the abstract.  To start implying that one has some implicit
<br>
correlation with the other is reducing both to low-resolution symbols,
<br>
pasting them together with some sort of theoretical, yet totally undefined,
<br>
glue.
