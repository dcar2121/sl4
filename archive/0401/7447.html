<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; True, but no disproof exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Operating on the assumption that that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which may or may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be possible will happen seems imprudent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems like a very reasonable idea that what can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done, by dumb evolution, in a few gigabytes of DNA can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be done in programming code by humans.
</em><br>
<p>So one can have AI. I don't dispute that. What I'm talking about is
<br>
&quot;Friendly&quot; AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if you have Friendly human-equivalent AI,
</em><br>
<p>You've taken a leap. Step back. Just because we know we can build AI
<br>
doesn't mean we know we can build &quot;Friendly&quot; AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; If anyone thinks they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; have one, I would be very interested. And there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; currently no good reason I can see why Friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; shouldn't be possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I can -- or at least, why it wouldn't be stable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then please, by all means, show me the proof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There are several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; problems here, including the fact that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; absolute morality (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thus no way to universally determine &quot;the good&quot;),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the postition of subjective morality, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from proven. It's not a 'fact', it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility.
</em><br>
<p>It is unproven, for the exact same reason that the non-existence of
<br>
God is unproven and indeed unprovable -- I can come up with all sorts
<br>
of non-falsifiable scenarios in which a God could exist. However, an
<br>
absolute morality requires a bunch of assumptions -- again,
<br>
non-falsifiable assumptions. As a good Popperian, depending on things
<br>
that are non-falsifiable rings alarm bells in my head.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; that it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; obvious that one could construct something far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we truly can't construct something vastly more
</em><br>
<p>Stop. You cut my sentence. I don't doubt that dumb forces can build
<br>
intelligences -- we're an example of that after all. I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; that it is not obvious that one could construct something far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligent than yourself and still manage to constrain its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; behavior effectively,
</em><br>
<p>and don't edit my words that way again if you want me to reply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; and still manage to constrain its behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; effectively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't 'constrain' a transhuman.
</em><br>
<p>And so, I don't believe we can guarantee that you can create a
<br>
Friendly AI in the process of creating a superhuman intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; that it is not clear that a construct like this would be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; battle it out effectively against other constructs from societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that do not construct Friendly AIs (or indeed that the winner in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the universe won't be the societies that produce the meanest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; baddest-assed intelligences rather than the friendliest -- see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolution on earth), etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Battle it out? The 'winner'? The 'winner' in this case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the AI who makes it to superintelligence first.
</em><br>
<p>How do we know that this hasn't already happened elsewhere in the
<br>
universe? We don't. We just assume (probably correctly) that it hasn't
<br>
happened on our planet -- but there are all sorts of other planets out
<br>
there. The Universe is Big. You don't want to build something that
<br>
will have trouble with Outside Context Problems (as Ian Banks dubbed
<br>
them).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Anyway, I find it interesting to speculate on possible constructs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like The Friendly AI, but not safe to assume that they're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be in one's future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course you can't assume that there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity caused by a Friendly AI, but I'm pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darn sure I want it to happen!
</em><br>
<p>I want roses to grow unbidden from the wood of my writing desk.
<br>
<p>Don't speak of desire. Speak of realistic possibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The prudent transhumanist considers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; survival in wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; variety of scenarios.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Survival? If the first transhuman is Friendly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival is a given,
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not, because it isn't even clear that there will be any way
<br>
to define &quot;Friendly&quot; well enough. See &quot;no absolute morality&quot;, above.
