<br>
<em>&gt; Does a much better way of organization than free-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -market economy exist? I don't know but I do notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is some similarity between the free market and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>Pre-singularity, humans act as follows:
<br>
<p>So long as humans have unsatisfied wants and needs,
<br>
they have a reason to act.  In general people rank
<br>
their wants and needs according a personal internal
<br>
system, which does not need to match that of anyone
<br>
else.  They also are endowed with different natural
<br>
abilities, and locations on the Earth are endowed
<br>
with different natural resources and accumulated
<br>
manmade stuff.  
<br>
<p>Trade arises because of these differences.  If I
<br>
am physically weak but good at math, and someone
<br>
else is strong but innumerate, I can do his taxes
<br>
in return for him doing yardwork, and we are both
<br>
better off than trying to do tasks for ourselves
<br>
that we are not good at.
<br>
<p>Anything that widens the opportunities for trade
<br>
tends to make society more efficient, since
<br>
people and locales can specialize in what they
<br>
are best at relative to everyone else.
<br>
<p>Thus an economy that uses money as a trade
<br>
intermediary is more efficient than a barter
<br>
economy. In barter you must find someone who
<br>
has the right combination to do a trade.  With
<br>
money, you do what you are good at for money,
<br>
then exchange the money for what you need, but
<br>
the two transactions can be with different people.
<br>
<p>Things like large cargo ships and the internet
<br>
lower overhead for trades, widening the range
<br>
of trades that can occur.  High sales taxes and
<br>
import duties raise the overhead for trade.
<br>
<p>There is no reason to trade for items that are
<br>
in abundance for everyone (breathable air is an
<br>
example).  Items that are scarce become subject
<br>
to trade.  In the case of the Linux operating
<br>
system, making copies of the OS has become
<br>
negligible in cost.  The scarce item is programmer
<br>
time for making improvements.  Therefore the
<br>
method of openly trading my code improvements
<br>
for everyone else's works well, since I get
<br>
back many times more code improvements than if
<br>
I tried to write all the code myself.
<br>
<p>In a future with replicating automated factories,
<br>
some items will become abundant, and others will
<br>
still be scarce.  Land to put the new factories
<br>
on and factory programming time for a particular
<br>
product are examples of what might still be scarce.
<br>
<p>In a post-singularity future where everyone has
<br>
been uploaded into their personal virtual
<br>
universe, and all your wants and needs can be
<br>
satisfied by making wishes, there would be no
<br>
need for trade.  Nothing would be scarce, and
<br>
everyone would have equal ability.
