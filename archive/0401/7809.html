That's all very nice, but I don't believe all of us
<br>
are MoveOn members, and the last time I checked, this
<br>
is the SL4 mailing list, not the free speech advocacy
<br>
mailing list. How is this relevant to the Singularity
<br>
any more than the World Series is?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: It's About Free Speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dear MoveOn member,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Over the last four days, something incredible has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened.  CBS has received over 340,000 emails and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phone calls asking it to stop its censorship. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clearly a huge number of us believe that CBS's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refusal to run our Voter Fund ad, while allowing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush White House to run an advocacy ad of its own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just plain wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columnists and editorial pages are writing about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  And on Monday, FCC commissioner Michael Copps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issued a statement on it.  These folks understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this issue isn't just about our Voter Fund's ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- an ad by People for the Ethical Treatment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Animals was censored as well.  At heart, it's about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free speech.  Huge companies like CBS that control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to the publicly owned airwaves have to air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposing points of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CBS still refuses to run &quot;Child's Pay.&quot;  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together, we can increase the pressure on CBS.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the power of the Internet, we can make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that millions of people see the ad and learn about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the controversy.  As a first step, forward this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email or the original message attached below to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends.  Ask them to check out the ad at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/">http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They can also send an email to CBS and join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign at that address.  If you haven't joined the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign yet, you can sign the petition there as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next, consider taking a moment to call CBS and let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them know why you believe their refusal to run ads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this one is wrong.  If you call, please be calm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and polite -- it's not the folks who answer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phones' fault that CBS made this decision.  You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach them at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CBS Comment Line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (212) 975-3247 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (We're spreading out the calls across a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant CBS numbers, so hopefully you won't get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; busy signal.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After you've called, help us track the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls that are pouring in by going to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you have a website or blog of your own, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also help by placing a banner ad or button on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site.  This'll help push the ad to a whole new level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of prominence.  Click on the link below to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; images and the code to put on your site:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, you can contribute to the conversation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nation's editorial pages by writing a letter to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the editor.  Here are a few tips on writing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective letter:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Brevity is the soul of wit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - The key to publication is to pounce on something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific you've seen in the newspaper -- such as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story on Super Bowl advertising.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Be sure to include your name and address, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially your phone number when submitting your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letter.  Editors need to call you to verify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authorship before they can print your letter.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't print your phone number. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Your newspaper's letters page should give you an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email address or fax number to use, or you can try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this website:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://congress.org/congressorg/dbq/media/">http://congress.org/congressorg/dbq/media/</a> 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Please let us know when you've sent your letter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by going to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbsltes.html?id=2285-640333-FRGVKSw5mwfSiqMOir8.NQ">http://www.moveon.org/cbsltes.html?id=2285-640333-FRGVKSw5mwfSiqMOir8.NQ</a>
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are a few talking points you can use in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letter:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * It's about free speech. The First Amendment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean a whole lot if we're denied access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the airwaves.  CBS has a constitutional obligation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to air opposing points of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * If the White House can run an ad, other groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be allowed to also.  CBS will be airing an ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sponsored by the White House on this year's Super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bowl.  Previous ads in this series have implied that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buying drugs funds terrorism -- a much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial claim than the one &quot;Child's Pay&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * CBS just got a huge favor from the White House. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Senator John McCain said that the bill was custom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tailored to CBS and Fox, which have been lobbying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavily to be able to grow larger.  MoveOn and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups have lobbied against this bill.  Now the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; White House is allowed to run an ad, and groups like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MoveOn Voter Fund are not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * What's &quot;controversial&quot;? CBS claims that it has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy against running &quot;controversial&quot; issue ads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the only line in the whole ad is a fact:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Bush has created a $1 trillion deficit. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, according to numbers released by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-partisan Congressional Budget Office yesterday,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that number's low.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you know, this campaign is bigger than one ad. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's about free speech.  We're putting the country's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media on notice that we're not going to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; censorship lying down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sincerely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Adam, Carrie, Eli, James, Joan, Laura, Noah,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peter, Wes, and Zack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The MoveOn.org Team
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   January 27th, 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. Some of you have written in to tell us that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local CBS affiliates are willing to run the ad. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's true, and it points out CBS' hypocrisy: If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;policy&quot; under which it rejected this ad made sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the national organization, one would think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would apply to the affiliates as well.  Placing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ad nationally via affiliates would likely cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several times the $1.6 million to run it on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network.  But even if in the end CBS still refuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to broadcast the ad nationwide, we'll make sure it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets on TV in a powerful way.  Please stay tuned.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.P.S. Here's the original message:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dear friend of MoveOn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During this year's Super Bowl, you'll see ads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sponsored by beer companies, tobacco companies, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Bush White House.(1)  But you won't see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning ad in MoveOn.org Voter Fund's Bush in 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seconds ad contest.  CBS refuses to air it.(2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, the White House is on the verge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signing into law a deal which Senator John McCain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (R-AZ) says is custom-tailored for CBS and Fox,(3)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing the two networks to grow much bigger.  CBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lobbied hard for this rule change; MoveOn.org
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members across the country lobbied against it; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now our ad has been rejected while the White House
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ad will be played.  It looks an awful lot like CBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is playing politics with the right to free speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Over the last year, you've been a part of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible campaign against media consolidation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CBS's censorship demonstrates why this issue is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important: a few big media companies can effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop political speech.  If we can successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highlight CBS's unfairness in the media, we'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to push forward our FCC campaign as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To watch the ad that CBS won't air and sign our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; petition to CBS, go to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/">http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to skip the ad and just sign the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; petition, go to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbs/?id=2285-640333-FRGVKSw5mwfSiqMOir8.NQ">http://www.moveon.org/cbs/?id=2285-640333-FRGVKSw5mwfSiqMOir8.NQ</a>
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We'll deliver the petition by email directly to CBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headquarters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also may want to let your local CBS affiliate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know you're unhappy about this decision.We've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attached a list of the CBS affiliates in your state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the bottom of this email.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember, a polite, friendly call will be most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective -- just explain to them why you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CBS' decision hurts our democracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, this is bigger than just the MoveOn.org
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voter Fund.  People for the Ethical Treatment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Animals (PETA) submitted an ad that was also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejected.(4)  But this isn't even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressive-vs.-conservative issue.  The airwaves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are publicly owned, so we have a fundamental right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear viewpoints from across the ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum.  That's why we need to let CBS know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this practice of arbitrarily turning down ads that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be &quot;controversial&quot; -- especially if they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial simply because they take on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President -- just isn't right.
