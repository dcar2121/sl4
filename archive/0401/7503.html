<p>While decisions about what is moral depend entirely on context, it seems to
<br>
me that as the context is widened a direction begins to emerge.
<br>
<p>In physics, random events, according to the laws of thermodynamics, tend to
<br>
follow an arrow of time.
<br>
<p>In evolution, random mutations, according to the &quot;laws of survival&quot;, tend
<br>
toward greater organization.
<br>
<p>In game theory, as the games get more complex, non-zero sum characteristics
<br>
emerge that tend to reward those who cooperate.
<br>
<p>In any human society, by whichever arbitrary anthropocentric scale we use to
<br>
measure, we observe that stupid people appear less moral and more
<br>
intelligent people appear more moral in their actions.
<br>
<p>While I agree with you that there is no absolute morality, and that all
<br>
morality is viewed against a background of practical survival value, it
<br>
seems to me that there is an arrow of morality that begins to emerge as the
<br>
context is widened in time, number of participants, or scope of issues.
