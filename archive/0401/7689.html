Hi,
<br>
<p>I had a dream last night about the following way of increasing the odds of
<br>
human intelligence surviving the Singularity.  I'm  not surprised if it's
<br>
unoriginal, of course, but I can't think of where I've heard it before.
<br>
It's much like things in Egan's novel Diaspora, but with differences.
<br>
<p>The basic premise is that traveling faster than the speed of light may be
<br>
impossible or at least very difficult even for superintelligent AI's.
<br>
<p>The idea is to create a factory that spits out a vast number of spacefaring
<br>
modules, each of which travels very close to light speed, and each of which
<br>
contains
<br>
<p>-- a seed AI, triggered to awaken in N years and start evolving toward
<br>
friendly superintelligence
<br>
-- a simulated world for the seed AI to play in
<br>
-- a universe of virtual humans embodied in the simulated world
<br>
<p>Statistically, some percentage of these AI's will become friendly and
<br>
ultimately create a nice corner of the universe for their simulated
<br>
population.  And if the ones that evolve into bad AI's can't break the light
<br>
speed limit, then they'll have a very hard time catching up with all the
<br>
good ones to annihilate them, even if they have the desire to do so.  After
<br>
all, the good ones can keep on running ... faster and faster as they design
<br>
better and better propulsion systems ;-))
<br>
<p>Obviously, this doesn't increase the probability that a given human-instance
<br>
survives the Singularity, but it much increases the probability that *some*
<br>
human-instance corresponding to a given human (e.g. me) survives the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>Also obviously, if the bad uber-AI learns to break the light-speed limit,
<br>
then the plan may fail.  Or may not, because the good AI may figure out how
<br>
first ... or a good AI and bad AI may partition off the universe ... etc.
<br>
<p>Anyway -- it was an amusing dream ;))
<br>
<p>Does anyone know of any sci-fi that explores this specific territory?
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
