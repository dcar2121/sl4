<em>&gt; For the ten thousandth time, Darwinian evolution and

</em><br>
<p>Yes, and capitalist economics will not apply after the revolution,
<br>
comrade. We will build the new communist man, and he will be free of
<br>
these base drives you speak of. The very notion of supply and demand
<br>
driven economics is a product of the class logic of the bourgeoisie,
<br>
and with the end of the bourgeoisie and the triumph of the proletariat
<br>
we will have a new, proletarian economics based on need rather than on
<br>
base greeds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And you're telling me Ghandi isn't altruistic?
</em><br>
<p>Gandhi (please spell the Mahatma's name correctly) is 
<br>
a) dead, thus the past tense should be used.
<br>
b) had a number of human children and thirteen grandchildren, whom he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent considerable resources on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And if you have Friendly human-equivalent AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You've taken a leap. Step back. Just because we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we can build AI doesn't mean we know we can build &quot;Friendly&quot; AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Again, there are humans which are very friendly, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; humans weren't built with friendliness in mind at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't think there are many humans who are friendly the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Friendly AI&quot; has to be. A &quot;Friendly AI&quot; has to favor the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; preservation of other creatures who are not members of its line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (humans and their descendents) over its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read CFAI extermely thoroughly, (literally), then take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hammer, and pound CFAI into your head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (metaphorically, please!).
</em><br>
<p>I apologize for not having read the Gospels often enough. I realize
<br>
that if I only peruse them sufficiently, I will gain enlightenment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should clarify that: subjective morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; not only unproven, it is nowhere near certain. Neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; is objective morality. The matter is still up for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; debate. A good Friendliness design should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; compatible with either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1) I argue quite strongly that there is no objective morality. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot find answers to all &quot;moral questions&quot; by making inquiry to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some sort of moral oracle algorithm. Indeed, the very notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;morality&quot; is disputed -- you will find plenty of people who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think they have any moral obligations at all!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you can find people who think that Zeta aliens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicating with us about the giant planet that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to come careening through the solar system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopping the Earth's rotation in May 2003 (yes, May
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2003, the month that has already passed).
</em><br>
<p>I can conduct experiments to determine whether or not the earth has
<br>
stopped rotating (numerous ones in fact). I can also conduct
<br>
experiments to determine whether proposed &quot;alien signals&quot; do indeed
<br>
appear to be of intelligent origin from outside the solar system.
<br>
<p>What is the experiment I can conduct to determine if it is immoral to
<br>
eat meat? How do I determine what is the correct objective moral
<br>
position on meat eating?
