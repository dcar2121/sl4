<p>
I have to say I have found this debate over removing negative human 
<br>
emotions and such entertaining.
<br>
<p>I feel I must note that true Zen (and Taoist) masters do not banish any 
<br>
emotion.  It is an &quot;Western&quot; idea that thinks that positive and 
<br>
negative emotions/concepts are separable, but it is one side which 
<br>
defines its opposite.  Judeo-Christian beliefs have somehow instilled 
<br>
in Western society that good could exist without evil, that somehow
<br>
they are not two sides to the same coin. (No, I don't buy into the idea 
<br>
of there being actual Evil and Good forces in nature - those are 
<br>
features we apply to the egoless, faceless, consciousnessless universe 
<br>
of which we are a part).
<br>
<p>To use a simple example: on a light switch, there would be no concept 
<br>
of 'off' if 'on' didn't exist.  Sure, human emotions also involve a 
<br>
gradient, but it is the extremes upon which the gradient is based, and 
<br>
if there is only one extreme and no other, say only pleasure, you have 
<br>
nothing against which to compare it, the pleasure becomes meaningless 
<br>
without context.  Removing them gives us nothing to which we can 
<br>
compare out positive experiences. If that makes any sense :)
<br>
<p>So the debate about eliminating all suffering I think misses the point 
<br>
of how an SI could *really* help humanity.  It's not to eliminate ANY 
<br>
and ALL bad feeling, it's to eliminate *unnecessary* human suffering - 
<br>
starvation, torture, slavery, etc.  These are certainly things our 
<br>
species can do without, however, those ills should never be forgotten, 
<br>
or again we lose context to our own situation -- we would never know 
<br>
how good we have it.
