</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt;fixed in the population.  Evolution is not a pro-child puppet master that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can employ genes on one occasion and memes on another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hence my reference to the &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; passage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Genesis 1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If a meme that urges childbearing from a philosophical standpoint is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevalent over evolutionary time, and there is a gene whose heritable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect is to make the bearer more susceptible to that meme, and this

<em>&gt;gene's other effects do not have negative reproductive effects that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outweigh this (for example by making the bearer susceptible to other memes

</em><br>
<em>&gt;covariance) between the gene's heritable variation in susceptibility and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the meme-bearer's variation in actual reproductive output is large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(meaning that the gene must make people noticeably more susceptible to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meme, and people who bear the gene must have noticeably more children, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the covariance and not just the correlation is large), then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;darwinian dynamic may fix the gene in a population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's not clear why memes that particularly urge childbearing would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around reliably, over evolutionary time, in a population that did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already have an emotional urge to do so; nor is it clear that this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually happened, given that in the West, at least, many major religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tend to be somewhat down about sex.
</em><br>
<p>I believe Wei and Eliezer are referring to two different concepts; Eliezer
<br>
seems to be thinking of evolution in the &quot;strict&quot; biological sense, and Wei
<br>
seems to be thinking of evolution in a &quot;broader,&quot; more universal sense.  For
<br>
example, if we have two villages, A and B, competing for a mutual and
<br>
necessary resource, we can conceptualize A and B as organisms, and their
<br>
respective meme-pools as each organism's &quot;genes,&quot; (we will assume that
<br>
whatever genetic differences there are between A and B's members is
<br>
negligible, so far as reproductive capability goes anyway). If the existence
<br>
of a certain &quot;reproductive meme&quot; appears in B's, but not A's meme pool, and
<br>
has a significant effect on the village B's net total reproduction rate
<br>
(even small increase of only 2% or 3% per generation can make a very large
<br>
difference in the long run), then eventually village B will outpopulate A
<br>
and drive it to extinction (or A's members will be absorbed into B). In this
<br>
way memes have aided genes in the past, although only for their own
<br>
purposes. Given this, it is not surprising to find that our ancestor's meme
<br>
pool should contain exactly such &quot;reproductive memes.&quot;
<br>
<p>What is extremely important for this process to work though is that A and
<br>
B's memes cannot cross pools very easily (say, because they have different
<br>
languages). If A and B's memes can cross over villages with significant
<br>
frequency, then we will not have evolution of individual villages, but
<br>
evolution of individual memes in A and B's collective meme pool (thus the
<br>
&quot;reproductive meme,&quot; if it is to survive, must survive in A and B's
<br>
collective meme pool for reasons other than increasing its members
<br>
reproductive rate, at least so far as A and B go).
<br>
<p>Also equally important is that parents pass their memes onto their children;
<br>
in order for evolution (of villages, populations, etc.) to work, traits must
<br>
be inherited with sufficient frequency, but with an occasional variation.
<br>
Perhaps this is one reason why there seems to be the universal assumption
<br>
that one should &quot;listen to one's elders,&quot; and &quot;respect tradition.&quot;
<br>
(Incidentally, there seems to be an absolute reversal of this age-old trend
<br>
in our modern society; tradition and folk wisdom are often flagrantly
<br>
ignored, for better or worse.) Needless to say, both of these criteria have
<br>
been considerably violated as of late, breaking the link between
<br>
reproduction and memes; memes can no longer rely wholly upon &quot;group
<br>
boundaries,&quot; and must be more clever and robust now if they are to survive.
<br>
Also unlike genes (inclusive fitness not withstanding!), if memes end up
<br>
killing their host (or negatively effecting the host's reproductive ability)
<br>
this can result in a net increase for the meme!
