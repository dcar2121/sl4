</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of them.)
</em><br>
<p>This is the point of dispute.  Why would such an SI have any advantage 
<br>
whatsoever?  Just about any optimization process, I expect, would attach a 
<br>
huge instrumental utility to what we anthropomorphically call &quot;survival&quot;, 
<br>
although actually it is the continued existence of an optimization process 
<br>
with a similar utility function and as much optimization power as possible.
<br>
<p>An SI that attaches a huge *intrinsic* utility to its own survival *has no 
<br>
advantage*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;For an extremely large class of SIs, they will *all* choose to absorb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;all nearby matter.  So there is no reason to suppose that they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;need a particular desire to reproduce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is difficult to control things at long distances -- the speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light gets in the way. That provides a powerful incentive to send out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other intelligences.
</em><br>
<p>It provides a powerful incentive to create local extensions of the 
<br>
optimization process with exact copies of the local utility function 
<br>
(regardless of what that utility function is).  There would be tiny or no 
<br>
variance in the utility function, and tiny or no variance in reproduction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiny covariance between heritable properties and fitness
<br>
+ small integer number of generations
<br>
= effectively zero selection pressure
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also unclear that we'll deal with only one SI in our local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood
</em><br>
<p>It's pretty clear.  Any generic optimization process that passes the first 
<br>
filter absorbs the solar system, winner-take-all; nor can I imagine that a 
<br>
Friendly SI would permit generic optimization processes to arise and eat 
<br>
the rest of the planet.  The only way I can imagine lots of SIs arising 
<br>
from a single evolved intelligent species is if the SIs are grownup 
<br>
citizens within a Friendlyish civilization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;And finally, there is no reason to suppose that the process whereby
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;SIs absorb matter, optimize matter, or in other ways do things with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;matter, would create subregions with (a) large heritable changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;properties, that (b) correlate to large differences in the rate at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which these regions spread or transform other matter, and that (c)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;this process will continue over the thousands or millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;generations that would be required for the natural selection dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to produce optimized functional complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if we had any control over what shows up around here, we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have particularly good control over the entire reachable portion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I am talking about optimization processes *in general*, Friendly or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Almost any utility function I have ever heard proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will choose to spread across the cosmos and transform matter into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;either (1) *maximally high-fidelity copies* of the optimization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;control structure or (2) configurations that fulfill intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;utilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the only experiment we've seen done on this -- the earth -- we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found neither condition to have been satisfied.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean?  I most certainly would try to transform all available 
<br>
matter to the high purposes of life, fun, and happiness if there was any 
<br>
possible instrumental or intrinsic utility that matter could serve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;In short, under scenarios of the type I have seen discussed so far,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;replicator dynamics do not apply to SIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you keep asserting....
</em><br>
<p>Oh, come now, you've said nothing to contradict my mathematics; I think 
<br>
that applying conventional population genetics to the scenario deserves a 
<br>
bit more respect than asserting it's &quot;asserting&quot;.  It also seems that 
<br>
you've straightforwardly misunderstood the intended applicability of the 
<br>
arguments - they are intended to apply to generic paperclip-producing SIs 
<br>
we might encounter, not particularly Friendly SIs, or other SIs 
<br>
successfully created to a pattern chosen by an evolved being.
<br>
<p>People unfamiliar with the mathematics of population biology reason as if 
<br>
&quot;evolution&quot; is an all-or-nothing property, which can be deductively 
<br>
inferred from the presence of &quot;reproduction&quot;.  Actually, for there to be 
<br>
any selection pressure at all requires heritable variation in properties 
<br>
that covary with variations in reproductive success.  Evolution is not 
<br>
all-or-nothing.  The amount of selection pressure is quantitative and can 
<br>
be calculated, depending on the heritable variance, the reproductive 
<br>
variance, the correlation, the number of successive generations - and more 
<br>
complex properties in more complex population scenarios.  The amount of 
<br>
selection pressure looks to be infinitesimal for SI scenarios of the kind 
<br>
we discuss.
