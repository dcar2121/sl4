<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Combining a few issues here. I believe that strong

<em>&gt;&gt; superintelligence is possible. Furthermore, I believe that to argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the contrary is amazingly rank anthropocentrism, and should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; laughed at. Beyond that, I think full AI is possible. It's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; combination of the two that's interesting.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I agree that people who believe strong superintelligence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; impossible are memetically distant enough from Singularity-aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thought that trying to avoid offending/confusing them is pointless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not at all true.  I think it's quite arguable that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong superintelligence is impossible.  For instance, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be that physical law doesn't permit complexity above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some ceiling.  If so, it might be that the smartest possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are already very close to that limit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This might not seem very likely to you, but unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can logically rule it out, it isn't incompatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a technologically induced singularity (in the weak sense).
</em><br>
<p>I tend to think one can logically rule this one out -- strong
<br>
superintelligence seems compatible with physical law. Why? Because we
<br>
already know of ways to make components with much higher speed and
<br>
much smaller size than human neurons have. One could therefore assume
<br>
that it is possible to get at least a few orders of magnitude
<br>
improvement by moving to non-biological substrates. Even if we just
<br>
made a human who could think a few hundred million times faster, that
<br>
would be a pretty amazing improvement -- and we can be (I think)
<br>
reasonably sure that is possible.
<br>
<p>Whether or not we humans could design such a thing in such a way as to
<br>
be sure of the &quot;Friendliness&quot; of the outcome, though, seems dubious to
<br>
me at best.
