<p>In the realm of software I have spend 21 years in the money making way of doing things.  I conclude that while this way of producing and disseminating software is sometimes useful and does increase financial well-being, it is not the best way to produce really good software or have it have maximal input on human abilities and well-being.   There are various models that almost work and some number of hybrids that look at least somewhat promising.   But proprietary software is imho in trouble.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with this last.

<p>That really depends on how you define &quot;selfish&quot;.  But I probably don't want to go there.
