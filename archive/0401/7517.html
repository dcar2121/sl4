<p>Huh?  I didn't mention &quot;intelligence without personhood&quot;.  I am curious why you went there.  Ah, I see.  You seem to have jumped from what we recognize as a person to sentient being as such.  That is a bit of a leap.   What we would recognize as a person is more obviously bound by our own limitations than bound by the limitations of the sentient entity being considered.  I would suspect there are levels of intelligence so far beyond our current abilities that we would have a difficult time seeing them as a &quot;person&quot;.  But this doesn't at all mean such a being is just a mass of raw computing power.
