Perry,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, as a scientist, I find that many non-falsifiable ideas are worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paying attention to --- they can be quite inspirational conceptually....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you give an example of an idea that is not falsifiable even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle that is conceptually inspirational?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Not falsifiable even in principle&quot; is pretty strong....  It's hard for me
<br>
in practical cases to distinguish &quot;not falsifiable even in principle&quot; from
<br>
&quot;not falsifiable in the near future assuming current science is correct&quot;...
<br>
<p>Is the theory that species on Earth evolved by natural selection
<br>
falsifiable?  How about the Big Bang theory?  Historical rather than
<br>
experimental sciences are one kind of example...
<br>
<p>Another kind of example is the so-called &quot;science of complex systems&quot;, as
<br>
discussed in  many popular books.  This has never really crystallized into a
<br>
general science of complex systems -- its &quot;principles&quot; tend to be too
<br>
slippery, things like &quot;evolution and autopoiesis are the two dynamical
<br>
principles underlying complex systems&quot; -- yet its lessons have been
<br>
inspirational to many scientists...
<br>
<p>Also, the notion that consciousness collapses the wave function in quantum
<br>
physics.  Perhaps this is gobbledygook -- I quite often think so -- but it
<br>
led Wheeler to design the delayed-choice double-slit experiment, led to the
<br>
development of exotic probability theory in quantum logic, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>Or, the notion that hierarchical structures are generally useful in
<br>
cognitive systems.  Maybe this could be falsified somehow, but not plausibly
<br>
in human science -- it's too general.  Yet this kind of heuristic is really
<br>
useful in AI desing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Are you familiar with the later philosophy-of-science work by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imre Lakatos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Paul Feyerabend (two friends who did not agree with each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, but both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had interesting and deep ideas about how science is actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different in many respects from what Popper claimed).  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be curious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how you respond to their critiques of Popper's falsificationist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have heard of them but have yet to read them. I'd appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recommendations of reasonable starting points in their works.
</em><br>
<p><p>Feyerabend's classic is &quot;Against Method&quot;, a very funny as well as deep book.
<br>
&quot;A Farewell to Reason&quot; is pretty good too.
<br>
<p>&quot;For and Against Method&quot; contains a lot of correspondence between Feyerabend
<br>
and Lakatos.  But the first part of the book is a simple and systematic
<br>
exposition by Lakatos of why Popper's thinking is totally inadequate.  You
<br>
should definitely read this!
<br>
<p>Lakatos's classic is &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot;, but it deals mostly with
<br>
math.  For his views on empirical science in detail, see his &quot;The
<br>
Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes&quot;
