<em>&gt; Ben, I want to take the other side to this.  Technical competence in at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least some fields and at least a little effort to familiarize oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the background to sl1-4 is presumed on this list.
</em><br>
<p>I did not know that there was a specific background I had to familiarize
<br>
myself with; I think I am well versed in a few of the key areas usually
<br>
discussed here, but if you can be more specific I will make sure I get
<br>
myself up to speed with this background knowledge. Especially if there is
<br>
some kind of doctrine, for instance something like &quot;we intend Friendliness
<br>
to be Friendliness to humans this is a settled argument so we do not need
<br>
any more feedback or alternative ideas&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; should be), but pointing out atrocious arguments about moral philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without mincing words is not a bad thing.
</em><br>
<p>Valid argument, if and when it can be agreed that my argument was atrocious.
<br>
Actually it wasn't atrocious and it wasn't my argument. An extreme
<br>
ramification of an argument was singled out and attacked, but the theory
<br>
itself has not been touched much.
<br>
<p>You do make some claims below that I think concern the actual theory, so I
<br>
will answer these. Keep in mind I am proposing a theory. I am not here to
<br>
convince anyone, I am not here to say that it is the only way that it could
<br>
possibly be. I just tried to propose this on the mailing list where there
<br>
should be the least possible level of anthropocentrism, the maximum possible
<br>
level of ability to operate outside of human evolutionary programming and
<br>
tackle ideas as purely abstract entities. In other words, I chose to see
<br>
what the smart people thought about the theory (since I had mostly &quot;huh&quot;s
<br>
and &quot;don't know&quot;s from other lists). If it's crap, and everyone agrees on
<br>
it, then that will surely make me think twice about it, just to check if god
<br>
forbid, I am the one who is wrong.
<br>
<p>If after this reply we want to just do a raise of hands, who thinks the
<br>
theory is valid, who thinks it's crap, and not talk about it again, I think
<br>
that will be one positive outcome, since I think I did have time to put down
<br>
all the main aspects and ramifications of my proposal and I am getting
<br>
feedback.
<br>
<p>And maybe sl4 was never the place to have such discussion, maybe this topic
<br>
should have its own list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, it completely begs the question it set out to answer.  Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing how moral arguments can be objectively justified, it offered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral theory that makes judgments by counting purportedly objective
</em><br>
<p>Your point being, maximize positive qualia/minimize negative ones, is just
<br>
as good a theory as maximize pebbles, since the choice of positive/negative
<br>
qualia is arbitrary. I see where your reasoning is coming from. The only way
<br>
I can justify the choice of qualia over pebbles is that I have a particular
<br>
interface to the universe, one that goes beyond information and pattern and
<br>
yet is strictly related to it; this interface lets me experience the world
<br>
in a direct way where some things appear as self evident and completely
<br>
outside the realm of true/false, they just ARE, exist. These are qualia.
<br>
This direct experience of existing tells me what is right and what is wrong,
<br>
because the way it feels, IS beyond any reasoning, right or wrong. Outside
<br>
of the realm of qualia, it is as you say. Pebbles, furry balls, maximize
<br>
what you will, that is not morality it is just a goal that was programmed
<br>
and now is trying to be fulfilled. To me the only real moral is coupled with
<br>
qualia. But of course do we know about qualia? No. And you ask me to know
<br>
about these before I propose my argument.
<br>
Therefore I respond: I cannot give a justification for why qualia are better
<br>
than pebbles in such a way that it will be satisfying to the rigorous
<br>
reader. I know what pebbles are and they aren't worth much. I don't know
<br>
what qualia are but they feel like they are worth a lot. I wish that in the
<br>
future we will be able to find out what qualia are and how they behave, and
<br>
THEN I will give you a very good reason why they are more important than
<br>
pebbles. In the meanwhile I must appeal to _your_ direct interface to
<br>
reality and try to decrease the amount of pebbles in the universe by one,
<br>
then decrease the amount of positive qualia you will be able to experience
<br>
by one, and tell me which one is more valuable. There is no good way to
<br>
write this argument down so that all information necessary will be included.
<br>
It still requires your brain to produce your qualia and see that the
<br>
argument is right. This is why I was suggesting that the AI should have
<br>
qualia before it worries about developing its own morality; you can't write
<br>
it, you have to experience it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, his theory does not achieve objectivity of even the lesser sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; are not objective terms.
</em><br>
<p>Granted, positive and negative are subjective, but a law that minimizes
<br>
subjective negativity and maximizes subjective positivity for every possible
<br>
observer is objectively positive. No? At least that's what it's trying to
<br>
do; there may be situations in which &quot;every possible observer&quot; is not an
<br>
option. Those are the challenging situations, the hard decisions to make,
<br>
and when it would be helpful to have a theory that is not only trying to
<br>
satisfy the judge's personal interest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Unfortunately, when pressed, Metaqualia wrote that he did not have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more elaborate account of what makes a qualia positive.
</em><br>
<p>Behavioristically you can say that positive qualia create in the being the
<br>
need of getting more of the same by repeating the physical circumstances
<br>
that caused the qualia. I don't think &quot;what is a positive qualia, what is a
<br>
negative one&quot; is under discussion, hopefully we all know from our
<br>
experience, and we are also able to look at a different life form and guess
<br>
if something will feel good or bad based on what its response usually is to
<br>
certain stimuli.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of the stream of consciousness as a qualia stream is also far outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the standard usage, because the stream of consciousness includes a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things other than sense impressions.
</em><br>
<p>The two are interconnected, there is a qualia for seeing the red spot, one
<br>
for thinking &quot;hey that's an apple&quot; one for thinking this very sentence and
<br>
so forth...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; secondary effects aside, killing the most unhappy could improve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratio.  Utilitarians refined their theory to avoid such arguments, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Metaqualia presumably will too, if he is pressed.
</em><br>
<p>I have absolutely no personal gain whether the theory is accepted or not; so
<br>
I won't revise it for political reasons or to please some individual or
<br>
group. Of course it is open to revision for good reasons.
