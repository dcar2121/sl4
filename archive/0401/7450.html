<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 1.  Why do you call Singularitarianism your &quot;new religion&quot;?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; know it's basically all in jest, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, it's not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I define religion as a set of beliefs held in absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evidence or proof.  Singularitarianism fits perfectly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regardless of how much I might wish otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you should abandon it then. It is not healthy to hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views in the absence of evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Well, not totally in absence of evidence I suppose.  Regardless, my
<br>
mental health is doing just fine.  Thanks for asking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I get the impression that some in this group feel that it is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paramount importance to go off and build their Friendly AI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all other goals must be subverted to it.  One worries about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such people -- a lot.
</em><br>
<p>No, *you* worry about such people.
<br>
<p>Please do not attempt to bring silent observers into the fold by
<br>
using the word 'one' as though you were speaking for the Everyman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Myself, though, I will make a strong prediction -- which is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws of physics and the rules of math don't cease to apply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That leads me to believe that evolution doesn't stop. That further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads me to believe that nature -- bloody in tooth and claw, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some have termed it -- will simply be taken to the next level. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't fear this particularly, but it isn't consistent with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;everything is going to turn up roses&quot; viewpoint.
</em><br>
<p>You've taken one sample set, Earth, and implied from the course of
<br>
evolution on Earth that it is a *law of physics* that violent
<br>
conflict occur.
<br>
<p>That's not even tripe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it is unlikely that everything is going to suddenly be perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we've got nanotechnology and know how to build honking big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs.
</em><br>
<p>Given that almost all large-scale human conflict has been over
<br>
resources, and nanotech changes the shape of resource allocation
<br>
entirely, it seems that at the very least the nature of human
<br>
conflict must change to the point of unrecognizability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I *am* atheisitic and humanistic.  But that doesn't change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact that I have no proof, and barely any evidence, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; singularity, let alone the sysop scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I encourage you, then, to drop the meme complex. You will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happier if you base your activities on that for which you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong evidence or proof, rather than on religion, regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the flavor of religion.
</em><br>
<p>Your arrogance in this e-mail has been truly astounding, but
<br>
believing that you have any idea what constitutes happiness for me
<br>
really takes the cake.
