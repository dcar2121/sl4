<em>&gt;&gt; My current working hypothesis is that the complexity and richness of
</em><br>
qualia corresponds directly to the complexity of the algorithm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes!  this is pretty  much exactly what I meant when i called myself a
</em><br>
&quot;panpsychist&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The big question is: What is the right definition of &quot;complexity&quot; here?
</em><br>
That will only come out of a theory that crosses the experiential and
<br>
physical perspectives on mind ...
<br>
<p>I don't believe that &quot;What is the right definition of complexity&quot; is a big
<br>
question.  I think that we have a good handle on the definition of
<br>
complexity and that you are struggling with the fact that that definition
<br>
doesn't immediately pave the way to where you want to go.
<br>
<p>I'd like to, once again, toot my diversity horn.  I believe that complexity
<br>
correlates well with hard-to-reach/rare diversity.  I believe that
<br>
increasing diversity is a &quot;force&quot; in the same sense that increasing entropy
<br>
and evolution are &quot;forces&quot;.  What you refer to as negative qualia correlate
<br>
pretty well with GLOBALLY decreased diversity either directly or indirectly.
<br>
Many of your problematical positive qualia (wireheading, altering someone to
<br>
always be happy) also correlate pretty well with decreased diversity.  Why
<br>
not correlate your &quot;morality&quot; with  what seems to be an increasing quantity
<br>
in the universe?  ( Maybe there IS an absolute goal to the universe leading
<br>
to an absolute morality and we're just too primitive to see the connection
<br>
yet . . . .  :-)  I'd be interested to see if anyone could propose a moral
<br>
question that can't be reframed into a diversity question and correctly
<br>
solved.
<br>
<p>I'd also like to note that I don't believe in qualia as some mystical thing
<br>
that all humans and many animals have.  I believe that qualia are artifacts
<br>
of the systems by which we internally represent the difference between an
<br>
actual experience and our thoughts about an experience.  I would also argue
<br>
that rocks don't have qualia unless they have some sort of consciousness.
<br>
And I would point out that there is scientific evidence that seems to
<br>
support these points of view and many learned experts and philosophers who
<br>
will debate the qualia point that seems to have become the orthodoxy of this
<br>
list.
<br>
