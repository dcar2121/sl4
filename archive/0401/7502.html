<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Myself, though, I will make a strong prediction -- which is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the laws of physics and the rules of math don't cease to apply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That leads me to believe that evolution doesn't stop. That further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leads me to believe that nature -- bloody in tooth and claw, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some have termed it -- will simply be taken to the next level. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't fear this particularly, but it isn't consistent with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;everything is going to turn up roses&quot; viewpoint.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; You've taken one sample set, Earth, and implied from the course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; evolution on Earth that it is a *law of physics* that violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; conflict occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; That's not even tripe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I routinely hear arguments like that from socialists about why my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evidence for economic rules that contradict their religion must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wrong. Generally, it comes down to &quot;I will choose to believe that what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you are mentioning doesn't generalize because it violates what I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; prefer to believe.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you characterizing all who think your argument above somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacking as being (oh my!) &quot;socialists&quot;, or are you just innocently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throwing this out as one place you hear what seems to you an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogous argument with no intent to prejudice the conversation?
</em><br>
<p>It is an analogy, although it is an interesting one since economic and
<br>
evolutionary mechanisms are rather similar in that they're based on
<br>
spontaneous order. I don't in any way assume that the people in this
<br>
discussion are socialists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Evolution isn't something you can avoid. Deep down, all it says is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;you find more of that which survives and spreads itself&quot;, which is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; close to a tautology that it is damn hard to dispute. There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; moral superiority to a bacterium that minds its manners over one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; overwhelms its competition. The universe on a deep level doesn't care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which one you find more of. However, almost axiomatically, the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; one is the one you'll find in every soil sample and the first will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rare or extinct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it is not in the least clear that only what is &quot;bloody in tooth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and claw&quot; is what optimally survives.
</em><br>
<p>It is fairly clear that mere capacity for violence is not enough to
<br>
guarantee survival -- but it is also pretty clear that lack of
<br>
capacity for defense can have adverse consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, it is not clear that any sort of normal evolution or genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm applies after intelligent beings become able to directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase their intelligence and thus survivability.  Evolution gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially replaced as the engine of change.
</em><br>
<p>I very strongly disagree. The mechanism of evolution changes -- we're
<br>
no longer talking about DNA mutations, but often conscious design
<br>
choices -- but the overall effect changes not at all. For a
<br>
gedankenexperiment, consider a superintelligence that chooses to
<br>
remain in one small solar system versus one that chooses to spread
<br>
aggressively throughout a whole galaxy. If you take a quick sample at
<br>
random, which are you more likely to find? One can also imagine design
<br>
choices like using more material to build fewer intelligences
<br>
vs. using smaller amounts of material each on larger numbers of them,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So what sort of strategies does evolution favor? Quite a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them, actually, but none of them can be characterized as &quot;pacifist&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assumes evolution forever which is the point of contention.
</em><br>
<p>I can't see how evolution would stop. It seems to me that we would
<br>
continue, in the future, to find more examples of those entities that
<br>
have good survival traits and spread aggressively than those that do
<br>
not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not clear what meaning to assign to &quot;pacifist&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Choosing the avoidance of violence as a primary goal rather than as a
<br>
possible strategy towards achieving another goal, like survival and
<br>
reproduction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The struggle for resources is unlikely to end, because the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; resource you can have in any finite volume remains finite. That leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me to assume that we'll continue to see evolution take place as life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spreads through the cosmos. That, in turn, leads me to assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we'll continue to see &quot;nature bloody in tooth and claw&quot;, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perhaps it will become &quot;nature bloody in assembler and particle beam&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or other gadgetry far beyond our understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are many ways to deal with a struggle for resources that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not &quot;bloody in tooth and claw&quot; though.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, there's trade as well. However, that tends to happen between
<br>
entities with fairly balanced capabilities for violence, in
<br>
circumstances where there is significant mutal gain to be had from
<br>
trade. If what I covet is not your abilities but literally the raw
<br>
materials of which you are made, such as in the relationship between
<br>
humans and salmon....
