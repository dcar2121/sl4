<em>&gt; &gt; True, but no disproof exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Operating on the assumption that that something which may or may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be possible will happen seems imprudent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If anyone thinks they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have one, I would be very interested. And there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently no good reason I can see why Friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shouldn't be possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can -- or at least, why it wouldn't be stable. There are several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems here, including the fact that there is no absolute morality (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus no way to universally determine &quot;the good&quot;), 
</em><br>
<p>I do not see that there is any necessity for &quot;absolute&quot; morality in order to acheive Friendly AI or any necessity for a unversally determination of what is &quot;the good&quot;.   Friendliness (toward humanity) does not demand this absolute universal morality does it?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; that it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious that one could construct something far more intelligent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself and still manage to constrain its behavior effectively, that
</em><br>
<p>What I have read from Eliezer on the subject disavows any notion of constraining the behavior of the FAI explicitly.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it is not clear that a construct like this would be able to battle it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out effectively against other constructs from societies that do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct Friendly AIs (or indeed that the winner in the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be the societies that produce the meanest, baddest-assed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences rather than the friendliest -- see evolution on earth),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>An argument from evolution doesn't seem terribly germane for entities that are very much not evolved but designed and iteratively self-improved.  What exactly is meant by such a loose term as &quot;bad-ass&quot; in this context?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I find it interesting to speculate on possible constructs like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Friendly AI, but not safe to assume that they're going to be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's future. The prudent transhumanist considers survival in wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety of scenarios.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>But what do you believe is the scenario or set of scenarios that has the maximum survivability and benefit with the least amount of pain/danger of annihilation of self and species?
