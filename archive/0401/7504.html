<em>&gt;&gt; Unclear. Many people who are possessed of high IQs lack &quot;social

<em>&gt; My take on it is that what works socially is largely based on a lot
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Some of it is actually pretty straightforward and not very
<br>
ritualistic, such as figuring out that other people have independent
<br>
interests and that you have to convince them to do what you want by
<br>
appealing to those interests. However, you are right that determining
<br>
if someone in a bar is likely to sleep with you has to do with reading
<br>
stuff in body language and behavior that is pretty low level primate
<br>
ritual -- and knowing how to take advantage means, likewise, a
<br>
considerable familiarity with likely reactions to various responses.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, many people who complain that they can't get a date
<br>
are capable of mastering complicated video games that are no less (or
<br>
more) meaningless, if a bit less complicated.
