<em>&gt; From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=RE:%20What%20exactly%20is%20&quot;panpsychism&quot;?">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think David Chalmers and some other philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; have got it right already, it's called functionalism. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; structure with information-processing abilities will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate qualia, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and the qualia is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; *independent* of space-scale, time-scale, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; substrate. It could be neurons, silicon, it could be intergalactic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (if you can muster up so much energy), it could execute only 1 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; instruction per a million year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So my PDA &quot;generates qualia&quot;?  Is that the same as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or is it some other thing?   This wonderful replacement for &quot;ether&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;permeates all objects, organizations of matter/energy and all their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;known and most remotely possible interactions.  I wonder 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;good such a universally assumed something is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry about the delay, and also my wording is not very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional. It should be &quot;experiencing&quot; qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If rocks have qualia then it is to be assumed that the moral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be responsible for keeping rocks maximally happy.   &lt;sigh&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rocks don't have qualia because its information-processing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability is next to zero (under everyday circumstances). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise a PDA is not very complex either. Human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is interesting partly because we have this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflexive mechanism in our brain that allows us to monitor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own thoughts. Neuroscientists are actually trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out exactly where this is located in the brain. A lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of similar, complex mechanisms add up to create interesting qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This view (functionalism) is quite widely accepted I think, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps not exactly &quot;orthodox&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>A nice, juicy new-year's thread.... 
<br>
<p>I thought I'd throw this chart into the ring as worth a look:
<br>
<a href="http://marr.bsee.swin.edu.au/~dtl/het704/lecture6/node1.html#SECTION0001">http://marr.bsee.swin.edu.au/~dtl/het704/lecture6/node1.html#SECTION0001</a>
<br>
0000000000000000
<br>
<p>The diversity of views given in the posts surely indicates that my level
<br>
of confusion about the word panpsychism is not unusual. I'm not citing
<br>
Dr Liley's diagram as definitive....indeed, looking at the diagram I'm
<br>
not sure I'd have put panpsychism under: &quot;non-deteriministic reductive
<br>
property dualism&quot;.
<br>
<p>Yan King Yin cites functionalism. On Dr Liley's diagram it's under
<br>
&quot;supervenient non-reductive property dualism&quot;.
<br>
<p>Eeek! All these damned isms. There seems to be a pervading delusion that
<br>
somehow nature is conveniently going to cooperate by poking all it's
<br>
machinations into one or other ism box. I love philosophy and read heaps
<br>
but this aspect of it drives me nuts. I'm too much the engineer beaten
<br>
up by reality I s'pose. Like many of you I have my own qualia model or
<br>
set of beliefs as to their underpinnings. When I map my model onto Dr
<br>
Liley's chart I see aspects of it spread across the whole chart.
<br>
<p>Without broaching the extent of my possible delusions :-) my 12 layer
<br>
model traverses the quale axis, in effect. Representationalism, the
<br>
precinct of all conventional AI work is on the other othogonal axis,
<br>
which could also be called 'organisational' or 'functional'. Sorry but
<br>
functionalism doesn't do it folks - not in my model anyway. An instance
<br>
of a mind is out on the space formed between these two axes. At any one
<br>
layer on the quale axis you can say 'Yeah, it kind of looks like Xism
<br>
from this perspective'. The top layer quale axis layer hits the origin
<br>
of the axis and becomes functionalism devoid of the quale. At the
<br>
extreme bottom of the quale axis is pure baryonic matter physics. Thus
<br>
my difficulty pouring my ideas into any one philosophical bucket.
<br>
<p>The idea of panpsychism seems useful, however. Panpsychism at
<br>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/</a> depends on the usual
<br>
linguistic layer-cake - eg the definition of the word 'mind' in sentence
<br>
1. One way or another language gets in the way. Regardless of this,
<br>
aspects of the word that seem common to all definitions is 
<br>
<p>A) the notion of something universal.
<br>
B) the notion of recognising something new and fundamental.
<br>
<p>In time it may well be that we simply have to recognise formally the
<br>
evidence of our own internal life as a declaration of something
<br>
fundamental. 
<br>
<p>I'd like to throw one possible (and by no means new) candidate for this
<br>
'stuff' which has already been mentioned - almost: Entropy _change_. [
<br>
ie. &quot;That subjective experience is a fundamental property of the
<br>
universe associated with change of entropy&quot; is the kind of fundamental
<br>
statement that could be incorporated in a panpsychist view as
<br>
universal].
<br>
<p>Other candidates? Entropy level. Simple 'matter' has been suggested
<br>
elsewhere in this thread (&quot;an atom has little qualia&quot; I think it was).
<br>
Space, the void is another candidate. Some would have organisational
<br>
complexity as the 'stuff'. 
<br>
<p>These are simply an invocation that 'it is a fundamental property of all
<br>
&lt;&lt; insert choice here &gt;&gt; that in configuration X it is responsible for
<br>
the quale'. This is the invocation yearned for by Chalmers, for example.
<br>
This sort of paradigm shift seems to really stick in the throat of
<br>
orthodoxy. Me? I like to have 6 paradigm shifts before breakfast.... :-)
<br>
<p>This is how I like to think of the panpsychist view, anyway. I hope it
<br>
helps, Samantha.
<br>
<p>Happy new year to you all...
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
