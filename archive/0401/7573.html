<p>Well, as I understand it, you aren't building a &quot;new intelligence&quot; but rather have an intelligence able to iteratively improve itself.  I don't see any simple way to guesstimate the difficulty of each iteration or when/if the iterations would become too expensive to consider (or of lower priority).   In humans I note that self-improvement and improvement of tools is not a task receiving high priority relative to working toward other goals.    I am curious whether an AI would need explicit goals toward self-improvement or would naturally hit upon it as conducive to its supergoals and make it a sufficiently high priority.
