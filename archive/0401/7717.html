Hello metaqualia et al,
<br>
<p>Here are some thoughts re your positive qualia idea =)
<br>
<p>Positive Qualia Maximization
<br>
============================
<br>
<p>1.
<br>
<p>1.1 Human beings are not always hedonists because we have
<br>
emotions other than pleasure (such as guilt when commiting
<br>
adultery). Therefore it's not correct to characterize
<br>
humans as hedone maximizers.
<br>
<p>1.2. However if we broaden this perspective then we can say
<br>
humans are maximizers of &quot;positive&quot; qualia. Which is somewhat
<br>
a tautology.
<br>
<p>2.
<br>
<p>2.1. The &quot;qualia structure&quot; (QS) in our brain determines
<br>
what we desire. For example men tend to desire women with
<br>
nice teeth, hip:waist ratio, etc etc.
<br>
<p>2.2. There is individual variability in qualia structures
<br>
in the population. Some of this variability may be genetic.
<br>
<p>2.3. Over time, the evolutionary process winnows out desires
<br>
(QS's) that are detrimental. For example, desire of drugs
<br>
leads to addiction leads to no offsprings. Detrimental here
<br>
means &quot;not conducive to _continuation_of_the_lineage_&quot;.
<br>
<p>3.
<br>
<p>3.1. The pursuit of positive qualia led human beings to evolve
<br>
agriculture, industrialization, and technological progress.
<br>
<p>3.2. As a by-product of this, the environment is changed by
<br>
technologies. This in turn enables new traits to be successful,
<br>
eg the emergence of nerds in modern society. Thus the selective
<br>
pressure may change.
<br>
<p>4.
<br>
<p>4.1. In some cases it is possible for an organism to *modify*
<br>
itself. Eg wearing clothes, wearing glasses. In general humans
<br>
do this for no other reason than positive-qualia maximization.
<br>
<p>4.2. But in some of the above cases, the qualia structure of
<br>
the individual is *also* modified. Eg genital miltilation,
<br>
recreational drug use, etc.
<br>
<p>4.3. The paradoxical thing about &quot;qualia structure self-mod&quot;
<br>
is that after modification, the individual will go off a
<br>
different trajectory than other members.
<br>
<p>4.4. The intriguing thing about the post-upload world is
<br>
that virtually limitless self-mod of our qualia structure will
<br>
be available.
<br>
<p>5.
<br>
<p>5.1. We have also argued (elsewhere) that competition of
<br>
limited resource will likely continue after the singularity.
<br>
<p>5.2. Also, technology likely will *not* eliminate variability
<br>
of qualia structures in the population.
<br>
<p>5.3. Thus, the winnowing out of detrimental desires will
<br>
continue.
<br>
<p>6.
<br>
<p>6.1. Everyone, if they want lineage continuation, will
<br>
have to delete detrimental desires. If we don't do this
<br>
soon, we'll have to do it later. [Robin Henson's point]
<br>
<p>6.2. Question: will the elimination of detrimental
<br>
desires occur extremely rapidly after the advent of
<br>
uploading?
<br>
<p>6.3. We're in a situation similar to the prisoner's
<br>
dilemma, where rapid self-mod of qualia structure is the
<br>
&quot;nasty&quot; move (given our aversion to rapid changes, we'll
<br>
not be happy to make such moves unless compelled to).
<br>
<p>6.4. But as long as there is variability in the population,
<br>
competition, and changes in the enviroment, this process
<br>
may not reach stagnation. Despite rapid self-mod.
<br>
<p>Well, these are my thoughts so far... can't go further
<br>
now =)
<br>
<p>YKY
