Tommy, before getting into the details, take a minute to really think 
<br>
through the main point.  It is basic economics.  Scarcity and 
<br>
superfluity of goods do not drive exchange:  differences among 
<br>
decisionmakers about the evaluation of the desirability of bundles of 
<br>
goods, services and states of the world drives exchange.  If people 
<br>
disagree about how the solar system (I'll get to your fighting your own 
<br>
hypothetical by shifting to the galaxy in a few paragraphs) should be 
<br>
utilized, they will seek political leverage or economic property rights, 
<br>
whatever is available, to get as much of what they want as they can. 
<br>
&nbsp;Your position is that everyone can be satisfied at once.  But if some 
<br>
people have diverse preferences over the design of the entire area, 
<br>
whether those preferences spring from scientific, aesthetic, ideological 
<br>
or religious interests, no such total accommodation will be possible. 
<br>
&nbsp;The first obvious split is that there will be some conservationists who 
<br>
will argue that all the major astronomical features of the solar system 
<br>
should be conserved: no planets or moons converted to computronium.  You 
<br>
rely a great deal on virtual reality to satisfy desires, but a virtual 
<br>
model of the solar system will not satisfy them, and virtually real 
<br>
computronium is not likely to satisfy you.
<br>
<p>Virtual reality has significant limits.  You assume below it can 
<br>
substitute for scientific experiments, and it can to an extent, but do 
<br>
you really think it can substitute for all possible experiments?  Do you 
<br>
assume that come the singularity the AI will have all possible 
<br>
scientific knowledge?  That would be an extreme assumption.  If some 
<br>
experiments using a significant part of the solar system (galaxy, 
<br>
nebula, whatever) would potentially yield new information, some people 
<br>
will want to do them to the exclusion of other uses, and they will 
<br>
disagree over the design and who gets to participate.  The number of 
<br>
people with enough knowledge to take part in such debates may be small 
<br>
now, but with the singularity that number should grow rapidly.
<br>
<p>Virtual reality will not satisfy some peoples' political, religious, 
<br>
historical, and aesthetic interests.  Conservationists will want to 
<br>
conserve the real moon, not a virtually real moon. Holy men will want to 
<br>
extend the reach of God's law (whichever God they worship) in real 
<br>
space, not virtual space.  The artistic descendants of Christo will want 
<br>
to wrap the real Neptune in pink foil to make a work of art, not a 
<br>
virtual Neptune.  Anyone with a romantic streak will want a honeymoon on 
<br>
the real moon, not a virtual moon.  You will not be able to accommodate 
<br>
everyone at once.  You, personally, may find these sorts of views odd, 
<br>
sentimental, irrational, you might even be right, but it doesn't matter. 
<br>
&nbsp;If people disagree the various methods of conflict resolution (economic 
<br>
exchange, political organization, terrorism and war) will have fodder on 
<br>
which to feed.  
<br>
<p>And trying to evade these arguments by changing the scale to the galaxy 
<br>
or even the universe does not help.   Sentimental attachments of all 
<br>
kinds to our solar system will not all be assuaged by offering an artist 
<br>
or a religion another solar system.  You will create more goods to fight 
<br>
over but the goods will not be indistinguishable so the original fights 
<br>
over the original solar system will remain.

<em>&gt;&gt;amusement park--Earth's orbit will do nicely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since when is an amusement park thousands of miles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You really need to think this stuff through in more detail.  Half the 
<br>
time you make dismissive comments as if after an AI develops, all 
<br>
humanity will lose all of the sentimental and ideological habits of mind 
<br>
it has always possessed; as if everyone will be uploaded and completely 
<br>
changed.  (Notice that even Ben wants to leave a meat version.)  Then 
<br>
you turn around, as here, and forget that uploaded and augmented people 
<br>
are likely to be able to use probes and other devices as external 
<br>
sensory organs.  Once this happens entertainment facilities will be able 
<br>
to change to be much larger (and much smaller.)  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;want a few billion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;space probes to send in various directions to search
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the universe for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whatever strikes my fancy.  Yes, I know the AI(s)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will be sending their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;own, but I like control of my own data streams,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;thank you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure. Just chew up that small asteroid over there and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convert it to a hundred reconfigurable Von Neumann
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probes. Or better yet, send out a billion tiny grains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of dust with a computronium chip and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;femto-manipualtor. (something that can manipulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objects at that scale)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So you cannot think of any purposes for which a larger probe would be 
<br>
useful?  So much the worse for you.  I would like an assortment of all 
<br>
sizes, thanks.  Again the point is that once people have the capability 
<br>
to do large scale constructions themselves, there will be a billion 
<br>
schemes.  They won't all make sense to you, or anyone.  But I guarantee 
<br>
there are over a thousand people who if they could would build a full 
<br>
planet sized replica of middle earth, complete with Ents.  There will be 
<br>
thousands of full size Starships Enterprise.  There will be competitions 
<br>
to build the largest this, the most of that.  If resources are costless, 
<br>
which is your assumption in practical terms, there will not be an end to 
<br>
the building schemes.
<br>
<p>To be followed inevitably by the zoning schemes, as the first builders 
<br>
try to keep their view of near space unoccluded, and try to keep 
<br>
whatever they find tacky as far away from themselves as possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Don't forget that the singularity, while greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;increasing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;resources available to effective use, will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;greatly increase the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;capabilities of consumers to use resouces.  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;one solar system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Try the billions that are in the Milky Way without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentient life on them, not counting other galaxies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>By the time you can send a probe to Alpha Centauri, I will not only 
<br>
conceive of 20 different pieces of performance art which will each 
<br>
consume a galaxy, but I will also make arrangements to spawn a thousand 
<br>
descendents, each cross fertilized with mental attributes from people I 
<br>
admire.  If we are going out to colonize a galaxy, I'm willing to do my 
<br>
part to create the colonists.  Ben is not the only person who will want 
<br>
multiple versions of himself.  Again. if you assume costless near 
<br>
infinite resources, population can expand to match and to exceed those 
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;but billions of us.  The current me cannot make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;effective use of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;asteroid, but given affordable nanotech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;spacetravel, I could use it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for data storage, or to make a large sculpture, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;huge number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;other purposes.  Scarcity won't be just a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;food, clothing and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;shelter, as it is for many people on earth now. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Every single person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will have the capabilty to transform the solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;system to match their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dreams, except for a few billion fellow dreamers who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will stand in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;way.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The singularity will increase competition for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;resources.  What remains 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to be seen is whether that competition is economic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or political, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;violent, or lobbying the sysop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lobbying the sysop? Not in the way we think of it: any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lobbying would be done automatically by the sysop, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;petitioning required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are off the main point, but your error is similar to those above and 
<br>
thus instructive.   I assume the sysop is Friendly in something like 
<br>
Eliezer's sense.  It respects volition and attempts, other things being 
<br>
equal, to preserve our capacity for volition.  So I assume people need 
<br>
not live in a totally solipsistic virtual reality with no contact with 
<br>
the real world or with other minds than the sysop.  So in this shared, 
<br>
partially virtual and partially real world, can the members of a group 
<br>
of minds shepherded by a sysop influence the actions of that sysop? 
<br>
&nbsp;Surely yes, to an extent. If the sysop is providing you  virtual 
<br>
content for your private use, and it is friendly, your wishes will 
<br>
influence the content it gives.  Some services the sysop will provide 
<br>
not to individuals  privately but to as something shared among the 
<br>
group.  Again, the members of the group must have the abilty to 
<br>
influence what the sysop does to some extent or they are being deprived 
<br>
of volition.  And, to get back to the main point of our disagreement, if 
<br>
the sysop can be influenced to one alternative, it can be influenced to 
<br>
several and there is room for competition among members of the group to 
<br>
influence the sysop in the way each prefers.  Now what form the 
<br>
influence on the sysop will take is impossible for us to say: rational 
<br>
argument? demonstrations of political support? economic bidding?  But 
<br>
since lobbying encompasses all of these and more besides, it seems a 
<br>
perfectly good word to use.
