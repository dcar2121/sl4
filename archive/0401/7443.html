</em><br>
<p>What?  If evolution acts on you, it is through the intermediary of a gene, 
<br>
gene complex, or other heritable genetic information; at some point in the 
<br>
past, a heritable gene must have arisen which produced heritable variation 
<br>
which covaried positively with reproductive success and thereby became 
<br>
fixed in the population.  Evolution is not a pro-child puppet master that 
<br>
can employ genes on one occasion and memes on another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hence my reference to the &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; passage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Genesis 1.
</em><br>
<p>If a meme that urges childbearing from a philosophical standpoint is 
<br>
prevalent over evolutionary time, and there is a gene whose heritable 
<br>
effect is to make the bearer more susceptible to that meme, and this 
<br>
gene's other effects do not have negative reproductive effects that 
<br>
outweigh this (for example by making the bearer susceptible to other memes 
<br>
that urge celibacy), and the covariance (not the correlation, the 
<br>
covariance) between the gene's heritable variation in susceptibility and 
<br>
the meme-bearer's variation in actual reproductive output is large 
<br>
(meaning that the gene must make people noticeably more susceptible to the 
<br>
meme, and people who bear the gene must have noticeably more children, so 
<br>
that the covariance and not just the correlation is large), then the 
<br>
darwinian dynamic may fix the gene in a population.
<br>
<p>It's not clear why memes that particularly urge childbearing would be 
<br>
around reliably, over evolutionary time, in a population that did not 
<br>
already have an emotional urge to do so; nor is it clear that this has 
<br>
actually happened, given that in the West, at least, many major religions 
<br>
tend to be somewhat down about sex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think evolution was quite clever here, and came to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same conclusion that Eliezer reached: the supergoal needs philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support. It could not be provided in the genes and had to come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbiotic memes because genes can't evolve fast enough to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against parasitic memes.
</em><br>
<p>I think you mean to hypothesize that the specific information was too 
<br>
complex to arise in the genes as a natural mutation, and so arose in the 
<br>
form of philosophical susceptibility to memes in general, which in the 
<br>
ancestral environment tended to urge childbearing.
<br>
<p>But humans *do* have an urge for children, as such.  Women certainly do. 
<br>
Men are certainly fond of children once they've been born, and possibly 
<br>
(I'm not sure) experience a desire to be fathers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately for the genes, the parasitic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes are now evolving faster because of greater communications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth between non-relatives so that even the symbiotic memes can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch up.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds confused.  Sorry.
<br>
<p>The reason humans are escaping the &quot;control&quot; of evolution, in the sense 
<br>
that the effects now produced by evolved brainware frequently depart from 
<br>
the original optimization criterion of the darwinian dynamic, is that the 
<br>
darwinian dynamic cares only about who did in fact reproduce, and weights 
<br>
selection pressures by the covariance (not correlation, covariance) of 
<br>
heritable capacities with their reproductive effects *in the ancestral 
<br>
domain*.  Anything that has not yet happened is absolutely invisible to 
<br>
evolution except insofar as it covaries (not correlates) with a situation 
<br>
that our ancestors tended to already encounter.
<br>
<p>Natural selection has absolutely no foresight except by luck, and humans 
<br>
are getting steadily farther from the domain in which that luck applies. 
<br>
The situation in which humans gain control of their own source code did 
<br>
not occur ancestrally; therefore the darwinian dynamic determines that 
<br>
outcome only as a side effect of the ancestral variables it did optimize.
<br>
<p>Evolution simply didn't think of it.  Evolution didn't even try to think 
<br>
of it.  That is just not how natural selection works.  What we call 
<br>
&quot;evolution&quot; is just a statistical regularity in the record of what did in 
<br>
fact happen.
