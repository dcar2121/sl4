<em>&gt;&gt; So what sort of strategies does evolution favor? Quite a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them, actually, but none of them can be characterized as &quot;pacifist&quot;.
</em><br>

<p>If you think ours is not an extraordinarily vicious and aggressive
<br>
race, I direct you to the nearest factory farm or slaughterhouse. Most
<br>
people are fully aware of where their food comes from, and yet we (in
<br>
general) have very little compunction about continuing to eat it.
<br>
<p>By the way, I will repeat a contention I've made pretty frequently,
<br>
with a new example. There are people out there that say &quot;meat is
<br>
murder&quot;. There are people who enjoy a good steak. Which of them is
<br>
&quot;morally correct&quot;? What is the experiment we can conduct that will
<br>
answer this question?  I contend there is none, and that there is no
<br>
answer because absolute morality is an illusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aggression tends to bring self defense,
</em><br>
<p>Our race intelligently tends to stop being vicious only when self
<br>
defense is likely (as in when dealing with other humans) and tends to
<br>
be pretty brutal when dealing with life forms unable to defend
<br>
themselves effectively. Baboons can be pretty nasty creatures, but as
<br>
we've got the cages and they don't, guess who is used in who's vaccine
<br>
experiments?
<br>
<p>That's not to say, by the way, that I draw any sort of absolute
<br>
morality under which gluing the feet of geese to the bottoms of cages
<br>
and force feeding them to make their livers particularly tasty is
<br>
&quot;evil&quot;. I don't believe there is an absolute morality, so I'm not
<br>
going to pretend that it is somehow &quot;wrong&quot; to turn geese into foie
<br>
gras. However, you would be pretty much incorrect if you thought the
<br>
geese weren't pissed off about the process -- it is very obvious that
<br>
they're miserable. (One might argue if animals can suffer, but the
<br>
arguments used to claim they can't could just as easily be applied to
<br>
other people -- I'm going to stipulate that if a cat screams in pain
<br>
when you stick it with a hot iron that it is in fact suffering.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You will often see that predators have evolved strategies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid actual aggression, instead resolving disputes with a proxy aggression 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to assert dominance and territory. 
</em><br>
<p>*With each other*, since two members of the same species have nearly
<br>
the same capacity for violence. It is rare that you will see
<br>
cheetahs negotiating with herds of antelope to try to non-violently
<br>
settle their &quot;disputes&quot;.
<br>
<p>Evolution is not, however, free of aggression even within species. I
<br>
would direct you to the latest data on the behavior of our nearest
<br>
relatives, the chimps and bonobos. They're pretty nasty when they feel
<br>
they can get away with it -- as, by the way, are people. It is just
<br>
that most creatures have evolved not to get into fights they will lose
<br>
if they can help it, and thus there are fairly few intra-species
<br>
combats compared to inter-species ones.
