<em>&gt;&gt; That's like trying to get rid of gravitation. So long as there are

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, so long as you have limited resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND frequent death to free up resources
</em><br>
<p>Nope. Many species of single celled organisms don't have appreciably
<br>
limited life spans, and yet they still evolve. Besides, though, one
<br>
assumes that death will continue to be frequent in the future,
<br>
especially when less prepared entities meet more prepared ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AND multiple competing phenotypes with heritable characteristics
</em><br>
<p>As soon as you get a change of any sort, you have multiple classes of
<br>
entities competing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AND substantial variation in those characteristics
</em><br>
<p>That will arise with time. You only need a little variation at the
<br>
start -- and even the variation of experience histories of multiple
<br>
entities can be sufficient to provide for advantages
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AND substantial variation in reproductive fitness
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't need to be substantial. Even slight advantages lead to big
<br>
long term changes. Call it the &quot;compound interest effect&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AND correlation between heritable characteristics and fitness
</em><br>
<p>In the DNA world, that's crucial. In the pseudo-lamarkian world of the
<br>
future, it is unlikely to be nearly as obvious an issue. Presumably,
<br>
entities will construct descendents using design rather than blind
<br>
mutation of a blueprint.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AND this is iterated for many generations
</em><br>
<p>What are &quot;many generations&quot;? People have been able to artificially
<br>
induce astounding changes in animals in a half dozen to dozen
<br>
generations. See, for example, the Russian experiments on
<br>
domesticating wild animals during the middle of the last century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; THEN you have a noticeable amount of selection pressure
</em><br>
<p>Before we continue, might I ask you why you have such an astounding
<br>
vitriolic reaction to the idea that evolution might continue?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Natural selection feeds on variation and, in feeding on it, uses it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Feeding on it&quot;? &quot;Uses it up&quot;? I don't see that in the real world. I
<br>
see billions of species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intelligence is a vastly faster optimization process -
</em><br>
<p>Evolution doesn't require genetic material and literal inheritance to
<br>
work. Companies evolve, societies evolve, investment strategies
<br>
evolve. Intelligence will doubtless guide much of the design change of
<br>
the future -- but it will also doubtless be tempered with the
<br>
selection pressure that competition and limited resources bring. I see
<br>
no reason to expect that in this regard the future will be any
<br>
different from the present.
