<em>&gt; Sorry, I don't think that Metaqualia explained panpsychism well at all when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he quoted Hans Moravec; what you're talking about above (and in Moravec's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote) is more like some kind of &quot;quantum mysticism&quot; than panpsychism. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider myself a panpsychist at the moment, and all I mean by asserting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is that I believe all things have qualia to a certain extent. A quale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is simply &quot;what it's like to be in some state,&quot; e.g. information, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because all things, from rocks to raindrops, posses information and can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extract&quot; information from other sources (like when a rock extracts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about a surface when it collides with it), this means they must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all have qualia.
</em><br>
<p>This seems confused.  That which is &quot;what it's like to be in some state&quot; can only be relevant to an entity capable of such self-reflection.  To attribute this to all things that can be in any state whatsoever is not justified.  It is a projection of our own self-awareness universally. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, I'm definitely not asserting that rocks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;conscious&quot; or &quot;sentient&quot; by any reasonable definition of the word; they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far too simple for that, all I've asserted is that there is something it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to be a rock, and probably not much at that. Though rocks absorb all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their photons and soundwaves unfocused, unfiltered, and with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-conceived notions, they &quot;see&quot; reality in full as it truly is; I suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's a certain Taoistic virtue in that. ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Seems pretty loose and sloppy to me.   But that isn't to say I don't have more than a little attraction toward the position.  I just see no way to justify it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My current working hypothesis is that the complexity and richness of qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponds directly to the complexity of the algorithm. If you had two Paul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fidikas; myself and a &quot;Brute-Force Paul Fidika,&quot; who consisted simply of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long list of IF Percept A, Then Action B rules. If Brute-Force Paul had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough of these rules, like more than would reasonably fit into our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, and if these were carefully constructed to make Brute-Force Paul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do whatever I would do in any given situation, then we would both be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionally equivalent. HOWEVER, I believe that Brute-Force Paul would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much less qualia than I, in fact, no more qualia than a really long and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid list of switch-statements in C++, because that's &quot;all&quot; he is, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The list would probably be surprisingly short at a raw behavioral level for human beings.  &lt;g&gt;  In the above case, by construction, the automaton would have no self-awareness. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Also for the record, Searle and his &quot;information relativism&quot; doesn't like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panpsychism (see Chapter six of The Mystery of Consciousness and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange with David Chalmers therein), although all Searle can ever muster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up against it is &quot;my intuition suggests that panpsychism is a load of BS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I can't come up with even a remotely good reason as to why that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true.&quot; He doesn't actually come out and say that, but like any good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosopher rambles on and on for a few pages about nothing (poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluent-aphasiac ;-p ).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a more fruitful question may be whether a rock having qualia makes any difference or not.
