Harvey Newstrom excellently pointed out exactly how horribly observer biased
<br>
this entire discussion has been by saying and elaborating on the thought:
<br>
<em>&gt; I think it is common for everybody to see the world in terms of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they know.
</em><br>
<p>Please, take this very simple concept and apply it globally to my argument
<br>
below.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; It's gonna be fun, good and long lasting, a care-free positive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfying Happy existence, for everyone, forever, no compromise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; needed. This is not paradise, it's the status quo. AFTER, we start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about positive qualia and orgasmium and music with 459 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; octaves 500 voices, paintings with 2 billion different colors, sex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; in 98 dimensions... (sorry the monkey here just started talking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; about red bananas... I know we'll have better stuff after we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; augmented).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Suppose the case where happiness is hardwired to some constant value, let's
<br>
say orgasmic. Maybe I should experiment with tantric meditation before
<br>
making any claims, but I have a hunch that prolonged exposure to positive
<br>
qualia only desensitizes us to given positive qualia. Bathing with a golden
<br>
rubber ducky gets old, and god forbid should you ever have to go back to
<br>
using a regular rubber ducky. Whenever we fix our happiness at any certain
<br>
point, you eliminate happiness completely.
<br>
<p>Suppose the case where happiness is bounded. Whether happiness is bounded
<br>
between [neutral, happy] or [happy, orgasmic] doesn't really matter. Your
<br>
neutral point becomes your average happiness level.  It's certainly feasible
<br>
to assume that if you are bounded between [happy, orgasmic] and you get
<br>
stuck at just plain happy for a while, you may become rather desperate to
<br>
become orgasmic again. Likewise, if you are bounded between [neutral, happy]
<br>
you may notice that after being happy for a long, long time with someone
<br>
you're passionately in love with, once the relationship is over and you have
<br>
to go back to neutral hurts in the heart, quite a bit in fact. If you
<br>
suggest taking that pain away as well, I maintain that you're just fixing
<br>
our emotions at a point and removing them.
<br>
<p>Suppose the case I haven't covered, where happiness is both increasing and
<br>
unbounded. Oh no, don't you dare unhook me from that machine. And, I think
<br>
we all agreed that being hooked up to the Orgasmotron indefinitely would be
<br>
a &quot;Bad Thing&quot;(tm) for &quot;The Good of Humanity&quot;(tm).
<br>
<p>I'm pretty sure that we've decided that we don't want our FAI to experience
<br>
Pleasure/Pain. Therefore, if we are ever to hope for transhumanity, we must
<br>
eliminate Pleasure and Pain from our own race. In fact, I liken Pleasure and
<br>
Pain to producing and excreting biological waste, both are necessities for
<br>
the development and survival of biological organisms as complex as
<br>
ourselves. Experiencing Pleasure and Pain does not make us human, it
<br>
certainly is a factor in our behavior, but may I suggest that it is
<br>
collectively the biggest thorn in our side as a sentient race.

amount of negative emotions.  I suspect this is the case.  Zen masters
<br>
who have banished negative emotions from their mind are not a
<br>
counterexample, because they have in a sense stopped themselves from
<br>
emotionally engaging in the world (an interesting choice, but not
<br>
necessarily the &quot;right&quot; one).
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Excellent point! When are we human, and when are we purely algorithmic
<br>
General Intelligence? How much do we wish to change ultimately when this
<br>
Singularity comes and we have the option to make ourselves exactly as our
<br>
FAI? Do we still want to paint and feel the need to sing? Do we still want
<br>
to cry? Do we still wish to have love and loss, rather than to never have
<br>
love at all?
<br>
<p>Ben, I hope I've made it pretty clear that removal of physical aches and
<br>
pains, unfortunately under your own definition may very well destroy our
<br>
humanity:

to answer &quot;no&quot;?
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Morality has nothing to do with what are Right/Good and Wrong/Bad and has
<br>
everything to do with what is Societal Appropriate/Accepted and
<br>
Inappropriate/Unaccepted. We as noble transhumanists or singularitarians
<br>
need to be thinking a lot bigger. There can be no society! If we want to
<br>
make people live forever, we cannot preserve the burning passion for life
<br>
that is humanity today. Can you say &quot;Hello Planetmind,&quot; Earthzakharov?
<br>
<p>Am I wrong to think that a Bayesian Reasoning FAI will not think that
<br>
removing our observer-centric Pleasure/Plain Reasoning with a more rational
<br>
and mathematically sound Bayesian Reasoning decision core as the best for
<br>
humanity as well? Do we really believe that Pleasure/Pain Reasoning, which
<br>
is our biologically evolved method for decision making as humans, is
<br>
actually the absolutely most desirable for us?

Ps. META: First post! I really hope at least some of this was relevant...
