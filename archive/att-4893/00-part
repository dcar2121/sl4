I'll step up to the plate and state that wisdom and intelligence ARE
equivalent, at least insofar as they represent the same underlying
thing. If you eliminate the fluffy garbage associated with both
definitions in their pedestrian sense, you end up with two words that
really describe two different distributions and types of domain
intelligence.  It is just two different characteristic manifestations of
the same underlying machinery.  It is sort of like the old "book
smart"/"street smart" dichotomy.  Intelligence still manifests itself
quite clearly even in the absence of formal education in some field, but
it tends to look qualitatively different.

BTW, having personally known a number of "Native American Indian Chiefs"
in real life, I must say that their wisdom is mostly a mythological
construct; the egregious lack of wisdom and judgment exhibited by most
"Native Americans" should make this patently obvious.  What is
interpreted as "wisdom" is really just the New Age artsy sound of their
languages when interpreted literally rather than semantically.
