Many books are electronic readable (ebookz/warez on p2p) but not legal. 

Many people scan/ocr their books and proof read them. Feed this stuff 

into users personal assistant, make a wearable out of this and school 

is much easier.


If you put a knowledge-checker-plug-in (smart-spelling-checker) into 

normal textprocessing software you'll get info before publication. A 

personal assistant to write your thesis in 21 days, or do your homework

in a quarter of time.


I still see no problem to get the info.
