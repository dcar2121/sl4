<em>&gt; &gt; Nature is not obligated to make her problems easy enough for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of course people get quite indignant when told that a problem may

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world is not going to be inhabited by large percentages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super intelligent mathematicians and is not going to be run by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same anytime this side of the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, one possible conclusion is that arriving at a singularity as 
<br>
safely (hopefully) as possible will not be acheived by &quot;the world&quot; 
<br>
doing its business as usual with the majority of non-super 
<br>
intelligent brains.    If the goal cannot be acheived by any but the 
<br>
very few then it certainly seems obvious that they will be the ones 
<br>
who acheive it if it is done at all and that the job of the world is 
<br>
to not kill them or their progress and hopefully help them.   
<br>
<p>The task will not be easier than it is just because it would be more 
<br>
palatable to the majority if it was easier to understand and follow.  
<br>
So obviously, the trick is to make the task doable at all without 
<br>
depending on the help of the normal world politicial and business 
<br>
mechanisms more than is really (vs. by fiat) necessary.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if you want to ensure that people generally don't do stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things re the development of AGIs - including applying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inappropriate regulation - then you or someone is going to have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain things to the public and the regulators in a non-arrogant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way so that they grapple with the issue intellgently and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Or the regulators and those who support them will need to simply 
<br>
stand down in this area.  Of course these parties never ever admit 
<br>
the level of their incompetence so I am not terribly hopeful.
<br>
<p>Why assume that those capable of building a FAI should give a rat's 
<br>
ass whether the politicians understand what they are doing or not?  
<br>
Why should they have to?    I am overstating this point as 
<br>
counterbalance to the bland assumption that everyone must be 
<br>
involved, informed, and in control. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many ways to do this even if the issue involved requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least someone to possess some arcane knowledge or understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People regularly rely on experts to advise them on things that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond their generalist knowledge or understanding.  And the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful advisors are the ones that go to the greatest lengths to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help the advised to understand the issue maximally and then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advisors establish a state of trust so that the very particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits of the argument that the advised cannot understand for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves are accepted on the basis of that trust.  Then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advised can go on an make lots of good decisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  The process is actually that the adviser receives a level of 
<br>
trust/respect such that they can get on with the work with funding 
<br>
and [relatively] unmolested.   In real life the actual work is 
<br>
complex enough that the advised should certainly not know the day to 
<br>
day or even much of the detail of major challenges.   The advisers 
<br>
only need the advised to the extent of getting/keeping 
<br>
funding/resources and not being overly interefered with.   Only those 
<br>
actually capable are involved or courted beyond that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the existence of a problem that has elements that can only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood by ultra-experts is not a basis for abandoning democracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or real dialogue.  This is because such problems come up all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time in almost every aspect of modern complex human society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Most of the dialogue in democracies today about most far simpler 
<br>
technologies is not remotely &quot;real&quot;.  Or hadn't you noticed?  
<br>
<p>Processes that can't even deal with stem cell research surely will be 
<br>
utterly inadequate for AGI much less FAI.   Ironically, their very 
<br>
inadequacies are one of the motivations for building the AGI/FAI that 
<br>
some are attempting to persuade us these inadequate processes should 
<br>
control/regulate.
