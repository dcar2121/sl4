<p>Ben, you've given some interesting answers.  You have no problem giving 
<br>
only advice (although I don't know what you consider `advice') when 
<br>
your children make nonsurvival choices:  religion, school, etc..  But, 
<br>
when your children die, your position changes.  Young children do 
<br>
require training to learn how to handle their environment, but older 
<br>
children aren't still in training when they want to commit suicide.  
<br>
You may think that they're confused and later in life they will thank 
<br>
you for saving them, but you don't actually know that.  You do know is 
<br>
that your offspring, who is one of the propagators of your genes, wants 
<br>
to kill all of its genes, which would be very bad for you 
<br>
evolutionarily.
<br>
<p>Do you think it's possible that you're letting your attachment for your 
<br>
children cloud your moral judgment?  If you were in a room with a total 
<br>
stranger and he said that he would shoot himself in the head in 5 
<br>
minutes, would you in the proceeding 5 minutes try to prevent his 
<br>
suicide, and if so to what extent?
