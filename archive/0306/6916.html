Hi Eliezer and Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer said: We can discuss governance issues related to AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.  If you want to discuss Iraq, try the Extropians list. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben said: And -- Philip -- a perusal of the Extropians archives will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show you how contemporary politics tends to be an attractor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominate an e-mail list far more than anyone could possibly want it to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hence Eliezer's attitude on the subject!! 
</em><br>
<p>Points taken.  I don't want to discuss Iraq (in an open ended sort of 
<br>
way) on this list.
<br>
<p>But I think one key issue coming out of Samantha's comments (for me 
<br>
at least) is - how do you regulate in the public good if the regulator is 
<br>
captured by dubious or criminal elements.
<br>
<p>I don't subscribe to the view that that there is such a thing as monolithic 
<br>
government - you only have to look at the tension between sections of 
<br>
the US intelligence community on the one hand and the the controlling 
<br>
group in the Pentagon clustered around Rumsfelt and Wolfowitz over 
<br>
whether there really was a weapons of mass destruction threat in Iraq.
<br>
<p>The same issue applies in relation to police corruption - the one police 
<br>
force can have straight and bent individuals and straight and bent units 
<br>
operating under the same umbrella.
<br>
<p>I think it's this sort of model of the public sector as a 'mixture of forces - 
<br>
'both good and bad' that we need to have in mind when devising 
<br>
regulatory strategies for AGI.
<br>
<p>So in practical terms a key question might be: given that governments 
<br>
usually have a mixture of forces within them, could an effective AGI 
<br>
regulatory regime be put in place and how could the AGI regulator be 
<br>
kept honest and effective - despite the existence of corrupt or dubious 
<br>
forces within government?
<br>
<p>We could also ask the question:  what would be lost to the task of 
<br>
getting safe AGI up and running if we fail to harness the positive power 
<br>
of government - despite the existence of corrupt or dubious forces 
<br>
within government?
<br>
<p>There's bound to be no magic answers to these question but perhaps it 
<br>
moves us in the direction of dealing with things practically and 
<br>
realistically - and in the direction of not rejecting options with a sweep 
<br>
of the massive generalisation.
<br>
<p>Furthermore I think that dubious and corrupt forces are less strong -
<br>
even relatively weak in at least some countries.  If we won't 
<br>
ackowledge BOTH that there are dubious and corrupt forces in 
<br>
government and that there are good forces then we can't develop 
<br>
strategies that will push our countries in the direction of the latter and 
<br>
away from the former.
<br>
<p>I think this bigger picture is the setting in which we have to frame our 
<br>
governance strategies in relation to AGI.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
<br>
