</em><br>
<p>OK, this is different from what I had heard.  My psychological training is a
<br>
bit out of date.  From what I learned, savants were not thought to be using
<br>
more of their brain.  They lacked high-level analysis and interpretation
<br>
skills and could only perform perfect rote memorization.
<br>
<p>For example, I was under the impression that musical savants can't compose
<br>
music.  They can memorize the piano keyboard instantly, remember and
<br>
recognize notes perfectly, and reproduce any piece of music exactly by
<br>
playing it.  But they can't vary the composition or come up with new ones.
<br>
<p>Likewise, I thought artistic savants could reproduce the masters exactly,
<br>
paint/draw anything they see with almost photorealistic precision, but
<br>
couldn't paint something new on their own.
<br>
<p>Another problem that savants have is that they don't seem to be able to
<br>
disregard information.  They memorize and remember everything.  They repeat
<br>
everything literally and follow instructions exactly.  But they can't break
<br>
down these linguistic sentences to their intended meanings.  They can quote
<br>
anything exactly, but don't really understand it.
<br>
<p>I may be biased toward my understanding over yours, but it seems more likely
<br>
that a zap through a particular area of the brain is more likely to disrupt
<br>
specific processes rather than trigger higher-level cooperation among brain
<br>
regions.  In any case, this would be a wonderful ability to control.  If I
<br>
could bypass my higher-level thought processes and just memorize data
<br>
exactly or calculate numbers directly, it would be great.
