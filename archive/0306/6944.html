<p><em>&gt; My own view is that they are correct in their belief that this effect is

</em><br>
<p>This whole theory sounds a bit fishy to me. Savant like abilities are 
<br>
found all along the autistic spectrum, the most dramatic cases and whats
<br>
normally considered a savant are often found in those who are extremely 
<br>
autistic. But its not uncommon for 'high functioning' autistics to have 
<br>
both exceptionally high IQs, and still maintain some savant like 
<br>
abilities as well. 
<br>
<p>The belief that TMS is activating such true savant like latent abilities 
<br>
also seems unlikely. I'd think its more like the latent abilities LSD 
<br>
might activate in a person. True savant abilities seem to involve
<br>
differences in brain wiring. For example I know of a person whose 'mental
<br>
super power' has been mapped by FMRI, it turns out that this ability uses
<br>
a much larger area of his brain than it would in normal people. In turn
<br>
he has a severe deficit in the ability that would have resided in the area
<br>
taken over by the special ability. Its often these dramatic peaks and 
<br>
valleys in abilities which are seen in autism, true savants just being 
<br>
people in whom both the peaks and valleys are exceptional in size. Given
<br>
enough deep valleys in abilities and your going to do quite poorly on
<br>
IQ tests, thus the 'idiot' part of 'idiot savant'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drawing a dog is not creative.  The person remembers a dog and copies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image.  Shutting down higher functions actually makes this easier.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restricted brain doesn't see a holistic dog as much as it can see a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines and shapes at a lower level.  This level of copying is easier.
</em><br>
<p>Here I will agree. But I think such a feat of dog drawing might come just
<br>
as easily from drugs, hypnosis, meditation, or any other means of 
<br>
accessing alternate states of consciousness. Without the brain 
<br>
rewiring to accompany it, I don't believe any of these means will
<br>
give an ordinary unpracticed person the full dog drawing a ability of a
<br>
true dog drawing savant. A true dog drawing savant would do such a good 
<br>
job you'd feel the picture drooling on you.
