<em>&gt; The list appears to have fallen eerily silent. Has everyone Transcended?
</em><br>
<p>I was wondering that myself.  I joined the list about a week ago and thought
<br>
I would read a while before jumping in.  It didn't help.  :-)
<br>
<p>Anyway, here is my introduction to the list.
<br>
<p>My interests include cyber security, making things really work, verifying
<br>
that things work like we think, developing working methodologies, and
<br>
debugging processes to see where they fail.
<br>
<p>I have real-world experience running my own consulting business for the past
<br>
decade, going through a venture-capital dot-com upstart and shutdown,
<br>
working on top-secret black-ops government projects (a long time ago, no
<br>
more), and being involved in the Extropians List from the beginning.  (I was
<br>
the very first paid member back when the list was first formed in the late
<br>
1980s.)
<br>
<p>An intro to my public speaking engagements, published works, software
<br>
products I helped develop, and the like are at my website
<br>
&lt;HarveyNewstrom.com&gt;.  An intro to my consulting business is at our website
<br>
&lt;Newstaff.com&gt;.  An intro to some standard security references are at
<br>
&lt;Newstaff.info&gt;.
<br>
<p>My certifications in security are listed in my signature.  I also just took
<br>
my CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor) test.  I have an Associate's
<br>
degree in Computer Science, a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration,
<br>
and minors in Science Education, Biology, and Psychology.
<br>
<p>I started college at age 16.  After two years, I was making more money in my
<br>
part-time computer consulting job than teacher's made, so I rounded off my
<br>
computer science into the A.S. and switched my major to Business
<br>
Administration to pursue my own goals.
<br>
<p>I have been on the Extropians List since the beginning.  I was the first
<br>
paid subscriber when that list started and went off beta mode.  I have
<br>
served on the ExI Board of Directors.  I spoke at Extropy-5.  I have been an
<br>
Alcor member signed up for a decade.  I am a WTA member.  I have been an LEF
<br>
member since the 1980's and have been trying to transcend my natural
<br>
lifespan for over two decades.  I helped Natasha brainstorm Pro-Act.  I am
<br>
seriously interested in real results, and often become discouraged at how
<br>
much energy is wasted doing little.
