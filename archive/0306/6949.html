<p>
Our level one universe consists of infinitely many
<br>
of each of these items:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solar systems                   ~10^9 kilometer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;galaxies                        ~10^6 ly = 10^22 m
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhomogeneous patches            .1 x 10^9 ly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubble volumes                   84 x 10^9 ly
<br>
<p>where the quantities on the right suggest the scale of
<br>
the object.  A lightyear (ly) is ~10^16 meters.
<br>
<p>Perhaps our universe should be called Bruno, in honor
<br>
of the man &quot;whose vision of space was homogeneous,
<br>
infinite, and populated by infinitely many worlds:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a single general space, a single vast
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immensity which we may freely call Void: in it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are innumerable globes like this one on which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we live and grow; this space I declare to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infinite, since neither reason, convenience,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense-perception nor nature assign to it a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limit.&quot; [3]
<br>
<p>There are about 10^11 stars in our galaxy, and there
<br>
are about 10^12 galaxies in our Hubble volume, which
<br>
is our visible universe [4].  An inhomogeneous patch
<br>
corresponds to what Tegmark calls &quot;the largest coherent
<br>
structures astronomers have been able to identify&quot;.
<br>
Laid end to end, there are very roughly 1000 of these
<br>
patches across our Hubble volume, as in 500 to our
<br>
left and 500 to our right, and at this level &quot;the
<br>
arrangement of matter gives way to dull uniformity&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't think that we should designate either
<br>
the inhomogeneous patches (or, as Tegmark does) the
<br>
Hubble volumes, as &quot;universes&quot; because unlike solar
<br>
systems and galaxies, there are no demarcation
<br>
lines from one to the next.  Observers 20 million
<br>
light years from us see themselves at the center
<br>
of their inhomogeneous patch, and observers 20
<br>
billion light years from us see themselves at
<br>
the center of their Hubble volume.
<br>
<p>I also would prefer not to call the level 1 universe
<br>
a multiverse for the same reason.
<br>
<p><p>The shocking question is, &quot;if our universe is only
<br>
13.7 billion years old, [2] then how is it possible for
<br>
it to have a radius of about 42x10^9 ly?  How can we
<br>
possibly see that much?  Our Hubble volume should only
<br>
be 14 billion ly in radius!&quot;
<br>
<p>The answer is that light got to cross certain regions
<br>
quickly when the universe was young; these regions are
<br>
now very much further apart.  Thus this light carries
<br>
information to us about objects that are now at about
<br>
40 billion light years.  When the light left them,
<br>
however, they weren't nearly so far away.
<br>
<p>Here is a similar math problem.  A worm on the right
<br>
end of a one meter rubber rod is determined to reach
<br>
the left end of the meter rod, which is fixed at the
<br>
point zero.  But at the same instant the worm begins
<br>
to move (at one centimeter per second), the rod expands
<br>
uniformly to the right at one meter per second, carrying
<br>
the worm along with it.  Does the worm finally manage to
<br>
reach the left end of the rod?  Does the worm cross more
<br>
millimeter lines (which are moving farther apart each
<br>
second) near the beginning of his journey, or near the
<br>
end, or does it matter?
<br>
<p>Imagine that the path of each galaxy in a spacetime diagram
<br>
follows a world line.  These world lines diverge---there
<br>
are more light years between them at later times than at
<br>
earlier times.  (The galaxies inside clusters don't move
<br>
farther apart from each other over time, so by &quot;galaxies&quot;
<br>
you may wish to think of clusters of galaxies.)  These world
<br>
lines are like the millimeter lines in the math problem.
<br>
Thus when the light from the most distant galaxy we can see
<br>
began its journey, it crossed more of these worlds lines in
<br>
a given time than it is able to now.
<br>
<p>Galaxies formed about 10 billion years ago: that is, about 4
<br>
billion years after the big bang.  The matter making up our
<br>
Hubble volume was about six times smaller, so the space between
<br>
us and the theoretically furthest galaxy observable now has
<br>
enlarged by a factor of six since then [5].
<br>
<p>But we can see much further than that.  The cosmic background
<br>
radiation was emitted when the universe finally became transparent
<br>
to photons 300,000 years after the big bang, when the universe's
<br>
temperature was 3,000 degrees.  The following discussion is based
<br>
mostly on Guth, pages 182-183 [6].
<br>
<p>Suppose that we see coming towards us from opposite directions
<br>
two photons emitted at the time of transparency (300,000 AB).
<br>
They've been traveling in straight lines, and represent the
<br>
furthest distance from which information via photons can possibly
<br>
be available in this century.  These photons were 90,000,000 light
<br>
years apart at the time of emission, and so was the matter, of
<br>
course, that emitted them.  That matter is now separated by 80
<br>
billion light years!  If we call X the atom that emitted the
<br>
photon coming at us from the left, and Y the atom that emitted
<br>
the photon coming at us from the right, then the space between X
<br>
and Y has expanded from 90M ly to 80G ly, or has expanded 
<br>
approximately by a factor of one thousand.
<br>
<p>Of course, X and Y were extremely close together in the big
<br>
bang.  (The big bang was a process---there was no time zero,
<br>
though it is a handy reference point.)  The photons emitted
<br>
from X and Y were swept along in the general expansion of space,
<br>
and did not reach their maximum separation for a long time.
<br>
There had to be a point at which, despite their frantic motion
<br>
towards each other, the distance between them was neither 
<br>
increasing nor decreasing.  (Had they not been swept up, of
<br>
course, then it would have taken but 45,000,000 years for them
<br>
to cross paths in the vicinity of matter that would later form
<br>
the Earth.)
<br>
<p>What is profound about this &quot;sweeping up&quot; process is that although
<br>
from the point of view of an extremely remote galaxy that is
<br>
just now emitting photons in our direction everything is normal,
<br>
it's peculiar that the photons are nonetheless becoming further
<br>
from us each second, and if the universe is accelerating, may
<br>
never start to close the gap.  This would never occur in ordinary
<br>
special relativity: a photon emitted towards one non-accelerating
<br>
object by another always closes the gap, regardless of reference
<br>
frame.
<br>
<p>Note that the first expansion described above---from a time when
<br>
the galaxies formed (about 4 billion AB) to now---represents an
<br>
expansion by a factor of 6, whereas *this* expansion is from a
<br>
much earlier time, when everything in the universe was a thousand
<br>
times closer together than now.  (Of course, by &quot;everything&quot;,
<br>
I mean only the atoms currently residing in different galaxy
<br>
clusters.  Within clusters and within galaxies, the distance
<br>
between atoms has not increased since galaxy formation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From its own point of view, each galaxy is approximately at rest
</em><br>
with respect to the big bang.  To its inhabitants, the universe
<br>
appears to be centered on that galaxy, with all the other galaxies
<br>
flying away from it.  All the observers in all the infinitely many
<br>
galaxies have this impression.  No galaxy, nor any Hubble volume,
<br>
was formed before all the others.  Space and matter beyond 100
<br>
million light years is statistically homogenous so far as we know.
<br>
<p>(One aspect to the expanding universe is that images of remote
<br>
objects---although necessarily very dated because of the time at
<br>
which light left them---appear larger than they &quot;should&quot; be.
<br>
If we (in coming decades) get pictures of extremely remote galaxies
<br>
just after their formation, about ten billion years ago, they'll
<br>
look six times as large as they would appear if light could 
<br>
instantaneously cross from them to us now.  That's because they
<br>
were six times closer then.)
<br>
<p>If you are eager to become precisely at rest with respect to the
<br>
big bang, you can in principle do so within a factor of 100,000
<br>
or so.  If you measure the frequency of the cosmic background
<br>
radiation, you'll find it almost the same in any direction except
<br>
for the slight random residual speed of your galaxy.  You'll
<br>
obtain figures that agree to within 1 in 1000 in every direction,
<br>
so all you have to do is change your velocity by a few hundred
<br>
kilometers per second, and voila!, you are now at rest with
<br>
respect to the big bang.
<br>
<p>It does seem strange that while you find yourself precisely
<br>
at rest with respect to the big bang, another observer moving
<br>
half the speed of light relative to you in a faraway galaxy
<br>
can also determine that he is at rest with respect to the big
<br>
bang!
<br>
<p><p>Our whole universe is a single inflationary &quot;bubble&quot;.  But 
<br>
discussion of any bubble besides our own, i.e., besides our
<br>
own universe, should wait until level two.
<br>
<p>In our universe, in our bubble, there exist infinitely many
<br>
regions the size of our Hubble volume.  Within our universe,
<br>
the laws of physics are the same everywhere, and thus Tegmark
<br>
and many others assume there exist other regions, also about
<br>
80 billion light years wide, that are completely identical
<br>
to ours.  After all, QM dictates that there are only so many
<br>
states that can obtain in a volume of definite size.  The
<br>
number of possible states is so vast, however, that it's
<br>
safe to say that there is probably no volume identical to
<br>
ours closer than 10^10^118 away.  (Remarkably, it turns out
<br>
that it's unnecessary to specify whether you are
<br>
speaking of light years or meters, because in megamathematics
<br>
---my term for the study of phenomena arising in the consideration
<br>
of quite large integers---factors hardly matter at all.  Even
<br>
the base used in, for example 10^10^118, hardly matters.  If one
<br>
substituted ten billion for 10 as the bottom base, this would
<br>
only cause an increase to 10^10^119.)
<br>
<p>A cautionary note concerning identity should be made.  According
<br>
to one principle advocated as far back as Leibniz, it might be
<br>
more accurate to refer to the set of all identical Hubble volumes
<br>
when we speak of &quot;ours&quot;.  No possible observer, except for a God
<br>
who stands outside our universe and is able to specify, somehow,
<br>
a volume at random, can refer to a particular region in isolation,
<br>
because even that observer is replicated infinitely many times in
<br>
the universe.  Although an individual person may find it helpful
<br>
to go about referring to &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; when discussing future
<br>
possibilities involving his or her own future, a digression into
<br>
this interesting topic isn't relevant here.
