Hi, you wrote:
<br>
<p>HN&gt; My own view is that they are correct in their belief that this
<br>
HN&gt; effect is  mimicking a savant.  However, psychological theories of
<br>
HN&gt; savants are that they are lacking certain functions of the brain.
<br>
HN&gt; They are not more creative or more capable.
<br>
<p>Although I agree with the rest of what you wrote, I would disagree
<br>
that they are not &quot;more capable&quot;.  They are capable of certain types
<br>
of focus, as you point out, which are inhibited or interfered with by
<br>
higher-order functioning.
<br>
<p>HN&gt; By selectively shutting down certain higher functions of
<br>
HN&gt; the brain, they are tapping into more lower-order functions.  For
<br>
HN&gt; example, drawing a dog is not creative.  The person remembers a
<br>
HN&gt; dog and copies the image.  Shutting down higher functions actually
<br>
HN&gt; makes this easier.  The restricted brain doesn't see a holistic
<br>
HN&gt; dog as much as it can see a bunch of lines and shapes at a lower
<br>
HN&gt; level.  This level of copying is easier. 
<br>
<p>This point is explicitly made in the article, and expounded upon at
<br>
length in the book _Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_ (which is
<br>
an excellent guide for anybody who believes they cannot draw but would
<br>
like to).
<br>
<p>HN&gt; This is similar to the &quot;focus&quot; drugs in Vernor Vinge's &quot;A Deepness
<br>
HN&gt; in the  Sky&quot;.  It is probably also similar to any drug functions
<br>
HN&gt; that suppress the more rational centers of the brain and seem to
<br>
HN&gt; allow more creativity.  They work by suppressing parts of the
<br>
HN&gt; brain, not enhancing anything. 
<br>
<p>Some drugs probably work this way, such as Ketamine.  Others, such
<br>
as LSD, seem to function by setting off plenty of &quot;random&quot; neuron
<br>
firings, allowing unforeseen connections to be made, without
<br>
necessarily &quot;shutting down&quot; any portion of the brain.
