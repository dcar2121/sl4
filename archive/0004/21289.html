<p>
A short story, very Extropian vision, from what is probably the most
<br>
*bizarre* writer I have ever encountered.  This guy is really, really,
<br>
really strange.  I mean, we're not just talking &quot;Marching to a different
<br>
kettle of fish&quot;; we're talking about setting fire to the damn fish and
<br>
having *more* fun with the avocado.
<br>
<p>This is actually one of the most normal stories on his site.

    Your Tax Dollars At Work
I had almost managed to fall asleep after the last disturbance when the
doorbell sounded. &quot;Bloody bloody bloody bloody -&quot; I muttered, staggering
to my feet and throwing my robe over my shoulders. Couldn't they read
the notice I'd left on the door?
I brushed hair out of my eyes and peered at the low-res security
display; it was a government official of some kind. I opened the door
and saw that the notice had fallen off and had landed face down in the
corridor. I pointedly retrieved it and held it up; it said: &quot;DREAM
RECALL EXPERIMENTS. DO NOT DISTURB.&quot; The official – a woman slightly
older than me – gave me an apologetic grimace and said, &quot;Sorry to bother
you, citizen. I'm collecting taxes for the new tower project.&quot; I
brightened at this.
&quot;Please, come in. Can I get you a drink?&quot; Her grimace tightened somewhat
and I realised that she'd probably been drinking people's coffee all
day. &quot;Sorry.&quot;
&quot;That's okay. Can you spare anything for this project? We're going to
need at least five hundred dollars, and we've only collected one hundred
and fifty so far.&quot;
&quot;Oh, sure. I've got four dollars, and you can have one for however long
it takes – &quot;
&quot;We think it'll take about six months.&quot;
&quot; – great. A new tower, huh? I hadn't heard.&quot;
She came in and we sat down on the couch. &quot;The stats people said that
this region needs its own tower. The nearest one is -&quot;
&quot;- yeah, just outside the comfortable travel time. Do you have any of
those cool animated artist's impressions of what it'll look like when
it's finished?&quot;
She smiled and held out her clipboard. It played a video: &quot;Your Tax
Dollars At Work&quot;, showing the needle spire thrusting up through the
clouds and into low Earth orbit, dollars crawling up and down the
surface, laying down molecule-thick layers of environment-proof paint. I
particularly liked the way the clouds had been rendered.
I got up and went to the kitchen, where one of my dollars was sitting on
the breakfast bar. &quot;Mmm. You know, I could probably spare two dollars
for something cool like this.&quot;
She waved this aside. &quot;That'd be helpful, but there's a law against it.
No citizen shall be required to pay more than one-third of their wealth
in taxes for any given year.&quot;
&quot;Well, it'd only be for six months, right?&quot;
&quot;Financial year.&quot;
Oh, right. Financial years are only three months long. &quot;Are you sure I
couldn't.. you know... accidentally...&quot;
She gave me a stern look. &quot;I'm not going to conspire with you to break
the law.&quot;
I shrugged, picked up the domino-sized dollar and tossed it to her. She
caught it, whispered a deactivation command to it and put it into her
satchel. She stood and looked at me with her head slightly to one side.
&quot;Four dollars? How did you manage to -&quot;
&quot;I make custom footwear. I managed to blow up two dollars while
experimenting with plastic injection-molding techniques, and I was
awarded an extra dollar for each one I killed, for showing up faults in
the old ones.&quot;
&quot;I didn't know they did that.&quot;
&quot;It isn't generally known, otherwise people'd be deliberately trying to
destroy dollars all the time. And they only pay off for things that
might go wrong in the course of everyday life.&quot;
&quot;Not much chance of that happening while collecting taxes.&quot;
&quot;Are you absolutely certain that I can't – &quot;
She smiled again and shook her head. &quot;No, you can't. Stop that, or I'll
have you locked up.&quot;
