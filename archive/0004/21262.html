<p>Now, there goes someone who really loves relational databases.  If I
<br>
ever need a relational database built, this is probably the person to ask.
<br>
<p>I don't know about a Singularity or an AI, though.
<br>
<p>SQL doesn't exactly capture the full complexity of physics, life, mind,
<br>
and culture, except in the Physicist's Paradigm sense that SQL is Turing-complete.
<br>
<p>Of course, this isn't really what you're talking about, according to
<br>
FactTechnologies's video whitepaper.  You're talking about using
<br>
real-time enterprise computing systems (which are usually built on
<br>
relational databases, albeit not real-time ones) to add another layer of
<br>
organization to the company; that is, by automating the flows of
<br>
information that result in certain types of responses - even
<br>
thermostat-like feedback - you hope that certain types of higher-level
<br>
phenomena will emerge, just as a capitalist economy emerges from
<br>
selfishness, Gaia effects from DaisyWorld, brains from selfish-neuron
<br>
wiring algorithms, and so on.  Personally, I'm not sure how much
<br>
higher-level phenomena you're going to get, but it does seem worth a
<br>
shot.  An organization with real-time feedback mechanisms should at
<br>
least be more efficient than one without them, maybe substantially more
<br>
efficient.  I've had my own ideas along those lines.  But I don't think
<br>
it's enough to save the world.
<br>
<p>Even with real-time feedback mechanisms and emergent phenomena, a
<br>
corporation composed of human elements plus automation does not have the
<br>
complexity of a single human brain.  If you have an automated
<br>
corporation with hundreds of non-genius humans, they will not be able to
<br>
outthink a genius human.  Thoughts are enormous structures that exist in
<br>
a brain with a hundred billion neurons and a hundred trillion synapses;
<br>
the bandwidth between humans, in a corporation, isn't enough to expand
<br>
the class of things that are Obvious, and while it does expand the class
<br>
that's Inventable, it does so in a very limited, airy way.
<br>
<p>Maybe two or three or sixty-four nongeniuses with BCI telepathy links
<br>
(BCI:  Brain-Computer Interface) could outthink a genius, if the
<br>
interconnection bandwidth was high enough.  (Certainly, both
<br>
corporations and telepaths can do things that a genius can't; the
<br>
question I'm asking is whether they can do genius-things - invent
<br>
Newtonian physics, predict General and Special Relativity, design an AI...)
<br>
<p>Groups of humans can spread out a thought-structure over multiple
<br>
individuals, enabling the construction of mental structures far larger
<br>
than any single human is capable of.  But the elements of that structure
<br>
have to be joined by links limited to the bandwidth of human language
<br>
(admittedly with a shared reference base).  Human genius is
<br>
characterized by very dense, tightly-interconnected chains of reasoning.
<br>
&nbsp;Those genius thoughts might be Understandable by a corporation - they
<br>
are, for that matter, understandable by individuals; GEB, Q.E.D. - but
<br>
the thought processes that Invent them cannot be spread across corporations.
<br>
<p>A group of humans is simply capable of holding a larger overall
<br>
structure.  Each individual link, each individual insight, is the
<br>
product of a single individual, because the cognitive abilities that
<br>
produce those insights are neural modules and neural processes with
<br>
internal variables that just don't get shared by language.
<br>
<p>Imagine a thousand Gary Kasparovs trying to beat Deep Thought.  If they
<br>
were all in the same room thinking about it out loud, that's analogous
<br>
to a modern corporation.  If a computer system projects a couple of
<br>
moves ahead and assigns various positions to each separate Kasparov,
<br>
then that's a FactSystem corporation - or at least, that's what they're
<br>
aiming for.  Even so, though, the Kasparovs won't be able to share
<br>
insights, chess-perceptions, about each of the hundred boards assigned. 
<br>
They'll need to have the same insights over and over.  They won't be
<br>
able to take an insight on one board and apply it to a second, or invent
<br>
forks that they'd have to look at two boards at once to see.  And when
<br>
it comes time to chose the best move, each one will have to give some
<br>
kind of numeric rating to the chessboard in the absence of any knowledge
<br>
about what the other possibilities are like.  They won't be able to
<br>
match a BCI-telepathic team, and a BCI group can't match a
<br>
general-intelligent AI with a chess cortex.
<br>
<p>This is essentially the same objection I have to Marc Stiegler's
<br>
characterization of the Earthweb as a superintelligence, or Robin
<br>
Hanson's characterization of modern corporations as being in the same
<br>
league as hardware intelligence enhancement.  (Greg A, if you
<br>
haven't read a book called _Earthweb_ by Marc Stiegler, I think you'd
<br>
really enjoy it.)
<br>
<p>If humans are Legos, then corporations represent the class of structures
<br>
that can be built with Legos; automated corporations are the class of
<br>
structures that can be built with motorized Legos; hardware intelligence
<br>
enhancement is the class of structures that can be built with modern
<br>
manufacturing; and AI is nanotechnology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrain that growth to such an extent that it doesn't dilute our essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity?
</em><br>
<p>Just thinking about the Singularity for a few years has severely diluted
<br>
my &quot;essential humanity&quot;, or at least what most people would cite as
<br>
&quot;essential humanity&quot; - my fear of nonexistence, my emotional attachment
<br>
to various parts of my personality and cognitive architecture, my
<br>
allegiance to the human race (though I'm still fond of it), that sort of thing.
<br>
<p>Can't we just admit that we don't even know which parts of ourselves are
<br>
valuable, and keep an open mind about which parts we might want to throw
<br>
away?  Right now, it's all theory.  Once we're faced with the reality,
<br>
our perspectives will change.
<br>
<p>I certainly don't have the moral (or engineering) authority to chide
<br>
anyone about remaining attached to their humanity, but the correct goal
<br>
from that perspective is to ensure that each individual has the option
<br>
of remaining human.  Not to ensure that everyone is similarly restrained.
