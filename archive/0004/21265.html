You know, no matter how much time I spend thinking about the
<br>
Singularity, suggestions like these still give me the chills.

</em><br>
<p>Since at least 1950, &quot;hemispherectomy&quot; (the surgical removal of half the
<br>
brain) has been used in children for hemiplegia and intractable epilepsy.
<br>
<em>&gt;From <a href="http://www.c3.hu/~mavideg/jns/642696june1.html">http://www.c3.hu/~mavideg/jns/642696june1.html</a> &quot;The operation
</em><br>
eliminated or reduced seizures in 70% to 80% of patients. In the majority of
<br>
reported cases, surgery improved the patients' development, led to increased
<br>
intelligence quotient scores, and often eliminated profoundly negative
<br>
behavior.  Perioperative mortality rates were 5% to 6% in case series from
<br>
1950 to 1970.[58] Long-term morbidity and mortality, however, gave rise to a
<br>
much greater concern.&quot;
<br>
<p>So I got to thinking: What if Calvin is right, and our cortex has lots of
<br>
small areas that are independently active and compete with each other to
<br>
produce the overall thought?  What if we could cut out a square inch of
<br>
cortex (containing many complete active-areas) and implant it in another
<br>
brain?  That would leave the donor almost unchanged... but the recipient
<br>
would have access to some of the thoughts and memories, and maybe even
<br>
patterns of thought, of the donor, if the thoughts were strong enough to
<br>
spread through the rest of the brain and become conscious.  What if I cloned
<br>
myself and gave the infant clone a square inch of my brain?  Would the
<br>
thought patterns propagate and train the new brain?  It wouldn't be me, of
<br>
course, but mentally it might be about as close as an identical twin.  (I'd
<br>
rate that about 15-20% on the scale of &quot;me&quot;-ness.)  This is an experiment
<br>
that in theory we could do within ten years.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't think I was still fully &quot;me&quot;* if half my brain were destroyed.
<br>
I'd be a different person with some of the same memories and thought
<br>
patterns.  Still, if I had to choose between losing half a brain and being
<br>
fully dead, I'd choose the half-brain option as long as my function wasn't
<br>
degraded too much (e.g. IQ not below 85).
<br>
<p>* I view identity on a continuum.  I'm mostly still &quot;me&quot; if I'm drunk or
<br>
sleep-deprived.  Ten years from now I'll be maybe 75% the same &quot;me&quot;.  A good
<br>
upload should preserve 90% or better.  People who use cocaine to help them
<br>
work already accept more changes, for less benefit, than uploading will
<br>
likely entail.
<br>
<p>My consciousness restarts every time I wake up.  Consciousness is not nearly
<br>
as important as it would like us to think it is.  It's simply one
<br>
significant feature of my brain--it tells me what I'm thinking, just as
<br>
emotion tells me how I'm feeling.  My guess is that any running system(s)
<br>
that had my memories and thought patterns and circuitry (physical or
<br>
simulated) would have &quot;my&quot; consciousness.  (This email can be copied to many
<br>
computers.  So can a mind.  Which of you is reading the &quot;real&quot; email?  It's
<br>
a stupid question.)
