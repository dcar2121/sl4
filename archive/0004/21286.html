<p>
Watching Jean-Michel Jarre's 'Egypt 2000' Millenium Concert last night,
<br>
I was struck by a spark of hope.  Here was a guy with some obviously
<br>
transhuman sensibilities staging a show filled with flames, explosions,
<br>
and coherent radiation beams, classical weapons technology, but used
<br>
purely for fun and profit.  Which is nice, but more interestingly,
<br>
the most recent of the three, the laser, is actually very difficult
<br>
to use as a weapon, and has seen much earlier adoption as an engine
<br>
of communication, computing, healing, and more recently, creation.
<br>
<p>Is this a trend?  As we focus more on sophisticated short range,
<br>
low energy applications of our ideas in favour of the robustness,
<br>
range, and brute power required to destroy our perceived enemies,
<br>
will bio and nano technologies and the ultratechnologies they
<br>
enable have their earliest impact on computers and the internet,
<br>
then medicine and industry, with dangerously destructive options
<br>
arriving later, when defensive techniques are already established?
<br>
<p>Not to be relied on, obviously, but it seems at least feasible
<br>
that as we investigate ever smaller and more fundamental universal
<br>
forces it actually becomes ever easier to create than to destroy..
