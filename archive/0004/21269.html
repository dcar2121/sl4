<p>
OK.
<br>
<p>I just tried to compose a message to sum the Big Idea up neatly, and after
<br>
about 1200 words I realized that it was ridiculous to think that I could
<br>
just rattle off a short version of it unless you all had the same background
<br>
as me.
<br>
<p>That means the explanation is going to be long... REALLY long (in the
<br>
Yudkowsky sense... just kidding, Eliezer). It also means that it's going to
<br>
be necessary if we're going to get the world interested at all. You all have
<br>
to understand it as well as I do for it to sound like anything other than
<br>
more-of-the-same .com marketing hype.
<br>
<p>To me, if I'm right, this breakthrough represents the discovery of a New
<br>
World in much the same way the Americas did in 15th century -- it's awfully
<br>
big to miss, we won't be able to imagine why we didn't come across it
<br>
sooner, and it takes one crazy dude to be that far out there in the first
<br>
place. :)
<br>
<p>On a more practical level, it's like the discovery of the America's because
<br>
there's plenty of room for everyone who wants to come over, and
<br>
near-limitless wealth to be had by those with the courage to do so.
<br>
<p>I was in a big rush to get the idea out because this seems like the kind of
<br>
thing that more than one person &quot;discovers&quot; at approximately the same time,
<br>
and I don't want anyone trying to control this knowledge. Attempting to
<br>
patent this idea would be impractical, anyway, and it would probably array
<br>
the entire existing computing industry against us. Better to point, yell,
<br>
and run as fast as we can to stake out the best spots ahead of the crowd.
<br>
<p>I'll be busy the next couple days, but part of what I have to do is get most
<br>
of the company caught up with what I'm talking about. To do that, I have to
<br>
tell the whole story from the beginning, and I'll be prepared to share it
<br>
with you guys when I'm done explaining it inside corporate walls.
<br>
<p>To avoid the speculation getting too wild, this really isn't all that
<br>
amazing in the sense of anything magical or other-worldly. Just a semi-novel
<br>
insight and some practical applications of it.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, the impact on society should be extraordinary.
<br>
<p>Try not to pay too much attention to the marketing we'll be spouting this
<br>
week. It's hyper-hype so that we can be perceived as a signal against
<br>
background industry marketing noise. It will mostly be designed for
<br>
linguistic shock effect to pave the way for a new perspective using what
<br>
I've started to call &quot;assault memes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Wish me luck, gentlemen. I'll get back to you soon.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>Greg A
<br>
<p><p>P.S. If anyone objects to me discussing this topic here, I am happy to move
<br>
it to a private email list forum. Let me know.

<em>&gt; &gt; The key element that I think you're missing, Eliezer, (and which I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blame you for, since it's intentionally withheld in the preliminary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; announcement) is the (relatively) novel concept (at 30 hours old) of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; semantic network. This only makes sense if you read this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FYI:  &quot;Semantic network&quot; is a term going back for forty or fifty years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of classical AI.  It has a long and hated history.  If you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something different, I *strongly* advise you, from a PR perspective, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pick a different name.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particularly the mathematical concept of &quot;projection.&quot; Dr. Codd noticed
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in 1969. I noticed it in 1999. I understood it about 10 days ago, and I
</em><br>
came
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; across the Codd paper (while search for the name of SQL's inventor and
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; date of origin) on Friday morning. That killed the last of my doubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, either I have not understood your proposed use of &quot;projections&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or I have failed to notice projections entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My non-linguistic math sucks. I'm sure you guys can see much bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implications after you see the link I'm talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The essence of my idea (quickly maturing into a theory) is that the Codd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concept of projection is/(can be) equivalent to semantic meaning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact-based computation involving human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What kind of meaning?  I use an RNUI-like scale to describe what I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call &quot;representational bindings&quot; or &quot;semantic bindings&quot;, i.e. the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to which a model represents reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Sensory binding.  This occurs when elements of the model covary with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements of the external world (from a programming perspective, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they covary with incoming data from a sensory device).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Predictive binding.  This occurs when you can use the model to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict what the incoming data will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Decisive binding.  This occurs when you can use the model to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence external reality; that is, when you can select, of three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible actions, the one which will result in the most desired result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as incoming data).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Specifiable binding.  (Or &quot;manipulative&quot; binding.)  This occurs when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can start with a desired external result, and notice/invent an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action or actions which will lead to that result (&quot;external result&quot; ==
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoming data from a sensory device).  The three sublevels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifiable binding are qualitative, when the desired outcome is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected from the members of a finite set (more or less the same as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisive binding); quantitative, when the desired outcome is an integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or real number (thus, blind search through the space of possible actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could never suffice to reach the desired outcome); and structural - that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, the specified result may consist of multiple interconnected
</em><br>
subelements.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If an intelligence has a representation with a structural specifiable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binding, fully integrated with the goal system, and hierarchically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrated so that sub-elements of a specifiable system can be treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as subproblems in another specifiable prepresentation, then this is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we call &quot;intelligent design&quot;.  That is, this is how we get from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem of &quot;high-speed travel&quot; to visualizing a bicycle to designing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wheels and gears and all the little pieces to machining the parts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [NOTE: There are lots of interesting fallout implications here, but I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trying to excite the world about the business implications first before
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; figure these out. SL4 is a suitably rarefied atmosphere for exploration
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the deeper meaning in an attention-secure arena.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By which I assume you mean that none of your business rivals are paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention, although they easily could be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What THAT means, is that a team of links humans sharing fact-based data
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perform fact-based computations much better than a pure machine will for
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foreseeable future (i.e. the next 30 days).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Translate, translate...  &quot;If you can use humans as primitive operations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can build a 'computer program' that does cool stuff.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Welcome to the New World of Computing, everyone. Check what I'm saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Follow the links. Decide whether I'm crazy or genius or both, and let me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I followed the link.  You've still lost me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Essential humanity&quot; means what's left over as uniquely human here in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; New World. I'm hoping it will largely be the good stuff, since the good
</em><br>
guys
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have built the first cybersocial weapon with potentially planetary scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effect. I think we can stay ahead of the bad guys for long enough to
</em><br>
make it
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not matter, mainly because the bad guys won't WANT to understand what
</em><br>
we're
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill Joy wants to understand.  It might work for a year, but not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade.  And you'd be amazed at what people are willing to understand if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it'll make them a buck.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's a &quot;cybersocial weapon&quot;?  Is that like a collaborative filtering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism designed to track movements in opinion space and steer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participants to desired foci?  (I.e., is that like a massive Web-rating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system designed to track which pages are effective at converting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrats to Republicans and steer Democrats to those pages?)  I tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view that sort of thing as morally unacceptable except as a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence of a morally acceptable system (i.e. a web-rating system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which steers people to opinion-changing pages, regardless of creed).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If that's not good news to this group (particularly in light of Mr. Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Joy's recent Wired article), I don't know what will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; REQUEST FOR INACTION: Although this idea is revolutionary, I would very
</em><br>
much
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appreciate it if nobody took the perceived connection outside this list
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now. I am declaring this idea humanity's first un-patent (i.e.
</em><br>
uncontrolled
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea), in the tradition of copyleft, and Fact Technologies doesn't need
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get involved in expensive legal games at this hypercritical early stage
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the process. I'm counting on you guys for support in effecting this
</em><br>
social
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explosion, so please prove to me that my decision to trust you was
</em><br>
valid.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, please be aware that SL4 is an uncontrolled list.  I do not approve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subscriptions, as I do with the Singularitarian list.  Anyone could be
</em><br>
listening.
