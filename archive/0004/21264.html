<p>FYI:  &quot;Semantic network&quot; is a term going back for forty or fifty years

of classical AI.  It has a long and hated history.  If you mean

something different, I *strongly* advise you, from a PR perspective, to

pick a different name.

<em>&gt; particularly the mathematical concept of &quot;projection.&quot; Dr. Codd noticed it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 1969. I noticed it in 1999. I understood it about 10 days ago, and I came

</em><br>
<em>&gt; date of origin) on Friday morning. That killed the last of my doubt.
</em><br>
<p>Well, either I have not understood your proposed use of &quot;projections&quot;,
<br>
or I have failed to notice projections entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My non-linguistic math sucks. I'm sure you guys can see much bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications after you see the link I'm talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The essence of my idea (quickly maturing into a theory) is that the Codd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of projection is/(can be) equivalent to semantic meaning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact-based computation involving human beings.
</em><br>
<p>What kind of meaning?  I use an RNUI-like scale to describe what I would
<br>
call &quot;representational bindings&quot; or &quot;semantic bindings&quot;, i.e. the degree
<br>
to which a model represents reality.
<br>
<p>1)  Sensory binding.  This occurs when elements of the model covary with
<br>
elements of the external world (from a programming perspective, when
<br>
they covary with incoming data from a sensory device).
<br>
<p>2)  Predictive binding.  This occurs when you can use the model to
<br>
predict what the incoming data will be.
<br>
<p>3)  Decisive binding.  This occurs when you can use the model to
<br>
influence external reality; that is, when you can select, of three
<br>
possible actions, the one which will result in the most desired result
<br>
(as incoming data).
<br>
<p>4)  Specifiable binding.  (Or &quot;manipulative&quot; binding.)  This occurs when
<br>
you can start with a desired external result, and notice/invent an
<br>
action or actions which will lead to that result (&quot;external result&quot; ==
<br>
incoming data from a sensory device).  The three sublevels of
<br>
specifiable binding are qualitative, when the desired outcome is
<br>
selected from the members of a finite set (more or less the same as a
<br>
decisive binding); quantitative, when the desired outcome is an integer
<br>
or real number (thus, blind search through the space of possible actions
<br>
could never suffice to reach the desired outcome); and structural - that
<br>
is, the specified result may consist of multiple interconnected subelements.
<br>
<p>If an intelligence has a representation with a structural specifiable
<br>
binding, fully integrated with the goal system, and hierarchically
<br>
integrated so that sub-elements of a specifiable system can be treated
<br>
as subproblems in another specifiable prepresentation, then this is what
<br>
we call &quot;intelligent design&quot;.  That is, this is how we get from the
<br>
problem of &quot;high-speed travel&quot; to visualizing a bicycle to designing
<br>
wheels and gears and all the little pieces to machining the parts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [NOTE: There are lots of interesting fallout implications here, but I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to excite the world about the business implications first before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure these out. SL4 is a suitably rarefied atmosphere for exploration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deeper meaning in an attention-secure arena.]
</em><br>
<p>By which I assume you mean that none of your business rivals are paying
<br>
attention, although they easily could be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What THAT means, is that a team of links humans sharing fact-based data can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform fact-based computations much better than a pure machine will for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeable future (i.e. the next 30 days).
</em><br>
<p>Translate, translate...  &quot;If you can use humans as primitive operations,
<br>
you can build a 'computer program' that does cool stuff.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Welcome to the New World of Computing, everyone. Check what I'm saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Follow the links. Decide whether I'm crazy or genius or both, and let me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know.
</em><br>
<p>I followed the link.  You've still lost me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Essential humanity&quot; means what's left over as uniquely human here in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New World. I'm hoping it will largely be the good stuff, since the good guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have built the first cybersocial weapon with potentially planetary scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect. I think we can stay ahead of the bad guys for long enough to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not matter, mainly because the bad guys won't WANT to understand what we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about.
</em><br>
<p>Bill Joy wants to understand.  It might work for a year, but not a
<br>
decade.  And you'd be amazed at what people are willing to understand if
<br>
it'll make them a buck.
<br>
<p>What's a &quot;cybersocial weapon&quot;?  Is that like a collaborative filtering
<br>
mechanism designed to track movements in opinion space and steer
<br>
participants to desired foci?  (I.e., is that like a massive Web-rating
<br>
system designed to track which pages are effective at converting
<br>
Democrats to Republicans and steer Democrats to those pages?)  I tend to
<br>
view that sort of thing as morally unacceptable except as a special
<br>
consequence of a morally acceptable system (i.e. a web-rating system
<br>
which steers people to opinion-changing pages, regardless of creed).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that's not good news to this group (particularly in light of Mr. Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joy's recent Wired article), I don't know what will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; REQUEST FOR INACTION: Although this idea is revolutionary, I would very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate it if nobody took the perceived connection outside this list for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now. I am declaring this idea humanity's first un-patent (i.e. uncontrolled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea), in the tradition of copyleft, and Fact Technologies doesn't need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get involved in expensive legal games at this hypercritical early stage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the process. I'm counting on you guys for support in effecting this social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explosion, so please prove to me that my decision to trust you was valid.
</em><br>
<p>Um, please be aware that SL4 is an uncontrolled list.  I do not approve
<br>
subscriptions, as I do with the Singularitarian list.  Anyone could be listening.
