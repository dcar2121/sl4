</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>So how do you really feel about NLP, Eliezer?
<br>
<p>I think this was a perfectly valid question not only because I am delighted that
<br>
I now know of at least two other people on this list that are aware of NLP, but
<br>
also because I have had many thoughts on this topic and its relationship to a
<br>
general AI as well.
<br>
<p>First of all, NLP is but one of many models of human psychology. We already know
<br>
that anthromorphisizing a SAI/GAI doesn't make sense, but I am certain that we
<br>
can at least make comparisons, and maybe through a scientific method increase
<br>
our understanding of both human and non-human AI. I am also curious to know what
<br>
the other human psychology models are and compare them to a new AI.
<br>
<p>I am not an NLP trainer, but I know one, and I do know, or used to know, some
<br>
basic techniques and how to apply them. Indeed, NLP is not a science in the way
<br>
of formulating theorems and proofs, et al. NLP is a set of techniques that
<br>
enable effective communication between humans. Neuro == brain, Linguistic ==
<br>
spoken language, and Programming usually involves well-known techniques such as
<br>
hypnosis. Clever marketing is absolutely correct, because if the marketing was
<br>
not clever, it would not be a very effective technique. The most well known and
<br>
financially successful NLPer is of course Tony Robbins. Do a web search for NLP
<br>
and/or Tony Robbins, you will find plenty of ammunition against NLP and for NLP.
<br>
Especially the ethics behind its use and practice.
<br>
<p>Let's say that the path to superhuman AI lies in enhancing current human
<br>
intelligence. The SAI will probably still have human feelings, but more
<br>
&quot;enhanced&quot;, or &quot;faster&quot;. Would persuasion techniques become more difficult to
<br>
implement? Would it be more difficult, even for a SAI,  to program an agent
<br>
surfing the web trying to learn from all published human knowledge, but it reads
<br>
mostly spam and advertisements?
<br>
<p>What about an unfriendly AI that learns all about NLP and uses it to convince
<br>
humans, that it is friendly?
<br>
<p>To answer Jordan's original question, I believe that NLP and any other human
<br>
psychological model is very relevant to an AI model, although at a higher level,
<br>
or &quot;chunk&quot; in NLP-speak. If we send a stream of random data into an AI's
<br>
processing cortex, effectively blinding or deafening or causing a hallucination
<br>
without ver knowledge, would we be able to predict its behaviour? Would we be
<br>
able to fix it?
<br>
<p>I think the crux of the matter is that for one sentient being to communicate
<br>
with another, the messages and signals being transmitted will be richer and open
<br>
to different interpretation at different levels of communication proportional to
<br>
the intelligence of the beings. One of my favourite metaphors for God worship my
<br>
father told me, &quot;if there is a God and He's pointing towards enlightenment, why
<br>
would we be sucking on his finger?&quot; Understanding how humans think at the higher
<br>
level is important if we are to dumb-down our messages to a sub-human AI, and
<br>
the AI needs to learn how to get smarter and dumb-down vis messages for us.
