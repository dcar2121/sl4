<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think this was a perfectly valid question not only because I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delighted that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I now know of at least two other people on this list that are aware 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of NLP, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also because I have had many thoughts on this topic and its relationship to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general AI as well.
</em><br>
<p><p>The Skeptic's Dictionary has this entry:
<br>
<p><a href="http://skepdic.com/neurolin.html">http://skepdic.com/neurolin.html</a>
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;First of all, NLP is but one of many models of human psychology. We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that anthromorphisizing a SAI/GAI doesn't make sense, but I am certain that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can at least make comparisons, and maybe through a scientific method increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our understanding of both human and non-human AI. I am also curious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the other human psychology models are and compare them to a new AI.
</em><br>
<p>Calling it just another &quot;model&quot; out of many is disingenuous, similar 
<br>
to the claims by apologists of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; and some of the 
<br>
kookier varieties of academic multiculturalists who speak of many 
<br>
&quot;ways of knowing&quot; -- as if all claims are equally valid.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I am not an NLP trainer, but I know one, and I do know, or used to know, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basic techniques and how to apply them. Indeed, NLP is not a science 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of formulating theorems and proofs, et al. NLP is a set of techniques that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enable effective communication between humans. Neuro == brain, Linguistic ==
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spoken language, and Programming usually involves well-known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;techniques such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypnosis. [...]
</em><br>
<p>Aah, now you're getting into testable claims -- whether NLP's 
<br>
&quot;techniques&quot; do the many fabulous things they're claimed to do. The 
<br>
evidence is not particularly encouraging.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let's say that the path to superhuman AI lies in enhancing current human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence. The SAI will probably still have human feelings, but more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;enhanced&quot;, or &quot;faster&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Err ... an SAI would be &quot;enhanced&quot; because it was created by enhanced 
<br>
humans? I thought the point of enhanced humans (back when it appeared 
<br>
this was necessary -- Eliezer disagrees now, I'm rather ambivalent) 
<br>
was to get to SAI (and hence the Singularity) faster. An SAI doesn't 
<br>
automatically take on the properties of its creators; to claim 
<br>
otherwise is an anthropomorphism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Would persuasion techniques become more difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implement? Would it be more difficult, even for a SAI,  to program an agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surfing the web trying to learn from all published human knowledge, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it reads
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mostly spam and advertisements?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What about an unfriendly AI that learns all about NLP and uses it to convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans, that it is friendly?
</em><br>
<p>I think we don't have to worry about that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;To answer Jordan's original question, I believe that NLP and any other human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychological model is very relevant to an AI model, although at a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher level,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or &quot;chunk&quot; in NLP-speak. If we send a stream of random data into an AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processing cortex, effectively blinding or deafening or causing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hallucination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without ver knowledge, would we be able to predict its behaviour? Would we be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to fix it?
</em><br>
<p>This class of problems is a perfectly valid area of study, but NLP 
<br>
would be relevant only if it actually described how an AI works. It 
<br>
hardly describes how a human works, so there's not much of interest 
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think the crux of the matter is that for one sentient being to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with another, the messages and signals being transmitted will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;richer and open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to different interpretation at different levels of communication 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proportional to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the intelligence of the beings. One of my favourite metaphors for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;God worship my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;father told me, &quot;if there is a God and He's pointing towards 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enlightenment, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would we be sucking on his finger?&quot; Understanding how humans think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level is important if we are to dumb-down our messages to a sub-human AI, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the AI needs to learn how to get smarter and dumb-down vis messages for us.
</em><br>
<p>When you've designed an AI that uses NLP to read my body language 
<br>
(one of the central themes of NLP), remind me to be exceedingly 
<br>
careful. Wouldn't want to raise my hands in a gesture and have it 
<br>
interpret this as &quot;Blast Emil off into the vacuum of outer space.&quot;
<br>
