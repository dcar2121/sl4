IBM has announced: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/resources/news/20011109_bluegene.shtml">http://www.research.ibm.com/resources/news/20011109_bluegene.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>the first computer to be built over the threshhold
<br>
of Moravec's estimate of human-equivalent processing
<br>
power (200 TFlops for Blue Gene/L vs. Moravec's
<br>
figure of 100 TFlops).
<br>
<p>In light of that, is it time to start thinking about
<br>
the rest of the system required to develop the seed
<br>
AI?  
<br>
The software is necessary, but not sufficient for
<br>
a complete system.
<br>
<p>I can see at least three levels of computer set-ups
<br>
that might be required:
<br>
<p>(1) Workstation(s) to do code development on
<br>
(2) Test system to test parts of the seed AI code
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or early stages of it's run
<br>
(3) Full system capable of getting to
<br>
super-intelligence.
<br>
<p>For the first level, a specially designed system
<br>
probably isn't required.  But for the second &amp;
<br>
third, a complete system will require thinking
<br>
about:
<br>
<p>- Core computer hardware requirements (Flops,
<br>
RAM, disk capacity, internal and external data
<br>
transfer rates)
<br>
<p>- Interfaces or barriers to the outside world
<br>
<p>- Facility support (floor space, UPS, electrical
<br>
and HVAC to support your 1000 linux box cluster
<br>
or whatever)
<br>
<p>- Staff
<br>
<p>- Procedures (do you do daily backups?  what do
<br>
you do if the console operator starts acting like
<br>
a zombie?  etc.)
<br>
<p><p>In any engineering project, the first question is
<br>
what are the requirements for the project.  So my
<br>
question for the list is has anyone got a better
<br>
estimate on the hardware requirements than the ones
<br>
based on human brain capacity (which range from
<br>
100 - 100,000 TFlops depending on who you ask)?
<br>
<p>If you have multiple approaches to AI, even a 
<br>
rough estimate of the requirements can help guide
<br>
what you do now.  For example, say the CYC-like
<br>
approach of feeding in millions of bits of
<br>
knowledge takes 1 TFlop to run, and a neuron
<br>
simulation takes 1000 TFlop to run.  Given
<br>
limited financial resources, you might not even
<br>
have to start development of the latter for
<br>
5 years, since the hardware won't be affordable
<br>
for 10 years.  That means you can spend the next
<br>
5 years on the former approach on the chance it
<br>
might work, rather than just waiting for the
<br>
hardware to get cheap enough for the latter.
<br>
<p>That's a simplistic example, but I hope it gets
<br>
the point across that there is value in even a
<br>
rough estimate of the requirements of an AI.
