&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok Guys, here's my thoughts about this.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear with me through my 'NLP overview' and take the AI-related
<br>
speculations at the end as just that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I see it, NLP completely dispenses with any notions of truth and
<br>
scientific correctness and attempts to create useful models of the world.
<br>
Useful in the sense that by following these models one can achieve a
<br>
desired outcome with high reliability multiple times.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the premises behind NLP is that because humans have similar
<br>
neurology, ANYTHING that YOU can do, I can do too.  All I need to do is
<br>
observe how you perform the thing that you are skilled at, build a model
<br>
based on my observations, and implement it myself.  The classic example is
<br>
Richard Bandler and John Grinder's model of Milton Erickson's hypnotic
<br>
techniques.  Erickson was (and still is) considered one of the most
<br>
effective psychotherapist of all times.  Bandler and Grinder studied his
<br>
techniques, found a structure and patterns behind what he was doing, and
<br>
were able to replicate his success and teach others how to do this.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is noteworthy in this process is that they did NOT try to find out
<br>
what he was actually doing, neither did they listen to Erickson's own
<br>
explanations of what he was doing.  Instead, they observed what he SEEMED
<br>
TO be doing, and ended up with a model that even Erickson once proclaimed
<br>
more complete than his own idea of his actions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar process has since been used to mirror the skills of effective
<br>
communicators, educators, street fighters, chiefs, seducers, and all sorts
<br>
of other oddities...  And of course there's all the things that Anthony
<br>
Robbins has done, like Simon mentioned.  All this NOT by understanding
<br>
what's actually going on inside those people's minds and bodies, but by
<br>
observing what they seem to be doing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's interesting to note that a lot of what NLP'ers do just plain does
<br>
not make sense at first.  If you listen to Bandler talk for example, a lot
<br>
of the time his statements thoroughly violate any laws of logic and are
<br>
seemingly unrelated if you stop to think about it, but your mind just
<br>
kindda follows along anyway, because it &quot;makes sense&quot; in a different
<br>
sense...  And the communication that has taken place is, from Bandler's
<br>
perspective, meaningful and successful, because for him the meaning of any
<br>
communication between humans is the end result that it accomplishes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What he does is he induces various feelings, sounds, and pictures in
<br>
your imagination by using language and tonality that are bound to do so.
<br>
And the underlying principle is that whatever you can get a person to
<br>
imagine is perceived by that person as being their own thought, and
<br>
therefore they don't resist it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I see two connections to AI at this point.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, Simon's remarks about the utilization of some of these
<br>
principles by an AI to persuade humans seem very relevant to me.  After
<br>
seeing some heavy NLP in action and studying it for a while, I now firmly
<br>
believe that it is absolutely feasible to persuade a human being of just
<br>
about anything, solely by using spoken language and observing that
<br>
person's reactions.  By virtue of neurology, people are bound to respond
<br>
to certain linguistic stimuli in predictible ways, and whether you are
<br>
aware of what's going on or not doesn't mean a thing (just try not to
<br>
think of a beautiful large butterfly flapping it's wings right in front
<br>
of you...  You just can't do it!  In order to understand what I am
<br>
saying, you have no choice but to imagine a butterfly.)  This obviously
<br>
has tremendous potential for benefitting and enhancing humans as well as
<br>
for causing harm beyond belief.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a systematic method to develop NLP-style models of
<br>
the world (meta-NLP?) seems like a subtly novel approach to machine
<br>
learning.
