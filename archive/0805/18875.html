<p>
Fellow life extension advocates,
<br>
<p>This event (*Aging: The Disease, The Cure, The Implications*, or *Aging 2008
<br>
* for short) a coming up in about a month.  June 27th, UCLA, Royce Hall,
<br>
4-8PM, dinner after for an additional $30.  Host is the Methuselah
<br>
Foundation.  8 great speakers, including Aubrey, William Haseltine, Bruce
<br>
Ames, Greg Stock, and others.  Be there if you can, blog about it if you
<br>
can't.  The event is free but registration (<a href="http://www.mfoundation.org/ADCI">http://www.mfoundation.org/ADCI</a>)
<br>
is required.  This is the chance for life extension advocates to make a huge
<br>
splash in California, the absolute hub of regenerative medicine research,
<br>
whose greatest application will be to slow and eventually reverse the
<br>
diseases of aging.
<br>
<p>Press release is below.  &quot;Things you can do to help&quot; page is here:

<p>Anyone who blogs about this gets a link on the event blogroll at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mfoundation.org/ADCI/blogcoverage/">http://www.mfoundation.org/ADCI/blogcoverage/</a>.  Just email Aubrey (his email
<br>
address is at the bottom of the page) and he'll make sure it gets up.
<br>
<p>Royce Hall has a capacity of 1800.  If we come anywhere close to filling it,
<br>
it will create a great impression in the eyes of local and national media!

<p>*Methuselah Foundation Announces Aging 2008 at UCLA*
<br>
<p>*Have You Ever Dreamed of Climbing Mt. Everest — on Your 125th Birthday?*
<br>
<p>LOS ANGELES, CA–(Marketwire - May 19, 2008) - On *Friday, June 27th*,
<br>
leading scientists and thinkers in stem cell research and regenerative
<br>
medicine will gather in Los Angeles at UCLA for *Aging
<br>
2008&lt;<a href="http://www.mfoundation.org/ADCI/">http://www.mfoundation.org/ADCI/</a>&gt;
<br>
* to explain how their work can combat human aging, and the sociological
<br>
implications of developing rejuvenation therapies.
<br>
<p>*Aging 2008* is *free*, with advance registration required at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mfoundation.org/Aging2008/">http://www.mfoundation.org/Aging2008/</a>.
<br>
<p>Dr. Aubrey de Grey, chairman and chief science officer of the Methuselah
<br>
Foundation, said, &quot;Our organization has raised over $10 million to crack
<br>
open the logjams in longevity science. With the two-armed strategy of direct
<br>
investments into key research projects, and a competitive prize to spur on
<br>
competing scientists' race to break rejuvenation and longevity records in
<br>
lab mice, the Foundation is actively accelerating the drive toward a future
<br>
free of age-related degeneration.&quot; The Methuselah Foundation has been
<br>
covered by &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Popular Science, The Wall Street Journal, and other
<br>
top-flight media outlets.
<br>
<p>The State of California is a frontrunner in regenerative medicine and stem
<br>
cell research. On November 2, 2004, more than seven million Californians
<br>
voted to pass Proposition 71, establishing the California Institute for
<br>
Regenerative Medicine, and allocating $3 billion over ten years to fund stem
<br>
cell research. Proposition 71 was a rare instance of voters directly
<br>
authorizing funding for scientific research.
<br>
<p>The speakers at *Aging 2008* will argue that the near-term consequences of
<br>
intense research into regenerative medicine could be the development of
<br>
therapies that extend healthy human life by decades, even if the therapies
<br>
are applied in middle age. Peter Thiel, president of Clarium Capital,
<br>
initial investor in Facebook, and lead sponsor of Aging 2008, said, &quot;The
<br>
time has come to challenge the inevitability of aging. This forum will
<br>
provide an excellent opportunity to look at the scientific barriers that
<br>
must be overcome to substantially extend healthy human life, as well as the
<br>
sociological implications of doing so.&quot;
<br>
<p>Aging 2008 also serves as the free opening session for the technically
<br>
focused Understanding Aging Conference, which will run at UCLA on June 28th
<br>
and 29th.
