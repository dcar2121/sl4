<p>If you own the hardware, I probably don't even know about it.  If you
<br>
are telling me that you are already doing so, then I can assign my own
<br>
utility value to that information.  Perhaps it weighs negatively on my
<br>
consideration of your moral status.  Perhaps I am already torturing
<br>
ten billion sentients and feel you're trying to make me feel guilty
<br>
about my wanton disregard for ethical best practice?  In zero-sum
<br>
thinking, I might feel it is necessary (to try) to take your resources
<br>
to improve my own computing power.  I thought the idea of the
<br>
post-singularity world is that there is an effective surplus such that
<br>
I don't have to care what you are doing to the billions of sentients
<br>
you host on your hardware and you don't have to care about mine.
<br>
Apparently the entire universe isn't a large enough playground for
<br>
everyone to get along...  You've converted 38% of the known universe
<br>
to computronium, with an estimated probability of converting 45% of
<br>
the newly discovered universe each moment it becomes available?  That
<br>
means within the next few observable moments of the universe, you will
<br>
have acquired a share that is 2% larger than my own... and I cannot
<br>
let that happen; prepare to fight.
<br>
<p>Not much different than prehistoric men fighting over a choice rock.
