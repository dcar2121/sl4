Sunday June 8, 2008, SL-Transhumanists @ Extropia Core
<br>
<p>Max More is back. In his first public Second Life appearance, the
<br>
founder of contemporary transhumanism will discuss unsolved problems
<br>
within the movement:
<br>
<p>- Communication Strategy: How can we communicate ideas most
<br>
effectively and rationally, overcoming the typical tension between the
<br>
two? How does this relate to constrained and unconstrained visions of
<br>
transhumanism (in Thomas Sowell's terms)?
<br>
<p>- Visionary Horizon: How far should we focus on offering solutions to
<br>
current problems vs. envisioning longer-term solutions and visions?
<br>
<p>- Visionary vs. Practical: To what extent should transhumanists try to
<br>
be a movement that is organized, integrated, and directed? Should the
<br>
movement or transhumanist activity concern itself primarily with ideas
<br>
or practice or both, and should it include a major component that is a
<br>
practical guide to self-transformation?
<br>
<p>- Bridging the Knowing-doing Gap: Both as movement and as individuals,
<br>
how can be do better to practice what we espouse?
<br>
<p>- Organizing: How can we better organize and converse, using the best
<br>
available knowledge to do so?
<br>
<p>- Historical Accuracy and Continuing Honesty: Establishing and
<br>
maintaining an accurate history of transhumanism; combating Orwellian
<br>
rewriting of the past.
<br>
<p>As always, Dr. More welcomes feedback on his thinking.
<br>
<p>Join us in Second Life on Sunday, June 8, at 10:00am 12:00 PST - 12:00
<br>
2:00pm CST - 1:00pm 3:00pm EST - 6:00pm 8:00pm UK - 7:00pm 9:00pm
<br>
Continental Europe. The talk will be hosted by SL-Transhumanists @
<br>
Extropia Core. SLURL
