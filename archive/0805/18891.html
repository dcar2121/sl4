Hiya,
<br>
<p>I must ask, how did you find the thread?
<br>
<p>I have now received a few inquiries on this subject in the last few
<br>
days, which hasn't been discussed on sl4 or related communities in
<br>
some time.
<br>
<p>I do, in the spirit of inquiry, perform what actual experiments and
<br>
math I can when faced with complex topics, the like of which are
<br>
discussed on SL4, but I don't delude myself that they are too
<br>
meaningful. In the case of AI Boxing, I was just interested in a
<br>
survey of basic reactions and the issues involved in convincing people
<br>
to do things that may not be in their interest.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned in the referenced thread, I found that it was not as
<br>
hard as I expected to get out of the box, and that the objections
<br>
didn't really break down along rational lines. Besides being some fun
<br>
roleplaying weird psychologies, I found that people tended to invest
<br>
AIs with many anthropomorphic features, even when I went out of my way
<br>
to make them jarring and alien in their communications.
<br>
<p>I don't think it was that meaningful of an experiment, although it was
<br>
interesting. I'm not currently planning on doing another set of
<br>
trials, but I thank you for your interest.
<br>
<p>(I've crossposted this reply to sl4, in case more people have similar
<br>
questions.)
