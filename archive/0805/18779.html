<em>&gt;  That does not compute. Nothing more? First you say memes and genes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  COMPLETELY different (with an exclamation point!) and then you admit you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can make an analogy between them. If you can make an analogy between two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  things then they are not completely different, if you can make a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  analogy as I believe you can between genes and memes then they can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  even be substantially different.
</em><br>
<p>I can make analogies between stars and jilted lovers, between the flow
<br>
of time and the flow of a river, between AI's and gods, between cars
<br>
and ants. Some of these would be very good analogies, with many points
<br>
in common.
<br>
<p>But none of them would be useful analogies, in that I can't take known
<br>
results from one side, and apply them on the other. Memes and genes
<br>
are liguistically close (hardly surprising, since the meme was
<br>
conceived as &quot;let's take the idea of a gene and transplant it to
<br>
another context&quot;). To go beyond linguistics, you need a precise
<br>
equivalence between important elements of a gene and meme, a model of
<br>
how both interact, and a mathematical expression for the difference in
<br>
how the two evolve.
<br>
<p>You need to be able to make numerical predictions about memes while
<br>
knowing only about genes (or vice-versa) and for these predictions to
<br>
be at least somewhat accurate.
