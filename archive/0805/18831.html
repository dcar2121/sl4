<em>&gt;  What's this entity called &quot;you&quot; in the rules above?  Humans have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  brains in their heads.  They can think only with their brains and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cannot copy that process onto another computational substrate.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  makes it possible to identify humans by name and count them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  essentially by labelling the skulls.  The process doesn't work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  entities that don't share those anatomical restrictions, so it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  obvious how to identify the entities you're talking about any more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  However, identifying the entities is an essential requirement for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  laws you're proposing there to have meaning, so the whole thing seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  unworkable.
</em><br>
<p>That's avery good point; I was still thinking in a very human-centric
<br>
way (what ethical codes should a language translating program have?
<br>
not to mention self replicating viral programs, etc...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Using words to confine an entity that's going to be a better lawyer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  than you seems pretty dicey.
</em><br>
<p>That's not the problem, though. The rules have to be integrated in
<br>
such a way that the AI wants to implement them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I don't see how to win with the slow-fast scheme.  Once the dominant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  force in the world is a disorganized bunch of AI's competing with each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  other, and those AI's are able to do engineering, then neither human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cognition nor human evolution are driving things any more.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  collection of AI's isn't an individual AI, so no one program written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by humans is in control any more either.  With no traceable ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cause-and-effect bewteen humanity and anything identifiable that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  matters, I'd say we lost.  I don't see hope of getting back on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  horse after being thrown off.
</em><br>
<p>I'm more optimistic about purely slow development; it seems possible
<br>
to &quot;muddle through&quot; that. It's the slow-fast that seems unbeleivably
<br>
worrying... Hope for diminishing returns on intelligence, then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  J. Storrs Hall believes a slow takeoff is survivable, judging by his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  recent Singularity Summit talk.  I didn't read his &quot;Beyond AI&quot; book
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  yet so I don't know how he's able to believe that.
</em><br>
<p>I'll have to read that, once I get some of that &quot;free-time&quot; everyone
<br>
seems to be talking about...
