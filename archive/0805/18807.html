<em>&gt;  &gt; No (super) goal is more &quot;intelligent&quot; than another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But a dynamic goal structure is more intelligent (No quotation marks!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  than a static one. Rocks have a very stable goal system but are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  particularly smart.
</em><br>
<p>Rocks have no goals (and if you think they do, can you justify this
<br>
surprising statement?)
<br>
<p>I can imagine a human whose long-term goals change every day, on a
<br>
whim. I can imagine a human whose single overriding goal is to become
<br>
the vest conceptual artist the world has ever known. I fail to see how
<br>
we can declare the first one more intelligent than the last, without
<br>
more information.
<br>
<p>Note that &quot;being the best conceptual artist&quot; is a very nice super-goal
<br>
to have, as what is needed for that changes constantly, as fashions,
<br>
times, and places change. There's no need for fixed goals to lead to
<br>
stasis; if you stretch the point a bit (a lot) and claim that the
<br>
&quot;goal&quot; of genes is to survive and multiply, then we have the most
<br>
dazzling variety being created from these simple unchanging goals.
<br>
<p>Similarly, an AI with a goal like &quot;ensure that every human being
<br>
survives, is happy and feels worthwhile, and beyond that obey human
<br>
instructions&quot;, would probably not stumble towards paralysis or rote,
<br>
even if that goal remains forever unchanged.
<br>
