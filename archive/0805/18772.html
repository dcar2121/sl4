<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  You are assuming that if your brain were augmented with silicon,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; True, but not all information is equally able to alter the state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the systems (brains and computers)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  From an information theoretic point of view, if one bit of input
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information does not alter the state of the receiver by one bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  conditional algorithmic complexity, then communication was wasted.
</em><br>
<p>Lots of communication is wasted, not all of it is relevant to what you
<br>
are trying to do, as the agents you are communicating with aren't
<br>
perfectly aligned with your goals so may be transmitting useless or
<br>
harmful data!
<br>
<p>I'm assuming both human and computer are likely to be memory
<br>
saturated, that is they would need to forget a bit of information in
<br>
order to remember a new bit. The policy of which bits to remember and
<br>
which bits to forget (new or old) can be controlled by other bits of
<br>
information from the environment. The channel that these bits come in
<br>
on can be said to be a privileged channel. If this channel completely
<br>
comes from a human, the computer could become part of that human,
<br>
dependent upon its initial programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is not that having machines control your behavior is fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bad.  It's that humans believe they have free choice and don't want it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  taken away.  A brain interface doesn't have to force you to do X
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  instead of Y.  It just gives you information so that you believe X is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  better choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nothing has free choice, however not all information channels have an
<br>
equal affect on the state of the systems involved. I think it possible
<br>
to create computer systems that have a symbiotic relationship, but a
<br>
much less ability to change a human than the human does it.
<br>
<p>Just don't get your robot to be your sexual partner/best friend, else
<br>
it might get more control over you. ;)
