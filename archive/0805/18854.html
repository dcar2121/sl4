</em><br>
<p>My question is whether &quot;after the singularity&quot; makes any more sense than
<br>
&quot;before the big bang&quot;.  I alluded to two types of time, making &quot;after&quot;
<br>
poorly defined.  Physical time is symmetric with regard to past and
<br>
future.  Perceptual or computational time is not.  It is directed toward
<br>
increasing thermodynamic entropy and irreversible computational operations
<br>
such as writing into memory.  We may quantify perceptual time by
<br>
considering two states S1 and S2 of an intelligent agent and algorithmic
<br>
complexity K() such that if
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;K(S2|S1) = t
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;K(S1|S2) = 0
<br>
<p>then S2 occurs at time t after S1 on a perceptual time scale.  When you
<br>
were a child and 5 minutes seemed like an hour, it was because you were
<br>
learning faster.  Likewise, for a computation it makes more sense to count
<br>
instructions than seconds.
<br>
<p>This model assumes no forgetting.  In reality, K(S1|S2) &gt; 0, so &quot;after&quot; is
<br>
a partially ordered relation with a beginning but no end.  (This is true
<br>
in cosmology and general relativity too, so it should not seem so
<br>
strange).
<br>
<p>In physical time, knowledge is assumed to accumulate at a hyperbolic rate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A singularity occurs when knowledge becomes infinite, say, after 40 more
<br>
Earth orbits around the Sun.  In perceptual time a singularity seems to be
<br>
infinitely far into the future.  Thus, &quot;after the singularity&quot; does not
<br>
make sense.
<br>
<p>With regard to simulation, I was talking about a time &quot;just before&quot; the
<br>
singularity in physical time, when it is possible to simulate universes
<br>
containing intelligent agents programmed to believe their environment is
<br>
real.  I agree that it makes no difference from your viewpoint whether the
<br>
universe is real or not, because there is no way to distinguish the
<br>
possibilities.  I actually believe that the universe we observe is one of
<br>
an enumeration of all possible universes, possibly at the bottom of a
<br>
chain of simulations within simulations.  I believe the top of the chain
<br>
is isomorphic to N, the set of natural numbers, which is the most likely
<br>
possibility given a Solomonoff prior.  Our observable universe seems to be
<br>
generated by a program with a complexity of a few hundred bits.
