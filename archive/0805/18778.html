<em>&gt; &gt; Nothing has free choice, however not all information channels have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; equal affect on the state of the systems involved. I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to create computer systems that have a symbiotic relationship, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; much less ability to change a human than the human does it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If two symbiotic agents with unequally sized saturated memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  communicate, then both agents must change state at the same rate, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  measured by conditional algorithmic complexity.
</em><br>
<p>If and only if they send each other no redundant or useless
<br>
information. Which is unlikely even between subsystems of the same
<br>
agent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  However if by &quot;change&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you mean the percentage of  information affected, then the smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agent will change faster relative to its size.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Suppose that A and B are saturated agents and algorithmic complexity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  K(A) &gt; K(B).  Consider a message x from A to B, where we don't count
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  any bits ignored by B.
</em><br>
<p>Ignoring, forgetting etc is vital to intelligence to work in the real
<br>
world. Else you have stasis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then K(B(t2)|B(t1)) = K(x|B(t1)), where t1 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the time before the message and t2 is after.  A can forget x (since A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can always get it back from B), so K(A(t1)|A(t2)) = K(x|A(t2)).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  By symbiotic, I mean that communication tends to minimize K(A) + K(B),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  an ideal division of labor.  If K(x|B(t1)) &lt; K(x|A(t2)) (B can remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  x more easily than A could have), then B should keep x, or else send it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  back.
</em><br>
<p>Why remember anything, why is it important?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If A and B are both saturated and symbiotic at equilibrium, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information is conserved.  Both agents must change state at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rate.  There must be equal amounts of information flowing in each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  direction because neither agent can hold any more.
</em><br>
<p>Or some of it is discarded. I was considering an open system where one
<br>
part of the systems was connected to the internet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This relation holds even if the agents perform lossy compression.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  one agent transmitted information faster than the other, then the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  receiver must discard some of it to make the rates equal.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  generalize the above argument, let x be the part of the message that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not ignored by the receiver.  The sender, of course, must continue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  remember the ignored part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Now suppose that A is a human and B is a calculator.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reasonable division of labor because the calculator can do arithmetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  faster and more accurately than I can.  But I can completely change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  state of the calculator's registers much faster than it can change me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  into a different person.  This is also the case with all nonhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agents in existence today.  But if B was a superhuman AI, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  situation could be reversed.
</em><br>
<p>No, because we are not exactly like calculators and other nonhuman
<br>
agents. We can resist state change, as long as things don't send tweak
<br>
our motivational systems as well (pain, pleasure). Just look at how
<br>
slow academic fields are to change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The agents need not be symbiotic.  By a simpler argument, the maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  change K(A(t2)|A(t1)) is min(K(A), K(B)), i.e. transfer all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information from B to A until A is full.  Then B can change A into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  different person only if K(B) &gt;= K(A).
</em><br>
<p>There is no such actual thing as a &quot;different person&quot;. There is no
<br>
sharp distinction between self and environment. The separate agent
<br>
hood I give to computers is simply an illusion that allows me to work
<br>
with them better.
<br>
<p>Do you consider the visual cortex as trying to change you to a
<br>
&quot;different person&quot;? If not why not? Why is it not separate?
