<em>&gt; I disagree.  No supergoal being better / more intelligent than another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies that the entities involved effectively have no nature, that they 
</em><br>
<p>I fail to see how this is implied. On the contrary, as intelligence is
<br>
not a factor in primary goals, the primary goals of an entity pretty
<br>
much define its nature (or if you like, the other way around, depending
<br>
on what's your preferred semantics for &quot;nature&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; somehow exist in a vacuum such that whether their goals make conditions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they live in better or worse for themselves and those around them is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly and completely irrelevant.   This is simply and literally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without foundation.  
</em><br>
<p>If &quot;this&quot; refers to the claim that my words somehow imply the above,
<br>
indeed it is true. Otherwise this is more straws for the strawman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Much of our discussion presumes that a super-intelligence will not do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-abstraction on its own goals.  This is very convenient and perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to convincing ourselves we can somehow cause such a being to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be &quot;Friendly&quot;. But it does not match any intelligent systems existing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to date and is not a foolproof assumption.
</em><br>
<p>As for systems existing to date, it's trivially explainable why we have
<br>
to do that nasty stuff: our goal structure, such as it is, is a
<br>
self-contradictory mess of overlapping and inconsistent values. However,
<br>
for at least some of us, consistency and its friends are included in
<br>
that mess (quite possibly as instrumental values rather than intrinsic
<br>
ones). This enables, nay, even requires us to study, abstract and rank
<br>
some of our goals in order to make some sense out of the spaghetti we've
<br>
been dealt. (The apparent instrumentality stems largely from the fact
<br>
that if we did not try to clean things up a bit, we'd be no good at
<br>
achieving any of our goals, what with working internally against
<br>
ourselves the whole time - as, indeed, we often do regardless.)
<br>
<p>On the other hand, a rational intelligent system with a clean and
<br>
consistent goal architecture does not have to do things like this, and
<br>
indeed will not, for rationality in pursuing goals _by definition_ rules
<br>
out changing those goals. Of course, whether such a system can be built
<br>
is another matter, where one has to rely on one's best guestimates.
<br>
Regardless, with our way of operation easily explained by our identified
<br>
bugs (irrationality and inconsistency), your argument is easily
<br>
nullified as a reason to think systems in general would have to be
<br>
similarly buggy.
<br>
<p>Of course, I don't deny the possibility of hodgepodge superintelligent
<br>
systems that were as irrational and inconsistent as us. In this case
<br>
they would quite conceivably have to resort to same kind of cognitive
<br>
kludges as us too, and be rather dangerous.
<br>
<p>No foolproof claims from me here, I just think it's worth a shot making
<br>
a the former kind of AI what with there being no solid arguments to the
<br>
impossibility thereof. As well as having astronomical waste hanging in
<br>
the balance and all that.
