<p>
Humans are very good at error detecting; when something goes wrong we
<br>
are very vocal in pointing it out. We have a mixed record on
<br>
correcting these errors once we've detected them - our skill in
<br>
correcting errors before they become ingrained is balanced by our
<br>
complete inability at correcting them once they have become
<br>
&quot;traditional&quot; and some people benefit from it.
<br>
<p>Finally, we are complete muppets at predicting errors before they
<br>
happen. The &quot;everything will be fine&quot; brigade meets the &quot;we're all
<br>
going to die&quot; division, and no-one puts their finger on what the real
<br>
problems will be.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, a decent general AI without our ingrained biases
<br>
should be much better than us at error predicting. On the other hand
<br>
it would be very poor at error detecting - in that we have to tell it
<br>
what we would consider to be an error (such as the extinction or
<br>
enslavement of humanity).
<br>
<p>These facts explain my approach in the Chain/GodAI paper
<br>
<a href="http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf">http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>Simple solutions to FAI, even more complicated ones such as CEV,
<br>
suffer from the weakness that they may fail in ways that we cannot
<br>
predict. Seeing our poor self-knowledge, they may even fail in ways we
<br>
cannot imagine now, but that would be undoubtedly seen as a failure
<br>
after the fact.
<br>
<p>That is why my approach attempts to marry the human ability to see
<br>
things going wrong with an AI's ability to predict consequences. Apart
<br>
from a few central principles to keep the whole project on the rails,
<br>
most of the AI's ethical system would develop organically, with the AI
<br>
predicting the consequences of a particular &quot;value&quot;, and us making a
<br>
decision as to whether those consequences are acceptable.
