<br>
<em>&gt;The corporate model
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... there would be the definite risk of AI designers following the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;letter of the law rather than the spirit, thus the system needing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constant legal updating to keep up with ways of gaming the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This would require a nimbleness never before seen in government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The government model
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...The difficulty of legislating friendliness remains, though less of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a problem than in the corporate model...
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why it's less of a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The centralised model
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) You must accept deletion if the AIC imposes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) You must not interfere with the physical set-up of the AIC
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3) You must not interfere with the AIC's data collection operation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<p>What's this entity called &quot;you&quot; in the rules above?  Humans have
<br>
brains in their heads.  They can think only with their brains and
<br>
cannot copy that process onto another computational substrate.  This
<br>
makes it possible to identify humans by name and count them
<br>
essentially by labelling the skulls.  The process doesn't work for
<br>
entities that don't share those anatomical restrictions, so it's not
<br>
obvious how to identify the entities you're talking about any more.
<br>
However, identifying the entities is an essential requirement for the
<br>
laws you're proposing there to have meaning, so the whole thing seems
<br>
unworkable.
<br>
<p>Making sure these laws retain their meaning in changing circumstances
<br>
leaves you with the same legislative problems as before.  Isaac Asimov
<br>
spent many years writing about the unintended consequences of a
<br>
superficially similar set of rules.
<br>
<p>Using words to confine an entity that's going to be a better lawyer
<br>
than you seems pretty dicey.
<br>
<p>I don't see how to win with the slow-fast scheme.  Once the dominant
<br>
force in the world is a disorganized bunch of AI's competing with each
<br>
other, and those AI's are able to do engineering, then neither human
<br>
cognition nor human evolution are driving things any more.  A
<br>
collection of AI's isn't an individual AI, so no one program written
<br>
by humans is in control any more either.  With no traceable ongoing
<br>
cause-and-effect bewteen humanity and anything identifiable that
<br>
matters, I'd say we lost.  I don't see hope of getting back on this
<br>
horse after being thrown off.
<br>
<p>J. Storrs Hall believes a slow takeoff is survivable, judging by his
<br>
recent Singularity Summit talk.  I didn't read his &quot;Beyond AI&quot; book
<br>
yet so I don't know how he's able to believe that.
