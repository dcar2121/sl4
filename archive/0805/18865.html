<em>&gt; You originally proposed giving greater (perhaps infinite) weight to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative utility than positive utility.  By this reasoning, you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never test any new drugs because of the possibility they may cause harm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could not engage in trade because the negative utility of the payer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceeds the positive utility of the recipient.  I know you could make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceptions in these cases, but there are many other examples.
</em><br>
<p>I grant the point about the new drug tests (holding out the hope that
<br>
my design of utility function will encourage non-human tests to be
<br>
developed. In the meantimes, I'd be in favour of paying people above
<br>
the market rate to take part in them - and I already know the moral
<br>
and practical objection to that position). I don't get the trade
<br>
argument - trade only happens if both parties get positive utility out
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p>Maybe I should have emphasised that I was focusing on actual pain, not
<br>
just negative utility. If losing a million pounds will make little
<br>
difference to your happiness beyond some initial anguish, then I see
<br>
nothing wrong with that happening (my research into the happiness is a
<br>
bit rusty, but what I read a few years back when I was engaged in it,
<br>
was that for most people, as long as you draw the salary of at least a
<br>
medical doctor, your income is uncorrelated with your happiness). It
<br>
is the really damaging suffering and death that I think should be
<br>
over-emphasised, and the risk of those.
<br>
<p>And yes, there are problems with my approach (though I don't count
<br>
preference reversal as a problem). But it still seems, to me, to be
<br>
advantageous over the alternatives.
<br>
<p>I've cost a post on &quot;Rights&quot; that I'll post soon; it will have a more
<br>
general case of non-linear utility.
<br>
<p>If you want to continue the discussion, maybe better to take it off
<br>
the mailing list? And return with the conclusions?
<br>
