</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If two symbiotic agents with unequally sized saturated memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  communicate, then both agents must change state at the same rate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  as measured by conditional algorithmic complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If and only if they send each other no redundant or useless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. Which is unlikely even between subsystems of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent.
</em><br>
<p>I accounted for both in my analysis.  In general, a message will be
<br>
longer than the amount of state change in the receiver.  We may regard
<br>
any information from sender A that is ignored by the receiver B as
<br>
having not been communicated.  If the remainder is x, then in general
<br>
|x| &gt;= K(x) &gt;= K(x|B(t1)) = K(B(t2)|B(t1)), x may be more redundant to
<br>
B than any intrinsic redundancy in x itself.
<br>
<p>The most efficient distribution of information in A and B is the one
<br>
that minimizes the redundancy due to shared knowledge,
<br>
K(A)+K(B)-K(A,B).  If A and B cooperate then they can achieve this by
<br>
communicating x whenever B can store it more efficiently than A, i.e.
<br>
K(x|B(t1)) &lt; K(x|A(t2)).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Now suppose that A is a human and B is a calculator.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  reasonable division of labor because the calculator can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arithmetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  faster and more accurately than I can.  But I can completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  state of the calculator's registers much faster than it can change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  into a different person.  This is also the case with all nonhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  agents in existence today.  But if B was a superhuman AI, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  situation could be reversed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, because we are not exactly like calculators and other nonhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents. We can resist state change, as long as things don't send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tweak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our motivational systems as well (pain, pleasure). Just look at how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow academic fields are to change.
</em><br>
<p>I used a calculator as an example because there is little shared
<br>
information, as in the ideal case.  Another example would be a
<br>
notebook.  After you write down something like a phone number, you can
<br>
forget it.  After you read and memorize it, you can throw away the
<br>
note.  It is your choice, of course, but having a notebook to outsource
<br>
some of your memory changes your behavior slightly vs. not having one.
<br>
<p>Humans resist rapid change because we have a long term memory rate of
<br>
about 1 bit per second, not because we want to.  Slow change still
<br>
happens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you consider the visual cortex as trying to change you to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;different person&quot;? If not why not? Why is it not separate?
</em><br>
<p>If you didn't have one, you would be very different.
