</em><br>
<p>If two symbiotic agents with unequally sized saturated memories
<br>
communicate, then both agents must change state at the same rate, as
<br>
measured by conditional algorithmic complexity.  However if by &quot;change&quot;
<br>
you mean the percentage of  information affected, then the smaller
<br>
agent will change faster relative to its size.
<br>
<p>Suppose that A and B are saturated agents and algorithmic complexity
<br>
K(A) &gt; K(B).  Consider a message x from A to B, where we don't count
<br>
any bits ignored by B.  Then K(B(t2)|B(t1)) = K(x|B(t1)), where t1 is
<br>
the time before the message and t2 is after.  A can forget x (since A
<br>
can always get it back from B), so K(A(t1)|A(t2)) = K(x|A(t2)).
<br>
<p>By symbiotic, I mean that communication tends to minimize K(A) + K(B),
<br>
an ideal division of labor.  If K(x|B(t1)) &lt; K(x|A(t2)) (B can remember
<br>
x more easily than A could have), then B should keep x, or else send it
<br>
back.
<br>
<p>If A and B are both saturated and symbiotic at equilibrium, then
<br>
information is conserved.  Both agents must change state at the same
<br>
rate.  There must be equal amounts of information flowing in each
<br>
direction because neither agent can hold any more.
<br>
<p>This relation holds even if the agents perform lossy compression.  If
<br>
one agent transmitted information faster than the other, then the other
<br>
receiver must discard some of it to make the rates equal.  To
<br>
generalize the above argument, let x be the part of the message that is
<br>
not ignored by the receiver.  The sender, of course, must continue to
<br>
remember the ignored part.
<br>
<p>Now suppose that A is a human and B is a calculator.  This is a
<br>
reasonable division of labor because the calculator can do arithmetic
<br>
faster and more accurately than I can.  But I can completely change the
<br>
state of the calculator's registers much faster than it can change me
<br>
into a different person.  This is also the case with all nonhuman
<br>
agents in existence today.  But if B was a superhuman AI, then the
<br>
situation could be reversed.
<br>
<p>The agents need not be symbiotic.  By a simpler argument, the maximum
<br>
change K(A(t2)|A(t1)) is min(K(A), K(B)), i.e. transfer all of the
<br>
information from B to A until A is full.  Then B can change A into a
<br>
different person only if K(B) &gt;= K(A).
<br>
<p>But given the rate of human long term memory, it would take many years.
