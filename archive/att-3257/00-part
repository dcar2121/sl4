Protected memory really doesn't have anything to do with code being able
to modify itself in any sense meaningful to AI.  Creating a
self-modifying system on modern machines and operating systems is a
trivial exercise.

The real problem is that AI research HAS gone in a hundred different
directions, the vast majority of which have no chance of leading to AI.
If any "leading" has been going on, it certainly isn't evident from the
myriad of random directions routinely taken in AI research.

But of course I would say these things.  After all, I am part of the
conspiracy...
