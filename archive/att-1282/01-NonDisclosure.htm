<p>On this _________ day of _____________ , 2001, in connection
with your consideration of a possible transaction with Webmind Inc. (&quot;Company&quot;) involving all or a

Company has agreed to supply under nondisclosure agreement
(&quot;Agreement&quot;) on the following terms and conditions.</p>

<p>As a condition to the furnishing of such information by the
Company to Recipient, whether written or oral, the Company
requires that Recipient agree as set forth below to treat
confidentially any and all information, concepts, or samples
which the Company or its directors, officers, employees, counsel,
consultants or agents (hereinafter collectively
&quot;Representatives&quot;) furnish to Recipient in connection
with such transaction, whether furnished before, on or after the
date of this agreement, and all notes, analyses, compilations,
studies, reports, or other documents, whether prepared by
Recipient or its Representatives, which contain or otherwise
reflect such information (collectively, the &quot;Evaluation
Material&quot;).</p>

<p>Recipient hereby agrees that the Evaluation Material will not
be used by Recipient or its Representatives except for the
purpose of determining Recipient's interest in a transaction with
the Company involving its IPP, and will be kept confidential by
Recipient for a period of five (5) years from the date hereof;
provided however, that:</p>

<p>(1) any of such information may be disclosed to those of
Recipient's Representatives who need to know such information for
the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between
Recipient and the Company, all of whom shall be informed by
Recipient of the confidential nature of such information and
shall be directed by the Recipient to treat such information and
the existence of the proposal confidentially;</p>

<p>(2) any disclosure of such information may be made to which
the Company consents in writing; and</p>

<p>(3) the obligation of confidentiality and non-use contained
herein shall not extend to such of the Evaluation Material which
(i) at the time of its receipt by Recipient is already in, or
subsequently comes into, the public domain through no fault of
Recipient or any of its Representatives (but only to the extent
that it so becomes available), (ii) is already in Recipient's
possession, or (iii) becomes available to Recipient without
restriction on disclosure from a third party who has a lawful
right to make a disclosure thereof.</p>

<p>In the event no transaction with regard to the IPP is effected
between the Company and Recipient or Recipient decides not to
make an offer, (1) Recipient will promptly upon the request of
the Company return to the Company all of the Evaluation Material
furnished by, or on behalf of, the Company, without retaining any
copy thereof, and (2) any analyses, compilations, studies,
reports, or other documents which may be prepared for Recipient's
internal use by Recipient or its Representatives which reflect

destroyed upon request of the Company, such destruction to be
certified in writing to the Company by an authorized officer
supervising such destruction.</p>

<p>It is acknowledged that the Company does not make any
representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness
of the Evaluation Material. It is agreed that neither the Company
nor its Representatives shall have any liability to Recipient or
its Representatives resulting from its or their use of the
Evaluation Material.</p>

<p>Neither this Agreement nor any other document, concept, or
sample delivered to or by Recipient, nor the delivery thereof,
shall constitute an offer to assign the rights to, or the
acceptance of an offer if any, to purchase, such IPP assignment.
Any agreement to assign, or enter into any arrangement with
respect to, the IPP shall be subject to the negotiation and
execution of definitive written agreements, all appropriate
governmental reviews and approvals, and the approval of the board
of directors of the Company.</p>

<p>Each party will keep knowledge of this investigation
confidential and will make no public disclosure of this
investigation of the IPP without prior consultation with and the
consent of the other party.</p>

<p>In the event that Recipient or any of its Representatives is
requested or required by oral questions, interrogatories,
requests for information or documents subpoena, civil
investigative demand, by order of any governmental authority, or
similar legal process to disclose any of the Evaluation Material
supplied to it in the course of its dealings with the Company or
its Representatives, it is agreed that it will provide the
Company with prompt written notice of such request(s) so that the
Company may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive
compliance by Recipient with the provisions of this Agreement. It
is further agreed that if, in the absence of a protective order
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Recipient is nonetheless,
in the opinion of its counsel, compelled to disclose any of the
Evaluation Material to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, it may disclose such
information to such tribunal hereunder, provided the information
so disclosed is clearly marked as confidential to the Company.</p>

with the laws of the State of New York (without
reference to any conflicts of law rules).</p>
