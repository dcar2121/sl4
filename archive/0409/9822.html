Dude, what is your problem?
<br>
<p><p>Selon Keith Henson &lt;<a href="mailto:hkhenson@rogers.com?Subject=Re:%20Keith%20could%20use%20some%20help">hkhenson@rogers.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p>| Actually Keith is *desperate* for help.
<br>
| 
<br>
| I got turned down on my refugee claim an incredible 10
<br>
| months after the 
<br>
| last hearing.  But after that my appeal to the Canadian
<br>
| federal courts was 
<br>
| almost instantly rejected.
<br>
| 
<br>
| So at this point I am a &quot;failed refugee.&quot;  The only thing
<br>
| that can keep me 
<br>
| from being deported to the US on short notice is an
<br>
| appeal to the Minister 
<br>
| of Citizenship and Immigration.  Her office gets 15,000
<br>
| letters a week so 
<br>
| it takes a well known case to reach the level where it
<br>
| gets attention.
<br>
| 
<br>
| Now you say, being deported to the US isn't so bad.  Well
<br>
| in my case it 
<br>
| is.  Here is testimony obtained about a week ago.  It is
<br>
| from May 13, 
<br>
| 2004.  A Toronto cop is being quizzed by my lawyer about
<br>
| events when I came 
<br>
| here three and a half years ago (Robert K Schwarz is the
<br>
| deputy DA who 
<br>
| prosecuted the case against me with the help of a former
<br>
| Mafia lawyer.)
<br>
| 
<br>
|                          Q.  I don't think you need to go
<br>
| into that.  I
<br>
| think we're all aware of that.  Did Mr. Schwarz  did you
<br>
| ask
<br>
| him if he was going to take any steps to extradite Mr.
<br>
| Henson?
<br>
|                          A.  Yes, I did.
<br>
|                          Q.  And he responded that he
<br>
| wasn't?
<br>
|                          A.  He said the State of
<br>
| California would not
<br>
| extradite Mr. Henson from Canada, however, if Mr. Henson
<br>
| was
<br>
| found to be in another State, such as New York, then they
<br>
| would
<br>
| probably proceed with extradition requests from New
<br>
| York.
<br>
|                          Q.  I see.  But he made it clear
<br>
| to you that they
<br>
| have no intention to try to extradite him from Canada?
<br>
|                          A.  It came down to a matter of
<br>
| cost, dollars and
<br>
| cents.
<br>
|                          Q.  He wasn't candid enough to
<br>
| admit that they
<br>
| couldn't extradite him from Canada?
<br>
|                          A.  No.  He just said that the
<br>
| State of
<br>
| California would not extradite Mr. Henson from Canada…
<br>
|                          Q.  I see.
<br>
|                          A.  … because of the cost.
<br>
| 
<br>
| Of course scientology would be footing the bill.  Someone
<br>
| who has been 
<br>
| sentenced does not have to be extradited, they can just
<br>
| be kidnapped by 
<br>
| bounty hunters.  And cult agents have made fairly clear
<br>
| public threats that 
<br>
| I would not survive jail.
<br>
| 
<br>
| Considering the depth the cult has corrupted the
<br>
| government of Riverside 
<br>
| County, I can hardly look for justice there or even being
<br>
| safe in their 
<br>
| jail.  I am about to release information that makes the
<br>
| case that 
<br>
| scientology created a jury where most of the members were
<br>
| under their control.
<br>
| 
<br>
| Ok, if you want to help what to do?
<br>
| 
<br>
| If you live in Canada, write your MP with a cc to my MP
<br>
| and if you will, a 
<br>
| blind cc to me or if you want, post it.  You can ask them
<br>
| asking your MP to 
<br>
| pass a copy on to the Minister, Judy Sgro.  You can get
<br>
| your MP from your 
<br>
| postal code by going here:

| My MP is Lloyd St Amand,  Constituency Address
<br>
| 
<br>
| 98 Paris Road, Unit 3
<br>
| Brantford, Ontario
<br>

<br>
| He says that email and postal mail are given the same
<br>
| attention.
<br>
| 
<br>
| If you are outside of Canada, supporting email to
<br>
| <a href="mailto:stamal@parl.gc.ca?Subject=Re:%20Keith%20could%20use%20some%20help">stamal@parl.gc.ca</a> asking 
<br>
| him to help me stay in Canada would be the way to go.
<br>
| 
<br>
| If you know me personally or by reputation, put that in
<br>
| your email or 
<br>
| letter.  Half a page to a page is more likely to get
<br>
| read, but the length 
<br>
| is up to you.
