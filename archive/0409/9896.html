===== short JOIN intro, skip to message at will
<br>
D.C. area engineer at AT&amp;T because it's easy and pays well, pursuing a
<br>
shift to research/academia out of intellectual &amp; moral necessity.

Current working papers in philosophy of (mind, cosmology, religion,
<br>
ethics); some other interests include AI, decision theory, probability
<br>
theory, theories of rationality, ontology.

<br>
<p>Michael Wilson said: &quot;This is on top of the already known issues with
<br>
qualia and the illusion of free will; both are results of specific
<br>
(adaptive) flaws in human introspective capability which would be
<br>
relatively trivial for transhumans to engineer out, but at the cost of
<br>
breaking the grounding for the actual (rather than theoretical)
<br>
implementation of our moral and legal systems&quot;
<br>
<p>Nothing of value is gained in engineering qualia out of the mind. The
<br>
blind are not more evolutionary fit or competitive than the sighted,
<br>
and neither are the color-blind in relation to those with
<br>
color-vision. Even if we presume (contrary to the two examples just
<br>
given) a being without phenomenal experience who yet collects and
<br>
assesses/processes electromagnetic radiation just as well as a
<br>
counterpart being for whom EM produces phenomenal content, there is
<br>
only loss of a mode of being.
<br>
The only examples I can imagine that might lead someone to think
<br>
qualia were a bad thing are ones which mention a negative result of a
<br>
phenomenal experience, such as cognitive processing severely hampered
<br>
by pain, loss of efficiency resulting from an inexplicable desire to
<br>
stare at shiny objects, and the like. But this sort of example
<br>
misappropriates responsibility to qualia for the unwanted result, when
<br>
the problem is the cognitive association between a particular
<br>
phenomenal experience and a particular negative behavior or loss of
<br>
ability. Hence, if your loved one was hit by a green car, causing you
<br>
to become depressed every time you see green, re-engineer the link
<br>
between the two, not your ability to see green; removing qualia is the
<br>
wrong approach.
<br>
<p>Aside: It remains to be seen whether it is even theoretically possible
<br>
to remove phenomenal consciousness from a sufficiently intelligent,
<br>
metacognitive being. Some form of panpsychism may yet be true, meaning
<br>
qualia may be an intrinsic property of all existence, even though it's
<br>
only recognizable by a certain class of mind-like, reflective
<br>
structure.
<br>
<p>Moving beyond &quot;the illusion of free will&quot; requires no engineering on
<br>
the part of transhumans. Current humans who have realized that the
<br>
folk concept of free will (which most closely resembles what is known
<br>
in the philosophical literature as the libertarian view of the will)
<br>
is a necessary impossibility (*) demonstrate all that is needed to
<br>
overcome the illusion is rational reflection.
<br>
<p>[* because, roughly, if the universe is deterministic, we cannot have
<br>
libertarian free will, our choices being determined by physical law
<br>
and &quot;beyond our control&quot; (according to the folk concept), and if the
<br>
universe is indeterministic, we cannot have libertarian free will,
<br>
because undetermined choices are not determined by our goals,
<br>
preferences, or will.]
<br>
<p>Now even assuming we could and did get rid of both qualia and the
<br>
illusion of free will, would this really threaten our moral and legal
<br>
foundations? Some theory would need to be re-worked, certainly, but in
<br>
minor and readily achievable ways. For example, some think that
<br>
without free will, we could no longer hold people responsible for
<br>
their crimes; after all, &quot;they had no choice.&quot; This conception of
<br>
culpability relies on the folk free will, so once that's gone, so is
<br>
the misguided view that only &quot;free&quot; actions are punishable. There is a
<br>
simpler and more stable foundation for punishing criminals already
<br>
under discussion in the literature; we can punish transgressors to
<br>
protect ourselves, not out of holy retribution or a &quot;you deserve it&quot;
<br>
mentality. Leaving murderers free puts others at risk, so we can
<br>
incarcerate murderers for the same reason we can remove faulty
<br>
bulldozers that drive around unguided, smashing into homes. And
<br>
qualia? Would you lose your moral sensibilities if you could no longer
<br>
hear or see? Neither would I.
<br>
<p>Michael Wilson said: &quot;The basic question here is 'can we create a
<br>
Power we can care about?'.&quot;
<br>
<p>A machine that produces food and water from solar power is not (as
<br>
Michael put it) &quot;sentient in a way we'd assign moral worth to&quot;, and
<br>
yet it would be incredibly valuable in many places on Earth where
<br>
humans are undernourished. There is no reason to think sentient beings
<br>
are the only objects that matter to other sentient beings, and the
<br>
question dissolves on this realization. Clearly we can and do create
<br>
things we care about, even assuming lack of sentience.
