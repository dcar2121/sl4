<p>
Keith,
<br>
It is my belief that you take evolutionary psychology far too seriously.
<br>
I will try to explain:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Problem is that what humans &quot;actually want&quot; has been shaped by Stone Age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution.  What they want varies depending on external conditions, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the obvious ones like heat when it is cold, but humans &quot;actually
</em><br>
want&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; to make war on neighbors when they have either been attacked *or* have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become convinced that they face &quot;looming privation&quot; (for lack of a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word) due to their perception of falling income per capita.
</em><br>
<p>This is not quite the case. Humans have a tendency to do this, possibly due
<br>
to evolution success of the behaviour. However, within the conscious sphere
<br>
of individuals, if you ask &quot;do you want to make war on your neighbours
<br>
whenever you're in an economic crises?&quot; the answer will, in the vast
<br>
majority of cases, be negative. In fact, as politics is conducted more and
<br>
more on the basis of rational discourse instead of by authority of a few,
<br>
the conscious sphere of the individual becomes more important in relation to
<br>
the hard-wired condition-action reflexes you speak of, and wars become,
<br>
where civilization makes politics public, if not inconceivable, at least
<br>
unfrequent. Example: would you imagine Germany declaring war on its
<br>
neighbours in the near future because its economy is in bad shape?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course you could specify that the AI should only figure out what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstressed humans want.  The problem with that is that they &quot;actually
</em><br>
want&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; things (like children) that set up the conditions that lead to lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stress and eventually wars.
</em><br>
<p>Well, wars are not so much a matter of population excess, but a matter of
<br>
resource growth being insufficient to support population growth with a
<br>
relatively even standard of living. A post-singularity world will, most
<br>
likely, not suffer of decline in standard of living due to population
<br>
growth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And they &quot;actually want&quot; their minds not to be messed with, which makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to edit out either traits leading to wars or children.
</em><br>
<p>These traits do exist, but I believe what Eliezer refers to (and I may be
<br>
mistaken) when he says &quot;to want&quot; is not the behaviourist idea of &quot;that which
<br>
a given agent seeks by its actions&quot;, but &quot;that which an agent expresses to
<br>
want&quot;. So, again: in the conscious sphere of the individual, many of these
<br>
problems are far less important. As for messing with people's minds, people
<br>
do acknowledge that messing with their minds may be in their own interest,
<br>
thus education and psychological/psychiatric therapy.
<br>
<p>--David.
