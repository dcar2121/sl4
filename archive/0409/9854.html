</em><br>
<p>As an agent striving to be non-eudaemonic, could you elaborate on what are 
<br>
the things you value? (Non-instrumentally, that is.)
<br>
<p>Note that in Bostrom's essay, even consciousness itself was classified as 
<br>
eudaemonic. (At least in the case where the supposition, that consciousness 
<br>
isn't necessary for maximizing the efficiency of any optimizing or problem-
<br>
solving process, is true.) Assuming that we are all using the same 
<br>
terminology here, it would seem that consciousness is morally irrelevant to 
<br>
you. What is it then, that to which you assign value, in a world devoid of 
<br>
qualia?
<br>
<p>I do agree with you on the point that there seems to be no objective 
<br>
morality. The qualities I value, however, more or less resemble those 
<br>
mentioned by Bostrom (humor, love, game-playing etc.), and I find his 
<br>
argumentation in The Future of Human Evolution quite forceful.
<br>
<p>The only somewhat relevant drawback with regard to his suggestions that 
<br>
comes to my mind as of now, is that we would indeed be sacrificing some 
<br>
problem-solving efficiency by being eudaumonic. This might pose a problem 
<br>
in some scenarios in which we are competing with external agents presently 
<br>
unknown to us (e.g. extraterrestrial post-singularity civilizations). It 
<br>
would seem like quite the non-trivial question, whether the probability 
<br>
that we are in fact situated in such a scenario, is non-infinitesimal.
<br>
<p>So let's strive to build something FAIish and find out ;)
