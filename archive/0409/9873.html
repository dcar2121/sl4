<em>&gt;and computing power. If there's any sort of competition going on, turning

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the end of most of the stuff we place moral value on. A universe full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perfect rationalists is a universe where all diversity resides solely in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people's goal systems (which may or may not converge); the qualities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'insight', 'creativeness', 'willpower' etc will all dissappear as they are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;revert to 'did this person have an initial utility function that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compassionate under renomralisation'? This is on top of the already known
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm having trouble figuring out why we should worry about this kind of
<br>
problem. We have goal-systems which are sometimes inconsistent, and when
<br>
we need to choose between conflicting goals, we figure out which goal is
<br>
least important and discard it as an obsolete sub-goal. The qualities you
<br>
mention above seem like sub-goals that I would be willing to discard if
<br>
they conflicted with more important goals such as happiness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The CV question could be glibly summarised as 'is there a likely incremental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-improvement path from me to a paperclip optimiser?'. While few people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like paperclips /that/ much, it seems likely that many people would choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to become perfect rationalists without appreciating what they're losing. If
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;If better information would cause people to choose a different path, then
<br>
that suggests that better information would be desirable. But that's a
<br>
normal problem with most decisions, and I don't see how the CV creates
<br>
a different type of problem in that regard.
<br>
&nbsp;Or were you suggesting that we should be upset with the end result if
<br>
fully informed people would decide to follow that path?
