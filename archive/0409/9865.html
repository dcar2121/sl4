<em>&gt;Keith,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is my belief that you take evolutionary psychology far too seriously.
</em><br>
<p>I think very few people including me take it seriously enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I will try to explain:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Problem is that what humans &quot;actually want&quot; has been shaped by Stone Age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolution.  What they want varies depending on external conditions, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just the obvious ones like heat when it is cold, but humans &quot;actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to make war on neighbors when they have either been attacked *or* have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become convinced that they face &quot;looming privation&quot; (for lack of a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; word) due to their perception of falling income per capita.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is not quite the case. Humans have a tendency to do this, possibly due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to evolution success of the behaviour. However, within the conscious sphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of individuals, if you ask &quot;do you want to make war on your neighbours
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whenever you're in an economic crises?&quot; the answer will, in the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;majority of cases, be negative.
</em><br>
<p>The question would never be asked.
<br>
<p>Assume I am right about &quot;looming privation,&quot; i.e., a rotten outlook for a 
<br>
substantial fraction of the population being what drives the psychological 
<br>
traits behind OBL, 9/11 and the rest, including suicide bombers.  Is this 
<br>
mechanism or anything related being discussed *anywhere* besides here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In fact, as politics is conducted more and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more on the basis of rational discourse
</em><br>
<p>The exact point of this model is that &quot;rational&quot; to the extent we have it 
<br>
gets switched off on favor of &quot;rationalization.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;instead of by authority of a few,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the conscious sphere of the individual becomes more important in relation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the hard-wired condition-action reflexes you speak of, and wars become,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where civilization makes politics public, if not inconceivable, at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfrequent. Example: would you imagine Germany declaring war on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighbours in the near future because its economy is in bad shape?
</em><br>
<p>Man what a question.  It depends on what you mean by &quot;near future.&quot;  There 
<br>
is a substantial time constant, years to a decade or more, after general 
<br>
perception of &quot;looming privation&quot; before some xenophobic meme is amplified 
<br>
up to the point the population goes into or at least will support attack 
<br>
mode.  The *last time* this happened in Germany, the communist meme was a 
<br>
solid contender against the Nazi meme fairly late in the game.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Of course you could specify that the AI should only figure out what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unstressed humans want.  The problem with that is that they &quot;actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things (like children) that set up the conditions that lead to lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stress and eventually wars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, wars are not so much a matter of population excess, but a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resource growth being insufficient to support population growth with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relatively even standard of living.
</em><br>
<p>It might take a slightly rising standard of living, i.e., income per capita 
<br>
moderately well distributed to keep xenophobic meme gain down or to shut 
<br>
off war mode in a population.  But that's a fair statement of the thesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A post-singularity world will, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely, not suffer of decline in standard of living due to population
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth.
</em><br>
<p>There are people (like Robin Hanson at one time) who argue that a post 
<br>
singularity world could be terribly poor because all it takes is one 
<br>
persons with the idea that it would be groovy to have a zillion of 
<br>
him.  Potentially this is much worse than high birth rates that at worst 
<br>
double the population every 15 years.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the *real* problems close to and through the singularity are 
<br>
going to be different from anything we have anticipated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And they &quot;actually want&quot; their minds not to be messed with, which makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hard to edit out either traits leading to wars or children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These traits do exist, but I believe what Eliezer refers to (and I may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistaken) when he says &quot;to want&quot; is not the behaviourist idea of &quot;that which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a given agent seeks by its actions&quot;, but &quot;that which an agent expresses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I think the first scares me a little less than the second.  At least if 
<br>
things are looking good, war mode stays in the background (until you are 
<br>
attacked that is).
<br>
<p>As for what people express . . . .  <a href="http://holysmoke.org/c-span-23sep2004.mp3">http://holysmoke.org/c-span-23sep2004.mp3</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, again: in the conscious sphere of the individual, many of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems are far less important. As for messing with people's minds, people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do acknowledge that messing with their minds may be in their own interest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thus education and psychological/psychiatric therapy.
</em><br>
<p>What you say is true, but I really doubt it reaches the evolved 
<br>
psychological traits level to much of an extent.  *Maybe* people will make 
<br>
such changes when we really have the tools.  Minsky for one does not think 
<br>
a lot of the idea.
<br>
<p>Analogy is always suspect, but knowledge about metabolism and the digestive 
<br>
system does not keep you from getting hungry and knowledge about the 
<br>
psychological mechanisms behind the breaking of pair bonds in childless 
<br>
relations probably won't save many such relations.
<br>
<p>But in any case, I really appreciate anyone willing to stick their oar in 
<br>
on such a sticky subject.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
