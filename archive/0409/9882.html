</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<p>This is a sub-goal stomp.  As far as the platform of the human mind is
<br>
concerned, happiness can be viewed as a sub-goal of survival (itself a
<br>
sub-goal of reproduction), as its intesity correlates with actions
<br>
that are likely to result in increased reproductory success in the EEA
<br>
(i.e. you can't reproduce if you're dead).  
<br>
<p>Based on the first part of your quote above, I infer that you might be
<br>
indicating that the strategy of analyzing our goals for consistency
<br>
will renormalize our sense of happiness, and I'd agree that to some
<br>
degree it can.  The problem lies in that our minds are more-or-less a
<br>
finely-tuned mess.  
<br>
<p>While the neocortex has had a great deal of time to adapt to the
<br>
limbic brain and utilize its capabilities to a reasonable extent, the
<br>
limbic brain is pretty entrenched, since it has spent the majority of
<br>
it's own evolution outside of the existence of the neocortex.  In
<br>
order for the limbic brain to adapt fundamentally to the more recent
<br>
presence of the neocortex would involve a reworking so deep that doing
<br>
so would render the intermediate stages inoperable.  Any adaptation
<br>
would tend to involve surface variations and newly emerging complex
<br>
functional adaptations, and ignore existing core complex functional
<br>
adaptations.  So outside of EEA-compatible situations, we cannot
<br>
always trust the accuracy of our sense of happiness at directing our
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p>The situation you mention is also a limited wireheading event, since
<br>
happiness is effectively an aggregate metric, contributed to by a
<br>
myriad of mental sub-modules indirectly suporting maximum reproductory
<br>
success.  By elevating to a super-goal priority the maximization of
<br>
such a metric, you've introduced a strange loop into your goal system.
<br>
<p><p>That might not be a good idea if you consider consistency to be a
<br>
desireable thing.
