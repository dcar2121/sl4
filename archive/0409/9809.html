<p><p>I myself am undecided on if this is a good idea for camoflage or not. On 
<br>
the first hand, you would never have to worry about going from say, a 
<br>
forest into a house and having on forest camo instead of urban, or such. 
<br>
On the other hand, movement is a dead give away with something like 
<br>
this, and i'm not sure how it'd look from many different angles.
<br>
<p>That being said, though, there are applications where radar is not the 
<br>
primary threat to an aircraft - for example, the helicopters shot down 
<br>
in iraq. And while night-time operations are good for stealth, thier not 
<br>
always viable. Suprisingly, perhaps, i see an easy application for this 
<br>
that hasn't been mentioned: much better camoflage netting, to cover over 
<br>
installations, vehicles, and troops in the field from aerial surveillence.
<br>
<p>Still though, even with all that, i don't forsee invisibility being all 
<br>
that important except in a few unique cases where other technology may 
<br>
work better. And we should be moving - increasingly - towards having 
<br>
fewer and fewer actual humans on the battle field anyway, and having 
<br>
more UAV's, and even remote-controlled tanks and other vehicles.
<br>
<p>Just a thought,
<br>
