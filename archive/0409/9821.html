Lloyd St Amand, MP

Brantford, Ontario
<br>
Canada
<br>
<p>Dear Sir:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to implore you to assist a refugee
<br>
from political persecution. His name is Keith
<br>
Henson, and his crime is spreading knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am acquainted with Keith through my membership
<br>
in an online discussion group called SL4, where
<br>
people far smarter than myself discuss the future
<br>
of the human race. I consider this adequate
<br>
evidence of high character.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in Toronto now, because he was railroaded
<br>
in California in a case of ‘interfering with
<br>
religion' (a misdemeanor in California), and has
<br>
been threatened with death once in prison.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadian citizens, I understand, view the
<br>
current state of their neighbor to the south with
<br>
alarm. Many down here do also. There are a number
<br>
of systemic problems leading the United States
<br>
into a condition of, let's be honest, corrupt
<br>
fascist (government-by-corporation) control. As I
<br>
see it, there are two issues of importance in the
<br>
Henson case which relate to the present crisis of
<br>
democracy.
<br>
1.) Religious groups here enjoy privileges and
<br>
power which some all too readily abuse.
<br>
2.) Intellectual property (copyrights and
<br>
patents) have expanded unreasonably to beget a
<br>
system of ‘intellectual feudalism' in which
<br>
greedy elites fence off the last field of
<br>
freedom: ideas.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith Henson was singled out for destruction by
<br>
an organization which uses the mask of religion
<br>
for worldly gain, uses the courts as a weapon,
<br>
spends large sums to ruin critics, and uses
<br>
copyright law to prevent critics from
<br>
disseminating its materials (how can one critique
<br>
what one is forbidden to reprint?)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no need to harp on the cancerous influence
<br>
of false prophets in political discourse. I am
<br>
confident you know the names of Falwell,
<br>
Robertson, Moon, and Ashcroft. Instead I call
<br>
your attention to the matter, yet unrecognized by
<br>
most observers, of the closing of the
<br>
intellectual commons and the theft of thought.
<br>
<p>I take the following quote from an excellent
<br>
essay called Against Intellectual Property, which
<br>
you may read in full at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.deoxy.org/aip.htm">http://www.deoxy.org/aip.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Scientology is a religion in which only certain
<br>
members at advanced stages of enlightenment have
<br>
access to special information, which is secret to
<br>
others. Scientology has long been controversial,
<br>
with critics maintaining that it exploits
<br>
members. Some critics, including former
<br>
Scientologists, have put secret documents from
<br>
advanced stages on the Internet. In response,
<br>
church officials invoked copyright. Police have
<br>
raided homes of critics, seizing computers, disks
<br>
and other equipment. This is all rather curious,
<br>
since the stated purpose of copyright is not to
<br>
bide (sp: hide?) information but rather to
<br>
stimulate production of new ideas.8
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Wendy M. Grossman, &quot;alt.scientology.war,&quot;
<br>
Wired, Vol. 3, No. 12, December 1995, pp,
<br>
172-177, 248-252.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these and other reasons, I am very sad to
<br>
say, the United States of America, once the
<br>
destination of those fleeing tyranny, is becoming
<br>
instead a departure point. And so I write to you,
<br>
asking you to appeal to the Minister of
<br>
Citizenship and Immigration that Keith Henson may
<br>
remain free of deportation, and asking that any
<br>
bounty hunters sent to take him be detained as
<br>
hostile foreign agents.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for myself, I will join others here in the
<br>
task of making this nation a place where Keith
<br>
Henson (and the rest of us) can once again live
<br>
in freedom.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your consideration,
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Tom Buckner
<br>
Holden, Massachusetts
<br>
