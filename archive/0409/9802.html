By John Robert Marlow
<br>
<p>This book is on topic here being fiction about the Singularity, having 
<br>
Vernor Vinge on the back cover and Eliezer in the acknowledgments.
<br>
<p>And Vinge is right in what he says,  the book will make a spectacular movie.
<br>
<p>But oh man is it painful to read.  Not because of the story line.  Even if 
<br>
a bit predictable it's ok for Matrix type violent adventure.
<br>
<p>The problem is the &quot;science,&quot; or rather what is supposed to pass for science.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology is not magic and most of my complaints are about gross 
<br>
violation of conservation of mass, thermodynamics, mass flows, doubling 
<br>
times and the like.  But that's not all the places it will irritate 
<br>
you.  On page 133 the good guys are trying to see who the bad guys are by 
<br>
analyzing a depleted uranium bullet.  &quot;We should have a signature on the 
<br>
uranium by the end of the day; from there we'll have the nation and reactor 
<br>
core of origin.&quot;
<br>
<p>I know what this story bit is imitating--Tom Clancy's excellent &quot;Sum of all 
<br>
Fears&quot; where the origin of plutonium in a bomb is determined.  But depleted 
<br>
uranium that's used for things like bullets never went near a 
<br>
reactor.  It's &quot;depleted&quot; of the easy to fission isotope U235.  This is the 
<br>
kind of error a knowledgeable editor should have caught.
<br>
<p>In another place Marlow describes an invisible aircraft, one that has light 
<br>
emitters on it that make the surface of the aircraft look like the 
<br>
background and the story line makes use of the invisible properties of the 
<br>
aircraft.  It is reasonable to assume that we could eventually have 
<br>
aircraft surfaces that can display the view blocked by the aircraft.  But 
<br>
if you think about it, to do this you have to know exactly what direction 
<br>
you want to fool someone.  Otherwise, you don't know what background to 
<br>
present.  This is applying pre high school geometry and a bit of logic.
<br>
<p>The scenes with nanotechnology devices are every bit as bad.  Toward the 
<br>
end of the book he has nano disassemblers eating away at a sea port 
<br>
city.  In a short time they have created a hole where massive amounts of 
<br>
sea water is pouring in.  So where did a fair fraction of a cubic mile of 
<br>
dirt go?
<br>
<p>Early in the book the hero stops a car in seconds by growing a huge redwood 
<br>
tree in the middle of the street.  Now, nanotechnology *can* grow redwoods 
<br>
a good deal faster than the natural way, but not *that* fast, not starting 
<br>
with a tenth of a cubic centimeter of nano machines.  Eric Drexler makes a 
<br>
case for doubling in an energy- and material-rich environment of 20 
<br>
minutes.  Estimating a redwood at meter square by 100 meters tall, growing 
<br>
from a 0.1 cc is an expansion of a billion, 10 exp 9.   Since 10 exp 3 is 
<br>
about 2 exp 10, we are talking 30 doubling, ten hours by Drexler's estimate.
<br>
<p>And you don't even want to think about Marlow's understanding of 
<br>
thermodynamics.  Someone told him that heat is a problem when making nano 
<br>
things fast.  So he &quot;solves&quot; it thus:
<br>
<p>&quot;Thermal problems?&quot;  . . . . &quot;If it becomes a problem you assemble water 
<br>
for evaporative cooling, then grab the atoms in the vapor and do it over 
<br>
again.&quot;
<br>
<p>*Sigh.*
<br>
<p>(Grabbing the vapor returns every bit of heat evaporation took away, and 
<br>
&quot;assembling&quot; water from atoms releases the searing heat of an oxy hydrogen 
<br>
flame.)
<br>
<p>I am reminded of the first &quot;chemistry&quot; teacher I had in high school.  First 
<br>
day he told us that boiling water was a chemical reaction that broke up the 
<br>
water into hydrogen and oxygen which was called &quot;steam.&quot;
<br>
<p>About half way into the first semester the FBI took him away.  Fortunately 
<br>
for Mr. Marlow they don't do that for authors making mistakes.  &lt;grin&gt;
<br>
<p>The shame is that with some advice on science and engineering the story 
<br>
could have been written so that it didn't violate physical laws and been 
<br>
just as exciting.
<br>
<p>As Dr. Vinge says, it will make a spectacular movie.  But if you know even 
<br>
a little about science and engineering reading the book will irritate the 
<br>
heck out of you.
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
<br>
<p>PS  If you want an example of high adventure that does not violate physical 
<br>
laws try _The Revolution from Rosinante_ by Alexis A Gilliland.  A bit 
<br>
dated (1981) but still it has an excellent treatment of computers that 
<br>
transcend humans and are starting to take care of them the way humans take 
<br>
care of cats.
