<p>
My sc-fi saga is set around 30 years in the future and
<br>
tells the tale of the last 10-years before the
<br>
Singularity.  SL4 er's might find my time-frames a bit
<br>
conservative, but bear in mind that in order to make a
<br>
good story I had to go with a 'slower take-off'
<br>
scenario.  The final book culminates in a big
<br>
show-down between an Friendly SAI ('Mithras') and an
<br>
unfriendly SAI ('Taurus').  Can you guess who wins?
<br>
<p>I'll post my book-blurbs here:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>General:
<br>
<p>United States, 2036.  Radical advances in
<br>
bio-technology, nano-technology and info-technology
<br>
are challenging human nature.  In a world where smart
<br>
dolphins and genetically engineered humans exist
<br>
alongside intelligent machines, many people find the
<br>
new technologies profoundly disturbing.    Mean while
<br>
globalization has lead to the decline of the nation
<br>
state, as trans-national organizations grow more
<br>
powerful than countries, and elements of many cultures
<br>
are becoming intermingled.  It's a dangerous,
<br>
anarchistic time as the wildly differing visions of
<br>
many philosophies compete.  Terrorism, espionage and
<br>
techno-conflicts are rife as all groups vie to achieve
<br>
their chosen vision for the world.  The race is on for
<br>
the ultimate technological break-through to ensure
<br>
victory in an explosive clash of world-views which
<br>
will determine the fate of humanity.
<br>
<p>Book 1.  Working title:  &quot;Revolution Source Code&quot;
<br>
<p>United States, 2036.  It's a period of explosive
<br>
scientific and technological advance.  Genetic
<br>
engineers have created intelligent dolphins and
<br>
super-smart humans.  Bio-tech has revolutionized
<br>
medicine with drugs and treatments which can alter
<br>
personality cure many diseases and radically extend
<br>
life human span.  Artificial intelligence researchers
<br>
are developing genuinely conscious machines.  But it's
<br>
also a time of great political and economic
<br>
instability.  The world is threatening to unravel into
<br>
anarchy.  'Natural harmony' movements consisting of
<br>
religious conservatives and radical greens are opposed
<br>
to the technologies which threaten to change the very
<br>
fabric of human nature.  The ‘World Federalists' want
<br>
a world government but Libertarians want everyone to
<br>
live free.  Increasingly violent acts of terrorism and
<br>
civil war abroad point to a nefarious plot being
<br>
hatched within the U.S.  Can the plot be uncovered in
<br>
time to prevent disaster?
<br>
<p>Book 2.  Working title:  &quot;Cyber-Labyrinthine&quot;
<br>
<p>Former United States, 2041.  The Federal government
<br>
has collapsed in the wake of devastating terror
<br>
attacks from a radical sect of the 'Natural Harmony'
<br>
movement.  The most important figures from the former
<br>
government have joined with the Californian 'World
<br>
Federalists' and they are now calling for the
<br>
restoration of the Union.  But many states now wish to
<br>
purse an independent existence, drawing inspiration
<br>
from New Hampshire, the heart-land of Libertarian
<br>
power.  Libertarians and Federalists are now engaged
<br>
in a dangerous 'techno arms race' as the aims of the
<br>
two movements increasingly diverge.  A labyrinthine
<br>
game of intrigue and espionage occurs in cyberspace as
<br>
each group strives for dominance.  The two sides race
<br>
to develop more powerful artificial intelligences.   
<br>
Will it come to civil war?
<br>
<p>Book 3.  Working title:  &quot;Cyborg Jungle&quot;
<br>
<p>2043.  A civil war between the New Hampshire
<br>
Libertarians and the Californian Federalists has
<br>
rocked the former United States.  A truce negotiated
<br>
by artificial intelligences now maintains an uneasy
<br>
peace.  But the conflict has gone global.  Devastating
<br>
civil wars are ripping China apart and Federalists and
<br>
Libertarians from around the world intervene.  The two
<br>
camps are engaged in an international battle of wits
<br>
to form grand alliances, pitting cybernetic and
<br>
genetically enhanced people against one another.  The
<br>
chief strategists are the artificial intelligences
<br>
'Mithras' for the Libertarians and 'Taurus' for the
<br>
Federalists and the power of these two alien
<br>
intellects continues to grow thanks to the efforts of
<br>
the two opposing eccentric human geniuses who created
<br>
them.  Which side will achieve the decisive advantage?
<br>
<p>Book 4.  Working title: &quot;Battlefield Singularity&quot;
<br>
<p>2045.  The World Federalist Alliance has declared
<br>
World Government and launched all-out war against the
<br>
World Libertarian Alliance.  The hammer strikes
<br>
hardest in the former U.S state of New Hampshire as
<br>
the WFA seeks to finally crush the seat of Libertarian
<br>
power.  The cataclysmic clash will decide the fate of
<br>
the world and the conflict takes place all the way
<br>
from the under-sea ocean colony to the international
<br>
moon-base, fought with nano-weapons of terrifying
<br>
power.  But the final outcome will be decided by the
<br>
two non-human commander-in-chiefs:  artificial
<br>
intelligences which have grown so powerful they are
<br>
rapidly approaching the super-human level.  Will the
<br>
Friendly-A.I 'Mithras' defeat the now psychopathic
<br>
un-Friendly A.I 'Taurus' and usher in a new era of
<br>
unprecedented peace and prosperity or will a new age
<br>
of darkness cover the world?
