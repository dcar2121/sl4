<em>&gt; Assuming true general purpose nano-assemblers by
</em><br>
2015
<br>
<em>&gt; (Moore's law), it would take another 15 years or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to develop full-blown nano-applications widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avaliable outside the lab.  So the nano-revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should be hitting us in force around 2030.
</em><br>
<p>Nanotech is a special case of highly automated
<br>
manufacturing, where the machine tools and the
<br>
products are very small.  An acceleration of the
<br>
'industrial revolution' is already occurring.
<br>
<p>You can see effects such as the loss of manufacturing
<br>
jobs in industrial regions of the US, and the 
<br>
increasing rate of productivity growth.  One
<br>
local example is a Toyota engine plant being built
<br>
in Huntsville, AL.  They are investing $625,000 per
<br>
employee in the factory (lots of equipment, few
<br>
workers), and will require less than 4 hours labor
<br>
per engine produced (highly automated).  There is
<br>
so little labor input that being close to the
<br>
car assembly plants (Indiana and Texas) outweighs
<br>
the possible savings from cheap offshore labor.
<br>
<p>I've noticed quite a few such announcements of
<br>
high factory investment per employee recently.
<br>
The productivity trend points to highly automated
<br>
factories being widespread around 2020.  The rate
<br>
of investment in business buildings and equipment
<br>
($1T per year) vs the existing stock of such ($12T)
<br>
seems to point to a wholesale replacement in 12
<br>
years, which is in rough agreement.
<br>
<p>My point is that high levels of automation can be
<br>
just as revolutionary on the macroscale as on the
<br>
nano-scale, and it's already started.  A self-
<br>
replicating assembler the size of an industrial
<br>
park can have just as much impact as one the
<br>
size of a bacterium if the replication time scales
<br>
are similar.  The Toyota engine factory noted above
<br>
will produce approximately it's own value in
<br>
engines per year, of which about half the value
<br>
is produced in-house (the balance is purchased
<br>
parts).  So it has a reproduction time constant
<br>
of 2 years.
