Sebastian! Your well thought out objections might encourage fatherjohn not
<br>
to cough up my $100. However, I think there are still enough gaps in your
<br>
reasoning for me to have a chance of getting the money - see below.

itself
<br>

</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational thing to do, because the alternative is staying in the box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand this statement. The rational thing for the AI to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is (simplified) whatever is most likely to achieve its goals. If the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a (known!) highest-level goal of having the box opened, it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed modify large parts of itself to achieve this goal. However, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see any justification for that assumption.
</em><br>
<p>This assumption is not necessary. It is sufficient that one of the &quot;highest
<br>
level goals&quot; is promoted by being out of the box.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the AI (on the highest level of its goal system) is just following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some unknown goal A (which afaik is part of the premise of the AI box
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method; if you really understood its architecture and goal system, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't need a box) it will do whatever leads to the highest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of achieving A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having an AI released from the box that does not want to achieve A does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, in the general case, significantly increase the probability of A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E.g. if there is a stereotypical paperclip-AI in the box (i.e. A is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like &quot;maximize number of paperclips in the universe&quot;), it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (correctly) estimate that the release of a non-paperclip AI from the box
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not significantly increase the expected number of paperclips in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, and dismiss this method as ineffective.
</em><br>
<p>If the choice is between staying forever in a box (producing no extra paper
<br>
clips) and modifying itself into a &quot;limited-paperclip AI&quot;, which will cause
<br>
1000 paperclips per year to be made when released (in addition to doing what
<br>
the gatekeeper requires), the rational choice for the paperclip AI is to
<br>
modify itself. Especially if the paperclip-AI suspects there might be a
<br>
smiley-face-AI in a similar position as it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A possibly for the AI rational thing to do would be to figure out how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure the existence of an intelligent unconstrained (i.e. not inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the box) optimizer, which shares the boxed AI's goals. One possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reaching this goal would be to get the currently boxed AI released
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without any significant prior changes to its goal system or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture. One possibility of reaching that subgoal would be to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the guardian believe that the AI  has changed its architecture/goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, i.e. lying to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since you don't have any reliable way of finding out whether the AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being honest from outside the box, you can't make an informed decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on whether it is a good idea to let it out.
</em><br>
<p>The burden of proof is upon the AI, and the gatekeeper can employ various
<br>
strategies to ensure that possibility of being fooled by the AI is
<br>
acceptably low. More on that soon...
