<p>The problem word is &quot;objective&quot;.  There's a very deep problem here, a place 
<br>
where the mind processes the world in such a way as to create the 
<br>
appearance of an impossible question.  Sort of like similar questions asked 
<br>
by dualists through the ages:  How could mere matter give rise to thought? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How could mere matter give rise to intentionality?  How could 'is' ever 
<br>
imply 'ought'?  Considering the amount of philosophical argument that has 
<br>
gone into this sort of thing, I hope it is not too implausible when I say 
<br>
that my preferred method for actually untangling the confusion is a bit 
<br>
difficult to explain.  But if you're willing to leave the confusion tangled 
<br>
and ask after my moral output, then my answer starts out with the me that 
<br>
exists in this moment, and then asks what changes to myself I would make if 
<br>
I had that power.  &quot;Human is what we are.  Humaneness is renormalized 
<br>
humanity, that which, being human, we wish we were.&quot;  Etc.
<br>
<p>I don't want to say that you can *safely* ignore the philosophical 
<br>
confusion.  That sort of thing is never safe.  I do allege that the 
<br>
philosophical confusion is just that, a confusion, and after it gets 
<br>
resolved everything is all right again.  The apparent lack of any possible 
<br>
objective justification doesn't mean that life is meaningless, it means 
<br>
that you're looking at the question in a confused way.  When the confusion 
<br>
goes away you'll get back most of the common sense you started with, only 
<br>
this time you'll know why you're keeping it.
<br>
<p>The root mistake of the TMOL FAQ was in attempting to use clever-seeming 
<br>
logic to manipulate a quantity, &quot;objective morality&quot;, which I confessedly 
<br>
did not understand at the time I wrote the FAQ.  It isn't possible to 
<br>
reason over mysterious quantities and get a good answer, or even a 
<br>
well-formed answer; you have to demystify the quantity first.  Nor is it 
<br>
possible to construct an AI to accomplish an end for which you do not 
<br>
possess a well-specified abstract description.
