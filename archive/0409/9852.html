Mithraism still got stomped didn't it?  I imagine it got absorbed to the same superficial extent Christianity absorbed any strong competing religion, and the demi-god idea, best I can tell comes from the Gospel of John.  Whether that was written late enough to be influenced, or whether it drew on some other source, (Mithraism didn't form in a vacuum- neither did Christianity) I don't know.  U think the absorption was partial, because Mithraism, stemming from Eastern and not Semitic mystery cults had a cyclical world-view, not an eschatological one, which makes a pretty big difference, and Chrisitanity drops the nine levels of intiation in favor of the damned/saved binary state.

<p>The way I hear it, Mithraism was a widespread

cult among the Roman army and Christianity
<br>
absorbed it; and that many of the more
<br>
'supernatural' ideas in Christianity (that Jesus
<br>
was a demigod, in essence) came from Mithraism.
