Re: Fermi Paradox
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Possibility: we're really the first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the extremely unfriendly planetary systems we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have seen so far, this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks increasingly likely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The extrasolar planets we have found so far are
<br>
a biased sample due to the way we have been looking
<br>
for them.  We don't have much data relevant to
<br>
addressing the 'intelligent life is rare' answer
<br>
to the Fermi Paradox yet, but it is finally coming
<br>
in.
<br>
<p>The current methods used to find extrasolar planets
<br>
involve looking for a wobble in the star or a
<br>
dimming in the star's light.  Astrometry measures
<br>
the side-to-side wobble of a star under the gravity
<br>
of a planet or brown dwarf.  Spectroscopy measures
<br>
the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines
<br>
towards and away from us from the same cause.
<br>
<p>Both methods are biased towards heavy objects.
<br>
Astrometry is also biased to objects in wide orbits,
<br>
since it produces larger wobbles in the star.
<br>
Spectroscopy is biased to small orbits, since it
<br>
produces larger doppler shifts in the star.  Neither
<br>
method is capable of locating earth-mass objects
<br>
at present.
<br>
<p>The third method involves looking for the dimming
<br>
of a star's light as a planet transits in front of
<br>
it.  Transits are rare, since the planet's orbit
<br>
has to be aligned edge on from our point of view,
<br>
and even then they occur on the order of 1/1000 of
<br>
the orbit period.  Therefore you have to monitor
<br>
a lot of stars for extended periods to find one.
<br>
<p>Automated telescopes with big CCDs have only recently
<br>
(a few years) been able to do this kind of search,
<br>
and results are just starting to come in.
<br>
<p>The fourth and most obvious method, direct observation
<br>
via imaging, is very difficult due to the glare of
<br>
the star.  There is one disputed sighting of a
<br>
planet visually.  There are telescopes and missions
<br>
planned in the next ten years or so that should
<br>
be able to succeed with visual searches.
<br>
<p>There is a well known size distribution law in
<br>
astronomical circles both for stars and for smaller
<br>
objects in our solar system.  It is observed that
<br>
the number of objects goes as some power (around
<br>
-2.5 if I remember right) of the diameter or mass.
<br>
That means there are lots more small objects than
<br>
large ones.  The hundred or so extrasolar planets
<br>
found so far, when you correct for observation
<br>
bias and allow for the still large uncertainties
<br>
in their sizes, seem to be following a similar law.
<br>
<p>This is encouraging, since it implies for every
<br>
planet we are finding in the 0.3-80 Jupiter mass
<br>
range, there should be multiple planets in the
<br>
0.0003-0.03 Jupiter (0.1 to 10 Earth) mass range.
<br>
<p>In the next 5-10 years we should be able to assign
<br>
realistic values to the term f(p) [fraction of
<br>
stars with planets] in the Drake Equation.  The
<br>
next term, [fraction of planets that can support
<br>
life], will take a little longer to move from
<br>
the stage of 'guess with no data' to 'estimate with
<br>
some data'.
