<em>&gt;  From Cosma Shalizi's review of Deborah G. Mayo, &quot;Error and the Growth

<em>&gt; of Experimental Knowledge&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Bayesians not only assign such probabilities, they do so a priori, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condensing their prejudices into real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two Bayesians cannot meet without smiling at each other's priors. True,

<em>&gt; they can shown that, in the limit of presenting an infinite amount of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (consistent) evidence, the priors &quot;wash out&quot; (provided they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;non-extreme,&quot; not 0 or 1 to start with); but it has also been shown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, &quot;for any body of evidence there are prior probabilities in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis H that, while nonextreme, will result in the two scientists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having posterior probabilities in H that differ by as much as one wants&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (p. 84n, Mayo's emphasis). This is discouraging, to say the least, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accords very poorly with the way that scientists actually do come to

<em>&gt; agree, very quickly, on the value and implications of pieces of

<em>&gt; evidence. Bayesian reconstructions of episodes in the history of

</em><br>
<p>Call it a wild guess, but I guess you found this page by googling on 
<br>
&quot;Bayesian Way&quot;, just as I did a couple of years ago.
<br>
<p>The simple reply is that Kolmogorov complexity makes a fine prior (with a 
<br>
bit of tweaking you can make the distribution over all computations add up 
<br>
to 1) and this formalism, known as Solomonoff induction, is that which 
<br>
Occam's Razor approximates.
<br>
<p>The deeper, more philosophical reply is, (a), Cox's Theorem establishes 
<br>
that you must use Bayesian updating of your probabilities if your reasoning 
<br>
is to obey simple consistency axioms and this would not be ambiguous even 
<br>
if priors were; (b) abandoning Bayesian consistency would hardly make the 
<br>
problem *more* objective; (c) a Bayesian strives to attain the best 
<br>
possible calibration of prior probabilities just as one strives for the 
<br>
best possible calibration in posterior probabilities, and just because 
<br>
mathematicians haven't *yet* all agreed on which formal, universal process 
<br>
to pick for doing this, doesn't change the goal or its importance; (d) one 
<br>
who seeks to attain the Way strives to calibrate probabilities as best as 
<br>
possible, to milk every last bit of accuracy and precision from the 
<br>
guesstimates, and this goal takes precedence over convincing others that 
<br>
you are using an objective method; and of course (e) Kolmogorov's Razor 
<br>
makes a fine prior.
