<p>Well, by &quot;comparable&quot;, I mean that no single group can afford
<br>
to completely ignore the efforts of all the others against them.
<br>
<p>On this scale, all nuclear powers (and some others) in today's
<br>
world are comparable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This isn't precisely an argument for a &quot;Sysop&quot;, but rather, an

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is also my view.  It's just that without nanotech, there's
<br>
no real hope of being able to go far enough to be unavailable to
<br>
those desirous of conflict.  Basically, my whole problem with
<br>
SAI building is that it seems to be, by the admission of those
<br>
involved, a winner-take-all proposition right now.  Even if
<br>
molecular manufacturing was certain to decimate 99% of the human
<br>
race, it would be better than an SAI with a 99% chance of being
<br>
benign.  However, if FTL is possible, we may have to face that
<br>
choice anyway.
<br>
<p>Anyway, all this is SL3 or worse, I'm sure, so I'll shut up now. :)
