<p>That's what I used to think; this I why I used to be dismissive of
<br>
abstract reasoning theory. However your analysis only applies to
<br>
methods of reasoning known to be normative for complete information
<br>
and unbounded computing power; even AIXI can do better than that
<br>
(it's normative for infinite computing power but limited information,
<br>
though only for restricted classes of utility function). I am now
<br>
talking about approaching /the/ normative reasoning strategy for
<br>
arbitrarily (but not trivially) bounded T, L and information. I think
<br>
it's highly likely that transhumans would discover and prove the full
<br>
theory and once we do I suspect it will be what people mean when they
<br>
refer to 'general intelligence'. In the mean time, we're starting to
<br>
see through the cogsci haze to some promising looking close
<br>
approximations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The economics of the situation do not allow a flat normative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution over the varied and changing landscape in which we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find ourselves now.
</em><br>
<p>'Flat' wouldn't be the word I'd use, but there is a normative solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best we can do is apply a form of &quot;bounded rationality&quot; where we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply current knowledge and strategies, however incomplete but growing, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an increasingly diverse environment.
</em><br>
<p>Everything that's worthwhile in AI will be implicit in the full
<br>
normative theory. Whatever strategy is best suited to a particular
<br>
problem, a normative reasoner will converge as soon as the
<br>
available feedback information can distinguish it from the other
<br>
possible strategies. All of the complicated cognitive complexity we've
<br>
been talking about putting into an AGI is still necessary both to
<br>
reduce the bootstrap time and more importantly so that the programmers
<br>
have a clue what's going on (particularly, so we know how to define
<br>
goals).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rather than try to extrapolate from what we know now and then normalize,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we must study the ever-changing rules of the game and then optimize.
</em><br>
<p>Friendly AI appears to require that we do both; unfortunately UFAI does
<br>
not, though doing so greatly increases the chances of building any sort
<br>
of AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, the far future environment and challenges will have little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship with current human values and concerns.
</em><br>
<p>For the superficial stuff that constitutes public issues and the
<br>
intermediate complexity of extant moral systems and philosophical debate
<br>
I agree. However I am not so sure about breaking our reference class for
<br>
'volitional sentient' and fundamentals. While I am prepared to trust a
<br>
competent implementation of CV to select between universes I can't
<br>
comprehend, I'm concerned that the 'volition' part might evaporate half-way
<br>
through the extrapolation, leaving a result that I no longer care about.
