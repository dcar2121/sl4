<p>I agree that the debate is about the relative order of
<br>
working examples, but I think that the relative dangers
<br>
involved are quite relevant.  In particular, while newly
<br>
built nanofactories will certainly allow a brute forcing
<br>
of the AI problem at some point, it seems clear that
<br>
building vehicles sufficient to leave the vicinity will
<br>
be effective immediately (essentially), as that problem
<br>
is well understood, unlike the AI problem.  In any case,
<br>
it seems like a simple grid choice to me, where one axis
<br>
is limit on travel (FTL or STL), and the other which
<br>
technology comes to fruition first (MNT or AI).  In an
<br>
FTL world, FAI is the only apparent hope of surviving the
<br>
advent of AI.  In an STL world, however, MNT can be a
<br>
sufficient technology for surviving unFriendly AI, for
<br>
some.  Since we appear to live in an STL world, I prefer
<br>
MNT first.
