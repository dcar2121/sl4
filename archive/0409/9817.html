<p>
Actually Keith is *desperate* for help.
<br>
<p>I got turned down on my refugee claim an incredible 10 months after the 
<br>
last hearing.  But after that my appeal to the Canadian federal courts was 
<br>
almost instantly rejected.
<br>
<p>So at this point I am a &quot;failed refugee.&quot;  The only thing that can keep me 
<br>
from being deported to the US on short notice is an appeal to the Minister 
<br>
of Citizenship and Immigration.  Her office gets 15,000 letters a week so 
<br>
it takes a well known case to reach the level where it gets attention.
<br>
<p>Now you say, being deported to the US isn't so bad.  Well in my case it 
<br>
is.  Here is testimony obtained about a week ago.  It is from May 13, 
<br>
2004.  A Toronto cop is being quizzed by my lawyer about events when I came 
<br>
here three and a half years ago (Robert K Schwarz is the deputy DA who 
<br>
prosecuted the case against me with the help of a former Mafia lawyer.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.  I don't think you need to go into that.  I
<br>
think we're all aware of that.  Did Mr. Schwarz  did you ask
<br>
him if he was going to take any steps to extradite Mr. Henson?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  Yes, I did.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.  And he responded that he wasn't?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  He said the State of California would not
<br>
extradite Mr. Henson from Canada, however, if Mr. Henson was
<br>
found to be in another State, such as New York, then they would
<br>
probably proceed with extradition requests from New York.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.  I see.  But he made it clear to you that they
<br>
have no intention to try to extradite him from Canada?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  It came down to a matter of cost, dollars and
<br>
cents.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.  He wasn't candid enough to admit that they
<br>
couldn't extradite him from Canada?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  No.  He just said that the State of
<br>
California would not extradite Mr. Henson from Canada…
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.  I see.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  … because of the cost.
<br>
<p>Of course scientology would be footing the bill.  Someone who has been 
<br>
sentenced does not have to be extradited, they can just be kidnapped by 
<br>
bounty hunters.  And cult agents have made fairly clear public threats that 
<br>
I would not survive jail.
<br>
<p>Considering the depth the cult has corrupted the government of Riverside 
<br>
County, I can hardly look for justice there or even being safe in their 
<br>
jail.  I am about to release information that makes the case that 
<br>
scientology created a jury where most of the members were under their control.
<br>
<p>Ok, if you want to help what to do?
<br>
<p>If you live in Canada, write your MP with a cc to my MP and if you will, a 
<br>
blind cc to me or if you want, post it.  You can ask them asking your MP to 
<br>
pass a copy on to the Minister, Judy Sgro.  You can get your MP from your 
<br>
postal code by going here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=canadaonline&amp;zu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parl.gc.ca%2Finformation%2Fabout%2Fpeople%2Fhouse%2FPostalCode.asp%3Flang%3DE%26amp%3Bsource%3Dsm">http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=canadaonline&amp;zu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parl.gc.ca%2Finformation%2Fabout%2Fpeople%2Fhouse%2FPostalCode.asp%3Flang%3DE%26amp%3Bsource%3Dsm</a><br>
<p>My MP is Lloyd St Amand,  Constituency Address
<br>
<p>98 Paris Road, Unit 3
<br>
Brantford, Ontario
<br>
N3R 1H9
<br>
<p>E-Mail: <a href="mailto:stamal@parl.gc.ca?Subject=Re:%20Keith%20could%20use%20some%20help">stamal@parl.gc.ca</a>
<br>
<p>He says that email and postal mail are given the same attention.
<br>
<p>If you are outside of Canada, supporting email to <a href="mailto:stamal@parl.gc.ca?Subject=Re:%20Keith%20could%20use%20some%20help">stamal@parl.gc.ca</a> asking 
<br>
him to help me stay in Canada would be the way to go.
<br>
<p>If you know me personally or by reputation, put that in your email or 
<br>
letter.  Half a page to a page is more likely to get read, but the length 
<br>
is up to you.

<br>
<p>PS and if anyone wants to read the whole transcript, ask and I will try to 
<br>
get it up on a web site.
