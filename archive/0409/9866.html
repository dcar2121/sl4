<p>Bingo.

</em><br>
<p>I don't even think conflict requires comparable power.   In fact, I can't 
<br>
think of a shooting conflicts in my adult life (post WWII) where the 
<br>
parties had comparable power.  Of course, trying to act half way around the 
<br>
world saps the effective power of even the US.

</em><br>
<p>Good points, but I think it makes the case for distance even more.
<br>
<p>There was a time long ago when I bemoaned the fact that the universe might 
<br>
not permit FLT travel.
<br>
<p>But given nanotech to keep you in good repair even a fraction of c will get 
<br>
you a long ways.
<br>
<p>A problem with the current situation is that there isn't anyplace where you 
<br>
can escape the unwanted attention of a government, especially one acting 
<br>
for a cult.  Going interstellar and *not* having FTL travel restores what I 
<br>
have come to see as a desirable feature--though I could be wrong.  It is 
<br>
possible that people like me would have a string of immortal zombies sent

after them!
