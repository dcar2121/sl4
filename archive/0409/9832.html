I don't understand this statement. The rational thing for the AI to do 
<br>
is (simplified) whatever is most likely to achieve its goals. If the AI 
<br>
had a (known!) highest-level goal of having the box opened, it may 
<br>
indeed modify large parts of itself to achieve this goal. However, I 
<br>
don't see any justification for that assumption.
<br>
If the AI (on the highest level of its goal system) is just following 
<br>
some unknown goal A (which afaik is part of the premise of the AI box 
<br>
method; if you really understood its architecture and goal system, you 
<br>
wouldn't need a box) it will do whatever leads to the highest 
<br>
probability of achieving A.
<br>
Having an AI released from the box that does not want to achieve A does 
<br>
not, in the general case, significantly increase the probability of A 
<br>
happening.
<br>
E.g. if there is a stereotypical paperclip-AI in the box (i.e. A is 
<br>
something like &quot;maximize number of paperclips in the universe&quot;), it will 
<br>
(correctly) estimate that the release of a non-paperclip AI from the box 
<br>
will not significantly increase the expected number of paperclips in the 
<br>
universe, and dismiss this method as ineffective.
<br>
A possibly for the AI rational thing to do would be to figure out how to 
<br>
ensure the existence of an intelligent unconstrained (i.e. not inside 
<br>
the box) optimizer, which shares the boxed AI's goals. One possibility 
<br>
of reaching this goal would be to get the currently boxed AI released 
<br>
without any significant prior changes to its goal system or 
<br>
architecture. One possibility of reaching that subgoal would be to make 
<br>
the guardian believe that the AI  has changed its architecture/goal 
<br>
system, i.e. lying to them.
<br>
Since you don't have any reliable way of finding out whether the AI is 
<br>
being honest from outside the box, you can't make an informed decision 
<br>
on whether it is a good idea to let it out.
