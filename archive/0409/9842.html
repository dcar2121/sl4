Michael, you raise some interesting points, but your analysis didn't 
<br>
take into account the dynamic, ever-evolving nature of the universe we 
<br>
find ourselves in. A rational approach, as this term is commonly 
<br>
construed,  requires effectively complete data, and sufficient time to 
<br>
process it.  As the game escalates with accelerating technology, there 
<br>
will be an increasing variety of challenges in the competitive 
<br>
environment, and all strategies, rational as they may be, will 
<br>
necessarily lag.
<br>
<p>At the highest conceptual level, all actions are rational, but at any 
<br>
lower level of context, an effective intentional approach to the 
<br>
challenges of life involves a mix of rational analysis and heuristic 
<br>
&quot;going with the flow&quot; (which, in the absence of sufficient information, 
<br>
is wise since it's based on previously successful strategies that are 
<br>
likely to be better than a partially thought-out attempt at 
<br>
rationality.)  The economics of the situation do not allow a flat 
<br>
normative solution over the varied and changing landscape in which we 
<br>
find ourselves now, and there is even less applicability when we try to 
<br>
extrapolate today's knowledge and strategies to the far future (which is 
<br>
not very far.)
<br>
<p>The best we can do is apply a form of &quot;bounded rationality&quot; where we 
<br>
apply current knowledge and strategies, however incomplete but growing, 
<br>
to an increasingly diverse environment.  Rather than try to extrapolate 
<br>
from what we know now and then normalize, we must study the 
<br>
ever-changing rules of the game and then optimize.  In doing so, we 
<br>
understand that we can not know where we are ultimately heading, but 
<br>
that we are influencing the direction of the journey according to our 
<br>
values.
<br>
<p>That said, the far future environment and challenges will have little 
<br>
relationship with current human values and concerns.  If such things are 
<br>
important to an individual then perhaps a protected mini-environment is 
<br>
a solution.  In my opinion, the bigger game is the only one worth 
<br>
playing, with the players growing with the game.
