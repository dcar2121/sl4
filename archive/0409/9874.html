Since I am a rocket scientist, I'd like to address
<br>
some issues about 'running away':
<br>
<p>(1) Eliezer wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Suppose you pack your bags and run away at .99c.
</em><br>
<p>If you travel at a high fraction of lightspeed, the
<br>
following will become serious issues:
<br>
<p>- the cosmic background radiation will be blue-shifted
<br>
ahead of you from 3 Kelvins up to a higher
<br>
temperature.
<br>
This will generate thermal problems at some point, and
<br>
differential light pressure will tend to limit your
<br>
speed.
<br>
<p>- Interstellar gas atoms will begin to act like
<br>
a high energy particle beam, causing radiation 
<br>
problems and drag.
<br>
<p>- Interstellar dust particles will act like tiny
<br>
high speed bullets.  At 0.99c, the particle flux
<br>
will deposit 20KW/m^2 in thermal energy if stopped.
<br>
That alone will heat a leading edge to 875F.  
<br>
Mechanical pitting of the leading edge from impacts
<br>
will likely be severe.
<br>
<p>The only propulsion methods I know of that can get
<br>
to a substantial fraction of c would still have a
<br>
hard time getting to 0.99c:
<br>
<p>- Matter-Antimatter annihiliation (due to mass 
<br>
overhead to store the antimatter and focus the
<br>
annihilation products to get thrust)
<br>
- Laser energy source (allows arbitrarily high
<br>
performance since the energy is external to the
<br>
vehicle, but the laser will be redshifted which
<br>
limits velocity)
<br>
- Quantum black hole (100% mass-energy conversion
<br>
if you feed the hole at the same rate it emits
<br>
Hawking radiation, but you still have mass overhead
<br>
to make an engine and the hole itself will be heavy.
<br>
<p>So absent some new ideas (which is always possible),
<br>
running away at 0.99c is not likely feasible.
<br>
<p>(2) It can be shown that the energy to send the
<br>
description of an object atom by atom is much less
<br>
than the energy to send the object itself at a high
<br>
fraction of c.  Given nanotech level capabilities,
<br>
the fastest way to get from here to there is to
<br>
send a small fast probe to a destination, then
<br>
have it build a receiver/assember factory.  Then
<br>
you FAX yourself to the destination.
<br>
<p>(3) If your back end is a cold (&lt;3K) conical
<br>
mirror, you will look like another patch of 
<br>
cosmic background to someone trying to chase you.
<br>
If you can get some uncertainty in direction
<br>
when leaving, you will be damn hard to find.
<br>
<p>The faster 
<br>
<em>&gt; you run, the less subjective time you have on board
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ship before someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catches up with you, owing to lightspeed effects.
</em><br>
<p>At 0.99c time dilation is 7x, so stellar flybys will
<br>
occur at ~6 month intervals ship time.  Each stellar
<br>
flyby is a chance to increase your positional
<br>
uncertainty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose it doesn't run after you.  In that case, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than one group 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escapes, say, 10 groups, then any one of them can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also potentially create 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an UFAI that will chase after you at .995c.
</em><br>
<p>For each year head start, in the galactic rest frame,
<br>
it will still only be gaining on you at 0.005c, so
<br>
it will take 200 years to catch up.  Onboard ship,
<br>
the time time will be ~30 years.
<br>
<p>Another way to look at it is as seen from the ship,
<br>
the Earth experiences a time dilation of 7x (it's
<br>
all relative you see).  So it takes that much 
<br>
longer for an AI to get built and start chasing
<br>
you, from your perspective.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also dispute that you would have .99c-capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape vehicles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *immediately* after nanotech is developed.
</em><br>
<p>Given that you can send information to the escape
<br>
vehicle, and it has sufficiently general purpose
<br>
materials and equipment, you can launch with what
<br>
you have now, and send it upgrades as technology
<br>
improves.
<br>
<p>There used to be an argument that given an assumed
<br>
rate of technology improvement, you can calculate
<br>
a minimum in the curve of (waiting for better
<br>
technology) + (travel time), such that there was
<br>
no point in building an interstellar ship earlier
<br>
than the optimum time.
<br>
<p>With the assumption of a singularity, with a 
<br>
hyperbolic technology curve, and the idea of sending
<br>
upgraded engine designs en-route, I don't know of
<br>
anyone who has worked out the optimal strategy
<br>
of when to build your ship.
<br>
<p>Daniel
