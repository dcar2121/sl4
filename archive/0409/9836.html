Hi,
<br>
<p>I tend to keep quiet during these AI-BOX discussions, but I'm moved to chip
<br>
in some brief comments at this point, motivated by an offline conversation
<br>
with Chris Healey.
<br>
<p>As I see it, the real question is whether we want to create an AI that's
<br>
smarter than us and let it influence human affairs in a significant way.
<br>
Whether we let it have direct physical control over the world outside its
<br>
box is really close to irrelevant.
<br>
<p>More explicitly:
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
It's just silly to ask whether this or that human could keep the AI in the
<br>
box if they *really really wanted to above all else*.   If some human is
<br>
fanatically convinced that letting the AI out of the box is bad, of course
<br>
they may be able to sit there, ignore what the AI says, and leave it in the
<br>
box.  Sure, humans are capable of all kinds of actions, noble and ridiculous
<br>
and good and bad, etc.  So what?
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
If we're going to create an AI and put it in a box and keep it from having
<br>
any influence on the world under any circumstances, then why bother?  Just
<br>
out of some kind of bizarre cross-species sadism?  ;-)  But if we're going
<br>
to create an AI and let it interfere with our world *indirectly* -- via
<br>
suggesting technologies to us, helping us invent new math, etc. -- then does
<br>
it really matter whether we literally let it out of the box or not? A
<br>
sufficiently smart creature will find some way to influence us anyway, via
<br>
the technologies it creates for us, and so forth.  Thus the issue of letting
<br>
the AI out of the box becomes a judgment call, assuming one has already made
<br>
the judgment that creating an AI and letting it influence the world is a
<br>
worthwhile thing.
<br>
<p><p>In short, it really makes no sense to create an AI, allow it to indirectly
<br>
affect human affairs, and then make an absolute decision to keep it in a
<br>
box.
<br>
<p>And it also makes no sense to create an AI and not allow it to affect human
<br>
affairs at all, under any circumstances.  This is a waste of resources.
<br>
<p>So creating an AI-BOX may be a useful interim strategy and conceivably a
<br>
useful long-term strategy, but it's not something we should expect to count
<br>
on absolutely.
<br>
<p>Thus I suggest that we spend our time discussing something else ;-)
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
