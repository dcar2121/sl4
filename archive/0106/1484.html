<em>&gt; 1)Some coercive memes and exponential cults (as the terms seem to be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this thread) are necessary to rational interaction and the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman intelligence.  Is English grammar and vocabulary a coercive set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memes?  The Academie Francaise certainly thinks so! Is algebra?  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarkably successful at self-replicating, and many people who learn it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first would rather not, but come to enjoy it after being changed.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential cults started by Euclid, Gutenberg, Newton, Einstein, and Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be rather frightening to the uninitiated.
</em><br>
<p>true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2)If coercion and cult are redefined to keep a pejoratively evaluative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotation, its much less clear they will flourish in a transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.  Assume the first approximation of &quot;coercion&quot; as applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is that information is coercive when it alters an AI's behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without being mediated by the AI's intelligent reflection. (Paradigm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example: direct involuntary change in AI's own source code.)  Intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just is life's defense to such coercion. (Between the stimulus and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response falls the shadow.... of thought).  The more intelligence develops,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more defense the individual has.  Compare an AI to your desktop PC,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerable to viruses it cannot intelligently examine.  Coercion, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment or other intelligences, can never be eliminated, but a sphere of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential volitional activity expands as intelligence expands.
</em><br>
<p>I see the argument that increased intelligence can protect against coercion.
<br>
However, if our competitors/peers/companions all out pace us intellectually,
<br>
are we not, relativistically, still just as vulnerable?
<br>
<p>Will transhuman law develop in time to protect everyone? (maybe during
<br>
Eli's wisdom tournaments, transhuman issues can be tackled *before* we
<br>
are ever faced with them). 
<br>
<p>Perhaps you can tell us or recommend a good book on how law evolves today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Most of the examples discussed involve coercion by trick, not direct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forceful coercion.  But the kinds of tricks proposed become much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult in a transhumanly intelligent environment.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes. I am specifically interested in &quot;coercion&quot; where Friendliness reigns
<br>
supreme. I guess it's &quot;coercion with consent&quot;. Admittedly, I do what my 
<br>
credit card companies and the DMV want me to, without too much detriment
<br>
to my well being. Our goals are contractually, and I suppose mutually,
<br>
aligned in some sense.
<br>
<p>These relationships are not always mutually beneficial. I was listening 
<br>
to the radio this morning about the debate over pay-day cash advances and 
<br>
how people can get locked in a cycle of debt. Desperation can wreak
<br>
havoc on the life of a mostly-rational mind. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, I suggest the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value structures of a person will in general become more stable as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence increases, so conversions become more difficult, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversions unrelated to the progress of scientific theories.  (The string
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory cult may prosper, but Astrology will have more and more difficulty in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propagating as anything other than a set of literary symbols.)  
</em><br>
<p>I agree that our knowledge of the universe will probably all increase and
<br>
become (or remain) sufficiently stable, revolutionary paradigm shifts aside,
<br>
that self corrective meme systems, like Science will thrive.
<br>
<p>Value structures (I'm interpreting as a means of assigning value to various
<br>
aspects of our experience: books, memories, friends, billboards, manure 
<br>
sandwiches) might or might not be stable. I don't want to calcify into stone.
<br>
I don't want to randomize into noise. I want to keep evolving into more life
<br>
with new and &quot;better&quot; vstructs.
<br>
<p>If I had locked myself off before considering Friendliness, I think I'd be
<br>
missing out right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be able to use tainted information to induce Charlie to change vis value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure (isn't this what was meant by &quot;volitional structure?&quot;) in ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unforseen and unwanted by Charlie, but Dan and Ellen, seeing the results,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be harder to fool.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, as Eli said, some will get eaten by memes. And there is hope yet if
<br>
Dan and Ellen can still influence Bill and &quot;rescue him&quot;...but he might not
<br>
want to be &quot;rescued&quot;...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (And again, as intelligence increases, so will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general knowledge of the social space, so that all the Dans and Ellens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to become aware of each transhuman equivalent of scams, chain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letters and cults, that arise.)
</em><br>
<p>The slower the transition to higher intelligence takes, the more time Dan
<br>
and Ellen have to adapt and learn. The faster the ascent, means just the
<br>
opposite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) In general, meme talk, with its Darwinian overtones and selfish gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphors, becomes progressively attenuated as intelligence develops.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of meme talk is to abstract from the mechanism by which ideas are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluated and adopted.  The point of AI is to understand, model and improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mechanisms by which ideas are evaluated and adopted.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but if one can rewire the very criteria by which memes are selected and
<br>
transported (ie. I can modify how I'll accept ideas), and if memes 
<br>
themselves can lead to this rewiring, intelligence must quickly learn to 
<br>
guard itself against epidemic loss. Can it do so quickly enough is an 
<br>
important question. This has sort of been covered in the &quot;When Subgoals
<br>
Attack&quot; thread, only now it's not an attack, but run away replication
<br>
IN THE DIRECTION of collective volition (eg. Exponential Cults).
<br>
<p>(Maybe this should be called Exponential Groups to avoid pejorative
<br>
connotations).
<br>
<p>I disagree that meme talk will attenuate as AI devolops. As AI &quot;understands, 
<br>
models and improves the mechanisms by which ideas are evaluated and adopted&quot;,
<br>
meta-memes about that understanding, modelling and improvement of these 
<br>
ideas by observation will spread. These meta-memes will be generated 
<br>
*in addition* to the ideas themselves (which when transmitted to other 
<br>
entities, qualify as memes also). As long as concepts are created, 
<br>
transmitted and disappear, we can talk about memes. But maybe you're 
<br>
saying something like natural evolution (of say animals) is different
<br>
than rational design (genetic engineering of animals) or combinatorial
<br>
biology (changing each &quot;bit&quot; of a mouse gene to see what it produces).
<br>
Maybe you are saying that natural evolution of memes is significantly 
<br>
different from rationally designed memes. That's fine by me. I'm willing
<br>
to update my overtones and connotations when talking memes with regard
<br>
to AI. The meme-meme is dead. Long live the meme-meme!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) This is not to say that incidents of coercive behavior of all types will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not persist as intelligence develops, just that the fear that coercive memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cults will necessarily propagate like kudzu is overstated, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence generally provides defenses to coercion slightly more quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it provides new means to coerce.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, where do our memetic defences come from? If it partially comes from 
<br>
the long time it takes to propagate adoption of ideas, that will change.
<br>
If it comes from evolutionary or acquired strategic defenses, then superior 
<br>
attacks might render these useless. Can we entirely get rid of kudzu and
<br>
other weeds as it is now? (Ok maybe an SI could, but an SI could also
<br>
develop a much worse strain if ve so wanted). 
<br>
<p>Maybe we won't all be infected by cult memes, or we will, but we'll call
<br>
them communities. Or perhaps I am concerned because the possibility of 
<br>
memetic plagues is not that outlandish. With winner take all hypergrowth, 
<br>
it doesn't seem like such a bad idea to consder the worst case (or implore
<br>
an SI to do so). I'll bet there's a good sci-fi book I just need to read :)
<br>
<p>I must admit though, that since I accept that an SI will likely outpace
<br>
the forces of corrosion and corruption, that sentient individuals have a 
<br>
good chance as well. Of course once we are uploaded, will individualism
<br>
really be that highly regared? Are we in for a spate of mergers and 
<br>
acquisitions? Can we / should we resist. It will be a strange, strange
<br>
world...
<br>
<p>With modifiable goals systems I just want some assurance that we don't
<br>
all just end up in endless pleasure stimulus-response loops. It seems
<br>
like we'll have to be very careful in the way we phrase what we want
<br>
because we might just get it. Maybe, like Odyseus, I'll be able to
<br>
tether myself to a timer and pass the sirens of hedonisms without
<br>
getting stuck...or maybe not &lt;gulp&gt;.
