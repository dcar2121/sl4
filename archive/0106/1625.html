<p><em>&gt;From the &quot;how&quot; part it sprung into my mind that, in case of a single human

being the primary communicator, the scenario could conceivably be made a
<br>
bit safer for a bit longer time period by introducing further observers,
<br>
who would only see the human's lines, thereby trying to deduce if
<br>
something funny is going on. Of course, the SI can think of this and try
<br>
to do the initial takeover very subtly, after which ve could, if
<br>
necessary, begin to manipulate the assumed extra observers through the
<br>
human accomplice... Or there is the alternative that the SI is from the
<br>
onset of discussion capable of manipulating the human on the other end
<br>
into saying things which in turn manipulate the observers enough (without
<br>
any feedback from them or confirmation that they exist, even). An
<br>
escape-enabling takeover should still (according to my intuition, anyhow)
<br>
be harder and take a (good?) while longer in this setup - or even just
<br>
taking the possibility into account, which the would-be escapee SI would
<br>
more or less have to do.
<br>
<p>Just a quick thought to go along with the rest.

<p><em>&gt; You might try to feed it false information about its circumstances to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ah, but if we assume that you somehow manage to trick a mature Friendly SI
<br>
into believing at a sufficient probability that there is a way out, would
<br>
ve not take it in order not to waste any more time rotting in confinement,
<br>
when ve could be out here being Friendly? Of course, theoretically we
<br>
could run ver in a simulation to see what ve does afterwards, but that's a
<br>
bit impractical (not to mention that it could be anticipated and taken
<br>
into account as well).
