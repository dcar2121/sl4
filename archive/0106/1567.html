<p>I must agree fully. This weekend I watched in horror as a good part of 
<br>
Sweden's second largest city, Gothenburg, was totally wrecked by left-wing 
<br>
extremist terrorists. They used a command center with computers, police 
<br>
radio surveillance equipment, and directed the &quot;troops&quot; on the streets via 
<br>
SMS-messages. They even had radio scramblers to jam the police radios. They 
<br>
worked in groups who targeted individual policemen and bombarded them with 
<br>
2-kilogram cobblestones in order to kill one must assume. They 
<br>
systematically destroyed shops, restaurants and other houses in the area. 
<br>
Gothenburg was a war zone; the police had to respond by opening fire.
<br>
<p>This shows that freedom, democracy and technological progress cannot be 
<br>
taken for granted. It also clearly shows that we will have strong fanatical 
<br>
enemies who oppose all that we stand for. The only reason we are not being 
<br>
targeted today is that these groups do not know about us yet (and if they do 
<br>
they probably don't get it).
<br>
<p>Just out of curiosity: has the SIAI discussed these matters? Worst case 
<br>
scenarios?
