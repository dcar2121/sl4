<em>&gt; From: Aaron McBride &lt;<a href="mailto:amcbride@jps.net?Subject=Re:%20SI%20Jail">amcbride@jps.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: SI Jail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Please forgive me if you get this twice.  I've been having some email trouble)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about putting the SI in a prisoners dilemma type situation?
</em><br>
<p>I like the concept, but this raises bigger issues. First is, which question 
<br>
we are asking?
<br>
<p>A) Given a Super Intelligence who is known to be UnFriendly, could a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspicious human *not* be taken over through a VT100 terminal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tricked into relasing the SI? (Can we safely jail ver?)
<br>
<p>B) Given an SI of *unknown* Friendliness, would we be able to test it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfactorily to determine if it is Friendly, so that we might 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release it? (Can we verify ve is Friendly?)
<br>
<p>C) Given an aFriendly* SI seed, could we modify it so that we are convinced 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is Friendly before releasing it?
<br>
<p><p>I don't think we can actually answer (A) without any of us having any
<br>
experience with an SI (ie. without an SI we cannot know its magic, so 
<br>
we cannot say whether it could take over a human or not). I don't know
<br>
how we could be 100% convinced it would be safe. I'd personally
<br>
classify this as Unanswerable (but with some clever and interesting
<br>
possible safety measures mentioned on this mailing list). We just can't
<br>
know the answer, yet. Sorry.
<br>
<p><p><p>For (B), we might try Aaron's suggestion of using the SI's to rat each
<br>
other off. But with his case 3 (UnFriendly and untruthful), we see that
<br>
this can't really help us, especially when they are so much smarter than
<br>
we are (by definition). 
<br>
<p>Someone tell me if this is true:
<br>
<p>&quot;A black box test of Friendliness can never satisfy us that an SI is
<br>
truly Friendly&quot;.
<br>
<p>That is, we feed the SI an input, it gives us an output and we check
<br>
that the output conforms to Friendliness. We cannot determine if the
<br>
SI is truly Friendly because this problem is similar to the Halting 
<br>
Problem**. We need source code level verification, verified by a *known*
<br>
Friendly AI when the complexity scales beyond what humans can determine.
<br>
(So if Eli builds his own, he would design ver to check verself as soon
<br>
as he could not.)
<br>
<p>Also with question (B), we'd likely find ourselves in the position 
<br>
that Carl Feynman proposed, in which the AI would give us such 
<br>
bounteous intellectual gifts that people would clamor for ver release.
<br>
<p><p><p>For (C): Suppose BioMind is wildly successful. Cognitive Bioscience 
<br>
is about to release the BioMind ScreenSaver(tm) which will turn 
<br>
everyone's computer into a buzzing, humming node on the internet
<br>
and possibly be seeding the Global Brain.
<br>
<p>BioMind understands proteins and has enhanced data mining tools which
<br>
it is starting to apply to other fields (like analyzing human behavior
<br>
as documented on the www in plain natural human language).
<br>
<p>Could they retrofit it to be Friendly? What if the task turns out to
<br>
be easier if they rewrite from scratch? Should they wait? Should they
<br>
release it anyway? What should they do? (I'll leave this an open 
<br>
question...it might just be a software engineering problem...I dunno). 
<br>
<p><p>* aFriendly: neutral, neither Friendly nor UnFriendly
<br>
<p>** We might test it 1,000,000 times, convince ourselves the SI is 
<br>
Friendly. Once we release the SI though and ve passes the same million
<br>
real world tests, we are not guaranteed that the SI won't be UnFriendly
<br>
on the millon + 1st time. The results of Wisdom Tournaments can't convince 
<br>
us entirely (forgive me if this is convered, I'm still making my way 
<br>
through CFAI and haven't even gotten to the Wisdom Tournament section). 
<br>
The wisdom tournaments will be useful for training, of course, but being 
<br>
*convinced* probably relies on knowing fundamentals of the entire 
<br>
architecture and dynamics of the system.
