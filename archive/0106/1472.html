<p>Okay, I can take the hint.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Actually, I was going to offer to write some stuff, but I thought 
<br>
that maybe we were trying to keep it all in CFAI and that's your 
<br>
(Eliezer's_ project.  But, if that's not a concern, I'll write away 
<br>
because I have the time (hey, it's summer vacation and college 
<br>
doesn't start until late August) and a Web page to which to post it 
<br>
all.  Besides, if I write some stuff, it will have my own nice spin 
<br>
on things.  :-)
<br>
<p>Also, in case anyone was wondering, Asimov now lives in my closet 
<br>
(and you thought he was dead) and writes my papers for me for school. 
<br>
Over the summer, though, I'm willing to loan him out to the highest 
<br>
bidder.  ;-P
