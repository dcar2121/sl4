<em>&gt; &gt; Now, imagine Charlie. Transhuman Charlie is sufficiently more intelligent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhuman Bill. Again our favorite Sysop can warn Bill off from doing any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing he might not want to do, if only he knew all the consequences. But there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a new twist with this case. Transhuman Charlie might convince transhuman Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to modify vis own volition so that accepting new memes from Charlie is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desired. Transhuman Charlie might advertise his suggested memes cleverly so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhuman Bill bill chooses them with no violation of vis volition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, transhuman Bill automatically flushes all messages from Charlie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a single thought smoothly integrated with the Sysop API.  Charlie can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince Bill to modify vis volition in the first place - at least, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using invalid arguments.  And if the arguments are valid from Bill's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective, even with the consequences taken into account, what's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem?  
</em><br>
<p>Say Charlie has a memetic attractor X. He can then create various messages that
<br>
bring anyone from Bill's state of mind incrementally closer to X, designing each
<br>
message to be appealing (ie. valid) with regard to the target (Bill in this case). 
<br>
<p>Bill might say: &quot;I do not want to be lead to X, Y, or Z. I wouldn't mind being
<br>
drawn closer to A, B, &amp; C, but I like where I am now&quot;. By doing this he would 
<br>
specifically be opt'ing-out of X, Y, Z and opt'ing-in to A, B, &amp; C. Yet there
<br>
are probably a non-enumerable set of memetic attractors (or this set is 
<br>
incredibly large). 
<br>
<p>Maybe Bill could say: I will accept messages for which these, and only these, 
<br>
parameters of my personality might be modified. I choose to allow the option 
<br>
for my most recent self to nullify any modification greater than x amount.
<br>
<p>I suppose Permutation City addressed these ideas, but I still think cults could 
<br>
creep in. I don't remember specific mention of them. I do think it becomes
<br>
more of a concern when we can rewire our volitional centers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Charlie has to be smarter than the *Sysop* to *covertly* take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over Bill, at least if Bill has a normal relationship with the Sysop.
</em><br>
<p>Not smarter. Just smart enough. Charlie merely needs to be smart enough to 
<br>
persuade Bill to incrementally change vis volition, without violating any
<br>
rules of the Sysop. Charlie might also do this completely openly. In fact,
<br>
if Charlie does not do this, then transhuman Cindy probably will, ie. 
<br>
someone would do it after enough time passes. And you know transhuman Cindy
<br>
has a way with words. She makes everything so clear and understandable.
<br>
<p>Replication would still seem to dominate interactions in this environment.
<br>
<p>I'm suggesting (or opening for discussion) the idea that:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems which influence your volitional mechanism to favor and replicate 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves will thrive at the expense of other systems (I mean memetic 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems, memeplexes, mores, even just behavioral instincts). 
<br>
<p>Smart people can be convinced to make incorrect conclusions if there is
<br>
enough spin and doubt created or if an idea is &quot;irresistably appealing&quot;. 
<br>
For some category of non-dangerous manipulation, the sysop won't intervene.
<br>
It seems likely that there will be an arms race for intelligence to defend 
<br>
one's self against hyper-clever marketting - ie. ideas which influence but 
<br>
are completely permissible by the sysop. 
<br>
<p>Side note:
<br>
I'm not sure if there are any laws against subliminal advertising (in the US). 
<br>
fnord
<br>
<p>If you are assuming there is going to be a separation between humans and 
<br>
transhumans (as in protecting humans from 'coercive transhuman memes'), I'm 
<br>
considering that there might be levels of protection between a transhuman
<br>
level A and a transhuman level B (where anyone in B could easily influence 
<br>
anyone in A WITHOUT violating rules of the sysop, merely by being a highly
<br>
effective marketter). These levels would go up and up A &lt; B &lt; C &lt; D, etc.
<br>
and I'd assume that the more computational power you had the more effective
<br>
memes you could devise. Lower levels would be &quot;protected&quot; from higher levels.
<br>
I'm sure a funny book could be written about inter-level dating...or maybe
<br>
a not so funny book.
<br>
<p>Smart people can be duped by smarter people (and even stupider people if the
<br>
conditions are right). The same seems only more so in an exaggerated version 
<br>
of hyperintelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The result? Exponential cults win (in a weird way).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only for people who like exponential cults...
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but because volition can be rewired, all you have to do is keep
<br>
getting people closer to liking exponential cults. Given that these
<br>
entities will live a long time and be mentally mutating anyway (give
<br>
or take), there is probably sufficient time to be largely
<br>
successful. People will &quot;drift&quot; toward strong attractors, or maybe
<br>
leap and bound between them...if they can escape from the previous one,
<br>
that is, if they'll *want* to.
<br>
<p>Because cults do not violate volition, they have a good chance of going
<br>
exponential (in the nanomachine-convert-the-universe-to-computronium sense).
<br>
<p>I suppose this leads to another question about property rights and volition.
<br>
If there is a land grab and I get out to the other matter in the universe first,
<br>
claim it and convert it to computronium populated with sentients who follow my 
<br>
cult am I violating anyone's volition in an unfair manner?
<br>
<p>I'm not saying the universe should be any other way...I'm just wondering if I
<br>
should start working on my cult personality for when the singularity arrives 
<br>
;-)
<br>
<p>Seriously though, are exponential cults a natural consequence for societies 
<br>
revering volition? 
<br>
<p>(if we can convert sentients, we'll create them!)
