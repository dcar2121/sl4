Actually I would much rather have a well designed, open society than what 
<br>
we have now.  Assuming our current society could be completely reworked to 
<br>
remove the negative elements I wouldn't mind at all having information 
<br>
about me be available.  Heck, their already is considerable information 
<br>
about me out there, but in sub-societies (such as this one).
<br>
<p>However, unless we obtain the ability to transcend or end up with a sysop 
<br>
that changes all the rules anything similar to the below idea would have 
<br>
many more negatives than positives to belonging.
<br>
<p>And actually I would still mind being &quot;hunted as a witch&quot; even if I 
<br>
couldn't be burned at the stake.  A society that would have such things 
<br>
would also be poorly designed.  In a truly well designed society no one 
<br>
would persecute others for their beliefs, no matter how much they deviated 
<br>
from theirs.  At least as long as those beliefs did not intrude on 
<br>
them.  Someone with a belief such as &quot;all life on earth should be 
<br>
exterminated&quot; (and who planned to work toward this goal) would still be 
<br>
problematic.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Information, once disseminated, can never be recalled.  Therefore, to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and keep information private is the fragile strategy; to design a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which can withstand the information being open is the nonfragile
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategy.  (At Extro 5, LDC pointed out that the problem is not that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cracker can obtain your social security number; the problem is that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;banking structure allows you to easily obtain a credit card in my name if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you have my social security number.  He offered as an analogy a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where ATMs allowed you to obtain cash using only the ATM card number,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than requiring the physical card plus a PIN.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ironically enough, LDC also wanted to send his kids to a fully monitored
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school, something that sounded to me like a reasonably good approximation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of hell - although LDC did agree with me when I pointed out that the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parents have over children needs to be substantially reduced before a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transparent school is a good idea.
