<p>
To sum up the arguments explicit and implicit responding to Durant Schoon's
<br>
concerns:
<br>
<p>1)Some coercive memes and exponential cults (as the terms seem to be used in
<br>
this thread) are necessary to rational interaction and the development of
<br>
transhuman intelligence.  Is English grammar and vocabulary a coercive set
<br>
of memes?  The Academie Francaise certainly thinks so! Is algebra?  It is
<br>
remarkably successful at self-replicating, and many people who learn it at
<br>
first would rather not, but come to enjoy it after being changed.  The
<br>
exponential cults started by Euclid, Gutenberg, Newton, Einstein, and Turing
<br>
can be rather frightening to the uninitiated.
<br>
<p>2)If coercion and cult are redefined to keep a pejoratively evaluative
<br>
connotation, its much less clear they will flourish in a transhuman
<br>
environment.  Assume the first approximation of &quot;coercion&quot; as applied to
<br>
information is that information is coercive when it alters an AI's behavior
<br>
without being mediated by the AI's intelligent reflection. (Paradigm
<br>
example: direct involuntary change in AI's own source code.)  Intelligence
<br>
just is life's defense to such coercion. (Between the stimulus and the
<br>
response falls the shadow.... of thought).  The more intelligence develops,
<br>
the more defense the individual has.  Compare an AI to your desktop PC,
<br>
vulnerable to viruses it cannot intelligently examine.  Coercion, from the
<br>
environment or other intelligences, can never be eliminated, but a sphere of
<br>
potential volitional activity expands as intelligence expands.
<br>
<p>3) Most of the examples discussed involve coercion by trick, not direct,
<br>
forceful coercion.  But the kinds of tricks proposed become much more
<br>
difficult in a transhumanly intelligent environment.  First, I suggest the
<br>
value structures of a person will in general become more stable as
<br>
intelligence increases, so conversions become more difficult, especially
<br>
conversions unrelated to the progress of scientific theories.  (The string
<br>
theory cult may prosper, but Astrology will have more and more difficulty in
<br>
propagating as anything other than a set of literary symbols.)  Second, Bill
<br>
may be able to use tainted information to induce Charlie to change vis value
<br>
structure (isn't this what was meant by &quot;volitional structure?&quot;) in ways
<br>
unforseen and unwanted by Charlie, but Dan and Ellen, seeing the results,
<br>
will be harder to fool.  (And again, as intelligence increases, so will
<br>
general knowledge of the social space, so that all the Dans and Ellens are
<br>
more likely to become aware of each transhuman equivalent of scams, chain
<br>
letters and cults, that arise.)
<br>
<p>4) In general, meme talk, with its Darwinian overtones and selfish gene
<br>
metaphors, becomes progressively attenuated as intelligence develops.  The
<br>
point of meme talk is to abstract from the mechanism by which ideas are
<br>
evaluated and adopted.  The point of AI is to understand, model and improve
<br>
the mechanisms by which ideas are evaluated and adopted.
<br>
<p>5) This is not to say that incidents of coercive behavior of all types will
<br>
not persist as intelligence develops, just that the fear that coercive memes
<br>
and cults will necessarily propagate like kudzu is overstated, and that
<br>
intelligence generally provides defenses to coercion slightly more quickly
<br>
than it provides new means to coerce.
