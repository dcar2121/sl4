<p>I'll just respond to this part and leave the rest for later (or, 
<br>
better yet, others ;-)).  The same strategies would work on all of 
<br>
us.  Sure, those of us on this list look pretty smart compared to 
<br>
'the masses', but really we are not very different outside of the 
<br>
human reference frame.  To an SI, one human is as dumb as the next, 
<br>
regardless if vis IQ is 70 or 180 (I don't like IQs as a measuring 
<br>
stick, but I digress).  While some of us would like to think 'Hey, I 
<br>
know what I'm getting into; I won't be taken over', there are plenty 
<br>
of dumber people out there who think the same thing out of ignorace. 
<br>
If we are dealing with an SI where little variations in human 
<br>
intelligence could matter whether ve could get out or not, I don't 
<br>
think we have too much to worry about.  If ve is only as smart or a 
<br>
little smarter than a human, we can take care of it.  But, if ve is 
<br>
much smarter (I'm thinking several orders of magnitude), I, Forrest 
<br>
Gump, Eliezer, and everyone else are just as likely to be sucked in 
<br>
and let the SI out as anyone else.
<br>
<p>As a further example, think about dogs.  All of the time, humans 
<br>
train them to act certain ways and do their bidding.  In other words, 
<br>
take over their minds.  Smart or dumb, dogs minds can be taken over 
<br>
by humans who have enough skill.  Just the same, an SI can take over 
<br>
a human, no matter how smart or dumb ve is, so long as the SI has 
<br>
enough skill in the appropriate language(s).
<br>
<p>Now, it's late (early?), so I'm going to bed.  There'll be plenty of 
<br>
time for the Singularity in the morning.  ;-P
