<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation similar to that posed by James Higgins, I would think
<br>
that the key variable is not the speed of the SI, but the amount of
<br>
information it has of its exact situation and the situation of its human
<br>
interrogator.  To let the SI know as much as Eliezer knows about Jimmy Wales
<br>
in their potential challenge is to give the game away.  You would want to
<br>
keep the SI from knowing whether it was being interrogated by a human, an
<br>
AI, an unintelligent program, or some combination.  You would want the SI
<br>
ignorant of whether it was interrogated by a single entity, or a group, and
<br>
whether there were further observers. and how the obervation was done.  If
<br>
the SI does not know the identity of its interrogator, it cannot tailor
<br>
promises or threats; if it does not know the means of observation, it has a
<br>
much more difficult encoding information in a form that can escape without
<br>
being noticed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SI loses if it makes an unsuccessful, observed unfriendly attempt to
<br>
influence the interrogator.  Its dominant strategy would seem to be to play
<br>
nice and elicit information from the interrogator, but fishing for
<br>
information could itself be seen as an unfriendly act.  (Of course, if it
<br>
can do magic, it can still escape--there ain't no such thing as an effective
<br>
AI jail.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SI will of course attempt to reason out what type of interrogator is
<br>
most likely.  Each type has its own risks.  A single human in a black box
<br>
can be subverted in ways that would be foiled if there are human observers
<br>
watching by camera, but the observers themselves could be subverted by a
<br>
different attack.  An friendly AI observer would protect against some
<br>
attacks but be vulnerable to new ones.  The best case senario might be that
<br>
for every attack there is a response, and vice versa.  Then, if one were
<br>
worried the SI could play the game of human regularites and predict the
<br>
actual precautions taken, one could at least maintain the possibilty of out
<br>
smarting the SI by choosing a strategy at random.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still don't understand the point of keeping a potentially unfriendly
<br>
AI in jail and talking to it on the lowest bandwidth connection possible.
<br>
Either kill it  if you can or trust it (so as not to make a new enemy out of
<br>
an entity that might have been at least neutral.)  The only way you are
<br>
likely to discover that it is unfriendly is to catch it in an unfriendly
<br>
act.  You might try to feed it false information about its circumstances to
<br>
induce a jail break that would be unsuccesful yet reveal its true nefarious
<br>
nature, but riding a great white shark bareback would be just as exciting,
<br>
and less dangerous for the spectators.
