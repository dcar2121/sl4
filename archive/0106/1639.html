<em>&gt; From: &quot;Ben Houston&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@exocortex.org?Subject=Re:%20sleep%20and%20communal%20dreaming%20(was%20RE:%20Unambiguous%20Language...)">ben@exocortex.org</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; Durant Schoon said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've had a pet theory for a while that dreaming is used to strengthen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weaken conceptual relationships while we sleep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's actually been an aspect of the dominant theory of what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we sleep.  Thus, there might be a simple reason why things seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearer after a good night's sleep.  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>The last thing I read about dreaming was the PONS theory in Chemical
<br>
States of Consciousness by Hobson...but's I don't even remember what
<br>
that theory is...I'll have to check that again.
<br>
<p>The book did explain why dreams are hard to remember: something about
<br>
a critical neurochemical for memory not being present during dreaming.
<br>
<p>Lots of other good stuff about halucinations and the balance between
<br>
the cholinergic and aminergic (sp) neurochemical systems in the brain 
<br>
(sleeping / waking...I might have the order backwards).
<br>
<p>I remember reading (but not in that book) that there was a recent 
<br>
experiment conducted where subjects played videogames all day long 
<br>
and their brain activity was being monitored. At night when they
<br>
slept the researchers showed that their brain was quite active in
<br>
the same area as game play, as if they were &quot;rehersing&quot;. I think there
<br>
was something similar done with rats and mazes and improved skills 
<br>
after sleeping / dreaming.

<em>&gt; &gt; Using spare cycles to compare one's own mental structures with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structures of others one is likely to come into concact with, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at the time of actual communication, one already knows which symbols
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shared.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure if this is a good idea.  Do you really want to be learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts from someone else without putting critical thought into it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But maybe it is decent...
</em><br>
<p>That's a step further than what I was thinking. I was merely proposing
<br>
that a list of similarities (to public beliefs) be created, so that if 
<br>
you're communicating with me, you can subconsciously check the results
<br>
of communal dreaming to see if we share a similar concept.
<br>
<p>The only information gathered would be a list of what is *similar* 
<br>
(perhaps what is different, too). That list could be consulted for
<br>
determining whether to send me an experience or just reference to one
<br>
of our common beliefs.
