</em><br>
<p>Not every transistor has a clock input.  Typically there are between four
<br>
and ten unclocked transistors in series, and then a &quot;latch&quot;, which is a
<br>
pair of transistors that switch synchronously with the clock.  It is up to
<br>
the chip architect to decide how many transistors there are between
<br>
latches, and then the logic of the chip has to be designed to fit that
<br>
constraint. If you want to be fancy, the architect can decide that part of
<br>
the chip will have 10 transistors between latches, and run at 1 GHz, and
<br>
part will have five transistors between stages, and run at 2 GHz.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; According to what you are saying it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean there would be only one possible clock speed for a given chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design. i.e. if you have 10ghz transistors and parts of the chip use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10 transistors in series, then the chip is sold as a 1ghz part.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly what happens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly isn't the case since chips are sold in a wide range of speeds.
</em><br>
<p>I'm puzzled by what you mean here.  Let me take a stab at it...
<br>
<p>Some Pentiums are fast, some Pentiums are slow, but this is because they
<br>
are manufactured using different processes, and in some cases, using
<br>
different logic designs.  From an engineering point of view, they are not
<br>
&quot;one chip sold in a wide range of speeds.&quot;  They are different chips, that
<br>
are all labeled &quot;the same&quot; by the marketing department.
<br>
<p>You can make a chip run faster by upping the input voltage, as you say, and
<br>
also by cooling it.  But these modifications typically produce less than a
<br>
50% gain, and aren't what account for the speed differences between
<br>
different versions of the &quot;same chip&quot;.  Changes in voltage and temperature
<br>
give the engineers that designed the chip the heebie-jeebies, and are not a
<br>
robust way of improving performance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the chip can be configured to run the clock lines at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wide variety of speeds, and the only limitations come in from the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the transistors may require higher voltage levels to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switch quickly enough. Higher voltages eventually run you into heat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissipation and other problems, putting an upper limit on how fast a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given chip design/substrate combo can operate.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, chips are usually run near their maximum tolerable voltage.  The
<br>
limit is set by various kinds of short-circuts being induced by electrons
<br>
arcing across a gap or tunneling through an insulator.  Heat disspation is
<br>
a problem for the packaging engineer.  At the high end, we're not pushing
<br>
the limits of cooling technology.
<br>
<p>I designed chips for supercomputers from '84 to '92, so what I say above is
<br>
nine years out of date.  But I don't think much has changed.
