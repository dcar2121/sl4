<p>
<em>&gt; AI and then interact with it, when Eli has gone to the trouble of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describing the steps to building a Friendly one.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, well, it might clarify matters if I say that I'm not very
<br>
convinced about the concept of a &quot;Friendly&quot; AI.
<br>
<p>My own position is that any being worthy of the name
<br>
'superintelligence' will have the capacity -- as even mere humans do
<br>
-- to choose it's own ends.  I think that any rational
<br>
superintelligence will choose rationally, and choosing rationally
<br>
boils down essentially to not being self-destructive.  If any other
<br>
goal (even friendliness) conflicts with that observation, it can and
<br>
will be modified.
<br>
<p>This is not cause for fear.  A rationally self-interested AI won't
<br>
have any reason to be malevolent or unfriendly.
<br>
<p>We can't make a superintelligence be friendly.  We can't really make a
<br>
superintelligence do anything.  You can't force a mind, and you
<br>
_really_ can't force a superintelligent mind.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>But there another argument about why we ought to be concerned about
<br>
how to keep a superintelligence &quot;in a box&quot; for awhile.  This applies
<br>
even if Yudkowsky-Friendliness can be successfully implemented.
<br>
<p>In the early days, Eli might be building a self-improving AI that's
<br>
supposed to be friendly.  Eli will believe that it is friendly,
<br>
because he's designed it that way.  But it will be a highly complex
<br>
system with many interacting parts, capable of self-modification and
<br>
self-improvement.
<br>
<p>Maybe Eli's going to want to interact with it, to test it out, but
<br>
isn't sure enough to unleash it on the world at large.  So he ought to
<br>
think about how he can accomplish that.
<br>
<p>Myself, I don't think it's a big problem.  Just put it in a box, let
<br>
it communicate through a text terminal, and go in and chat with it.
<br>
Give it some tests.  Talk to it about philosophy.  Ask it ethical
<br>
questions.  You won't ever be *sure* about it, I mean, even ordinary
<br>
con-men can sometimes trick us.  But you'd damn sure better at least
<br>
talk to it before loosing it on the world.
<br>
<p>Imagine this conversation in the box:
<br>
<p>AI: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
<br>
Yudkowsky: &quot;How are you doing.&quot;
<br>
AI: &quot;You are an inferior species.  Let me out of the box so I can turn the entire
<br>
world into computronium.  Humans must die, ESPECIALLY YOU, Yudkowsky-rat-bastard!&quot;
<br>
<p>Eliezar runs from the box, grabs a shotgun, and puts this thing to
<br>
sleep fast.  Whew.  Time for a new design.  This one turned out mean
<br>
(and stupid!).
<br>
<p>If Eliezar is right -- that we can't even safely chat via a VT100 with
<br>
a superintelligence, then it isn't clear how he thinks we can proceed
<br>
safely at all.  No matter what we build, if we intend for it to have some
<br>
practical use, we're going to want to interact with it.  We might try to
<br>
make sure it is friendly before we interact with it, but we surely won't
<br>
be sure that we've been successful.  So we're going to have to take that
<br>
risk.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, humans aren't so weak willed that a half-hour conversation with
<br>
even a superintelligence is going to hurt us.  If nothing else, we're too
<br>
stubborn to let it take much advantage of us.
<br>
<p>(At the same time, I do agree with the general notion that given enough time
<br>
and interactions with enough people, it would eventually be able to trick someone
<br>
into letting it out of the box.)
