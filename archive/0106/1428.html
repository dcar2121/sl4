</em><br>
<p>This is because egoism is a philosophy based on the idea that all 
<br>
action and thought comes from the individual, not a group.  An 
<br>
egoistic AI would, therefore, only be interested in the actions and 
<br>
thoughts of indivudual humans, not the entire species, because that's 
<br>
how ve thinks.  An altruistic AI (in the traditional sense, not the 
<br>
Friendly sense) would conversely be interested in helping the largest 
<br>
numbers possible (i.e. the whole species of several species).  An 
<br>
egoistic AI would fully encompass the philosophy of egoism (and 
<br>
there's no good reason why ve wouldn't be the ideal egoist short of 
<br>
bad code) and make all decisions based on the goal of being egositic 
<br>
as the ultimate goal, just as a Friendly AI makes all decisions based 
<br>
on the ultimate goal of being Friendly (well, there seems to be some 
<br>
dispute about this, but if you want just replace the previous example 
<br>
with whatever equivilant model you think will work best :^)).
<br>
<p>To respond to your thought, an egoistic AI would take an interest in 
<br>
the *individuals* that did the ground work to make ver, but not in 
<br>
the species as a whole (other than maybe trying to learn the 
<br>
species's anatomy, languages, etc. as a side effect of being 
<br>
interested in some individuals, but only insofar as this is necessary 
<br>
to interact with the individuals).
