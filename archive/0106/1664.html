</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need to keep clear the distinction between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transistor switching speed, which may be 100 GHz,
</em><br>
<p>If you read the article, they say the switching speed is up to 210ghz.
<br>
So I don't think the article's claim of 100ghz clock speeds is totally
<br>
bogus. High gigahertz speeds are already used for instance in RF chip
<br>
components where the chip has to generate microwave radio signals. I'd
<br>
have to check to be sure, but I think 5ghz+ clock speeds in SiGe chips
<br>
are commonplace nowadays.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the chip clock speed, which is the transistor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed divided by the number of transistors in series
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in one clock cycle.  The very shortest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycle would be a flip-flop type oscillator, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would take 2 transistors.  More typically it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take 5-10 transistors in series to complete a logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation.
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure this is correct. My (limited) understanding is that the
<br>
clock signal is transported through a chip layout in order to &quot;trigger&quot;
<br>
the transistors to switch. According to what you are saying it would
<br>
mean there would be only one possible clock speed for a given chip
<br>
design. i.e. if you have 10ghz transistors and parts of the chip use
<br>
10 transistors in series, then the chip is sold as a 1ghz part. This
<br>
clearly isn't the case since chips are sold in a wide range of speeds.
<br>
I think that the chip can be configured to run the clock lines at a
<br>
wide variety of speeds, and the only limitations come in from the fact
<br>
that the transistors may require higher voltage levels to be able to
<br>
switch quickly enough. Higher voltages eventually run you into heat
<br>
dissipation and other problems, putting an upper limit on how fast a
<br>
given chip design/substrate combo can operate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another complication is that modern chips may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal units running at different speeds than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external clock.  If I recall the fixed point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arithmetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit in the P4 processor actually runs at _twice_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the clock rate, and some chips run the L1 and L2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caches at less than the external clock rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communication with main memory is around 1/10 the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clock rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, so you see the clock rate is very controllable. The problem I
<br>
see with 100ghz chips is that at that speed the electrical signals
<br>
actually can't travel very far. Even in the P4, Intel had to design it
<br>
so that it sometimes spends multiple clock cycles simply moving data
<br>
from one side of the chip to the other. This is one of the reasons that
<br>
the P4 gets lower IPC (instructions per clockcycle) than the P3. So
<br>
100ghz chips will require most likely a completely new design ethic.
<br>
<p>Not to mention as you say the problem of accessing memory, etc. I read
<br>
an article in Wired mag a few years ago about how there are companies
<br>
working to integrate optical transport methods into motherboard buses-
<br>
but I haven't heard much lately.
