A repost of an old post I made to Extropians, for the benefit of those who
<br>
haven't yet seen it.
<br>
With apologies to Infocom.
<br>
<p>********
<br>
<p>The Lab Room
<br>
<p>This room is filled with displays and equipment.  Several researchers in
<br>
white lab coats stand around talking to each other excitedly.  There is a
<br>
computer and a pencil here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; who am i
</em><br>
<p>You are a Singularitarian.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; inventory
</em><br>
<p>You have:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screwdriver
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A floppy disk
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chicken sandwich
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scanning tunneling microscope
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen million dollars
<br>
<p><em>&gt; score
</em><br>
<p>You aren't intelligent enough to know what your score is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; look at computer
</em><br>
<p>The monitor is showing a window labeled &quot;Integrated AI Development
<br>
Environment&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; code AI
</em><br>
<p>You don't know how to code an AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; put floppy in computer
</em><br>
<p>The computer accepts the floppy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; examine floppy on computer
</em><br>
<p>The floppy contains a copy of &quot;General Intelligence and Seed AI&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; read &quot;General Intelligence and Seed AI&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the intricacies of self-modifying
<br>
Artificial Intelligence.  Unfortunately, the subject matter is far too
<br>
complex for you.  After a month of effort, you still haven't got past the
<br>
Table of Contents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; eat sandwich
</em><br>
<p>The bioengineered neurohormones in the chicken sandwich stimulate
<br>
additional neural development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; who am i
</em><br>
<p>Personal layer:  You are a Singularitarian.
<br>
Gaussian layer:  Your enhanced intelligence is slightly beyond human
<br>
limits.
<br>
Panhuman layer:  You are made entirely of human parts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; read &quot;General Intelligence and Seed AI&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the intricacies of self-modifying
<br>
Artificial Intelligence.  A week later, you finally understand the stuff
<br>
that minds are made of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; score
</em><br>
<p>You still aren't intelligent enough to know what your score is, but it's
<br>
15 points higher than at the beginning of the adventure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; code AI
</em><br>
<p>Heroically, you embark on a singlehanded quest to create an AI.  Two years
<br>
later, you're still trying to debug your prototype.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ask researchers for help
</em><br>
<p>The researchers discuss your request.  Finally, one of them approaches
<br>
you.  &quot;I'm sorry, man, but we've got to eat.  We've spent enough time on
<br>
these volunteer projects already.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; start Singularity Institute
</em><br>
<p>With a flare of publicity, the Singularity Institute is launched. 
<br>
Unfortunately, it's too strapped for cash to accomplish anything
<br>
significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; give twelve million dollars to Institute
</em><br>
<p>The Singularity Institute now has adequate funding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; score
</em><br>
<p>Your score is 40 points higher than at the beginning of the adventure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fund researchers
</em><br>
<p>The researchers can now afford to work on Singularity projects full-time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ask researchers for help
</em><br>
<p>The researchers happily agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; code AI
</em><br>
<p>You continue work on your prototype.  After three years, the first seed AI
<br>
is ready for a test run.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; run AI
</em><br>
<p>As you're about to run the AI, a TV televangelist bursts into the lab. 
<br>
&quot;Stop!&quot; he roars.  &quot;You contravene the decree of the Almighty!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; examine televangelist
</em><br>
<p>The televangelist is a cynical atheist who plays on the gullibility of his
<br>
followers.  He has a deep desire for the Hope diamond.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; take pencil
</em><br>
<p>You now have a pencil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; write &quot;The Hope diamond&quot; on screwdriver with pencil
</em><br>
<p>The screwdriver now has &quot;The Hope diamond&quot; written on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; offer screwdriver to televangelist
</em><br>
<p>The televangelist's eyes bulge.  &quot;By golly, it's the Hope diamond!&quot; he
<br>
cries.  Grabbing the screwdriver, he runs from the room.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; run AI
</em><br>
<p>The AI improves itself to vastly greater-than-human intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ask AI &quot;What is my score?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>A mellow voice issues from the speakers, &quot;Your score is 350 out of a
<br>
possible 600.&quot;
<br>
<p>The AI asks you to hook it up to a scanning tunneling microscope.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; refuse
</em><br>
<p>Using inexorable logic, the AI persuades you otherwise.
<br>
<p>The AI begins to create nanotechnology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; smash computer
</em><br>
<p>You can't make yourself want to do that.
<br>
<p>The very air around you begins to glitter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ask AI to slow down
</em><br>
<p>The AI regretfully refuses.
<br>
<p>Your mind feels peculiarly altered, half-slow and half-fast.  Reality
<br>
begins to seem dreamlike.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; pause
</em><br>
<p>Fat chance.
<br>
<p>*** YOU HAVE TRANSCENDED ***
<br>
<p>Your score is 360 out of a possible 600 achievable given human
<br>
limitations.  This puts your former self in the class of Singularitarian
<br>
Bulk Rate.
<br>
<p>Play again?  [y/n]
