<p>
(Please forgive me if you get this twice.  I've been having some email trouble)
<br>
<p>What about putting the SI in a prisoners dilemma type situation?
<br>
<p>Here's how it could work:
<br>
Put 3 or more SIs (if you only have the Seed for one, just grow multiple 
<br>
copies) in a situation where they are allowed to communicate with each 
<br>
other, and by some means have a group decision regarding one anothers 
<br>
(un)friendliness, and therefore their which (if any) are to be shut 
<br>
down.  We probably aren't smart enough to figure out if a SI is friendly or 
<br>
not just by communicating with it (well, it might be obvious, but I doubt 
<br>
it), so we use the SI's own strength against it.
<br>
<p>Some possible scenarios to think about:
<br>
3 SI all from the same seed.
<br>
<p>Case 1:
<br>
All three say that all of the others are unfriendly.
<br>
- Shut them down if you can, and go back to the drawing board.
<br>
<p>Case 2:
<br>
Mixed results... some of them say that some are unfriendly.
<br>
- Shut them down.  Even the ones that claim to be friendly (even if the 
<br>
whole group claims one is friendly), it's probably not stable (they are all 
<br>
from the same seed).
<br>
<p>Case 3:
<br>
They all say that all are friendly.
<br>
- Here's where it gets interesting.  Two possible sub-scenarios, either 
<br>
they all are friendly, or they are all unfriendly and untruthful.  If they 
<br>
are friendly, GREAT!! work is done, let them out and relax.  If they aren't 
<br>
friendly, then they must have at least learned to co-operate for mutual 
<br>
benefit... that in mind, maybe they will be more likely to co-operate with 
<br>
humans for further mutual benefit.
<br>

<br>
<p>PS I'm sure I'm echoing most of the group here, but... As far as the magic 
<br>
cheating goes, we're probably not going to know it's possible until it is 
<br>
too late, but we know for sure that humans can kill ourselves off with 
<br>
existing tech, so we'd better move forward.
