<p>Okay, I think this has been discussed before, but I'll get in here to 
<br>
try to draw some conclusions for everyone about privacy and then you 
<br>
can apply this knowledge back to the thread youselves as an exercise. 
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>There is no indication that I've seen that an AI would desire 
<br>
privacy, especially after being exposed to programmers all through 
<br>
development.  An SIAI (not to be confused with SIAI ;-P), would 
<br>
probably continue on with this view, unless it turned out that 
<br>
privacy were Friendly (my guess is that it's irrelevant to 
<br>
Friendliness in mature AIs, but developing AIs will have an aversion 
<br>
to priavcy because to be Friendly they must have readable code and 
<br>
such to make sure no FoFs are going on).
<br>
<p>Any kind of static human, upload or just transhuman, is going to hold 
<br>
onto privacy as much as any normal human does, which, for a lot of 
<br>
people, is not a lot.  Contrary to what some of you may be thinking, 
<br>
most peole don't care about their privacy very much, and even if they 
<br>
claim to, they don't care about it too much, since they do little to 
<br>
protect it.  Alas, even as much as I want to remain pretty private 
<br>
and act to ensure that, there is little I can do thanks to the 
<br>
Kafka-ish reality that we already live in and continue to submerge 
<br>
into.  There is a very good chance that technology will just make 
<br>
privacy most impossible, so you'd better get used to it.
<br>
<p>(For those of you who are sleeping, the upshot is that the Sysop will 
<br>
protect your privacy as much as you'd like, so priacy issues only get 
<br>
really bad during the transition period.)
<br>
<p>On dynamic human uploads, my guess is that there will be a wide 
<br>
variety of desires for privacy here.  Some people will open up their 
<br>
code and make it easy to read, while others will have the Sysop seal 
<br>
them up in a nice little box to be a hermit.
<br>
<p>On the big question of what a mind in general or intelligence in 
<br>
general will think of privacy, I may come up with something there 
<br>
later, but at the moment I have no real answer.  Maybe this is still 
<br>
beyond our visibility in the future fog?
<br>
<p>(BTW, for those who noticed, this is coming from a different account 
<br>
than I usually send from.  It seems that all of .cx is down since 
<br>
Friday morning ~9:00 EDT (if anyone knows where I can find more info 
<br>
about this, please let me know off list, because I'm in the dark 
<br>
about what's going on), but using Mac OS X as my main system comes 
<br>
with the perks of free e-mail from Apple.)
