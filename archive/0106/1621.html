</em><br>
<p>That gives me an idea!  How about for the first round of testing we have 
<br>
the AI communicate in a &quot;simulated&quot; world.  Setup the VT100 black-box 
<br>
scenario, but instead of a human lock a turing capable chat-bot in with the 
<br>
SI for a week.  Hopefully turing capable chat-bot technology will be 
<br>
avilable by this time, if not use the best available.  Then program it so 
<br>
that it is likely to ask the type of questions you want (if any specific 
<br>
ones are desired).  Setup the experiment so that neither the SI nor the 
<br>
Chat-Bot have any information indicating that the chat bot is not a person 
<br>
or that it is being closely monitored.  Of course you would have monitoring 
<br>
software running on the CB system that would look for anything 
<br>
unusual.  Everything from basic Firewall &amp; packet analizer to checking the 
<br>
CB binary files &amp; knowledge base for tampering.
