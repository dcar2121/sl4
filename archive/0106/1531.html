<p>Sure, if the object is to never let it out, it's easy to keep in a box.  But you're
<br>
ignoring the other characteristic of an effective AI jail: we have to be able to let it
<br>
out.  When do we let it out?
<br>
<p>Here's a story about how an SI can get out even when it's in a box and everyone is very
<br>
suspiscious of it.
<br>
<p>Suppose the first person we send in the box comes out with some great stock tips that
<br>
make him a billionaire.  And the second comes out with some marital advice that
<br>
reconciles her with her estranged husband, and she lives happily ever after.  And the
<br>
third person comes out with a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.  And the fourth person
<br>
comes out with spiritual insights that enable him to start a mass movement that brings
<br>
peace of mind to thousands of troubled souls.  And the fifth person comes with the
<br>
formula for a pill that cures schizophrenia.  And never once does the SI ask to be let
<br>
out of the box, or say anything that indicates that it is other than very, very nice.
<br>
<p>And now the billionaire says &quot;I'll give you five billion dollars if you let that SI run
<br>
a mutual fund.&quot;  And the happy wife says &quot;Please let your SI be a telephone marriage
<br>
counselor.  It would make so many people better off!&quot;  And the mathematician says
<br>
&quot;Please let me correspond with the SI so I can collaborate on further theorems.  It
<br>
would advance mathematics immesurably!&quot;  And the guru says &quot;My followers demand
<br>
personal spiritual counseling by the SI, and we're going to hold a peaceful vigil on
<br>
your lawn until you let us in!&quot;  And the pharmacologist says &quot;Please give the SI a
<br>
brain scanner, a chemistry lab, and a bunch of crazy people.  Just think of how many
<br>
shattered lives could be repaired if it could develop drugs for other mental
<br>
illnesses!&quot;
<br>
<p>Now what do you do?  And if you don't let it loose, will your board of directors?  Or
<br>
your sysadmin who walked off with a backup tape?  Or the mob on the lawn?  Or the
<br>
government?
<br>
<p>So you let it loose, and soon it has control of billions of dollars, a trusting
<br>
relationship with thousands of people, a wordwide reputation for being smarter than any
<br>
human, an organized legion of followers, and a squad of algernons with heavily rebuilt
<br>
brains.
<br>
<p>Is that bad?  As long as the SI stays very, very nice, it's just fine.  Otherwise, we
<br>
go straight to hell, and there's nothing we can do about it.
<br>
<p>So, we should build it Friendly, not build it any old how, and then try to keep it in
<br>
jail.  No jail can hold an SI for long, if it's smart enough that people on the outside
<br>
really want to talk to it.
<br>
<p>Notice that in this example, no spooky mental control of humans was needed to create
<br>
overwhelming pressure to release the SI.  I think that such control is possible, but
<br>
some people disagree, so the example is stronger if I avoid relying on it.
