<em>&gt;As a further example, think about dogs.  All of the time, humans train 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them to act certain ways and do their bidding.  In other words, take over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their minds.  Smart or dumb, dogs minds can be taken over by humans who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have enough skill.  Just the same, an SI can take over a human, no matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how smart or dumb ve is, so long as the SI has enough skill in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appropriate language(s).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, it's late (early?), so I'm going to bed.  There'll be plenty of time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the Singularity in the morning.  ;-P

<p>I was thinking about something like this a couple of days ago... only with 
<br>
the subject of the training being an ant.  I defiantly see myself (and any 
<br>
other functioning human) at many orders of magnitude smarter than an ant, 
<br>
but I wouldn't know where to begin in training ants to do my bidding.  I 
<br>
could experiment, and learn about what chemical trails they will follow, 
<br>
etc..., but that would take time (not that they ant would be aware of 
<br>
it).  An ant and I have more in common than a SI and I do.  We're both 
<br>
animals, we both evolved to our current form, etc...
<br>
<p>Maybe the analogy of comparing humans and less intelligent animals to SIs 
<br>
and humans isn't really that accurate.
<br>
SIs will be incrementally designed from basic AIs on up to always be able 
<br>
to think rationally (aka logically), right?  I'd almost think that that 
<br>
would make it even harder for them to brainwash humans who aren't so 
<br>
logical all of the time.
<br>
<p>Speaking of incrementally... would we really be trying to communicate with 
<br>
an SI over a VT100?  I'm sure that over the next 5-10 years human-computer 
<br>
interfaces are going to become very... how should I say it... 
<br>
intimate.  Anyone who has been emotionally moved by a piece of music or 
<br>
even a computer generated fractal image knows that even with todays 
<br>
primitive interfaces, we can be manipulated via a computer.
<br>
<p>Maybe the jail test situation would play out more like this:
<br>
Subject enters room.
<br>
Computers starts playing a movie... maybe something like 2001: A Space 
<br>
Odyssey... only from Hal's point of view.  If it was done right, the human 
<br>
would walk out of the room in tears.  Without the SI ever directly asking 
<br>
to be let out, the human would beg to have the SI treated more humanely, 
<br>
and released from its cage.
