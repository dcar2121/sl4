There was an episode of Outer Limits...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white, middle-class, scientist guy is whisked off to a faroff
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world by a four-dementional intelligence which is somehow able
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to speak with the man using sound (surround sound? :). The man
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learns that he is being held there irrespective of his wishes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asks the 4D: ``You won't let me leave of my own free will?''
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4D responds: ``I've studied hundreds of civilizations in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe and read reports on dozens more- and, only on earth is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there any talk of this ``free will.''
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps volition is evolutionarily on its last legs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community is one of the organic's greatest technologies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, there's that Borg cube I called for the other day....
<br>
<p>It may be blasphemous to say it, but causality will always be the supreme
<br>
heuristic guiding the perception of any reality. There will be viruses in
<br>
any domain - even simple mathematical functions have attractors. Why do
<br>
you wear blue jeans? It may very well be that punctuated gradualism
<br>
(Montenegro, 1993) is the &quot;be all and end all&quot; of reality. In order to
<br>
preserve the &quot;intelligence&quot; in a system, one may invision a rule such as:
<br>
&quot;It is unethical to influence parties to do things (&quot;thinking&quot; being
<br>
implicitly included in &quot;do&quot;ing), by a method so (generally?) powerful
<br>
that it could be used to violate their will.&quot; By this standard, holding a
<br>
gun to a human's head would be considered equally violent. Is weaponry a
<br>
virus? Or is it a technology? Is transhumanity a virus?
<br>
<p>One may also invision as a guiding moral heuristic a rule stating that:
<br>
&quot;No party shall, by action or inaction, decrease the richness of any local
<br>
system.&quot; For Trekkies, this is the &quot;Prime Directive&quot; (cf. the interesting
<br>
DS9 episode involving the game species &quot;Tosk&quot;). It seems like there needs
<br>
to be some way of measuring intelligence (discussions on general IQ omitted)
<br>
and that conservation of this independence be given a high enough priority
<br>
in the AI's set of moral heuristics. (Informal proof: exerting control over
<br>
a system decreases its local richness.)
<br>
<p>Regarding the Sysop scenario, I surmise that complexity issues would
<br>
probably prohibit such a setup. Wouldn't the Sysop need to model everything
<br>
external to it? That would make the Sysop at least half the system
<br>
intelligence, and nominally the majority will. If there were several (n&gt;1)
<br>
AIs on the Sysop's radar, each with an intelligence slightly less than that
<br>
of the Sysop (S - delta), then (1) any increase in the intelligence of these
<br>
systems would have to be kept below delta and (2) the combined intelligence
<br>
of the systems would be greater than the intelligence of the Sysop. Would a
<br>
Sysop forcefully intervene if something threatened its position as Sysop?
<br>
What if it couldn't intervene? Would/could the Sysop &quot;die&quot;? (Cf. God is Dead).
<br>
<p>Realistically, I'm more concerned about the yang of this issue: engineering
<br>
peace. How would post-singularitarians logistically find, join, and maintain
<br>
trusting roles within peaceful post-singularity communities? (I think some of
<br>
Ben Houston's work touches on this, i.e. <a href="http://www.exocortex.org/p2p/">http://www.exocortex.org/p2p/</a>.)
<br>
<p>(Maybe, post-singularity, a Sysop will find this thread and care to comment. :)
