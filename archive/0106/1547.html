<p>Now, *this* is the *only* SI-in-a-box scenario I've ever heard that has a
<br>
remote chance of working for, say, thirty reasonably innocuous questions. 
<br>
(Anything beyond that and you're entering into the point where the SI can
<br>
manipulate the deduced phase space of the external universe into arbitrary
<br>
states through the application of sufficiently precise stimuli.)  You also
<br>
run into the &quot;quantum cheat codes&quot; problem, in which the SI just uses
<br>
magic and vanishes - modern tech looks like magic to a Neanderthal, let
<br>
alone a dog.  Maybe entering a sufficiently precise internal state can
<br>
create the conditions that make likely, e.g., involvement in a larger
<br>
closed timelike curve.  Maybe the SI can make itself &quot;sufficiently
<br>
interesting&quot; to a deduced set of unknown-to-us observers.  You just don't
<br>
know, and I'm asking the wrong questions.
<br>
<p>But, if the laws of physics work the way we think we do; and the SI is
<br>
developed on layers of emulation multiply removed from the bottom
<br>
hardware; and the bottom hardware is relatively unsophisticated (no
<br>
quantum computers, no FPGA cellular automata); and the whole room is
<br>
sealed in multiple layers of insulation to try and prevent any
<br>
hardware-manipulation information from leaking into external reality; and
<br>
if the room is destroyed by a &quot;hard timer&quot;, nonresettable by available
<br>
resources, consisting of a tactical nuke; and if there are no backup
<br>
copies; and if all thirty questions are selected in advance; and if nobody
<br>
looks at the answers before the SI is destroyed; then you might succeed in
<br>
getting a set of completely useless or malevolent answers from an SI that
<br>
hates you, or a set of useful answers from a Friendly AI that you would
<br>
have then wrongly destroyed.  There would still be an irreduceable
<br>
probability of at least 40% that you would be just screwed by something
<br>
you didn't understand and couldn't anticipate.  Because let's face it, I
<br>
left *something* off that list.  How many of those precautions would a
<br>
Neanderthal have taken, I wonder?
<br>
<p>Jimmy Wales, you have insufficient fear.  Your basic reaction seems to be
<br>
&quot;Sure, I can use this unFriendly superintelligence,&quot; not to run screaming
<br>
in the opposite direction until you die of exhaustion.  Your pistol idea
<br>
would make things more difficult for me, but I doubt an SI would even
<br>
blink.  It simply imposes the already-obvious condition that the first
<br>
phases of takeover should not cause alarm or alertness in the subject.
