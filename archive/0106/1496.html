<p>
Durant,
<br>
<p>Fair enough.  My response was based in part on a sense that the language of
<br>
cult and coercion is emotionally loaded, and calls up specific instances of
<br>
current behavior that are unlikely to be precisely duplicated by transhuman
<br>
AIs.  There are interesting issues about what uses of information to
<br>
persuade another transhuman intelligence would be fraudulent, antisocial or
<br>
coercive, but the cult, conversion, and eaten by a meme tropes draw
<br>
attention to the extremes.  Arguing that the extremes will become less
<br>
prevalent as intelligence increases is (like) trying to look beyond a
<br>
singularity: of dubious utility and accuracy-- but what else are we going to
<br>
talk about?
<br>
<p>I don't buy the idea that intellectual coercion and its defense is an arms
<br>
race where each advance in intelligence helps each side equally.  First,
<br>
there is the simple minded argument that we start at zero intelligence, zero
<br>
freedom, so any advance has to help.  Not conclusive, of course, because
<br>
plotting intelligence against freedom may describe a curve whose slope goes
<br>
negative at some point, but still suggestive.  Mostly it is just a sense
<br>
running scenarios through my head that each bit of defense will require a
<br>
much larger increase in offensive intelligence to knock down.
<br>
<p>As for your inquiry about law and law books, I think law will help only
<br>
after the fact to ratify a consensus that develops within the AI community
<br>
on ethical behavior, that is, only after true AIs have been up and running a
<br>
long time (for them and us).  Attempts to legislate ahead of technology on
<br>
subtle, fact specific issues like this rarely occur, and are never
<br>
effective.  If legislators were convinced of the danger of AIs converting
<br>
humans, a ban of AIs would be the most likely response.  (And it would still
<br>
be ineffective.)  Redefinitions of fraud, blackmail and so on to make them
<br>
applicable to AIs will come only after substantial experience with the
<br>
behavior of real AIs.  Laws mostly follow social conventions, and do not
<br>
precede them, and are easily swept away without that support, unless you
<br>
have a very strong secret police.  I can't think of any books in legal
<br>
theory that address this issue convincingly at length, but if you want I
<br>
could suggest something generally relevant. Unfortunately, the most incisive
<br>
writings are all tied to one side or another of the culture wars, and so are
<br>
onesided.
<br>
<p>As for meme talk (a complete side issue and I apologize for raising it),
<br>
although the evolutionary metaphor can be suggestive, I am generally
<br>
suspicious that it is often used to attempt to get to grand theory and
<br>
sweeping arguments without having to attend to the detailed mechanism.  In
<br>
my amateurs understanding of current biology, the selfish gene theory meant
<br>
never having to say you are sorry for not having unraveled protein
<br>
chemistry, and is being superceded at the cutting edge because people are
<br>
beginning to find the ways proteins matter to evolutionary development.  For
<br>
us, I think meme talk displaces more detailed discussions of how concepts
<br>
are adopted in rational discourse, when the whole point in the AI field is
<br>
to get to the details and implement them.  But my argument here is unfair to
<br>
some uses of the meme meme, even if accurate about others.
<br>
<p>John Stick
