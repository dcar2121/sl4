<em>&gt; &gt; My (limited) understanding is that the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the transistors to switch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not every transistor has a clock input.  Typically there are between four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ten unclocked transistors in series, and then a &quot;latch&quot;, which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pair of transistors that switch synchronously with the clock.  It is up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the chip architect to decide how many transistors there are between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latches, and then the logic of the chip has to be designed to fit that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraint. If you want to be fancy, the architect can decide that part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the chip will have 10 transistors between latches, and run at 1 GHz, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part will have five transistors between stages, and run at 2 GHz.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; According to what you are saying it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean there would be only one possible clock speed for a given chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; design. i.e. if you have 10ghz transistors and parts of the chip use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 10 transistors in series, then the chip is sold as a 1ghz part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is exactly what happens.
</em><br>
<p>Well that sounds like a completely asynchronous design. The point I'm
<br>
getting at is the clock can be modified...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clearly isn't the case since chips are sold in a wide range of speeds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm puzzled by what you mean here.  Let me take a stab at it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some Pentiums are fast, some Pentiums are slow, but this is because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are manufactured using different processes, and in some cases, using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different logic designs.  From an engineering point of view, they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;one chip sold in a wide range of speeds.&quot;  They are different chips, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all labeled &quot;the same&quot; by the marketing department.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree here. I know that there is a &quot;natural&quot; variation in the max
<br>
clock speed achievable for a set of &quot;identical&quot; chips that come off of
<br>
a wafer. The manufacturers test them and do a &quot;bin split&quot; where all of
<br>
the chips capable of a specific speed grade are sorted together. For
<br>
instance, the current AMD Athlon 4 chip produced in Germany on their
<br>
copper process might have a &quot;sweet spot&quot; of 1.4ghz, but off a given
<br>
wafer you may have some chips that can operate up to 1.8ghz, and some
<br>
that only work at 1.2ghz and below. This is due simply to errors and
<br>
flaws in the manufacturing process. AMD marks them all according to
<br>
what they can handle, and may even mark some of them lower if there is
<br>
currently big demand for a lower speed grade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can make a chip run faster by upping the input voltage, as you say, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also by cooling it.  But these modifications typically produce less than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50% gain, and aren't what account for the speed differences between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different versions of the &quot;same chip&quot;.  Changes in voltage and temperature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give the engineers that designed the chip the heebie-jeebies, and are not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robust way of improving performance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that the chip can be configured to run the clock lines at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wide variety of speeds, and the only limitations come in from the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the transistors may require higher voltage levels to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; switch quickly enough. Higher voltages eventually run you into heat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dissipation and other problems, putting an upper limit on how fast a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given chip design/substrate combo can operate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, chips are usually run near their maximum tolerable voltage.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit is set by various kinds of short-circuts being induced by electrons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arcing across a gap or tunneling through an insulator.  Heat disspation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a problem for the packaging engineer.  At the high end, we're not pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the limits of cooling technology.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, well I've read about Pentium 4 &quot;hotspots&quot; that are already causing
<br>
thermal throttling problems in real world benchmarks... Some of these
<br>
CPUs are putting out over 75 watts. But that is not the high end :-)
<br>
<p>Anyway, what I was saying was simply that the CPU manufacturers can
<br>
&quot;lock&quot; the CPU clock to operate only at a given frequency. Intel has
<br>
done this in the past to try and defeat overclockers.
<br>
<p>So can we sum up: what are the factors that limit the max clockspeed of
<br>
a given chip design? transistor switching speed is only one apparently
<br>
minor factor. If we already have transistors in .18 processes that can
<br>
switch at over 100ghz speeds, why are our CPU designs limited to speeds
<br>
under 2ghz? Will clockless designs allow higher speeds and better
<br>
performance?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I designed chips for supercomputers from '84 to '92, so what I say above is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nine years out of date.  But I don't think much has changed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the details!
