that even an &quot;egotistical&quot; AI might be interested in a species

that had that sort of potential and in either further

actualizing or suppressing that potential.

<p><em>&gt; egoistic AI would fully encompass the philosophy of egoism (and

<p>Being egoistic as the ultimate goal is pretty empty. What does

it mean exactly?  If I have nothing in my head (figuratively

speaking) but being egoistic then I wouldn't have much going for
<br>
me as an average intelligence much less as a superintelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; on the ultimate goal of being Friendly (well, there seems to be some
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p><p>Is there any signficance to this seemingly empty line of

speculation? I confess that I don't get it.
