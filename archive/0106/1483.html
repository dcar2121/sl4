<p>
This will be my only post of a personal nature, and since it's a JOIN one, 
<br>
can't flak me.  I didn't use PGP for this message, although I can if you 
<br>
really really want--I just don't see the point, and don't really see other 
<br>
people use it either.

Best way to pronounce name: D.  PSA: Never, ever spell my first name with 
an S or two Ns.
Education:
	High School: Robert College '97
	College: Middlebury '02 (Math), Columbia SEAS '02 (Comp Sci--AI and Theory)
Work: Currently underemployed as research assistant in Natural Language 
Processing group hacking Perl on better days, no off-campus US work permit.
Gender: Male
Intelligence: 99%ile (says some test)
Slowness: occasional
Attitude: Usually unpretentious.  Try to be not-rude, telling the truth 
never qualifies as &quot;rude&quot; in my definition.  Learned not to point out some 
people's mistakes although it helps them on the long run--convincing myself 
that those who can't take that kind of a favor do not have ethical 
significance.  I have no place among people who burst into tantra when you 
show them their deficiency.  Or so I realized recently.
Political Orientation: volatile.  But always have been in favor of personal 
liberties.  One that I am iffy about is the right to believe in and spread 
obviously false things.  I am ethically kaput as far as the 
benevolence/builtin-morality discussion goes.
Religious Orientation: very vocally atheist and 
anti-(paganism/sprituality/newage).
Shock Level: I'm a mathematician, enough said!  I find some of the 
methodology in Eliezer's and Ray Kurzweil's writings unscientific, but 
overall, I approve.  My hesitation is not about what can be done as much as 
what should be done.
Propaganda: immune since 15 years old.  Make a point of seeing through 
every ad/commercial (almost, e-mail or ICQ me if you are interested in 
talking about them), deconstructing every song, and every scene in every 
popular movie/sitcom from a &quot;how's this supposed to take over my brain&quot; 
point of view.  Chomsky says most people don't do that, to my 
incomprehension (although it makes sense in an a priori way, since 
propaganda would probably phase out automatically if no one buyed in--since 
it takes resources to support, whoever uses it would use their resources 
otherwise unless it generated revenue).  One of the things I am usually bad 
at is not overestimating other people (probably does not apply to most of 
you here).
Outlook: usually cynical.  I see no reason why transitions to SI would not 
just fall into the hands of major corporations, which would do as they 
pleased with them.  I don't see why the BIG ones would not buy out any 
attempt of building some sort of worthy AI.  I don't understand why anyone 
in the world would invest to set up an ethical sysop (a huge 
investment).  I see a lot of potential for human slavery--which already 
exists (humans of humans) IMO.  &quot;My political orientation&quot; means my 
reaction to my assessment of the world--my overall assessment of how the 
world works does not change year to year.  Well, I am very cynical about 
issues not pertaining to AI as well, so I ain't no technophobe (duh!).
Hobbies: reading books, magazines, good stuff on the web; music, arguing 
(civilly, not as opposed to some widespread sense of the term), hanging out 
with intelligent people.
Taste in books: Isaac Asimov rules.  Also, some sciency non-fiction.  (a 
textbook on QM, i.e.) Bash: I should read more.
Are fun: abstract algebra, graph theory, AI, learning languages (human and 
programming), sex.
Philosophy: Scientific materialism.  I'll never be a Randian &quot;man&quot; (see 
above: oh my Freud, i'm guided by my animal instincts!) since I can not 
find a goal using reason only.  (How can I define &quot;self-interest&quot; if I 
don't have goals?  Money means nothing to me, as long as I have enough to 
eat and a place to stay.  Reproduction of my memes is also instinctive and 
do not see it as self-interest, although it can serve to reduce my stress 
level by making me get along better with other people if they spread 
enough.)  Finding goals using reason sounds to me like a contradiction 
anyway--there has to be seed desires (I use desire in a generic term which 
includes ethics, what I really means is a utility function) in order to 
build one that is guided by reason (i.e., not totally random).  I could 
just devote the rest of my life to, say, increasing the racially Asian 
percentage of the US population (this is just an example, I'm not Asian) 
but I guess that would not be a &quot;rationally-derived&quot; utility 
function.  Because nothing can.  Survival and reproduction blah blah are 
good for the organism, which I see myself as a function of--therefore have 
no obligation towards it except for sustaining me, etc.  I believe that 
rationality can come into play only for satisfying a (might be implicit or 
even quasi-defined) utility function (and based on observation).  I don't 
understand this talk about using reason to find our real goals--and as my 
father has advised, ideally speaking, I am a hedonist, but philosophically 
it's not very fulfilling.  I believe in the mind as well as the brain.  So 
there!
ICQ UIN: 1517804 (I'm not always on.)
Relationship with parents: I like them, they're pretty bright folks, 
although a little bit narrow-minded.  &quot;Why are you still making such an 
effort for me?&quot; &quot;You're our child--we love you.&quot; &quot;But how can you love me 
without understanding me?&quot; &quot;We do understand you.&quot; &quot;How can you understand 
me if you don't even know what recursion is?&quot;
Reason to join, etc: read Eliezer's stuff on the web.  Sounded a bit too 
much like me and my thoughts, and ever since I've been lurking here and on 
extropians, realized that I was not the only person thinking about weird 
stuff--in fact, I had independently thought of a lot of similar 
concepts.  I, on the other hand, have managed to have a traditional 
education with a 3.0+ GPA despite my energetically/moodwise low points, 
thanks to self-imposed dictatorship in stressful situations.  Having fun 
lurking so far.
Till later,
Deniz
