</em><br>
<p>Is there a good non-anthropomorphic definition of sentience somewhere?
<br>
The reason I ask is that SI:s might indeed agree with the statement above, 
<br>
but still do away with humanity because they feel that we are not &quot;sentient&quot; 
<br>
in THEIR definition of the term. Sentience seem to apply a certain level of 
<br>
complexity within the processing unit (brain in our case): The ability to 
<br>
recognize the self for instance.
<br>
<p>The SI:s might have some particular state of mind that (in their view) sets 
<br>
them apart from us as our sentience sets us apart from the lower animals. 
<br>
They might feel a strong sense of bonding with other beings with this 
<br>
mindstate, but feel that our sentience isn't all that fancy.
<br>
If you make an analogy: The SI:s might compare MindState X to our sentience 
<br>
in the same way we compare our sentience to, say, the ability to adapt to a 
<br>
changing environment(which many animals have).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a real superintelligence versus a computing engine without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any true inner life will conclude eventually (hopefully sooner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than later) that its own existence and by extension the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence of all sentients is made more secure by the valuing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentient beings and by a minimum set of agreed rights that lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to a minimum level of cooperation and peaceable co-existence.
</em><br>
<p>Again, replace sentience with MindState X, and it could be true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;An entity that stomps on humans today out of &quot;having no use for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them&quot; is open to being stomped on by a more capable entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tomorrow that has the same lack of ethical constraints.
</em><br>
<p>This is also interesting. A self-enhancing SI would probably know how much 
<br>
it could increase his own intelligence. If there was an entity that was as 
<br>
much above the SI as the SI is above humans, the SI would probably enhance 
<br>
himself to that level pretty quickly.
<br>
<p>Even if the scenario above took place, I cannot see why the Super SI (SSI) 
<br>
would spare the SI just because the SI was nice to humans. That would imply 
<br>
that if humans are nice to animals, the SI:s are more likely to be nice to 
<br>
us.
