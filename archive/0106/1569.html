PREFACE: I'm going to extend the idea of my previous post. The
<br>
original proposition was: &quot;A variant of English can be used for
<br>
unambiguous communication&quot;. We might use any natural human language
<br>
as a superset, but examples here will be in English. English might be
<br>
sufficiently powerful but just needs to be constrained. The question
<br>
could be: &quot;Are there examples of the English language which cannot be
<br>
disambiguated (ones which we cannot mend through some sort of
<br>
additional information)?&quot; or even &quot;Is unambiguous communication
<br>
possible?&quot;. If the answer to either of these is no, then we have to
<br>
give up. The discussion below presumes there is an &quot;unambiguous
<br>
intention of the speaker&quot;. This might be false in some cases and the
<br>
choice of language would neither help nor hinder. We should also be
<br>
concerned if there are some things which cannot be communicated.
<br>
<p>I might not arrive at solutions, but I mention a lot of things here
<br>
:) 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; From: &quot;Patrick McCuller&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:patrick@kia.net?Subject=RE:%20Unambiguous%20Language%20WAS:%20MEME:%20A.I.:%20Artificial%20Intelligence">patrick@kia.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	Very funny! Still, even that might not suffice. There are many dictionaries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all do not agree. Because definitions contain words, and we relate to each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those words, we would all have to have exactly the same understandings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all English words.
</em><br>
<p>If there are multiple dictionaries and we need them to agree, then
<br>
perhaps we can define equivalence mappings:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;commoner(MWOCD,ed7,2) &quot;means the same as&quot; commoner(MSED,ed666,13)*
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;foo(HD,ed13,1) &quot;means the same as&quot; foo(PD,ed415,7)+&lt;modification&gt;**
<br>
<p>So we can find all the matches that match exactly and then find all
<br>
the matches which are close and attach the difference (&lt;modification&gt;
<br>
above).
<br>
<p>* (MSED,ed13,7) = MicroSoft Encarta Dictionary, edition 666, def'n 13,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;35 cents has been deducted from your account. Thank you for using MSN.
<br>
<p>** foo according to (HD,ed13,1) is the same as foo according to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(PD,ed415,7), EXCEPT foo(PD,ed415,7) also means &lt;modification&gt;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	Even if we all agreed on the the book definitions of all words, and even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we were willing to spend huge amounts of processing power cross-referencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words (in many varied and fluidly changing dictionaries) we would still have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem presenting ideas without the possibility of misinterpretation.
</em><br>
<p>Regarding word ambiguity:
<br>
------------------------
<br>
<p>But it might only be a matter of practicality. We might be able to
<br>
communicate unambiguously, if we define all our terms ahead of time
<br>
(see above footnote style descriptions).
<br>
<p>At some point we hit bottom level symbol-referent bindings (as an
<br>
example of this I mean the symbol &quot;tree&quot; refers to &quot;the concept of
<br>
tree&quot; and is therefore &quot;bound&quot; to it. Or the symbol &quot;Patrick&quot; refers
<br>
to and is bound to (my mental symbol of) you, the person.) See also
<br>
&quot;More regarding experiential references&quot; below.
<br>
<p>Hardware Limitations:
<br>
--------------------
<br>
<p>One interesting point is that our understanding of English is
<br>
*hardware limited*. We (humans) can usually only remember 7 chunks of
<br>
information at a time, right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html">http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html</a>
<br>
<p>There are examples of English sentences which are grammatically
<br>
correct and unambiguous, but which are just too hard for most people
<br>
to parse correctly due to memory limitations. I tried to find an
<br>
example on the web, but I failed. I almost remember a sample that
<br>
looked something like: &quot;The sentence Ben said Gordon said Samantha
<br>
said Durant said Patrick said Jimmy said Jordon said Dave said Eli
<br>
said was right&quot; - but that's not an actual example, unfortunately...
<br>
<p>Regarding grammatical ambiguity:
<br>
-------------------------------
<br>
<p>Consider the grammatically correct sentence:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visiting extropians can be exciting.
<br>
<p>Could either mean:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Extropians, who are visiting, can be exciting.
<br>
Or:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Going to visit extropians can be exciting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Normally we distinguish between the possibility of (a) or (b) by
<br>
*context*, ie. the rest of the paragraph, chapter, etc. will support
<br>
one interpretation over the other. This is not guaranteed, of
<br>
course. So there are maybe two patches here: 1) disallow known
<br>
ambiguous sentence patterns (we're getting a subset of English here)
<br>
or 2) footnote ambiguous grammar in the same way we were foot-noting
<br>
ambiguous words above. If the speaker means to convey 7 concepts,
<br>
then those 7 concepts should be noted.
<br>
<p>Note:
<br>
The above example sentence was modified from one in &quot;Patterns of the
<br>
Mind : Language and Human Nature&quot; by Ray Jackendoff, p. 48. The book
<br>
is pretty simple (just right for me), but a good read.
<br>
<p>Another example:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a copy of CFAI to the man in the chair with the broken leg.
<br>
<p>which could mean:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a copy of CFAI to the man in (the chair with the broken leg).
<br>
Or:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a copy of CFAI to (the man with the broken leg) in the chair. 
<br>
<p>This would be especially ambiguous if you looked over and saw one man
<br>
with a broken leg sitting in a chair and another man in a chair which
<br>
had a broken leg, each reading a copy of CFAI. It would be funny,
<br>
too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	We each as individuals attach our own feelings, ideas, and experiences to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions of words.
</em><br>
<p>Just to carry my ridiculous thought experiment forward, I might
<br>
&quot;publish&quot; my meaning prior to using it, in a personal, public
<br>
dictionary:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Memetic Attractor&quot;(DD,ed1): 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. a sort of basin of beliefs to which a sentient
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entity can be &quot;attracted&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. a meme which attracts other memes to it, the way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Christianity co-opted Celtic winter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;festivals.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diz. using this phrase sometimes make me dizzy for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unknown reasons. This attached note means I'm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;referencing a feeling of dizziness in addition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any another meaning.
<br>
<p>Of course, these definitions would need to be replete with
<br>
disambiguating references as well (Is this hard? Am I side stepping
<br>
the real problem here? Does it all work if I assume everything
<br>
bottoms out?).
<br>
<p>More regarding experiential references:
<br>
--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Now, there are some cultural and personal experiential definitions
<br>
which are hard to convey. Consider the sentence:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like the first time I used a bidet.
<br>
<p>Even if you look up the definition of &quot;bidet&quot; in a French dictionary,
<br>
you still might have no idea how the author's experience of &quot;it&quot; was
<br>
like the author's first experience using a &quot;bidet&quot;. But I could
<br>
easily imagine an example of a satisfactory description of the
<br>
specific details. So the limitation is not the language, just the
<br>
cumbersome effort to convey all the relevant particulars.
<br>
<p>Regarding reliance on shared experiences:
<br>
----------------------------------------
<br>
<p>If I talk about colors to a blind person (ok, we're getting
<br>
dangerously close to the &quot;qualia&quot; issue) she might have no way of
<br>
knowing what I'm talking about. I can probably list connotations
<br>
about feeling &quot;hot&quot;, or making literary associations to &quot;anger&quot;,
<br>
which she would probably know. This is different from &quot;ambiguity&quot;,
<br>
which arises when more than one interpretation is possible. This is
<br>
the case of NO possible interpretation.
<br>
<p>If I were talking with a sentient machine which has no knowledge or
<br>
experience of heat or anger and no &quot;close&quot; mapping to those concepts
<br>
exist, we'd have the same problem. We can probably work around this
<br>
though in some (dare I suggest it) Skinnerian behavioral notions of
<br>
cause and effect (ie. if the sentient machine knows how these
<br>
concepts &quot;affect me behaviorally&quot; we might still be able to
<br>
communicate to a lesser extent).
<br>
<p>In fact it is very important that we can communicate unambiguously
<br>
(or at least effectively) if we are, or someone we know is :), going
<br>
to build a self enhancing AI any time soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	Language as we use it is fluid. Dictionaries do not contain every relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece of information, and they cannot tell us how others will interpret a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given word.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. We'd have to change the way we use it. Just to make this a
<br>
little more SL3-ish, can we assume a fat pipe*** connection to our
<br>
hardware enhanced brains, so hardware considerations disappear?
<br>
<p>&quot;Dictionaries do not contain every relevant piece of information&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True. But we could publish our personal meanings first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reference them parenthetically (see above).
<br>
<p>&quot;Dictionaries cannot tell us how others will interpret a given word.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently true. But if we can define precise enough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definitions and enumerate all connotations, couldn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this be solved? I assert that &quot;precise enough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definitions&quot; can be defined as needed (it just requires
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra effort and assumes bottom level common
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences exist, so that we can refer to the same
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things...or sufficiently similar things. Then it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes a matter of listing which meanings are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intended).
<br>
<p>*** Fat Pipe(DD,ed1)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. High bandwidth connection to a channel that carries lots of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	Given that we cannot control how others will interpret a word, a perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unambiguous languange may be impossible.
</em><br>
<p>So can we turn that around? &quot;Unambiguous languange may be possible if
<br>
we can control how others will interpret a word.&quot; Our next question
<br>
would be: &quot;What kind of control would we need?&quot; Maybe control is
<br>
unnecessary here, maybe all we need is verification that when I say
<br>
&quot;chocolate chip cookie&quot; your concept of this phrase is sufficiently
<br>
similar to mine for what I want to communicate. If I use the invented
<br>
phrase &quot;cow chip cookie&quot; and I could check that in your personal,
<br>
published lexicon you have similar definitions for &quot;cow chip&quot; and
<br>
&quot;cookie&quot;, I can feel pretty confident you'll know what I'm talking
<br>
about, even if neither of us knows how one tastes.
<br>
<p>Communication through English already works (ambiguity and all). The
<br>
stronger my anticipation that you'll know what I'm talking about, the
<br>
less I'll have to reference and clarify footnote-style. With this
<br>
envisioned future footnote/hyperlink scenario, the listener doesn't
<br>
have to ask for clarification, since the listener can check the
<br>
speaker's dictionary. Cumbersome currently, but we already use the
<br>
web to look things up without bothering the speaker or other
<br>
listeners...that is if our employers grant us web access :(
<br>
<p>For real world, common, tangible things, there is always a little
<br>
ambiguity. For example, if I sent you a cookie recipe:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Recipe may be halved)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 cups butter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 cups flour
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tsp. soda
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 cups sugar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 cups blended oatmeal (blend in a blender to a fine powder)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 oz. chocolate chips
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 cups brown sugar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 tsp. salt
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 eggs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tsp. baking powder
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tsp. vanilla
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla; mix
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts. Roll into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies.****
<br>
<p>you followed it and successfully baked the cookies. I'd say we
<br>
communicated. I don't know how you'll interpret: Hershey Bar, flour,
<br>
and soda, but somehow I can be pretty sure you'll interpret them as I
<br>
intend. Contextually, and otherwise, I expect these words should have
<br>
clear meaning. The little ambiguity that does exists is explained in
<br>
parenthetical notes (this actually reveals what I think is
<br>
ambiguous).
<br>
<p>And yes a full blow common sense engine would probably be needed for
<br>
a machine to bake these cookies given only the above recipe, because
<br>
there are always many, many shared assumptions. This is where
<br>
practicality prevents what might be possible.
<br>
<p>There might be associations which I do not want to or need to convey.
<br>
If the smell of vanilla reminds me of the (hypothetical) time I drank
<br>
a whole bottle of vanilla extract and got sick, that information is
<br>
irrelevant to you for the task of making cookies. If it were relevant
<br>
I could footnote it. *(6)
<br>
<p>**** Regarding this cookie recipe, I had just finished a salad at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nieman-Marcus cafe in Dallas and decided to have a small
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dessert. Because I'm such cookie lover, I decided to try the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Neiman-Marcus Cookie.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recipe and the waitress said with a small frown, &quot;I'm afraid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;would you let me buy the recipe?&quot; With a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cute smile, she said, &quot;yes.&quot; I asked how much and she responded,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;only two fifty. It's a great deal!&quot; With approval, I said to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just add it to my tab.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty days later, I received my statement from Neiman-Marcus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it was $285.00. I looked again and I remembered that I had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only spent $9.95 for a salad and about $20.00 for a hat. As I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;COOKIE RECIPE
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- $250.00&quot; That's outrageous!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called Nieman's accounting department and told them the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waitress said it was &quot;two-fifty&quot; which clearly does not mean
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;two hundred and fifty dollars&quot; by any possible interpretation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the phrase.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neiman-Marcus refused to budge. They would not refund my money
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because according to them, &quot;What the waitress told you is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our problem. You have already seen the recipe - we absolutely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not refund your money at this point.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained to her the criminal statutes which govern fraud in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas. I threatened to refer them to the Better Business Bureau
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the state's Attorney General for engaging in fraud. I was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basically told, &quot;Do what you want, we don't give a crap, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we're not refunding your money.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any of my money back. I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$250.00 and now I'm going to have $250.00 worth of fun.&quot; I told
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Nieman-Marcus for free.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She replied, &quot;I wish you wouldn't do that.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have thought of that before you ripped me off,&quot; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slammed the phone on her.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it is!!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can possibly think of. I paid $250.00 for this ... I don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want Nieman-Marcus to ever get another penny off of this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recipe. *(5)
<br>
<p>*(5) Actually none of this happened and most of you already suspected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.
<br>
<p>*(6) Do not drink entire bottles of vanilla extract, no matter how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delicious it smells. Though I have not done so, I think you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might get sick.
<br>
<p>PS - I thought I'd mention that that pun about &quot;A wild bore&quot; in one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my previous emails was invented by a computer program JAPE (I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think) written by Kim Binstead (I think) while she was at Oxford
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I think), in case you didn't recognize the reference. It was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obscure and didn't need to be explained, but I explained it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyway. So there :)
