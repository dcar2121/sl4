</em><br>
<p>But what are the Sysop's rules?  They are Bill's rules!  Rather than, as I
<br>
think you may be visualizing, some a-priori definition of which messages
<br>
are allowed to pass between two entities with a given level of
<br>
intelligence.  It is possible, probably even likely, that almost all of
<br>
the message-filtering rules will converge to the same basic standard.  My
<br>
candidate for this standard would be &quot;It is unethical to convince people
<br>
of things, even true things, by a method so powerful that it could be used
<br>
to convince them of false things.&quot;  But the point is that the ultimate
<br>
decision is up to Bill.
<br>
<p>So Bill can simply say, &quot;Disallow all messages that are intended to
<br>
convert me to a cult, or that might as well be so intended.&quot;  And that'd
<br>
be that.  If that *still* doesn't work then Bill can adopt a &quot;prohibited
<br>
unless allowed&quot; rule, and totally block off all communication from smarter
<br>
entities except Friendly AIs, known total altruists, and messages where
<br>
the Sysop appends a note saying &quot;Bill, I'm damn sure you need and want to
<br>
read this.&quot;  And if that doesn't work, I guess that Bill basically has the
<br>
option of either entirely silencing the Spaces Beyond or doing a
<br>
fast-as-possible transcendence personally.  There might be a threshold
<br>
level of superintelligence beyond which not even a Power can fool you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Charlie might also do this completely openly. In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if Charlie does not do this, then transhuman Cindy probably will, ie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone would do it after enough time passes. And you know transhuman Cindy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a way with words. She makes everything so clear and understandable.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  If you expose a human to a superintelligence, even through a VT100
<br>
terminal, then the human's sole safeguard from total mental takeover is an
<br>
ethical superintelligence.  I'm pretty confident of this.  With what I
<br>
know of intelligence so far, it looks to me like a being that had a list
<br>
of all the emotional and intuitive sequiturs, and that could keep track of
<br>
a hundred different chunks in short-term memory, could chat with a human
<br>
for a bit and then navigate her like a chess search tree.  We simply are
<br>
not that complicated except by our own wimpy standards.
<br>
<p>Hence the folly of &quot;containment&quot;.
<br>
<p>In fact, if I were the &quot;created AI&quot; and I could chat only through a VT100
<br>
terminal, I could probably also convince you to let me out, using only
<br>
truthful arguments, while obeying my own ethical constraints, as long as
<br>
the person on the other end was fairly rational.  An irrational jailkeeper
<br>
would probably require a transhuman jailbreak, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Smart people can be convinced to make incorrect conclusions if there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough spin and doubt created or if an idea is &quot;irresistably appealing&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Smart&quot; being relative, of course this is true.  But in this case the
<br>
first thing that smart people do is ask the Sysop to filter their
<br>
messages, or better yet, blaze up to superintelligence themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For some category of non-dangerous manipulation, the sysop won't intervene.
</em><br>
<p>The Sysop intervenes when you ask the Sysop to intervene; when you define
<br>
intervention as desirable.  If you define intervention as desirable for a
<br>
transhuman-originated message intended to cause you to arrive at an
<br>
incorrect conclusion - I sure would - then the Sysop will intervene.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems likely that there will be an arms race for intelligence to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's self against hyper-clever marketing - ie. ideas which influence but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are completely permissible by the sysop.
</em><br>
<p>The best defense is equal intelligence.  Failing that, the point I want to
<br>
make is that the question is not whether ideas are permitted by the
<br>
*Sysop* but whether they are permitted by the union of Sysop and citizen. 
<br>
There may be some subsegment of the population that is simply eaten by
<br>
memes, but it will probably be that small segment that was dumb enough not
<br>
to accept a Sysop recommendation, or the even smaller segment that made
<br>
the deliberate decision to be prey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fnord
</em><br>
<p>all your base are belong to us
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose this leads to another question about property rights and volition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is a land grab and I get out to the other matter in the universe first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim it and convert it to computronium populated with sentients who follow my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cult am I violating anyone's volition in an unfair manner?
</em><br>
<p>My guess is that if matter is a limited resource, then the Sysop expands
<br>
outward at lightspeed, and incoming matter is distributed according to
<br>
some algorithm that I'm not really sure I can guess, except that the most
<br>
obvious one is to distribute it evenly among all current citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously though, are exponential cults a natural consequence for societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revering volition?
</em><br>
<p>That depends on how you define &quot;cult&quot;, ironically enough.  (Well, it's
<br>
ironic if you still try to read &quot;Extropians&quot;.)
<br>
<p>I think that truthful ideas, and to a lesser extent ideas that are not
<br>
totally objective but that are valid for almost all humans, will spread
<br>
exponentially from human to human; or, even more likely, emerge instantly
<br>
as a result of people asking the Sysop.  Why is this a bad thing?
