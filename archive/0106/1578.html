<p>I ran a google on Pro-Act... only found a security company with that name.

Could be copyright problems...? Are they supporters of the Singularity or 
<br>
more SL3 and transhumanistic stuff?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for the Singularity, I hold that it is inevitable except in the case

<p>I agree with you, but as you say in the last line: the fact that the 
<br>
singularity probably is a natural development for an intelligent species is 
<br>
merely of philosophical interest. It will not help us if we spend our lives 
<br>
rotting away in some &quot;relinquishment camp&quot; or get lynched by an angry mob.
<br>
<p>That said, I think we have a fair chance of going Singular without much fuss 
<br>
(from the luddites that is). The public outcry against new technologies seem 
<br>
to slowly work its way up the SL-ladder: it currently seem to be at low-end 
<br>
SL2: genetic engineering, stem cell research, cloning. I think that when 
<br>
cloning has been performed and perfected, the debate will die down as it did 
<br>
with test-tube babies. After that we have genetic engineering of humans, 
<br>
which will cause major controversy (ClonAid say that they will pursue it). I 
<br>
hardly think that AI-research will seem threatening in that respect: some 
<br>
geeks sitting in a basement coding and drinking Jolt Cola can hardly compete 
<br>
with gangly men in white coats and round spectacles, screaming with a slight 
<br>
but unmistakable german accent: &quot;It's Alive!! ALIVE!!!&quot;
