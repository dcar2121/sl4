John,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From: &quot;John Stick&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:johnstick@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Coercive%20Transhuman%20Memes%20and%20Exponential%20Cults">johnstick@worldnet.att.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair enough.  My response was based in part on a sense that the language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cult and coercion is emotionally loaded, and calls up specific instances of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current behavior that are unlikely to be precisely duplicated by transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs.  
</em><br>
<p>Those terms are loaded, yes. &quot;Exponential Communities&quot; doesn't sound as
<br>
interesting :) What does still sound interesting to me is the notion of 
<br>
&quot;Manipulation with Consent&quot;. I guess what I'm really rediscovering is that
<br>
although we are pretty much free, we already live in a web of manipulation.
<br>
I make movies for some rich guy named George, whose company hires out my
<br>
services to the highest bidder. At the same time it's rather enjoyable, 
<br>
compared to say, heaving giant stones to build the pharo's tomb under the 
<br>
sweltering sun.
<br>
<p>Even if most of us spend most of our time fulfilling other people's goals,
<br>
there is still enough &quot;left over&quot; for me to pursue my own (provided I
<br>
limit my ambitions). There is always the truism that the more money one has, 
<br>
the &quot;free&quot;er one seems to be. I actually think that this will hold true
<br>
in a transhuman future where computational resources play the part of 
<br>
&quot;money&quot;, but that's another discussion.
<br>
<p>Cuckoo's discard other birds' eggs and lay their own egg's in the nest, to
<br>
be fed by the nesting bird. This type of one-sided manipulation does go
<br>
away as intelligence increases for both birds. Humans, who are much
<br>
smarter, would see through this usually, cuckolds not withstanding. 
<br>
Hopefully these days, infidelity sooner results in something like divorce 
<br>
and alimony than revenge and murder.
<br>
<p>So we have come a long way and I accept your point individual freedom has
<br>
increased over the years and there is much hope and reason to believe that
<br>
transhuman ascendence will continue that upward arc.
<br>
<p>If Friendliness does take hold and my well being is further assured,
<br>
there are still many various paths my life can take. These variations might
<br>
have benefit for more powerful entities than myself (in the same way that
<br>
corporations profit from my actions while I'm still a free citizen making
<br>
what I consider are my own choices). I find that interesting. I also find
<br>
it interesting that transhumans could scale up their abilities and &quot;play
<br>
games&quot; with other people's lives while those other people still enjoy
<br>
their &quot;freedom&quot;. Would there be protections against this? If people didn't
<br>
want to be a part of anyone else's game, is there any way of obtaining
<br>
disclosure one's &quot;manipulation&quot;? This might be a silly line of reasoning
<br>
but I find it curious nonetheless. Perhaps I find it most striking because
<br>
I'd assumed that with freedom and protection of volition that I would not
<br>
be manipulated, and now I realize that's hardly true. With an all knowing
<br>
Sysop, maybe we can still maintain the control of our lives that our 
<br>
individual dignity warrants. 
<br>
<p>The _danger_ I still see is incremental drift combined the ability to modify
<br>
ourselves at deep levels. But, actually, I think this is a tractable
<br>
and probably obvious problem, so I won't worry about it (I'll leave that up 
<br>
to the Sysop...riddle: when does &quot;Sysop&quot; rhyme with &quot;Copout&quot;? :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are interesting issues about what uses of information to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuade another transhuman intelligence would be fraudulent, antisocial or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercive, but the cult, conversion, and eaten by a meme tropes 
</em><br>
<p>:) is www.memetrope.com taken yet ? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; draw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to the extremes.  Arguing that the extremes will become less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevalent as intelligence increases is (like) trying to look beyond a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity: of dubious utility and accuracy-- but what else are we going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about?
</em><br>
<p>We haven't seen what transhumanism looks like yet. When the anaerobic bacteria
<br>
were &quot;catastrophically&quot; replaced by aerobic bacteria, the bacterial world
<br>
probably hadn't seen such drastic, punctuated chage. Both types survived, but
<br>
the new upstart dominated thereafter. Maybe Exponential Communities or Group
<br>
Brains should not be feared. Maybe they will be superior and more enjoyable.
<br>
The weirdness enters when I can allow ideas to enter my mind which can change 
<br>
what I find &quot;enjoyable&quot;, so that I might be converted from an individualist
<br>
to a happy member of the Borg family, while completely complying with the
<br>
rules of Friendliness!
<br>
<p>(Pssst, hey buddy, I've got a mod that'll blow your mind. Your body will
<br>
be reconfigured to intake the waste of other entities. You'll find it satisfying
<br>
and healthy. You'll enjoy its as you've never enjoyed anything else. Soon, 
<br>
you'll be craving that waste &quot;oxygen&quot;...or hating not getting it...hard to tell.
<br>
Mmmm, manure sandwiches... :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't buy the idea that intellectual coercion and its defense is an arms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race where each advance in intelligence helps each side equally.  
</em><br>
<p>When I think of intellectual coercion as an arms race, I think of having
<br>
to buy a car from a used car salesman. He has all these tactics and if I'm
<br>
not aware of them, I'm going to end up getting a lousy deal. By learning
<br>
how to defend myself (what's that webite, www.edmunds.com?) I will fare
<br>
better. Each iteration, each &quot;side&quot; must escalate...There are limits on
<br>
fraud, though, that prevent the salesman from completely cheating me (ie. 
<br>
lemon laws), but somehow I'm still afraid of ending up with True-Coat
<br>
rust proofing (a la the movie Fargo).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is the simple minded argument that we start at zero intelligence, zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom, so any advance has to help.  Not conclusive, of course, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plotting intelligence against freedom may describe a curve whose slope goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative at some point, but still suggestive.  Mostly it is just a sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running scenarios through my head that each bit of defense will require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much larger increase in offensive intelligence to knock down.
</em><br>
<p>Having an SI calculate my best defence seems like a good way to go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for your inquiry about law and law books, I think law will help only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the fact to ratify a consensus that develops within the AI community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on ethical behavior, that is, only after true AIs have been up and running a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long time (for them and us).  Attempts to legislate ahead of technology on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle, fact specific issues like this rarely occur, and are never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective.  
</em><br>
<p>Ah yes, thanks for pointing that out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If legislators were convinced of the danger of AIs converting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, a ban of AIs would be the most likely response.  (And it would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be ineffective.)  Redefinitions of fraud, blackmail and so on to make them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicable to AIs will come only after substantial experience with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior of real AIs.  
</em><br>
<p>Again, the latency with which it takes the law to adapt to new scams might
<br>
be acceptable under current conditions, but in the hyperfast ascent scenario
<br>
effective coercion techniques might rise faster than defensive tactics.
<br>
<p>Hopefully the first thing Eli will do is lead the nascent AI into consider
<br>
defenses for all the yet-to-exist-nasties that lie in our path. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Laws mostly follow social conventions, and do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precede them, and are easily swept away without that support, unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a very strong secret police.  
</em><br>
<p>When social convention is split (ie. the abortion issue), I guess things
<br>
get messy. Now if only there were a way to manipulate social convention...
<br>
:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for meme talk (a complete side issue and I apologize for raising it),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although the evolutionary metaphor can be suggestive, I am generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspicious that it is often used to attempt to get to grand theory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweeping arguments without having to attend to the detailed mechanism.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my amateurs understanding of current biology, the selfish gene theory meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never having to say you are sorry for not having unraveled protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemistry, and is being superceded at the cutting edge because people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning to find the ways proteins matter to evolutionary development.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us, I think meme talk displaces more detailed discussions of how concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are adopted in rational discourse, when the whole point in the AI field is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get to the details and implement them.  But my argument here is unfair to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some uses of the meme meme, even if accurate about others.
</em><br>
<p>I hope I was using the concept appropriately in the context of mass ideological
<br>
movements where the latest transhuman craze might be Borgification and the
<br>
complete elimination of the desire to leave a hive-mind. The notion of a spread 
<br>
of memes (like an infection vector) appeared natural for this, but I don't use
<br>
the metaphor all the time.
