<p>
Hello  all,
<br>
<p>At the Extro 5 conference last week, I spoke to a number of you about the
<br>
possibility of investing in my new firm, Cognitive  Bioscience, which is
<br>
focused on applying Webmind AI technology to the bioinformatics domain, and
<br>
initially in particular to  the analysis of gene and protein expression
<br>
data.
<br>
<p>I promised you more details; well, this e-mail contains some.
<br>
<p>The end of this message contains an executive summary of our business plan,
<br>
followed by a list of questions and answers about  Cognitive Bioscience and
<br>
this fundraising effort.
<br>
<p>If you  may be seriously interested in investing in Cognitive Bioscience,
<br>
please e-mail me privately (<a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20Cognitive%20Bioscience">ben@goertzel.org</a>) and I  will send you a
<br>
complete business plan (it's about 22 pages long, so there's no bandwidth
<br>
issue, but I'd prefer to limit the  distribution of it to that which is
<br>
truly necessary for fundraising).
<br>
<p>We are interested, at this stage, in investment amounts ranging from $1000
<br>
up to $1M.  Unfortunately, anything less than  $1000 is probably not worth
<br>
our while to deal with, in terms of the legal paperwork involved.
<br>
<p>It is a difficult time to raise money right now.  The financial markets are
<br>
tight.  Investors are conservative to a fault,  just as they were generous
<br>
to a fault a year and a half ago.  The tight markets have been good in one
<br>
way: They have forced  us to think very, very hard about how to create a
<br>
business model that will allow us to create substantial profits on the way
<br>
to creating a real AI system.  But the market is so tough that even with a
<br>
good business plan and a great team, fundraising  is difficult.
<br>
<p>So I'm appealing to you guys, who recognize the value of forward-thinking
<br>
technology, to see beyond the temporary mood of  conservatism, and take a
<br>
small risk by investing in Cognitive Bioscience.  This is not a
<br>
pie-in-the-sky pure research  venture, it's a very carefully calculated plan
<br>
to capitalize on an identified market niche, and then build from that to the
<br>
creation of an organization capable of building an highly powerful
<br>
biodata-focused AI system.
<br>
<p>I should also add that, I know many of you are technically oriented
<br>
individuals.  We are very open to accepting more than  just money from our
<br>
investors: expertise, contacts, and so forth.  You don't have to view this
<br>
as just another investment,  you can view it as joining forces with
<br>
like-minded visionary compu-bio-geeks to create something amazing ...
<br>
actually two  amazing things: amazing technology, and an amazing corporation
<br>
that will be able to create amazing technology in a  sustainable way based
<br>
on profitability.
<br>
<p>Finally, if someone would rather *donate* money for pure AI research, than
<br>
invest it in an AI/biotech start-up, we have  created a nonprofit
<br>
organization, the Real AI Institute (www.goertzel.or/realai/), for this
<br>
purpose.  My preliminary  inquiries indicate that it will be much easier to
<br>
fund Cognitive Bioscience than to fund a pure research endeavor, and so I
<br>
am focusing my efforts on the Cognitive Bioscience.  But even assuming we
<br>
succeed with Cognitive Bioscience, there is some  useful work that can be
<br>
done toward real AI right now, that doesn't fit into the framework of an
<br>
AI/biotech startup, so even  a small amount of donation to the Real AI
<br>
Institute may be of value.
<br>
<p><p><p>Yours,
<br>
Ben Goertzel

<p><p>*******
<br>
Mission:
<br>
<p>To dominate the market for gene and protein expression data analysis
<br>
software, via the creation of superior applications  based on a combination
<br>
of statistical and machine learning techniques with our unique Biomind
<br>
artificial cognition  technology.  And then, to leverage our domination of
<br>
the expression data analysis niche into a major position in the  “integrated
<br>
molecular-biology data analysis” market.
<br>
*******
<br>
<p><p>Cognitive Bioscience is a start-up bioinformatics software firm, currently
<br>
seeking seed or first-round funding.   Led by  computer scientist Dr. Ben
<br>
Goertzel, the firm currently consists of about a dozen former staff from the
<br>
recently dissolved AI  software firm Webmind Inc.
<br>
<p>We are creating a suite of three products for biologists to use to analyze
<br>
genomic and proteomic expression data: Biomind  Workbench (with a high
<br>
four-figure pricetag), aimed at the individual biologist; and the
<br>
Bioknowledge Management System and  Biomind Pattern Finder, an extremely
<br>
powerful database and data mining system for large-scale users, with a
<br>
six-figure  pricetag and some customization generally required.
<br>
<p>Initial product versions will focus narrowly on expression data; subsequent
<br>
versions of the products will integrate  expression data with other types of
<br>
information including EST data, chemical databases, information on metabolic
<br>
pathways,  cellular information and “in silico biology”  models of cellular
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>Our long-term vision is an integration of two grand visions: AI and
<br>
post-genomic biology.   There is a deep synergy here, in  that AI provides
<br>
the computational firepower needed to analyze the vast amounts of data that
<br>
microarrays and other  post-genomic data gathering techniques produce;
<br>
whereas the world of molecular biology provides a domain rich enough to feed
<br>
an AI system with an endless variety of information that is not tied to
<br>
human sense organs or human common-sense  understanding.   Our initial
<br>
business model, focused on microarrays, is a pragmatic pathway to the
<br>
realization of this  long-term vision.
<br>
<p>On the back end, our products will from the very start leverage our unique
<br>
“general intelligence” technology, as well as our  years of experience
<br>
working as a team applying artificial cognition, statistical and machine
<br>
learning methods to data  analysis in various domains.  Our current
<br>
technology toolkit includes proprietary prediction, pattern recognition,
<br>
inference,  and categorization components, integrated in an overall AI
<br>
software framework called Biomind.   In the past, our tools have  proven
<br>
themselves superior to competition in text categorization, information
<br>
retrieval and financial prediction, and our  preliminary work indicates that
<br>
this will also be the case in the bioinformatics domain.
<br>
<p>Currently there are only two serious, somewhat established competitors in
<br>
the gene and protein expression data analysis  niche: Silicon Genetics and
<br>
Spotfire.  A handful of new startups are also attempting to address this
<br>
niche.  But the market  penetration of all these firms put together is still
<br>
low, and although their products are reasonably good ones, on the back  end
<br>
their software is founded on standard and old-fashioned data analysis
<br>
technologies, derived from well-known ideas in the  computer science and
<br>
statistics literature and implemented without subtlety.  The problem with
<br>
these data analysis methods is  twofold: first, they often fail to yield
<br>
adequate results even when wielded expertly; and second, they are difficult
<br>
for the  average biologist to use.  Our techniques resolve both of these
<br>
problems, providing both greater intelligence and greater  automation.
<br>
Thus, the superior intelligence provided by our unique AI technology will
<br>
give us a very significant market  advantage.
<br>
<p>In the broader area of integrated genomic and proteomic data analysis, the
<br>
main competitor is the aptly-named Chicago firm  “Integrated Genomics.”
<br>
However, the data integration performed by this firm is on a relatively
<br>
primitive level, and they  lack the computational tools required to do
<br>
serious bioinformatic analysis on a large and diverse body of biodata.
<br>
<p>To complement our strong computer science, application engineering and data
<br>
analysis expertise, we have recruited a  computational biologist from a
<br>
major Japanese pharmaceutical company to join our team, and we are in the
<br>
process of  recruiting a handful of others with biotech expertise, on both
<br>
the scientific and the marketing sides.
<br>
<p>The Biomind technology is based on the same core algorithms as the Webmind
<br>
AI Engine, a software system developed within  Webmind Inc. over the period
<br>
1998-2000, based largely on Dr. Goertzel’s mathematical cognitive science
<br>
theories.  However,  Biomind is implemented primarily in C whereas the
<br>
Webmind Inc. software was in Java; and the Biomind software architecture is
<br>
completely different than that of the Webmind Inc. AI Engine.
<br>
<p>The leaders of the Cognitive Bioscience team include
<br>
<p>-- Dr. Ben Goertzel , Chief Scientist and CEO, former Webmind Inc. founder,
<br>
Chief Scientist and CTO
<br>
-- Cassio Pennachin, VP of Engineering, former Webmind Inc. VP of AI
<br>
Development
<br>
-- Stephan Vladimir Bugaj, VP of Product Development, current chief software
<br>
architect at the biotech firm Proteometrics,  former Webmind Inc. Deputy CTO
<br>
<p>Dr. Goertzel, Mr. Bugaj and a handful of the others are based in the US; Mr.
<br>
Pennachin and the majority of the technical team  are currently based in
<br>
Belo Horizonte, Brazil.  (Brazil features a stable economy and a labor cost
<br>
roughly 1/3 that of the  US; the US and Brazilian portions of our team have
<br>
worked together for 3 years and have an outstandingly smooth operating
<br>
relationship.)
<br>
<p>Assuming funding commencing August 1 2001, we anticipate bringing our first
<br>
product to beta in November 2001, and launching  it generally on February 1,
<br>
2002.  The second product, with significantly expanded capabilities, will
<br>
launch in Fall 2002.
<br>
<p>Assuming first-round funding of $1M, we anticipate achieving profitability
<br>
within roughly 12 months of funding, and 2003  revenues in the $20-$80M
<br>
range or higher.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>*************
<br>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT COGNITIVE BIOSCIENCE AND THIS FUND-RAISING
<br>
EFFORT
<br>
<p><p>*********
<br>
Q: How much money are you seeking?
<br>
<p>A:
<br>
Generally, we are seeking $1M of first-round venture financing to get this
<br>
new company off the ground.  We believe that $1M  will bring us to the point
<br>
of profitability, within a single year.  There is a fairly strong argument
<br>
that we should take  $1.5M or even $2M instead, if it is offered, in order
<br>
to give us more of a cushion against bad luck events.
<br>
<p>However, our shorter-term goal is to raise $100K in seed funding.  This
<br>
$100K of money will pay for 6 Brazilian engineers to  work for 6 months (I
<br>
won't pay myself out of it).  In the first 4 of these 6 months, they will be
<br>
able to build an excellent  prototype demonstrating the applicability of our
<br>
technology to the bioinformatics domain.  With this prototype in hand I have
<br>
little doubt I'll be able to raise VC money, or get a deal with a major
<br>
pharmaceutical or biotech hardware firm.  Without it,  I  may still succeed,
<br>
but it isn't as certain for obvious reasons.  (Of course, more than $100K is
<br>
even better).
<br>
<p><p>*********
<br>
Q:  Is it legal to raise money like this?
<br>
<p>A:
<br>
Yes, if it's conducted properly.  Please remember that I've been through
<br>
this before.  Rule 504 of Regulation D states that  it's OK according to
<br>
federal law for a firm to raise up to $1 million from private investors with
<br>
very few restrictions.  Before actually accepting money I will of course
<br>
retain a lawyer to take care of the paperwork and ensure that everything is
<br>
executed properly.  There are thus two phases involved in this sort of
<br>
capital-raising effort:
<br>
<p>1) find out on a &quot;handshake&quot; (or e-handshake) basis who is interested in
<br>
investing how much, i.e. who is &quot;in&quot; on this seed  financing round
<br>
2) set up the legal paperwork, get everyone involved in the funding round to
<br>
sign it, and then actually collect the money
<br>
<p><p><p>*********
<br>
Q: How does this work relate to your long-term project to build a &quot;real AI&quot;,
<br>
achieve the Singularity, and so forth?
<br>
<p>A:
<br>
Cognitive Bioscience's core technology is Biomind, which is a particular
<br>
application of the Webmind AI Engine.  Thus, the  core AI work done for
<br>
Cognitive Bioscience is work that pushes us toward the end goal of creating
<br>
a real AI.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is a lot of work involved in building and marketing
<br>
bioinformatics products that is not AI work, and that  does not directly
<br>
push toward the goal of creating real AI.
<br>
<p>However, unless someone emerges with a plan to substantially fund real AI
<br>
development work, the best path to creating real AI  seems to be the
<br>
Cognitive Bioscience path: create a company that leverages real-AI-bound
<br>
technology to create profit in a   particular market, and then use the
<br>
profits from this enterprise to fund more and more ambitious real AI
<br>
development over  time.
<br>
<p>It is also a fact that an AI system requires a rich data domain to study and
<br>
act within.  Lacking robotic sensors and  actuators, the human-scale
<br>
physical world is not a good one.  The financial domain, which we
<br>
experimented with in Webmind  Inc., also has its flaws.  The codic domain,
<br>
while an important one in terms of the long-term goal of self-modifying AI
<br>
and  the Singularity, is in my view a very poor initial domain for a baby
<br>
AI, because (to put a very long story short) it consists  largely of
<br>
processes rather than data.  The molecular biology domain actually has a lot
<br>
of advantages here: there's a lot of  data of diverse kinds, and human
<br>
common sense intuition is not required to understand most of it.  All in
<br>
all, this seems a  decent domain for an AI system on which to cut its teeth.
<br>
When we begin experimenting with conversational interaction as an  interface
<br>
to biological information (planned for mid-2002, after the first product
<br>
releases), our &quot;baby AI&quot; will have a lot   of knowledge about genes and
<br>
proteins to share.
<br>
<p>It should also be noted that all of us involved in Cognitive Bioscience also
<br>
have a real, deep and abiding interest in cell  development and functioning
<br>
and postgenomic biology.  This is not just a byway on the path to real AI,
<br>
it's a fascinating  technological and business challenge unto itself.
<br>
Applying Biomind to help understand how cells get old, for example, is an
<br>
application of immense interest to all of us who prefer not to have our
<br>
human bodies die....
<br>
<p><p><p><p>*********
<br>
<p>Q: Your last company, Webmind Inc., went bankrupt.  So why on Earth should
<br>
we want to invest in your new company?
<br>
<p><p>A:
<br>
A flip answer is: Well, now I and my collaborators know what *not* to do....
<br>
<p>More seriously, my view of the Webmind Inc. bankruptcy is given in the
<br>
article I posted here before,
<br>
<a href="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/WakingUpFromTheEconomyOfDreams.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/WakingUpFromTheEconomyOfDreams.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Webmind Inc. never had a credible business model.  This was realized at many
<br>
points during late 1999 and 2000, and we tried  to correct it, but as it
<br>
turned out we made our big mistake early on.  In 1999 we shifted from a
<br>
financial-prediction-based  business model to an internet information
<br>
management tools based business model.  This seemed clever at the time
<br>
because  financial funds were priced at 2 times earnings whereas internet
<br>
companies were priced at infinity times earnings.  The  result was that  our
<br>
excellent financial prediction technology was mothballed (it now has 11
<br>
months of real-time  paper-trading track record, but this comes too late to
<br>
save Webmind Inc., and out of the Webmind Inc. bankruptcy, this code  will
<br>
be owned by others than me and I'll have little to do with it, although I
<br>
invented a good bit of the technology  underlying this application).  Now
<br>
almost every company involved in internet information management is going
<br>
under, the most  recent one being Artificial Life, which was a really
<br>
interesting company.  (Autonomy and Verity are still doing OK -- the  market
<br>
is consolidating.)
<br>
<p>On the technology side, we created an amazingly detailed AI design and
<br>
implemented various modules of it and tested them,  invariably showing that
<br>
their performance exceeded that of anything else out there.  But we did
<br>
make one bad mistake: we  implemented our system using a Java-based agent
<br>
system framework that never delivered adequate computational performance.
<br>
Java simply did not improve in its large-scale performance as rapidly as we
<br>
thought it would.
<br>
<p>Now we have a very solid business model, with a clear path to profitability,
<br>
and we are reimplementing our AI design in C  using a much more efficient
<br>
software architecture.  The reimplementation is going fast: after a 2 month
<br>
effort by 3 people,  it's about 1/3 done.
<br>
<p>On a personal level, I must take substantial responsibility for Webmind
<br>
Inc.'s technical failures; but as for the business  problems, I consider my
<br>
responsibility to be limited, though greater than zero.  I never had a
<br>
formal day-to-day role in  Webmind Inc.'s business matters, and my counsel
<br>
on business matters was certainly not heeded all that frequently.
<br>
<p>I and my team are older and wiser now.  We know what we're doing to a vastly
<br>
greater extent than we did when Webmind inc. was  founded (as Intelligesis)
<br>
in 1997).  And we are more dedicated than ever to put in years of hard work
<br>
to achieve our  long-term goals.
<br>
<p>It's a cliche' quote but awfully appropriate: &quot;That which doesn't kill me,
<br>
makes me stronger.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>***********
<br>
<p>Q:  How does this new company relate to Webmind Inc. legally?
<br>
<p>A:
<br>
Cognitive Bioscience a new corporate entity.
<br>
<p>Webmind Inc. is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  A prepackaged
<br>
bankruptcy deal is being prepared, according to  which a certain large firm,
<br>
together with our former CEO Andy Siciliano, will bid to purchase the
<br>
intellectual property (IP)  of the company.  It is unlikely there will be
<br>
any other bidders.
<br>
<p>We have agreed to give the owners of the Webmind Inc. IP a certain
<br>
percentage of Cognitive Bioscience, in exchange for  permission to freely
<br>
use Webmind Inc. designs and code (at present, due to our rearchitecting of
<br>
the system, we have more use  for the designs than for most of the code).
<br>
The exact percentage is the subject of current, friendly negotiations, which
<br>
cannot be completed until the Webmind Inc. bankruptcy is completed.
<br>
<p>It would be nice to wait until all this were done before raising seed money,
<br>
but, this doesn't seem like a plausible course  because, basically, all of
<br>
us who are now working for free need to eat.
