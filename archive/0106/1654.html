<br>
<p>Easter's End
<br>
by Jared Diamond
<br>
Published in Discover Magazine on 08/01/95
<br>
<p>In just a few centuries, the people of Easter Island wiped out their
<br>
forest, drove their plants and animals to extinction, and saw their
<br>
complex society spiral into chaos and cannibalism. Are we about to follow
<br>
their lead?
<br>
<p>Among the most riveting mysteries of human history are those posed by
<br>
vanished civilizations. Everyone who has seen the abandoned buildings of
<br>
the Khmer, the Maya, or the Anasazi is immediately moved to ask the same
<br>
question: Why did the societies that erected those structures disappear?
<br>
<p>Their vanishing touches us as the disappearance of other animals, even the
<br>
dinosaurs, never can. No matter how exotic those lost civilizations seem,
<br>
their framers were humans like us. Who is to say we won+IBk-t succumb to
<br>
the same fate? Perhaps someday New York+IBk-s skyscrapers will stand
<br>
derelict and overgrown with vegetation, like the temples at Angkor Wat and
<br>
Tikal.
<br>
<p>Among all such vanished civilizations, that of the former Polynesian
<br>
society on Easter Island remains unsurpassed in mystery and isolation. The
<br>
mystery stems especially from the island+IBk-s gigantic stone statues and
<br>
its impoverished landscape, but it is enhanced by our associations with
<br>
the specific people involved: Polynesians represent for us the ultimate in
<br>
exotic romance, the background for many a child+IBk-s, and an adult+IBk-s,
<br>
vision of paradise. My own interest in Easter was kindled over 30 years
<br>
ago when I read Thor Heyerdahl+IBk-s fabulous accounts of his Kon-Tiki
<br>
voyage.
<br>
<p>But my interest has been revived recently by a much more exciting account,
<br>
one not of heroic voyages but of painstaking research and analysis. My
<br>
friend David Steadman, a paleontologist, has been working with a number of
<br>
other researchers who are carrying out the first systematic excavations on
<br>
Easter intended to identify the animals and plants that once lived there.
<br>
Their work is contributing to a new interpretation of the island+IBk-s
<br>
history that makes it a tale not only of wonder but of warning as well.
<br>
<p>Easter Island, with an area of only 64 square miles, is the world+IBk-s
<br>
most isolated scrap of habitable land. It lies in the Pacific Ocean more
<br>
than 2,000 miles west of the nearest continent (South America), 1,400
<br>
miles from even the nearest habitable island (Pitcairn). Its subtropical
<br>
location and latitude--at 27 degrees south, it is approximately as far
<br>
below the equator as Houston is north of it--help give it a rather mild
<br>
climate, while its volcanic origins make its soil fertile. In theory, this
<br>
combination of blessings should have made Easter a miniature paradise,
<br>
remote from problems that beset the rest of the world.
<br>
<p>The island derives its name from its +IBw-discovery+IB0- by the Dutch
<br>
explorer Jacob Roggeveen, on Easter (April 5) in 1722. Roggeveen+IBk-s
<br>
first impression was not of a paradise but of a wasteland: +IBw-We
<br>
originally, from a further distance, have considered the said Easter
<br>
Island as sandy+ADs- the reason for that is this, that we counted as sand
<br>
the withered grass, hay, or other scorched and burnt vegetation, because
<br>
its wasted appearance could give no other impression than of a singular
<br>
poverty and barrenness.+IB0-
<br>
<p>The island Roggeveen saw was a grassland without a single tree or bush
<br>
over ten feet high. Modern botanists have identified only 47 species of
<br>
higher plants native to Easter, most of them grasses, sedges, and ferns.
<br>
The list includes just two species of small trees and two of woody shrubs.
<br>
With such flora, the islanders Roggeveen encountered had no source of real
<br>
firewood to warm themselves during Easter+IBk-s cool, wet, windy winters.
<br>
Their native animals included nothing larger than insects, not even a
<br>
single species of native bat, land bird, land snail, or lizard. For
<br>
domestic animals, they had only chickens.
<br>
<p>European visitors throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
<br>
estimated Easter+IBk-s human population at about 2,000, a modest number
<br>
considering the island+IBk-s fertility. As Captain James Cook recognized
<br>
during his brief visit in 1774, the islanders were Polynesians (a Tahitian
<br>
man accompanying Cook was able to converse with them). Yet despite the
<br>
Polynesians+IBk- well-deserved fame as a great seafaring people, the
<br>
Easter Islanders who came out to Roggeveen+IBk-s and Cook+IBk-s ships did
<br>
so by swimming or paddling canoes that Roggeveen described as +IBw-bad and
<br>
frail.+IB0- Their craft, he wrote, were +IBw-put together with manifold
<br>
small planks and light inner timbers, which they cleverly stitched
<br>
together with very fine twisted threads. . . . But as they lack the
<br>
knowledge and particularly the materials for caulking and making tight the
<br>
great number of seams of the canoes, these are accordingly very leaky, for
<br>
which reason they are compelled to spend half the time in bailing.+IB0-
<br>
The canoes, only ten feet long, held at most two people, and only three or
<br>
four canoes were observed on the entire island.
<br>
<p>With such flimsy craft, Polynesians could never have colonized Easter from
<br>
even the nearest island, nor could they have traveled far offshore to
<br>
fish.  The islanders Roggeveen met were totally isolated, unaware that
<br>
other people existed. Investigators in all the years since his visit have
<br>
discovered no trace of the islanders+IBk- having any outside contacts: not
<br>
a single Easter Island rock or product has turned up elsewhere, nor has
<br>
anything been found on the island that could have been brought by anyone
<br>
other than the original settlers or the Europeans. Yet the people living
<br>
on Easter claimed memories of visiting the uninhabited Sala y Gomez reef
<br>
260 miles away, far beyond the range of the leaky canoes seen by
<br>
Roggeveen.  How did the islanders+IBk- ancestors reach that reef from
<br>
Easter, or reach Easter from anywhere else?
<br>
<p>Easter Island+IBk-s most famous feature is its huge stone statues, more
<br>
than 200 of which once stood on massive stone platforms lining the coast.
<br>
At least 700 more, in all stages of completion, were abandoned in quarries
<br>
or on ancient roads between the quarries and the coast, as if the carvers
<br>
and moving crews had thrown down their tools and walked off the job. Most
<br>
of the erected statues were carved in a single quarry and then somehow
<br>
transported as far as six miles--despite heights as great as 33 feet and
<br>
weights up to 82 tons. The abandoned statues, meanwhile, were as much as
<br>
65 feet tall and weighed up to 270 tons. The stone platforms were equally
<br>
gigantic: up to 500 feet long and 10 feet high, with facing slabs weighing
<br>
up to 10 tons.
<br>
<p>Roggeveen himself quickly recognized the problem the statues posed:
<br>
+IBw-The stone images at first caused us to be struck with
<br>
astonishment,+IB0- he wrote, +IBw-because we could not comprehend how it
<br>
was possible that these people, who are devoid of heavy thic timber for
<br>
making any machines, as well as strong ropes, nevertheless had been able
<br>
to erect such images.+IB0- Roggeveen might have added that the islanders
<br>
had no wheels, no draft animals, and no source of power except their own
<br>
muscles. How did they transport the giant statues for miles, even before
<br>
erecting them? To deepen the mystery, the statues were still standing in
<br>
1770, but by 1864 all of them had been pulled down, by the islanders
<br>
themselves. Why then did they carve them in the first place? And why did
<br>
they stop?
<br>
<p>The statues imply a society very different from the one Roggeveen saw in
<br>
1722. Their sheer number and size suggest a population much larger than
<br>
2,000 people. What became of everyone? Furthermore, that society must have
<br>
been highly organized. Easter+IBk-s resources were scattered across the
<br>
island: the best stone for the statues was quarried at Rano Raraku near
<br>
Easter+IBk-s northeast end+ADs- red stone, used for large crowns adorning
<br>
some of the statues, was quarried at Puna Pau, inland in the
<br>
southwest+ADs- stone carving tools came mostly from Aroi in the northwest.
<br>
Meanwhile, the best farmland lay in the south and east, and the best
<br>
fishing grounds on the north and west coasts. Extracting and
<br>
redistributing all those goods required complex political organization.
<br>
What happened to that organization, and how could it ever have arisen in
<br>
such a barren landscape?
<br>
<p>Easter Island+IBk-s mysteries have spawned volumes of speculation for more
<br>
than two and a half centuries. Many Europeans were incredulous that
<br>
Polynesians--commonly characterized as +IBw-mere savages+IB0---could have
<br>
created the statues or the beautifully constructed stone platforms. In the
<br>
1950s, Heyerdahl argued that Polynesia must have been settled by advanced
<br>
societies of American Indians, who in turn must have received civilization
<br>
across the Atlantic from more advanced societies of the Old World.
<br>
Heyerdahl+IBk-s raft voyages aimed to prove the feasibility of such
<br>
prehistoric transoceanic contacts. In the 1960s the Swiss writer Erich von
<br>
D+AOQ-niken, an ardent believer in Earth visits by extraterrestrial
<br>
astronauts, went further, claiming that Easter+IBk-s statues were the work
<br>
of intelligent beings who owned ultramodern tools, became stranded on
<br>
Easter, and were finally rescued.
<br>
<p>Heyerdahl and Von D+AOQ-niken both brushed aside overwhelming evidence
<br>
that the Easter Islanders were typical Polynesians derived from Asia
<br>
rather than from the Americas and that their culture (including their
<br>
statues) grew out of Polynesian culture. Their language was Polynesian, as
<br>
Cook had already concluded. Specifically, they spoke an eastern Polynesian
<br>
dialect related to Hawaiian and Marquesan, a dialect isolated since about
<br>
A.D. 400, as estimated from slight differences in vocabulary. Their
<br>
fishhooks and stone adzes resembled early Marquesan models. Last year DNA
<br>
extracted from 12 Easter Island skeletons was also shown to be Polynesian.
<br>
The islanders grew bananas, taro, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and paper
<br>
mulberry--typical Polynesian crops, mostly of Southeast Asian origin.
<br>
Their sole domestic animal, the chicken, was also typically Polynesian and
<br>
ultimately Asian, as were the rats that arrived as stowaways in the canoes
<br>
of the first settlers.
<br>
<p>What happened to those settlers? The fanciful theories of the past must
<br>
give way to evidence gathered by hardworking practitioners in three
<br>
fields: archeology, pollen analysis, and paleontology.
<br>
<p>Modern archeological excavations on Easter have continued since
<br>
Heyerdahl+IBk-s 1955 expedition. The earliest radiocarbon dates associated
<br>
with human activities are around A.D. 400 to 700, in reasonable agreement
<br>
with the approximate settlement date of 400 estimated by linguists. The
<br>
period of statue construction peaked around 1200 to 1500, with few if any
<br>
statues erected thereafter. Densities of archeological sites suggest a
<br>
large population+ADs- an estimate of 7,000 people is widely quoted by
<br>
archeologists, but other estimates range up to 20,000, which does not seem
<br>
implausible for an island of Easter+IBk-s area and fertility.
<br>
<p>Archeologists have also enlisted surviving islanders in experiments aimed
<br>
at figuring out how the statues might have been carved and erected. Twenty
<br>
people, using only stone chisels, could have carved even the largest
<br>
completed statue within a year. Given enough timber and fiber for making
<br>
ropes, teams of at most a few hundred people could have loaded the statues
<br>
onto wooden sleds, dragged them over lubricated wooden tracks or rollers,
<br>
and used logs as levers to maneuver them into a standing position. Rope
<br>
could have been made from the fiber of a small native tree, related to the
<br>
linden, called the hauhau. However, that tree is now extremely scarce on
<br>
Easter, and hauling one statue would have required hundreds of yards of
<br>
rope. Did Easter+IBk-s now barren landscape once support the necessary
<br>
trees?
<br>
<p>That question can be answered by the technique of pollen analysis, which
<br>
involves boring out a column of sediment from a swamp or pond, with the
<br>
most recent deposits at the top and relatively more ancient deposits at
<br>
the bottom. The absolute age of each layer can be dated by radiocarbon
<br>
methods.  Then begins the hard work: examining tens of thousands of pollen
<br>
grains under a microscope, counting them, and identifying the plant
<br>
species that produced each one by comparing the grains with modern pollen
<br>
from known plant species. For Easter Island, the bleary-eyed scientists
<br>
who performed that task were John Flenley, now at Massey University in New
<br>
Zealand, and Sarah King of the University of Hull in England.
<br>
<p>Flenley and King+IBk-s heroic efforts were rewarded by the striking new
<br>
picture that emerged of Easter+IBk-s prehistoric landscape. For at least
<br>
30,000 years before human arrival and during the early years of Polynesian
<br>
settlement, Easter was not a wasteland at all. Instead, a subtropical
<br>
forest of trees and woody bushes towered over a ground layer of shrubs,
<br>
herbs, ferns, and grasses. In the forest grew tree daisies, the rope-
<br>
yielding hauhau tree, and the toromiro tree, which furnishes a dense,
<br>
mesquite-like firewood.  The most common tree in the forest was a species
<br>
of palm now absent on Easter but formerly so abundant that the bottom
<br>
strata of the sediment column were packed with its pollen. The Easter
<br>
Island palm was closely related to the still-surviving Chilean wine palm,
<br>
which grows up to 82 feet tall and 6 feet in diameter. The tall,
<br>
unbranched trunks of the Easter Island palm would have been ideal for
<br>
transporting and erecting statues and constructing large canoes. The palm
<br>
would also have been a valuable food source, since its Chilean relative
<br>
yields edible nuts as well as sap from which Chileans make sugar, syrup,
<br>
honey, and wine.
<br>
<p>What did the first settlers of Easter Island eat when they were not
<br>
glutting themselves on the local equivalent of maple syrup? Recent
<br>
excavations by David Steadman, of the New York State Museum at Albany,
<br>
have yielded a picture of Easter+IBk-s original animal world as surprising
<br>
as Flenley and King+IBk-s picture of its plant world. Steadman+IBk-s
<br>
expectations for Easter were conditioned by his experiences elsewhere in
<br>
Polynesia, where fish are overwhelmingly the main food at archeological
<br>
sites, typically accounting for more than 90 percent of the bones in
<br>
ancient Polynesian garbage heaps. Easter, though, is too cool for the
<br>
coral reefs beloved by fish, and its cliff-girded coastline permits
<br>
shallow-water fishing in only a few places. Less than a quarter of the
<br>
bones in its early garbage heaps (from the period 900 to 1300) belonged to
<br>
fish+ADs- instead, nearly one-third of all bones came from porpoises.
<br>
<p>Nowhere else in Polynesia do porpoises account for even 1 percent of
<br>
discarded food bones. But most other Polynesian islands offered animal
<br>
food in the form of birds and mammals, such as New Zealand+IBk-s now
<br>
extinct giant moas and Hawaii+IBk-s now extinct flightless geese. Most
<br>
other islanders also had domestic pigs and dogs. On Easter, porpoises
<br>
would have been the largest animal available--other than humans. The
<br>
porpoise species identified at Easter, the common dolphin, weighs up to
<br>
165 pounds. It generally lives out at sea, so it could not have been
<br>
hunted by line fishing or spearfishing from shore. Instead, it must have
<br>
been harpooned far offshore, in big seaworthy canoes built from the
<br>
extinct palm tree.
<br>
<p>In addition to porpoise meat, Steadman found, the early Polynesian
<br>
settlers were feasting on seabirds. For those birds, Easter+IBk-s
<br>
remoteness and lack of predators made it an ideal haven as a breeding
<br>
site, at least until humans arrived. Among the prodigious numbers of
<br>
seabirds that bred on Easter were albatross, boobies, frigate birds,
<br>
fulmars, petrels, prions, shearwaters, storm petrels, terns, and tropic
<br>
birds. With at least 25 nesting species, Easter was the richest seabird
<br>
breeding site in Polynesia and probably in the whole Pacific.
<br>
<p>Land birds as well went into early Easter Island cooking pots. Steadman
<br>
identified bones of at least six species, including barn owls, herons,
<br>
parrots, and rail. Bird stew would have been seasoned with meat from large
<br>
numbers of rats, which the Polynesian colonists inadvertently brought with
<br>
them+ADs- Easter Island is the sole known Polynesian island where rat
<br>
bones outnumber fish bones at archeological sites. (In case you+IBk-re
<br>
squeamish and consider rats inedible, I still recall recipes for creamed
<br>
laboratory rat that my British biologist friends used to supplement their
<br>
diet during their years of wartime food rationing.)
<br>
<p>Porpoises, seabirds, land birds, and rats did not complete the list of
<br>
meat sources formerly available on Easter. A few bones hint at the
<br>
possibility of breeding seal colonies as well. All these delicacies were
<br>
cooked in ovens fired by wood from the island+IBk-s forests.
<br>
<p>Such evidence lets us imagine the island onto which Easter+IBk-s first
<br>
Polynesian colonists stepped ashore some 1,600 years ago, after a long
<br>
canoe voyage from eastern Polynesia. They found themselves in a pristine
<br>
paradise. What then happened to it? The pollen grains and the bones yield
<br>
a grim answer.
<br>
<p>Pollen records show that destruction of Easter+IBk-s forests was well
<br>
under way by the year 800, just a few centuries after the start of human
<br>
settlement.  Then charcoal from wood fires came to fill the sediment
<br>
cores, while pollen of palms and other trees and woody shrubs decreased or
<br>
disappeared, and pollen of the grasses that replaced the forest became
<br>
more abundant. Not long after 1400 the palm finally became extinct, not
<br>
only as a result of being chopped down but also because the now ubiquitous
<br>
rats prevented its regeneration: of the dozens of preserved palm nuts
<br>
discovered in caves on Easter, all had been chewed by rats and could no
<br>
longer germinate. While the hauhau tree did not become extinct in
<br>
Polynesian times, its numbers declined drastically until there weren+IBk-t
<br>
enough left to make ropes from. By the time Heyerdahl visited Easter, only
<br>
a single, nearly dead toromiro tree remained on the island, and even that
<br>
lone survivor has now disappeared.  (Fortunately, the toromiro still grows
<br>
in botanical gardens elsewhere.)
<br>
<p>The fifteenth century marked the end not only for Easter+IBk-s palm but
<br>
for the forest itself. Its doom had been approaching as people cleared
<br>
land to plant gardens+ADs- as they felled trees to build canoes, to
<br>
transport and erect statues, and to burn+ADs- as rats devoured seeds+ADs-
<br>
and probably as the native birds died out that had pollinated the
<br>
trees+IBk- flowers and dispersed their fruit. The overall picture is among
<br>
the most extreme examples of forest destruction anywhere in the world: the
<br>
whole forest gone, and most of its tree species extinct.
<br>
<p>The destruction of the island+IBk-s animals was as extreme as that of the
<br>
forest: without exception, every species of native land bird became
<br>
extinct. Even shellfish were overexploited, until people had to settle for
<br>
small sea snails instead of larger cowries. Porpoise bones disappeared
<br>
abruptly from garbage heaps around 1500+ADs- no one could harpoon
<br>
porpoises anymore, since the trees used for constructing the big seagoing
<br>
canoes no longer existed. The colonies of more than half of the seabird
<br>
species breeding on Easter or on its offshore islets were wiped out.
<br>
<p>In place of these meat supplies, the Easter Islanders intensified their
<br>
production of chickens, which had been only an occasional food item. They
<br>
also turned to the largest remaining meat source available: humans, whose
<br>
bones became common in late Easter Island garbage heaps. Oral traditions
<br>
of the islanders are rife with cannibalism+ADs- the most inflammatory
<br>
taunt that could be snarled at an enemy was +IBw-The flesh of your mother
<br>
sticks between my teeth.+IB0- With no wood available to cook these new
<br>
goodies, the islanders resorted to sugarcane scraps, grass, and sedges to
<br>
fuel their fires.
<br>
<p>All these strands of evidence can be wound into a coherent narrative of a
<br>
society+IBk-s decline and fall. The first Polynesian colonists found
<br>
themselves on an island with fertile soil, abundant food, bountiful
<br>
building materials, ample lebensraum, and all the prerequisites for
<br>
comfortable living. They prospered and multiplied.
<br>
<p>After a few centuries, they began erecting stone statues on platforms,
<br>
like the ones their Polynesian forebears had carved. With passing years,
<br>
the statues and platforms became larger and larger, and the statues began
<br>
sporting ten-ton red crowns--probably in an escalating spiral of
<br>
one-upmanship, as rival clans tried to surpass each other with shows of
<br>
wealth and power. (In the same way, successive Egyptian pharaohs built
<br>
ever-larger pyramids. Today Hollywood movie moguls near my home in Los
<br>
Angeles are displaying their wealth and power by building ever more
<br>
ostentatious mansions. Tycoon Marvin Davis topped previous moguls with
<br>
plans for a 50,000-square-foot house, so now Aaron Spelling has topped
<br>
Davis with a 56,000-square-foot house. All that those buildings lack to
<br>
make the message explicit are ten-ton red crowns.) On Easter, as in modern
<br>
America, society was held together by a complex political system to
<br>
redistribute locally available resources and to integrate the economies of
<br>
different areas.
<br>
<p>Eventually Easter+IBk-s growing population was cutting the forest more
<br>
rapidly than the forest was regenerating. The people used the land for
<br>
gardens and the wood for fuel, canoes, and houses--and, of course, for
<br>
lugging statues.  As forest disappeared, the islanders ran out of timber
<br>
and rope to transport and erect their statues. Life became more
<br>
uncomfortable--springs and streams dried up, and wood was no longer
<br>
available for fires.
<br>
<p>People also found it harder to fill their stomachs, as land birds, large
<br>
sea snails, and many seabirds disappeared. Because timber for building
<br>
seagoing canoes vanished, fish catches declined and porpoises disappeared
<br>
from the table. Crop yields also declined, since deforestation allowed the
<br>
soil to be eroded by rain and wind, dried by the sun, and its nutrients to
<br>
be leeched from it. Intensified chicken production and cannibalism
<br>
replaced only part of all those lost foods. Preserved statuettes with
<br>
sunken cheeks and visible ribs suggest that people were starving.
<br>
<p>With the disappearance of food surpluses, Easter Island could no longer
<br>
feed the chiefs, bureaucrats, and priests who had kept a complex society
<br>
running. Surviving islanders described to early European visitors how
<br>
local chaos replaced centralized government and a warrior class took over
<br>
from the hereditary chiefs. The stone points of spears and daggers, made
<br>
by the warriors during their heyday in the 1600s and 1700s, still litter
<br>
the ground of Easter today. By around 1700, the population began to crash
<br>
toward between one-quarter and one-tenth of its former number. People took
<br>
to living in caves for protection against their enemies. Around 1770 rival
<br>
clans started to topple each other+IBk-s statues, breaking the heads off.
<br>
By 1864 the last statue had been thrown down and desecrated.
<br>
<p>As we try to imagine the decline of Easter+IBk-s civilization, we ask
<br>
ourselves, +IBw-Why didn+IBk-t they look around, realize what they were
<br>
doing, and stop before it was too late? What were they thinking when they
<br>
cut down the last palm tree?+IB0-
<br>
<p>I suspect, though, that the disaster happened not with a bang but with a
<br>
whimper. After all, there are those hundreds of abandoned statues to
<br>
consider. The forest the islanders depended on for rollers and rope
<br>
didn+IBk-t simply disappear one day--it vanished slowly, over decades.
<br>
Perhaps war interrupted the moving teams+ADs- perhaps by the time the
<br>
carvers had finished their work, the last rope snapped. In the meantime,
<br>
any islander who tried to warn about the dangers of progressive
<br>
deforestation would have been overridden by vested interests of carvers,
<br>
bureaucrats, and chiefs, whose jobs depended on continued deforestation.
<br>
Our Pacific Northwest loggers are only the latest in a long line of
<br>
loggers to cry, +IBw-Jobs over trees+ACEgHQ- The changes in forest cover
<br>
from year to year would have been hard to detect: yes, this year we
<br>
cleared those woods over there, but trees are starting to grow back again
<br>
on this abandoned garden site here. Only older people, recollecting their
<br>
childhoods decades earlier, could have recognized a difference. Their
<br>
children could no more have comprehended their parents+IBk- tales than my
<br>
eight-year-old sons today can comprehend my wife+IBk-s and my tales of
<br>
what Los Angeles was like 30 years ago.
<br>
<p>Gradually trees became fewer, smaller, and less important. By the time the
<br>
last fruit-bearing adult palm tree was cut, palms had long since ceased to
<br>
be of economic significance. That left only smaller and smaller palm
<br>
saplings to clear each year, along with other bushes and treelets. No one
<br>
would have noticed the felling of the last small palm.
<br>
<p>By now the meaning of easter Island for us should be chillingly obvious.
<br>
Easter Island is Earth writ small. Today, again, a rising population
<br>
confronts shrinking resources. We too have no emigration valve, because
<br>
all human societies are linked by international transport, and we can no
<br>
more escape into space than the Easter Islanders could flee into the
<br>
ocean. If we continue to follow our present course, we shall have
<br>
exhausted the world+IBk-s major fisheries, tropical rain forests, fossil
<br>
fuels, and much of our soil by the time my sons reach my current age.
<br>
<p>Every day newspapers report details of famished countries-- Afghanistan,
<br>
Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, the former Yugoslavia,
<br>
Zaire--where soldiers have appropriated the wealth or where central
<br>
government is yielding to local gangs of thugs. With the risk of nuclear
<br>
war receding, the threat of our ending with a bang no longer has a chance
<br>
of galvanizing us to halt our course. Our risk now is of winding down,
<br>
slowly, in a whimper. Corrective action is blocked by vested interests, by
<br>
well-intentioned political and business leaders, and by their electorates,
<br>
all of whom are perfectly correct in not noticing big changes from year to
<br>
year. Instead, each year there are just somewhat more people, and somewhat
<br>
fewer resources, on Earth.
<br>
<p>It would be easy to close our eyes or to give up in despair. If mere
<br>
thousands of Easter Islanders with only stone tools and their own muscle
<br>
power sufficed to destroy their society, how can billions of people with
<br>
metal tools and machine power fail to do worse? But there is one crucial
<br>
difference. The Easter Islanders had no books and no histories of other
<br>
doomed societies. Unlike the Easter Islanders, we have histories of the
<br>
past--information that can save us. My main hope for my sons+IBk-
<br>
generation is that we may now choose to learn from the fates of societies
<br>
like Easter+IBk-s.
