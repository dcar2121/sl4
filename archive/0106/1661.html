<p>
The idea that the world is using up it's resources
<br>
and as a consequence civilization will fall is wrong
<br>
on two critical points.
<br>
<p>The first is that the resources of the planet don't
<br>
get 'used up'.  Atoms last forever (on human time
<br>
scales at least).  The carbon atoms that used to
<br>
be in the Amazon rain forest got turned into CO2,
<br>
which then get incorporated into American forest
<br>
biomass.  Contrary to common wisdom, the total
<br>
biomass in the US's forests is _increasing_, mostly
<br>
due to less farming in the eastern US after
<br>
1900.
<br>
<p>I tend to view landfills as future resource
<br>
stockpiles, awaiting an efficient way to separate
<br>
the components.
<br>
<p>The second error is considering the Earth as a 
<br>
closed system.  It's almost closed in matter
<br>
terms, but damn near wide open in energy terms.
<br>
Turn off the Sun and the atmosphere loses temperature
<br>
with a time constant of about 10 days (30 degrees
<br>
K/day
<br>
versus a starting temperature of 300 K).
<br>
<p>The annual solar flux on a relatively sunny location
<br>
is 7.2GJ/m^2.  Assume that you need no more than the
<br>
most energetic chemical reaction to transform your
<br>
raw materials.  Splitting water into O2 and H2 takes
<br>
15 MJ/kg.  This is about the most energetic reaction,
<br>
which is why it is used as rocket fuel going the other
<br>
way.  Therefore you can convert 480 kg/m^2/yr into
<br>
whatever.  A square kilometer can convert 480,000
<br>
tonsper year.  The total mass throughput in the US
<br>
is around 20 billion tons (as an aside, the largest
<br>
single mass flow item is crushed stone for concrete.
<br>
Who says we ever left the stone age :-) ).  So
<br>
40,000 square km of sunny land can support the
<br>
entire US civilization's mass flow.  That's around
<br>
0.5% of the land area.  And a lot of the mass
<br>
flow doesn't need anywhere near as much energy/kg
<br>
as we assumed.
<br>
<p>We don't synthesize plastic from scratch because
<br>
crude oil has components that are already close
<br>
in chemical structure to what we want.  We don't
<br>
pull aluminum and iron from random rocks because
<br>
it's cheaper to do so from decent ores.  But if
<br>
we had to, we could, and it wouldn't take an
<br>
impossible amount of land to power it purely from
<br>
solar sources, much less possible fission and
<br>
fusion sources, and the possibility of power
<br>
stations in space powering industry out there or
<br>
sending power down to the ground.
