<p>
After rereading part of General Intelligence and Seed AI
<br>
I thought better of my comments and would like to amend
<br>
them thusly.....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like I was being obtuse.
<br>
&quot;1.1: Seed AI
<br>
It is probably impossible to write an AI in immediate possession
<br>
&nbsp;of human-equivalent abilities in every field; transhuman abilities
<br>
&nbsp;even more so, since there's no working model.  The task is not
<br>
&nbsp;to build an AI with some astronomical level of intelligence; the 
<br>
task is building an AI which is capable of improving itself, of 
<br>
understanding and rewriting its own source code.  The task is
<br>
&nbsp;not to build a mighty oak tree, but a humble seed. 
<br>
<p>As the AI rewrites itself, it moves along a trajectory of intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The task is not to build an AI at some specific point on the 
<br>
trajectory, but to ensure that the trajectory is open-ended, 
<br>
reaching human equivalence and transcending it.  Smarter 
<br>
and smarter AIs become better and better at rewriting their
<br>
&nbsp;own code and making themselves even smarter.  When 
<br>
writing a seed AI, it's not just what the AI can do now, but 
<br>
what it will be able to do later.  And the problem isn't just 
<br>
writing good code, it's writing code that the seed AI can 
<br>
understand, since the eventual goal is for it to rewrite its 
<br>
own assembly language.  (1). &quot;
<br>
<p>It's not a valid assumption to assume that a seed AI wouldn't
<br>
take advantage of all data known about human sentience
<br>
(i.e. approximations, however inaccurate, of a &quot;working model&quot;)
<br>
to rewrite it's own code.  On the contrary I can't think of any
<br>
reason not to use the Human Brain Project (sic) or anything
<br>
else we know about the &quot;prototype&quot; as part of the the 
<br>
evolutionary process.  I guess I fell into that old &quot;us vs. it&quot;
<br>
thought trap. But &quot;it&quot; would be &quot;us&quot; if it worked. Just the
<br>
larger set subsuming the smaller.  
<br>
<p><p>hmmm,
<br>
Brian
