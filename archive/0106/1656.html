Right, right...  Obviously.
<br>
<p>Ignore technology for a moment.  How is it that civilisations last and
<br>
flourish for thousands and thousands of years and then disappear in an
<br>
instant?  True, shit happens.  Asteroids, and earthquakes, and floods, and
<br>
what-have-you...  But actually that's never really been much of a
<br>
problem.  Rome didn't go down in a flood, Egypt wasn't hit by an asteroid,
<br>
and the Aztecs didn't all die in a huge earthquake.  In virtually all
<br>
cases of civilizations' downfall, the driving forces were largely social
<br>
and very much unpredictable.  Of course you can always discount this as an
<br>
artifact of the cultural evolutionary processes on our planet, but that
<br>
doesn't explain anything.  Might there be a maximum sustainable degree of
<br>
complexity intrinsic to any social structure, beyond which a society can't
<br>
help but disintegrate?
<br>
<p>Okay, I feel very much off-topic now, so I'll stop.
