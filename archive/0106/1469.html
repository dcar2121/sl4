maybe that isn't really relevant to this discussion.

<p>Sounds like Freud's concept of the &quot;superego&quot; (i.e. the moral component
<br>
of his theory of mind) but more in a collective sense?  Are you sure
<br>
that you want this vicarious selector to be implemented in an external
<br>
regulating super-system or would you want it internalized in all the
<br>
agents as an internal component.  It would be cheaper and probably more
<br>
robust to internalize it... but then how would it differ from the
<br>
already existing moral center of our brains (i.e. parts of the
<br>
prefrontal cortex)?  Maybe your Sysop idea is just an augmentation of
<br>
our existing moral system...
<br>
<p>What is a vicarious selector you ask?  Another concept from cybernetics
<br>
/ system theory...

<br>
<p>Now, on what you've written.  This is not really what the Sysop is. 
<br>
I think that Sysop may not be the best way to think of it.  To make a 
<br>
Unix analogy (because that's what I know best :-)), the Sysop is not 
<br>
root, but more like the permission system, only much more complex. 
<br>
It can advise aginst you accessing a file, even though you have 
<br>
access to it, but in the end it can't stop you, even if it is not in 
<br>
your interest to do as such, because it is your volition that is most 
<br>
important and the Sysop may not violate it and must respect it so 
<br>
long as it doesn't violate anyone else's volition.
<br>
<p>On a side note, I think the Sysop scenario page needs some work. 
<br>
Maybe it's already been improved some in internal versions that 
<br>
Eliezer may be working on, gearing up for 1.0, but I think that it's 
<br>
vague and there is a lot more to it than is mentioned on that page. 
<br>
Having read numerous posts about the Sysop, I now know what it is and 
<br>
isn't, but I think if I just read the page, I wouldn't like it. 
<br>
Actually, I'm still skeptical of the ability to impliment the Sysop 
<br>
Scenario, but if we have a Transition Guide, it is more likely but 
<br>
once we run into other civilizations we may find out that 
<br>
Friendliness is the exception to a norm of dystopian Singularities.
