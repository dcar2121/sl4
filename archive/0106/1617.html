<em>&gt; From: &quot;John Stick&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:johnstick@worldnet.att.net?Subject=RE:%20Unambiguous%20Language%20WAS:%20MEME:%20A.I.:%20Artificial%20Intelligence">johnstick@worldnet.att.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Ambiguity is more central to the general use of natural languages than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone has noted yet in this thread.  It is a valuable design feature, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defect to be minimized at all costs.  Moreover, this use of  ambiguity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reason why language use in open conversation requires general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (or abductive reasoning, or a solution to the frame problem)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so is central to the task of building general AI.
</em><br>
<p>I completely agree with you. In my post I was merely trying to answer the
<br>
Patrick's challenge of &quot;Can an unambiguous language be created.&quot; I can now
<br>
sum up my answer as:
<br>
<p>Yes (I think so). If ambiguity is uncertainty due to choosing between 
<br>
multiple interpretations, then ambiguity can be eliminated by the author
<br>
choosing which interpretation is intended ahead of time (although 
<br>
exhaustively stating all implications / assumptions will be resource 
<br>
intensive and is computationally unattainable today). 
<br>
<p>Just because I currently think it's *possible*, I, in now way, advocate 
<br>
that it would be desirable to speak unambiguously all the time even if 
<br>
we could.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Beyond imprecision in meaning of words and sentences, ambiguity arises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because much of the meaning of a communication emerges from the interplay of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words and context.  This is built into natural language use at many levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the most simple are classes of words such as indexicals ( &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;here&quot;, &quot;now&quot;) and pronouns ( can't tell who is &quot;me&quot; without context).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Figurative speech, irony, sarcasm, humor, all rely on context (and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilty of multiple meanings that disambiguating would dissolve).  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all words, while denotations might be disambiguated by Durant Schoon's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Herculean Dictionary proposal, connotations will still vary relative to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences of speaker and listener.  All social situations make available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech acts or language games where meaning is altered or supplemented:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promising, flirting, calling out.
</em><br>
<p>Yes! Reason #1 for ambiguity: Flirting!
<br>
<p>[ ... many excellent examples snipped ... ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     You could limit ambiguity by limiting use of figurative speech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references that are not fully specified.  You could disclaim any intent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate connotations.  But except in very specialized circumstances, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you want to?  The same features that yield ambiguity allow much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to be expressed in limited  space, and allow many subltle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects and meanings that cannot be communicated more simply (as in poetry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not just poetry).
</em><br>
<p>Yes. To vindicate myself, I did try to mention that jokes would not be as
<br>
funny. Poetry is another excellent example. And I know this is not friendly
<br>
(lowercase f), but insults should be added to our list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Even in scientific discourse, figurative language can be very powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in suggesting new lines of thought, as with the meme meme, and the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of evolutionary  ideas throughout the social sciences.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, thank you for your eloquent points!
