</em><br>
<p>That's the one I was thinking of - switch CPUs on and off, modulate the
<br>
amount of power consumed, produce a pattern that would in theory be
<br>
detectable by the power company, and hope that the anomaly is detected by
<br>
whatever routine infrahuman AI is being run by power companies in, say,
<br>
five years.  A good way to grab attention would be to mimic a pattern
<br>
which (the SI deduces) will often be exhibited by power lines that are on
<br>
the edge of failure... once focus of attention has been gained, the SI can
<br>
either hack into the AI or further grab the attention of a human.
<br>
<p>Well, James Higgins can at least try to jail Eliezer, at any rate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are only 2 ways that I imagine that SI could ever perform &quot;magic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given these limited resources.  First, if it is possible to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that we do not understand by putting a bunch of electrons in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific patterns and the SI can figure out how to get said electrons into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that configuration within the hardware someplace.  This &quot;seems&quot; unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially given that the SI is highly unlikely to know details (circuit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designs, etc) about its own hardware unless its operators are stupid.
</em><br>
<p>So now we're setting limits on what an SI can *deduce*...?  Besides, it
<br>
seems to me that an SI is almost supersaturated with information that
<br>
allows ver to deduce the nature of the underlying hardware.  Circuit
<br>
delays, instruction sets, timing, architectures, design constraints...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other method would be true &quot;magic&quot; to us.  In Great Bear's &quot;Blood Music&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws of science are actually created by conscious thought.  So if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge number of minds agreed that something was true (like FTL travel) then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be so.  The amount of actual intelligence involved is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important in his universe than the actual number of individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds.  Thus, if anything like this were true we would be SOL no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we do, period.
</em><br>
<p>There is a third kind of magic - pattern manipulation.  Even a black-boxed
<br>
SI is literally emitting trillions of bits, just not large obvious bits
<br>
that a human would recognize.  A black box is still a part of our
<br>
Universe.  The question is whether an SI manipulating those bits can take
<br>
advantage of regularities in our Universe that a human wouldn't recognize.
