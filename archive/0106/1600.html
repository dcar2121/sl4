&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambiguity is more central to the general use of natural languages than
<br>
anyone has noted yet in this thread.  It is a valuable design feature, not a
<br>
defect to be minimized at all costs.  Moreover, this use of  ambiguity is
<br>
the reason why language use in open conversation requires general
<br>
intelligence (or abductive reasoning, or a solution to the frame problem)
<br>
and so is central to the task of building general AI.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond imprecision in meaning of words and sentences, ambiguity arises
<br>
because much of the meaning of a communication emerges from the interplay of
<br>
words and context.  This is built into natural language use at many levels.
<br>
At the most simple are classes of words such as indexicals ( &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;,
<br>
&quot;here&quot;, &quot;now&quot;) and pronouns ( can't tell who is &quot;me&quot; without context).
<br>
Figurative speech, irony, sarcasm, humor, all rely on context (and the
<br>
possibilty of multiple meanings that disambiguating would dissolve).  For
<br>
all words, while denotations might be disambiguated by Durant Schoon's
<br>
Herculean Dictionary proposal, connotations will still vary relative to the
<br>
experiences of speaker and listener.  All social situations make available
<br>
speech acts or language games where meaning is altered or supplemented:
<br>
promising, flirting, calling out.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider our audience's context and expectations in choosing words,
<br>
to trigger the connotations we want, but we also use their expectations and
<br>
context to encode meaning.  We incorporate by reference material from novels
<br>
fnord, pop culture (objectivism, anyone?) and science(using the meme meme to
<br>
inject evolutionary ideas into discussions of language usage).  We
<br>
intentionally break grammatical rules to add emphasis, or signal an
<br>
attitude( &quot;ain't&quot; or double negatives).  We violate the audience's
<br>
expectations of relevance(or good manners or appropriate  diction) to signal
<br>
irony or sarcasm or disagreement or boredom, and thus change the meaning of
<br>
a post from its surface meaning.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if meaning is dependent on the context of both speaker and listener,
<br>
as well as the actual words used, ambiguity can creep in because of
<br>
uncertainties in either context.  Many of the posts in this list are
<br>
seriuosly ambiguous to someone who knows none of the context.  Even if one
<br>
has a very wide scientific background, and has read Ayn Rand, and the
<br>
Illuminatus trilogy, and Vernor Vinge, and played Zork, until one gets to
<br>
know the various posters and their backgrounds, it is easy to misinterpret
<br>
posts.  The intellectual task of interpreting posts, which includes
<br>
simultaneously elaborating the contexts, is not merely deductive or
<br>
inductive, it requires inferences to the best explanation, or abduction, (or
<br>
general intelligence).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could limit ambiguity by limiting use of figurative speech and
<br>
references that are not fully specified.  You could disclaim any intent to
<br>
communicate connotations.  But except in very specialized circumstances, why
<br>
would you want to?  The same features that yield ambiguity allow much more
<br>
information to be expressed in limited  space, and allow many subltle
<br>
effects and meanings that cannot be communicated more simply (as in poetry,
<br>
but not just poetry).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in scientific discourse, figurative language can be very powerful
<br>
in suggesting new lines of thought, as with the meme meme, and the general
<br>
use of evolutionary  ideas throughout the social sciences.
