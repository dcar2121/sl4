<p>
Eliezer:
<br>
<p>Thanks for your response to my message.
<br>
<p>The idea I'm presenting for consideration is the importance of human
<br>
participation in the ascent towards the Singularity. I'm suggesting that
<br>
there may be an alternative to building the AI while we remain just as we
<br>
are.
<br>
<p>One issue here is whether the ascent can be sufficiently controlled so that
<br>
we can follow as best we can what is going on. One way to do this is to have
<br>
the AI itself have as a part of its architecture not just the communication
<br>
of what changes it is making to its code, but providing a
<br>
human-understandable explanation as to what it is doing and what it expects
<br>
the next steps will be. One control might be that it would have to get a
<br>
positive response from its programmers that they have sufficient
<br>
understanding before it could proceed to the next iteration of its
<br>
processing.
<br>
<p>Another area for consideration is whether the AI in its advanced but still
<br>
pre-singularity mode could make recommendations as to what enhancements to
<br>
human intellectual capacity would work best to allow us to follow it further
<br>
on its path. The advanced pre-singularity phase is a key point where a lot
<br>
of useful things might be done, and I'm suggesting that the architecture of
<br>
the AI be designed in a way that we could all get the benefit of this phase.
<br>
<p>It is certainly true that after the Singularity occurs all bets are off.
<br>
This is why controlling the advanced phase is crucial. If we don't have near
<br>
total confidence in the friendliness of the AI, we should never let it get
<br>
beyond this point. Being able to extensively interact with it during this
<br>
phase, even with the risk that someone else might create one first, is
<br>
necessary to establish that confidence.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Jack
