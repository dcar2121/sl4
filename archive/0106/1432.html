<em>&gt;Sigh... no definition offered for egoism,
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I just assumed there was no need to repeat the dictionary:
<br>
<p>1 a : a doctrine that individual self-interest is the actual motive 
<br>
of all conscious action b : a doctrine that individual self-interest 
<br>
is the valid end of all actions
<br>
<p>And, here's a mis definition that I found for egoism:
<br>
<p>Attempting to get personal recognition for oneself
<br>
<p>Sounds more to me like just the opposite of egoism, since the egoist 
<br>
is to concerned with verself to care what others think (this is one 
<br>
of those qualities that I think that AIs should develop and that I 
<br>
have, but SL4 probably isn't the place for me to get into a 
<br>
discussion of what characteristics I think that intelligences should 
<br>
have).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;no explanation of how it slips
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the mind...
</em><br>
<p>Egosim would be built in, like Friendliness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;how is this more than yet another case of &quot;AIs must share
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*my* philosophy&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>It's a philosophy that has a relation to Friendliness, but part of 
<br>
the reason that I like Friendliness now is that I realize that it 
<br>
takes this and other philosophies, either on purpose or not, and 
<br>
develops a new one for AIs (well, I guess Friendliness would be good 
<br>
for any SI) that is wiser to the realities of the world.  At one 
<br>
time, I would have written 'Let's make egoistic AIs' but now, after 
<br>
much more thought and FAI, I'd write 'Let's make Friendly AIs'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for the rest of this:  I'm interested in humans, but then, I'm a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human-level intelligence myself, so that level of complexity is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ultimate challenge rather than a trivial problem.  But even I can see that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the amount of complexity is both finite and understandable, and that once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're done, you're done.  Leave that aside.  Has it occurred to anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that maybe it wouldn't be all that *pleasant* to live in a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superintelligences were interested in people for purely utilitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons?  That, even if it were pleasant, it would probably still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointless?  That there's a world out there full of better possibilities?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  To be honest, I have little interest in the vast majority of 
<br>
human beings now, so after I'm uploaded, why would I start caring?
<br>
<p>I should clarify that last statement by adding that a lack of 
<br>
interest in humans is not a lack of interest in them so far as what 
<br>
huanity might do to me or how I might use humanity to better myself. 
<br>
I'm just not interested in what happens to humanity as a whole; just 
<br>
me a couple of other people, though there are certainly some issues 
<br>
where my interests match up with those of humanity (e.g. existential 
<br>
disasters).
