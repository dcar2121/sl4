<em>&gt; With the risk of nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war receding, the threat of our ending with a bang no longer has a chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of galvanizing us to halt our course. Our risk now is of winding down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowly, in a whimper. Corrective action is blocked by vested interests, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-intentioned political and business leaders, and by their electorates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of whom are perfectly correct in not noticing big changes from year to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year. Instead, each year there are just somewhat more people, and somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer resources, on Earth.
</em><br>
<p>The last sentence of this quote reveals a remarkable ignorance of the nature
<br>
of technology.  Technology allows us to use resources from off Earth, and to
<br>
use substances that weren't previously identified as useful resources, and
<br>
to use substances previously identified as resources much more efficiently.
<br>
Technology basically meaning &quot;matter organized in special ways according to
<br>
our intelligence.&quot;  Technology of course may ultimately allow us to leave
<br>
our human bodies behind as well.
<br>
<p>The analogy between societies like Easter Island and ours is pretty darn
<br>
forced.  Yes, they had tech too, but they didn't have the accelerating curve
<br>
of tech development that we have now.  They were on a very different point
<br>
in the overall tech development curve of intelligent races.
<br>
<p>I guess that on a list like this, I've already said more than was necessary.
<br>
Perhaps the best thing would have been to ignore this silliness.  But
<br>
there's always the risk that someone might take it seriously...
<br>
