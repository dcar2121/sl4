<p>Wow.  The SL4 mailing list is working.
<br>
<p>I should start by saying that I don't actually agree that this suggestion
<br>
will work; it's not the *speed* of thought but the *quality* of thought, I
<br>
think, that lets an unfriendly SI take over a human.  Remember that Deep
<br>
Blue had to examine literally billions of chess positions using an
<br>
unintelligent algorithm to achieve rough parity with a human examining a
<br>
couple of moves per second.  I like to say that Deep Blue - unlike any
<br>
human being - actually played *chess*; that is, actually navigated a
<br>
search tree composed of actual, raw chess positions.  Kasparov, and all
<br>
other human beings including myself, navigate a much smaller search tree
<br>
composed of the *regularities* in the actual Game of Chess.  And we can
<br>
play the game of Regularities in Chess for the same reason that Deep Blue
<br>
can play Actual Chess; we are significantly more complex and intricate
<br>
than the structure of regularities in chess, just as Deep Blue is
<br>
significantly more complex than Actual Chess (although nowhere near
<br>
complex enough to understand the Regularities of Chess.)
<br>
<p>A human cannot play the Game of Human Regularities because humans are
<br>
roughly on a par with each other, complexity-wise.  Rather, we must
<br>
persuade; we must operate through the use of personal analogy and
<br>
empathy.  A transhuman can play the Game of Human Regularities and take
<br>
over a human through a VT100 terminal, albeit this would require mental
<br>
effort and creativity such as we expend to play chess.  A
<br>
superintelligence has the theoretical computing capacity to play the Game
<br>
of Actual Humans - i.e., model us on a level low enough to be syntax
<br>
rather than semantics - and thereby, in some sense, obviate the need to
<br>
understand some of the regularities, allowing a superintelligence to
<br>
emulate a human using raw computing power rather than raw smartness.  It
<br>
is difficult to see why a superintelligence would want to do this.  The
<br>
argument serves mainly as a gedankenexperiment in the VT100 Takeover
<br>
debate.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, it may be that modeling of the Game of Actual Humans, at
<br>
least for some circumstances, could enable a superintelligence to pull off
<br>
stunts such as Deep Blue going pawn-hunting while Kasparov was after its
<br>
king, a feat later compared to a general walking through a battlefield and
<br>
keeping track of each bullet in flight.  The analogy for a VT100 Takeover
<br>
might be predicting and exploiting low-level anomalies in the target brain
<br>
to assist high-level effects.  For example, timing a statement with some
<br>
split-second regularity so as to take advantage of precise coordination
<br>
with a previously triggered memory retrieval or insight so that the human
<br>
fails to notice, or has a particular response to, the statement made.  I'm
<br>
not sure you can slow down an SI by starving it of processing power, but
<br>
if you did, I think it'd lose some VT100 Takeover capacities, but not all
<br>
of them, and not the *primary* one, which is that the SI is fundamentally
<br>
smarter than we are and is therefore - literally - more persuasive than
<br>
any human who ever lived, even if playing the game on our level; and, even
<br>
more importantly, is smarter than us and may therefore be playing a
<br>
different game than we think we are playing.
<br>
<p>That said, James Higgins's suggestion of &quot;slow the SI down&quot; does not, I
<br>
think, actually work on an SI - but it is nonetheless brilliant, creative,
<br>
and completely original.  So is Jimmy Wales's suggestion that a locked-up
<br>
SI should only be allowed to communicate with humans through binary code
<br>
(with my appended note that the yes-or-no signal needs deterministic
<br>
timing).  We are exploring genuinely new territory here that, AFAIK,
<br>
neither science fiction nor the Extropian mailing list have touched.
