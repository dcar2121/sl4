<em>&gt; &gt; Not trying to get into a religious debate with you (and Powers know

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational evidence for the existance of god and he knew it, too.  We,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on other hand, have rational reasons and suggestive evidence (we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't want actual evidence, because that means us getting hosed)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an unFriendly AI would be the end of us all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From what I've read of his writings, there's not much doubt that Pascal knew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no such thing.  He believed in the existence of his god fervently.  His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument was intended for nonbelievers.  His convictions about god were as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational to him - and many other people before and since - as your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear-based beliefs about the future seem to you.
</em><br>
<p>Side Note:
<br>
<p>I haven't read any of Pascal's writing, myself, but when I was reading 
<br>
Edward O. Wilson's book Consilience, it struck me that Pascal popularized 
<br>
the idea of Mind/Body Duality AND he was the father of scientific 
<br>
reductionism!
<br>
<p>What incredibly irony, if, in this century, we show that synapses can be
<br>
simulated and then reductionism will finally show that &quot;the mind is what 
<br>
the brain does&quot; (ps - is that Dennet's quote...epiphenomena?...)
