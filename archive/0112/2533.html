<p>Okay, lets...  I spent about 8 months doing market research and technical due
<br>
dilly on a bioinformatics play back at the beginning of '99, so I can hopefully
<br>
discuss this without being a total 'tard. ;-)  (For the record, my thoughts
<br>
about structured vs. unstructured data and costs are the result of spending the
<br>
last 12 months working on a storage resource management play that's in some
<br>
loose ways related to what I learned looking at the bioinformatics opportunity
<br>
a couple of years back.  It's really been quite amazing seeing where all the
<br>
&quot;storage&quot; dollars flow in corporate America.  And just for completion, the
<br>
middle period there was spent working on automated text summarization,
<br>
classification, and syndication of online newsflow. I may be wrong about any or
<br>
all of this, but hopefully I'm at least not totally uninformed. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a lot of useful information out there, in research papers.
</em><br>
<p>There's a lot of good *summary* information there;  let's be clear, though,
<br>
that the real information is in the datasets that underlie such papers.  I'm
<br>
not saying unstructured information is universally better than structured
<br>
information;  there's some information --- such as that found in bioinformatics
<br>
--- which is inherently structured.  Data about physical process is inherently
<br>
structured.  The unstructured summaries presented in such papers are never
<br>
substitutes for the real thing.  Further, the assumption that you can create
<br>
such good, structured information by reconstituting from summarized,
<br>
unstructured form is erroneous at best.
<br>
<p>And think about all the effort involved in building a tool to do this, even if
<br>
it were possible:  it's likely to (a) be a highly domain- (or
<br>
sub-sub-sub-domain-)specific creature, and (b) the cost (effort) is certain to
<br>
outweigh the effort needed to simply obtain the original datasets from the
<br>
various researchers.  I.e., the cost of building such a system amortized across
<br>
all uses of such a system will most likely outweigh the aggregate costs of
<br>
simply sharing the original datasets, or --- as has clearly happened in the
<br>
gene sequencing world --- building better *tools* for collaboratively creating
<br>
and sharing such datasets.  (Standard formats for and tools for translating
<br>
between and managing such structured datasets are without a doubt useful.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't feel you're being practical at all
</em><br>
<p>Well, right back at ya. ;-)  Seriously, understand what I'm saying:  structure
<br>
and unstructure aren't equivalent;  you can't convert freely from one to the
<br>
other without losing information in the process;  like all engineering
<br>
problems, the trick is to use the right tool for the job.  Unf., human beings
<br>
have a tendency to overcategorize, overclassify, then endlessly argue about and
<br>
revise such ontologies.  We get so wrapped up in our model-building that we
<br>
forget that the models are just that.
<br>
<p>I believe that bioinformatics --- like many other fields --- would be
<br>
well-served by the availability of better tools for dealing with unstructured
<br>
data.  Such tools would include better citation mapping mechanisms, academic
<br>
interaction mappers, domain-sensitive search engines, text summarizers,
<br>
similarity and &quot;semantic clustering&quot; engines, distributed data repositories,
<br>
collaboration / syndication / publication frameworks, etc.
<br>
<p>IMO, though, these do not or only minimally involve the kinds of structured
<br>
markup of &quot;knowledge&quot; that you hear TBL and friends going on about lately.
<br>
I.e., it seems rather impractical to assume that anybody's ever going to sit
<br>
down and *agree* on a standard set of &quot;bioinformatics&quot; semantics tags that can
<br>
be used to impart structured meaning on unstructured bioinformatics texts.  It
<br>
seems less likely that people would actually use such an ontology by manually
<br>
marking up such texts, and even less likely that any generic method (short of
<br>
human-equivalent AI) should be able to do so post facto, and less likely yet
<br>
that the results of such would be generally useful within the field.
<br>
<p>Here're some guiding principles I've been finding useful in the last few years
<br>
that have informed this point of view:
<br>
<p>Similarity, not ontology.
<br>
Filters / views, not containers.
<br>
Inappropriate or too much structure is bad.
<br>
Probabilities, not absolutes.
<br>
Generic interfaces, not APIs.
<br>
Composition, not inheritance.
<br>
Data flow, not control flow.
<br>
Chronology, not classification.
<br>
Free text, not markup.
<br>
Searching, not browsing.
<br>
Flat, not hierarchical.
<br>
Identities, not names.
<br>
Embrace messiness.
<br>
<p>Cheers ;-)
