<em>&gt; Yawn.  That's a very anti-scientific argument, Eli --- indeed one I often hear

</em><br>
<p>Alas for the Fundies:  Theories that have been killed, such as
<br>
creationism, always remain dead forever; science moves forward, but it
<br>
never goes back to where it was.
<br>
<p>Alas for us:  Future progress will kill off some of our own theories, too.
<br>
<p>There's a very big difference between saying &quot;science moves forward,
<br>
therefore your scientific disproof of my silly idea should not be trusted&quot;
<br>
and saying &quot;science moves forward, therefore our extrapolation of the next
<br>
billion millennia changes every fifty years&quot;.
<br>
<p>Any attempt to establish &quot;ultimate physical limits on technology&quot; is a
<br>
case in point.  Do you really think that an attempt to argue an ultimate
<br>
physical limit - as a reality, and not just as one model's interesting
<br>
extrapolation - should be treated under the same rules as a disproof of an
<br>
exploded flat-Earth theory?  Disproving creationism or flat-Earth does not
<br>
require that our current model be absolutely complete and that it stand
<br>
for all time, merely that we take into account the overwhelming
<br>
preponderance of negative evidence against a *disproven* theory. 
<br>
Establishing a physical limit is the hardest kind of result to establish,
<br>
since anything we don't know about could represent a possible loophole. 
<br>
Considering the rate at which this trick has failed in times past, one is
<br>
justified in insisting that a given &quot;physical limit&quot; remain firm for, oh,
<br>
at least a couple of centuries, before being accepted as anything other
<br>
than an interim approximation.  The historical record of &quot;technological
<br>
impossibilities&quot; dying off almost as fast as religious text can't be used
<br>
as an argument for the latest crackpot theory of perpetual motion, but it
<br>
does mean that we should limit the confidence level of statements about
<br>
*all possible* future technologies.
