</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A COMPUTATION would a simulation where the minds involved weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent or even really self aware, but function based on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm very much like that in a mind.  Just as we can model simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life forms (e.g. ants), we will all look like little ants to Powers.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is almost the same argument as the &quot;Can A Giant Look-Up Table Be
<br>
Conscious&quot; argument that was had a while back (though I don't know if that
<br>
was on this list or the Extropians or both).  I don't see a functional
<br>
difference in your definitions.  Any algorithm sufficiently accurate to
<br>
perfectly predict all changes of state of the actual phenomenon is
<br>
mathematically equivalent to a perfect simulation of that phenomenon (some
<br>
restrictions apply -- see below).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The difference is important because, just like the artificial ants, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial humans won't be real in that they won't have been programmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as full minds, but to respond *like* they are full minds.
</em><br>
<p><p>The only way this difference can be true mathematically is if you assume
<br>
that the human brain is not a finite state machine.  I personally am of the
<br>
opinion that the human brain is a finite state machine (in all aspects that
<br>
matter), and therefore have to reject your difference.  From the assumption
<br>
that a human mind is essentially an FSM, any code capable of fully
<br>
responding like a human mind would be the same as the code necessary to
<br>
simulate a human mind (Kolmogorov complexity).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Also, going back to your initial note, even if the problem can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced, it should be possible to run a very large computation without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having to go into simulations.  It's really a question of how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources some SIs are willing to put into figuring out how some humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acted or might have acted.  Unless, of course, you're assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is some inherent difference between algorithms that respond like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans and actual human mind algorithms.
</em><br>
<p><p>The problem is that I assume that the code required to respond exactly like
<br>
a human is identical to the code required for &quot;human mind algorithms&quot;.
<br>
Furthermore, I think this runs into a weak version of the Halting Problem.
<br>
There is no way to predict some future state without running your algorithm
<br>
through all the intermediate states.  In this context, I don't see any
<br>
difference at all between a &quot;simulation&quot; of a human mind and the computation
<br>
of state transitions of something that responds exactly like a human mind.
<br>
Both of these activities denote identical computational processes.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
