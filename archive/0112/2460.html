I cant prove that there ISNT a loophole in any given law (and hence loop 
<br>
holes in the loop holes and so on).
<br>
Let me propose a counter example with a more limited scope. If it is 
<br>
possible to develop a technology that would allow &quot;entire universe could be 
<br>
swallowed in an instant&quot;(including all of the time line) and we also assume 
<br>
that we are not the only technological beings in the time line (i 
<br>
reasonable assumption I think), then given the size and age of the universe 
<br>
it is likely that someone somewhere some-when will develop this technology. 
<br>
If anyone who wanted to take over the universe for whatever reason were to 
<br>
develop this technology then they would take over the universe.
<br>
Since we are here today, and space time seems intact it seems reasonable to 
<br>
assume that either 1) such a technology is very unlikely to be developed 
<br>
(or impossible), 2) there is a very compelling reason *not* to do this, 3) 
<br>
Nothing/no-one with both the ability and the inclination to develop and use 
<br>
such a technology has-ever or will ever exist anywhere in the (possibly 
<br>
infinite) universe.
<br>
So basically, if its possible, why hasn't it already happened? or &quot;if time 
<br>
travel works, where are all the time travelers?&quot;
<br>
I hope that was coherent.
