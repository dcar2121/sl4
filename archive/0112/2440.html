<p>Hey now...  I may be stating things forcefully, but I'm pretty emotionally detached
<br>
from this whole thing.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue - that is, before we begin making value judgements or philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions based on it -
</em><br>
<p>Let's understand that there's a difference between those things.  IMO, the issue of
<br>
&quot;value judgements&quot; is a huge one, but from my perspective it's the notion (as it's
<br>
been advanced so far) of Friendliness that's entangled with a priori value
<br>
assessments.  Philosophical assumptions, well, in order to argue logically you've got
<br>
to ground out in some set of assumptions.  I try to make that set as small as I can
<br>
in my arguments, but it's a challenge when dealing with issues this broad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we should remember that the model the prediction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is based on is a model which historically has often changed and currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still in flux.
</em><br>
<p>Yawn.  That's a very anti-scientific argument, Eli --- indeed one I often hear
<br>
religious folks (like the Creationist crowd) use to undermine the credibility of
<br>
arguments from a scientific bias.  Let's keep in mind that the model that we have now
<br>
--- while *certain* to change and improve --- is now yielding very fine-grained
<br>
predictions with accuracy improving at a rate that outstrips our ability to verify
<br>
them.  Those that we can measure are turning out to be very, very precise.  (I'm
<br>
speaking specifically about some of the predictions coming out of QED.)  That aside,
<br>
it's the best model we've got to make predictions from --- and given that all this
<br>
stuff is highly predictive, we should use the best predictive models and
<br>
understanding that we have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well... this is something I happen to disagree with, because personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the second law of thermodynamics strikes me as being statistical in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature, and often rather fragile.
</em><br>
<p>Go read up on it --- it's probably the best law we've got, and has very, very deep
<br>
implications for the most essential workings of spacetime.  Yes, it's statistical,
<br>
and yes, there are issues with scope (i.e., clearly life violates 2LT on a very local
<br>
scale, but then the law doesn't talk about those scales.)  But it's still got some
<br>
amazing properties relative to many other &quot;fundamental&quot; physical laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not be surprised to find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is utterly impossible to exceed the speed of light within a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitational frame of reference, forever and amen.  2LT seems to me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have more the character of a guideline than a rule.
</em><br>
<p>2LT doesn't predict the impossibility of exceeding c.  And IMO, you're right in your
<br>
bias:  I'm not convinced of the inviolability of c --- or even its constancy.  OTOH,
<br>
only 2LT gives reason to many of the other assymetries and observed peculiarities in
<br>
our reality, and we have no better explanation of one very real phenomenon:  the
<br>
directionality of time.
<br>
<p>Go read _Order Out Of Chaos_ by Ilya Prigogine.  It's a good (if pop) introduction to
<br>
the topic from back in the mid-80s, by a Nobel prizewinner (and local-to-me --- he
<br>
lives in Austin too!)
<br>
<p>Aside:  I find it amusing and appropriate that you should take issue with the
<br>
validity of 2LT, given the Maxwell's Daemon-like nature of your Sysop in some
<br>
possible interpretations. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can never prove (epistemological impossibility) that any given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; set of laws, no matter how accurate the predictions they yield, are the best or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even only model of how the world works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think perhaps our species is too young to know that as well.
</em><br>
<p>Really?  You're really close to arguing that logic itself is tenuous, and other
<br>
similar epistemological problems -wrt- the nature of knowledge.  There are some
<br>
things that are either knowable or unknowable independent of the characteristics of
<br>
the knower, and there are things that can be known to be knowable without actually
<br>
knowing them.  This isn't a matter of philosophy, it's a matter of math and logic ---
<br>
and unless you're up for taking on some of the brightest minds in those fields then
<br>
there's no argument to be had.  (BTW, these aren't my arguments, rather me
<br>
paraphrasing and synthesizing Curry, Church, Godel, Turing, Russell, and a host of
<br>
others.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceive of a model which starts at the First Cause
</em><br>
<p>What if there is no First Cause?  Many currently fashionable reinterpretations of the
<br>
origin of the universe actually imply that there is no timelike lower bound to the
<br>
universe, i.e. that timelike boundary is asymptotic, and there is no initial causal
<br>
moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; IMO, any system of &quot;rights&quot; in practice actually results in unresolvable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inconsistencies and paradoxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Unresolvable?&quot;  That sounds pretty strong.  Can you name a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unresolvable inconsistency or paradox?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Alice and Bob both have a &quot;right to life.&quot;  For whatever reason, a situation
<br>
that arises in which Alice can persist but Bob must perish, OR Bob can persist but
<br>
Alice must perish.  (Imagine that a Sysop is charged with guarding the physical
<br>
inhabitants of some region which is facing some catastrophe, and time or resource
<br>
constraints make it impossible to save everyone in peril.)  More mundanely, your wife
<br>
and your daughter are crossing the street, unaware of an oncoming bus --- you have
<br>
time to push one or the other out of the way but not both.  More generally, if two
<br>
actors have the right to pursue happiness, but happiness for one results in inability
<br>
to pursue happiness for the other, then you've got an inconsistency.[Image]
<br>
<p>Etc. etc.  these are of course contrived, but it's generalizable and formalizable,
<br>
and if it's formalizable it's decidable.  If we want to go down that path, I can give
<br>
you the formal notation.  I cannot (yet) prove that *any* system of rights results in
<br>
unresolvable inconsistencies, but I can prove that *many* (and common) systems of
<br>
assumed rights result in unresolvable inconsistencies.  My conclusion from this is
<br>
that rights are not and cannot be considered to be innate, and that rights are not
<br>
absolute but must be contextual within some system of values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It may be that the optimal system for allowing independent actors to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; optimal balance of competing self-interests is not a system of axiomatized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights coupled with protective and punitive measures (a &quot;legal&quot; system, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sysop) but rather a kind of metalegal framework that enables efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negotiation and exchange of consensual, contractual agreements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The two main problems with this are as stated earlier:  First, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of a universe in which offense beats defense; second, the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a simulated, enslaved citizen has no position from which to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negotiate.
</em><br>
<p>Two problems with the problems:  first, you can't *ever* prove that any given defense
<br>
against some threat is infallible;  there's an old logical argument to that effect,
<br>
and even more recent quantitative defense analyses that underscore and even reinforce
<br>
the principle.  Second, how did simulated, enslaved citizens work their way into the
<br>
argument?  Nothing I said requires or even implies that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A metalegal framework might be superimposed on an intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate, but it still requires an intelligent substrate to ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no being is stripped of citizenship rights.
</em><br>
<p>Again, rights are a very superstitious, nebulous, and anthropomorphic concept which
<br>
*may* in fact *impair* civilization's ability to achieve desirable outcomes such as
<br>
longevity or Pareto optimal happiness of individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Eliminate negative events if possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But &quot;negative&quot; has many dimensions, and most of those are subjective...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... he argued, correctly assuming that the audience would perceive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;subjectivity&quot; as a negative quality with respect to principles intended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>Not really my assumption, but it doesn't surprise me that you would assume that. ;-)
<br>
Believe it or not and dispite your skepticism of philosophers, Eli, this kind of
<br>
discourse and moral calculus does indeed exist outside the scope of the discussion of
<br>
Friendliness.  :-)  You might want to check out [1] below for some contemporary
<br>
discussion along these lines.  Bit of a tangent and not necessarily an argument I
<br>
agree with, but interesting nonetheless.
<br>
<p>BTW, this discussion doesn't offend me at all, and indeed there's a long tradition
<br>
along these lines, going back at least to the Greeks.  It should be understood that
<br>
I'm merely arguing along the lines of Epicurus, liberally seasoned with Lysander
<br>
Spooner.
