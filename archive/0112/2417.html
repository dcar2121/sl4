</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Sysop need not know the state of everything, but be there when

</em><br>
<p>And my argument is that in order to determine when and where the Sysop will
<br>
be needed, some agent --- whether the Sysop itself or the environment is
<br>
unimportant --- is going to need a predictive ability that allows it to
<br>
prevent unwanted harm or death to individuals.  This will be, for example,
<br>
*far* more complex than forecasting local weather patterns in detail with
<br>
any accuracy.  Indeed, consider weather:  a Sysop that in fact performs as
<br>
Eli suggests it should (i.e., ensures --- absolutely, reliably --- that
<br>
involuntary harm or damage cannot impact a protected individual under the
<br>
Sysop's care) will either need to be able to control the weather (which
<br>
implies deep simulation ability in that area) or be able to proactively
<br>
protect particular individuals and their goods when threatened by bad
<br>
weather.  Neither of these may be possible:  the first may not be possibly
<br>
due to the complex dynamics of physical phenomenon like weather, the latter
<br>
may not be possible simply because it may be physically impossible to
<br>
protect something against the forces seen in certain disastrous weather
<br>
conditions.  Bad weather, earthquakes, etc. would indeed require extremely
<br>
fine-grained simulation of the time evolution of large interrelated systems
<br>
of effects, to avoid the *eventual* impact on the constituency.
<br>
<p>I agree that this is all, most likely, computationally impractical --- not
<br>
particularly because of lack of computation ability (let's assume
<br>
computronium) but because of the potential physical limitations to
<br>
simulating the real world in sufficient detail to provide absolute
<br>
guarantees of safety.  IMO, the only thing a practical Sysop will be able
<br>
to do is guarantee best-effort protection and safety, and *that* might not
<br>
be worth the risks involved.
<br>
<p>BTW, this all assumes that some part of the constituency &quot;remains&quot;
<br>
interested in being physically present in the physical world.  If everybody
<br>
uploads --- *everybody* --- then this isn't as big a problem, though the
<br>
Sysop must still be concerned with the physical safety of whatever
<br>
substrate it runs on.
<br>
<p>Logic, common sense, and actuarial reasoning should tell us that that
<br>
*absolute* safety is an impossibility, and my gut tells me that attempting
<br>
to task some Power with providing it is a recipe for disaster.
