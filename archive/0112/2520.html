About &quot;faith&quot; and whether Eli's gotta have it or not... (I really love these
<br>
endless threads dissecting Eliezer's psychology.  We haven't gotten onto his
<br>
potty training yet for some reason; I guess there's a paucity of Freudians
<br>
on the list...)
<br>
<p>Anyway, I partly agree with Samantha here, actually.
<br>
<p>But only partly!
<br>
<p>Of course, as Hume observed back when I was in diapers, the problem of
<br>
induction is
<br>
unsolvable.  *Purely* rational inference about the universe is not possible.
<br>
Even highly-refined probabilistic inference engines like your own brain have
<br>
to make some a priori assumption about the background probability
<br>
distribution
<br>
(to cast Hume in Bayesian terms).
<br>
<p>Call it faith, call it intuition, or call it Caledonia Mahogany's Elbows,
<br>
there's something in addition rational calculation going on when we make
<br>
judgments, particularly in such data-poor domains as the end-state of
<br>
the cosmos!
<br>
<p>I also agree with Eli's point that our physical models of the universe are
<br>
very unstable and not to be taken that seriously in the &quot;big picture.&quot;
<br>
However,
<br>
I think the problem of induction show itself rather clearly in this
<br>
observation.
<br>
The time series of physical models of the universe is really not very long,
<br>
so
<br>
there's a lot of faith/intuition/assumption in extrapolating it *or* even in
<br>
estimating its variance as Eliezer is implicitly doing...
<br>
<p>BUT -- I guess the problem with the word &quot;faith&quot;, Samantha, is that it often
<br>
goes along
<br>
with the idea that *some things should not be rationally questioned.*  If
<br>
you have
<br>
faith in life after death, you should not even consider rational arguments
<br>
against
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>This is not the same as the kind of a-rational intuition that must underly
<br>
the
<br>
assumption of background probability distributions.  The mind must make some
<br>
underlying, biased assumptions in order to reason; but it can be flexible
<br>
about what
<br>
these assumptions are.  &quot;Faith&quot; implies a forced lack of flexibility in this
<br>
regard,
<br>
which is surely NOT optimal in terms of maximizing cognitive power (though
<br>
it may
<br>
well be optimal as a mechanism of spreading a certain assumption throughout
<br>
society).
