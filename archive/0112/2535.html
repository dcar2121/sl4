<em>&gt; &gt; There is a lot of useful information out there, in research papers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a lot of good *summary* information there;  let's be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear, though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the real information is in the datasets that underlie such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers.
</em><br>
<p>yes, but the real datasets are very rarely available.  What industry is more
<br>
secretive than pharma
<br>
and biotech?
<br>
<p>and of course, building software to automatically extract semantic knowledge
<br>
from diversely structured
<br>
raw datasets is just about as hard as building software to automatically
<br>
extract semantic knowledge
<br>
from text ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Further, the assumption that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such good, structured information by reconstituting from summarized,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstructured form is erroneous at best.
</em><br>
<p>It can be done to some extent, see for instance the work of rzhetsky at
<br>
columbia
<br>
<a href="http://genome6.cpmc.columbia.edu/~andrey/">http://genome6.cpmc.columbia.edu/~andrey/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And think about all the effort involved in building a tool to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it were possible:  it's likely to (a) be a highly domain- (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub-sub-sub-domain-)specific creature,
</em><br>
<p>yes, to date.  rzhetsky's system is an example of that
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and (b) the cost (effort)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is certain to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outweigh the effort needed to simply obtain the original datasets from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various researchers.
</em><br>
<p>This is an incredibly naive and ridiculous statement.  How are you going to
<br>
get
<br>
the original datasets out of the research divisions of pharma companies??
<br>
Even academics
<br>
won't share their datasets with other academics for fear of helping the
<br>
competition.
<br>
<p>About this aspect of the sociology of the research community, I'm afraid you
<br>
really
<br>
don't have a clue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I.e., the cost of building such a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amortized across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all uses of such a system will most likely outweigh the aggregate costs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply sharing the original datasets, or --- as has clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene sequencing world --- building better *tools* for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaboratively creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sharing such datasets.
</em><br>
<p>There is a lot of publicly available information in the bio domain, but a
<br>
hell of a lot
<br>
of secret information too.  Contrast the situation with yeast (for which
<br>
there are extensive
<br>
public databases on protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and so
<br>
forth) with the situation
<br>
for humans (nearly all data is private, and info is available only in
<br>
research papers)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Seriously, understand what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying:  structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unstructure aren't equivalent;  you can't convert freely from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other without losing information in the process;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course that's true.  You also can't communicate from one mind to
<br>
another
<br>
using language without losing information in the process, but, we do so
<br>
quite
<br>
regularly and usefully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that bioinformatics --- like many other fields --- would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-served by the availability of better tools for dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstructured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data.  Such tools would include better citation mapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms, academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction mappers, domain-sensitive search engines, text summarizers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarity and &quot;semantic clustering&quot; engines, distributed data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repositories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaboration / syndication / publication frameworks, etc.
</em><br>
<p>All these are good things, but I still believe that information extraction
<br>
from
<br>
NL text will be an important part of the toolkit too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I.e., it seems rather impractical to assume that anybody's ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down and *agree* on a standard set of &quot;bioinformatics&quot; semantics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tags that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be used to impart structured meaning on unstructured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bioinformatics texts.
</em><br>

<br>
<p>it already exists and is incorporated in some commercial projects, e.g.
