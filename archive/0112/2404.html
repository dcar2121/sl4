<p>I guess I need to break something down, because though I thought it was

obvious people seem to be missing it.
<br>
<p>We could very well be in a puppet show RIGHT NOW and have no idea about 
<br>
it.  The reason is that, just like when you play a role playing game or 
<br>
act a part in a play, you forget how you really are and focus on the 
<br>
play.  It doesn't seem like a big deal, because it's only for a little 
<br>
while and it's easy to jump back.  Now, imagine that an SI is doing the 
<br>
same thing, only playing the part of a human.  But, after what seems 
<br>
like years to us, we forget that we're really an SI.  I could be a great 
<br>
Power back in reality, but in here I'm a lowly college student acting 
<br>
out a part.  It could be that we've chosen to forego the ability to 
<br>
unmask ourselves so that the game/play is more realistic.
<br>
<p>But, as always, I think we're getting nowhere fast on these simulation 
<br>
threads.  There simply isn't enough evidence to figure things out for 
<br>
sure, but all of us are good at setting up proofs (myself included) that 
<br>
we do/don't live in a simulation *assuming* x, y, and z.
