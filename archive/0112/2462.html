<p><p><em>&gt; Let me propose a counter example with a more limited scope. If it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to develop a technology that would allow &quot;entire universe could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swallowed in an instant&quot;(including all of the time line) and we also assume 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are not the only technological beings in the time line (i 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable assumption I think), then given the size and age of the universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is likely that someone somewhere some-when will develop this technology. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If anyone who wanted to take over the universe for whatever reason were to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop this technology then they would take over the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Other possibilities; 1)Time machines might not be able to travel any further 
<br>
back in time than when the first time machine was created, in order not to 
<br>
violate causality.  The tradtional. timeline collapses at this pointbut not 
<br>
before.  2)The Powers find it more efficent to compact the immediately 
<br>
surrounding material, ie the Earth, and continue to make developments on 
<br>
compactification, ad infinitum, finding it more efficent to contract 
<br>
endlessly rather than colonize the universe as thought today, not leaving a 
<br>
mark on its previously surrounding environment/universe.  3) Maybe the 
<br>
Singularity State is the &quot;state of Nirvana&quot; for all universes/timelines which 
<br>
have sufficent quantum-wave-function-collapsing consciousnesses as 
<br>
constituents but not yet enough optimal organization to join the &quot;bulk&quot; of 
<br>
Reality or the Multiverse in the Singularity State...I suspect there are an 
<br>
enormous amount of &quot;potential universes&quot; which have no life and therefore no 
<br>
&quot;real&quot; existence on one pole, and on the other the 
<br>
Infinite-dimensional/complexity/growth Singularity State, with the universes 
<br>
with imperfect life hovering in between on an uneasy balance (a race could 
<br>
easily commit suicide with grey goo and reach the Void State rather than the 
<br>
Singularity State at the last minute).  The Two Great Attractors, fighting 
<br>
for universes between them...perhaps the complexity of the information 
<br>
processing within the universes isn't intense enough to reach a conclusion to 
<br>
the battle, or to break out to other universes, and neither state has the 
<br>
ability to absorb the universe due to the simple fact that ALL possibilities 
<br>
exist in the Many-Worlds interpretation of Quantum Theory...and maybe this 
<br>
state is the most likely one for individual, intelligent beings.  
<br>
<p>I hope that didn't sound like a bunch of gibberish or mysticism or 
<br>
anything...
