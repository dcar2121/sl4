<p>This is interesting stuff...  wasn't aware of it.  Thx!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How are you going to

</em><br>
<p>Hmm, well, that's not my experience --- in either academia or the private
<br>
sector.  (I recently got some really interesting filesystem usage data from a
<br>
Microsoft Research effort, for example of the latter.)  But that's likely an
<br>
industry / culture thing,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; About this aspect of the sociology of the research community, I'm afraid you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Easy there, hoss --- different experiences lead reasonably to different
<br>
conclusions.  And btw, while we're being naive:  let's assume that you *can*
<br>
extract such useful information from summaries.  Why do you believe that this
<br>
won't just cause pharma, etc. to clam up and not reveal *any* information?
<br>
I.e., even if the technology is feasible, to the extent that it's available it
<br>
will just trigger additional competitive concerns and restrict open publication
<br>
further.
<br>
<p>(There's a completely different discussion we can have about the economics of
<br>
&quot;soft property&quot; and whether any sustainable business model can be built on
<br>
secrecy.  But another time...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I still believe that information extraction from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NL text will be an important part of the toolkit too.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt.  My concern isn't that this isn't important, it's that having it as a
<br>
sole --- or even primary, ahead of the other things --- focus is less useful at
<br>
best, dangerous at worst.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Check out

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</a>
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, yeah.  We'll see how widely used it becomes.  (I've become rather cynical
<br>
about standardization and commercial interests since some rather bad IETF
<br>
interactions re: event notification / instant messaging a few years back.
<br>
Notice that MS Messenger, ICQ, and AIM aren't all fully / continuously
<br>
interoperable, even now?  Notice how the lock-in helps the vendors on a
<br>
competitive basis?  Same thing for any standard, unf.  And for things --- like
<br>
online communities, and like information about genes and protein expression ---
<br>
where there are &quot;network value chains&quot; this effect is even more pronounced.)
