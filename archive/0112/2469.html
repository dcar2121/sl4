<p><p>OK, so it's &quot;psychoanalyze Eli&quot; time is it?  What could be more exciting,
<br>
and more relevant to the future of AI and the universe?  ;)
<br>
<p>I would propose that our friend Eliezer has a strong personal desire to be
<br>
useful and helpful, on a grand scale.  (I won't go so far as to call it a
<br>
&quot;savior complex&quot; ;).  I would propose that this desire is biasing (in a +
<br>
direction) his estimate of the probability that it's possible for *any*
<br>
human being to be useful and helpful in terms of the Singularity and
<br>
associated events.
<br>
<p>But, the thing is, our probability estimates as regarding such things are
<br>
*inevitably* pretty damn shaky anyway, and hence very highly susceptible to
<br>
bias....  Where do you draw the line between bias and intuition?
<br>
<p>Where there is very little data, we have to use sentiment to guide our
<br>
intuitions.  There's not enough data to proceed by pure conscious reason.
<br>
<p>[By the way, in my view, &quot;sentiment&quot; may be analyzed as &quot;a lot of little
<br>
tiny unconfident reasoning steps merged together, many of them analogies
<br>
based on personal experience&quot;.  so you can say it's a kind of reason, but
<br>
it's different than &quot;conscious reason&quot;, which is based on a smaller number
<br>
of reasoning steps, most of which are fairly confident, and each of which
<br>
can be scrutinized extensively.]
<br>
<p>Hmmm... the relation of sentiment and reason in nonhuman or transhuman
<br>
minds... a more interesting topic than Eliezer's psyche, perhaps???
