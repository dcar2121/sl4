In the puppet show the puppets have no personal identity or free will, they
<br>
are effectivly an extension of the puppeteer. The immorality starts when you
<br>
exchange the puppets/sprites/scripts/animations for self aware minds, if the
<br>
simulated minds are in fact *real* minds rather then the puppeteer
<br>
roleplaying then they would be entitled to the same rights as any other self
<br>
aware mind.
<br>
Most people would not object to a puppet show. Many people would and do
<br>
object to tormenting animals purely for entertainment. And nearly everyone
<br>
objects to slavery.

Subject: Ancestral simulations and happy puppeteers
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer claims:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  A Friendly SI outcome does not allow for nonconsensual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  simulations, and most ancestral simulations would presumably fall into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  that category.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it difficult to believe that nonconsensual simulations should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be allowed, ever ever ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose Bob is a puppeteer, known for his masterful manipulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wooden marionettes representing human characters. In one sad skit we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a character to whom very unfortunate things happen, and we see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its expressions of suffering. Bob feels *happy* doing this dramatical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production. He himself does not feel the character's pain (except in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the metaphorical sense). If all we saw was the puppet we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that its suffering is nonconsensual. Is Bob's action immoral?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And of course, you see where this is going. Suppose we have six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion happy puppeteers controlling six billion &quot;suffering&quot; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puppets in a simulation, including some who have the line &quot;I hope I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in a simulation; if I were, I'd want out of it now!&quot; (Don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nominate this drama for a Pulitzer.) Is this immoral?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The possible resolutions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.) What Bob does is immoral and should not be allowed. I truly fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for our freedom if a Friendly AI decides that a street puppeteer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pedestrian can't even put on a innocuous tragic puppet show (or, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that matter, that nobody can perform Shakespeare).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.) What Bob does is okay, but the six billion isn't allowed. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many happy puppeteers would have to get together before their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorrowful simulation isn't allowed? On what rational basis could a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI pick such a number without it being somewhat arbitrary?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no such basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.) What Bob does is okay, and what six billion puppeteers do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (generally) okay.  Then I think one of the following would be true:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    3a.) All simulations of civilizations, including ancestral ones, are
</em><br>
okay, or
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    3b.) There might be something special about ancestral simulations, as
</em><br>
opposed
<br>
<em>&gt;    a simulation of a civilization that never historically existed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    To do a true ancestral simulation would require getting information
</em><br>
that is
<br>
<em>&gt;    (as far as physics knows right now) irretrievably lost to history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    remains impossible forever, in which case it is a moot point, or if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    post-Singularity we discover some physics that allows this information
</em><br>
to be
<br>
<em>&gt;    retrieved, the very act of retrieving it might involve doing something
</em><br>
else
<br>
<em>&gt;    that is definitely immoral. But note that the immorality would then lie
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt;    that (currently unknown) &quot;something else&quot;, and not in the act of doing
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt;    simulation.
</em><br>
