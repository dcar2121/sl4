As far as I can tell you're using &quot;real&quot; in a dual role as
<br>
&quot;applied&quot; and &quot;not-fake.&quot;  For example, you contrast it with
<br>
theoretical AI research, saying, &quot;[theoretical AI] doesn't
<br>
involve technical details regarding actually realizing
<br>
artificially intelligent software,&quot; and later say, &quot;over time,
<br>
AI has drifted from its original focus on the creation of
<br>
real, general artificial intelligence,&quot; implying both uses.
<br>
The latter use, which was my first interpretation, is unlikely
<br>
to win you any &quot;fake&quot; AI researchers as friends.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>Yes, I know the term has a bit of an &quot;edge&quot; to it, and I admit that this
<br>
&quot;edge&quot; matches my sometimes confrontational personality ;)
<br>
<p>By the way, I do in fact have several personal friends among the ranks of
<br>
traditional AI researchers.  However, even
<br>
though they're my friends, they don't necessarily agree with my research
<br>
ideas....
<br>
I think that the contents of my research are going to inevitably be
<br>
disagreeable
<br>
to traditional AI researchers, regardless of what label is attached to it...
<br>
<p><p>***
<br>
Is it really necessary to coin a new phrase at all?  The books
<br>
subtitled could probably be used alone and the focus of the
<br>
introduction could be changed.  Framing a general, applied
<br>
approach as an entirely different field (in contrast to
<br>
specific and theoretical approaches) seems like a rather
<br>
dubious endeavour to begin with; couldn't you simply introduce
<br>
the field of AI and then elaborate on the problems current
<br>
approaches have in integrating into a more general framework?
<br>
***
<br>
<p>I guess this is becoming a large theoretical argument, not an argument about
<br>
the
<br>
appropriateness of the phrase &quot;Real AI.&quot;
<br>
<p>I genuinely believe that the AI field has digressed way too far from its
<br>
initial
<br>
focus on general intelligence.  There are some more mainstream AI
<br>
researchers, e.g.
<br>
Marvin Minsky, who have made similar comments, so this is not entirely an
<br>
idiosyncratic
<br>
maverick notion.
<br>
<p>Whether &quot;real AI&quot; is a different field than mainstream AI is, to me, just an
<br>
exercise in
<br>
wordplay.  It's either a different field or a subfield substantially
<br>
distinct from the field.
<br>
Call it what you want, it still is what it is.
<br>
<p>Anyway, the book I'm editing definitely reflects my own point of view.  I
<br>
don't mind that
<br>
your view is different from mine, but I'm not going to rewrite my book to
<br>
reflect your view.
<br>
I encourage you to write or edit your own book presenting your own
<br>
perspective.
