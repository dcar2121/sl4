</em><br>
<p>Hold on, there, pardner:  I'm not claiming that only one thing can change in
<br>
reality over time, rather that it's prudent to introduce only one variable at
<br>
time and follow the implications of that introduction as far as they will
<br>
logically go.  This is true in science, and it's true in the (better) examples
<br>
of science fiction --- though if the goal is entertaining the credulous, then
<br>
go for it, change all the variables all at once, and we have a name for that
<br>
stuff:  &quot;fantasy.&quot;  :-)
<br>
<p>In your examples:  if you've already discovered inefficient motors, then the
<br>
highway's a reasonable extrapolation given a motor-driven ground transporation
<br>
assumption.  If the assumption is efficient motors, then perhaps the heavier
<br>
than air flying craft follows.  Wireless telegraphy is a reasonable
<br>
extrapolation if you've already discovered radio.  The point is that you can
<br>
extrapolate from the things you *know* as far as you can go;  however one leap
<br>
of faith relative to best-current-knowledge is all that's plausible.
<br>
Extrapolation:  free reign.  Pure invention:  one per scenario.
<br>
<p>BTW, it was Frank Herbert that told me that &quot;rule&quot; of the form when I met him
<br>
shortly before his death.  (I don't know if he came up with that rule, but he's
<br>
the one I heard it from.)  In his books, the spice and its potential effects on
<br>
spacetime are the one novelty, and almost everything interesting in his
<br>
universe flows (ahem ;-) is extrapolated from that novelty.  Everything else is
<br>
just an extrapolation from things we're already familiar with --- even the
<br>
sandworms (whales) and even the transformation of Leto into a hybrid creature
<br>
(symbiosis abounds in reality.) **
<br>
<p>jb
<br>
<p>** though actually, I haven't thought about this for years, but he was blowing
<br>
smoke at me:  Herbert broke his own rule.  Laseguns were a reasonable
<br>
extrapolation, but shields were an incredible novelty even though they were by
<br>
the time he wrote the books a relatively standard sci-fi fixture.
