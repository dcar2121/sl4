<p>Aaahh...  what comes around, goes around.  Having recently been
<br>
through this one on FoRK, let me try to give you the summary.  You're
<br>
asking a deep epistemological question.  Let's take it backwards:
<br>
you can't prove that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, *nor do you
<br>
&quot;know&quot; it will happen.*  You *believe* that it will happen with a
<br>
high degree of probability simply based on precedent, but belief and
<br>
knowledge aren't the same thing.  &quot;True&quot; and &quot;most likely true given
<br>
precedent&quot; aren't the same thing.  &quot;Faith&quot; is a misunderstanding of
<br>
the difference at best, at worst a blind belief in certain things
<br>
being &quot;true&quot; when there's no evidence to support such belief, or even
<br>
evidence to the contrary of such belief.
<br>
<p>Ask yourself this:  how can you know for certain that any given thing
<br>
is true?  What level of &quot;probably true&quot; is sufficient basis for you
<br>
to act on in various contexts?
