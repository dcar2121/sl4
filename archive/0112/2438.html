<p>
Clearly I've got some issues with the rather fuzzy definition of Friendliness
<br>
that's been offered, and the differences between the more rigorous definitions
<br>
and the use of that term in practice in some of the communiques around these
<br>
parts.  Let me offer up a strawman definition that I think is, perhaps, more
<br>
rigorous and useful.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;Friendly&quot; SI is one which strives to ensure an optimum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution of its constituents across a &quot;satisfaction landscape.&quot;
<br>
<p>Okay, so what does that mean?  First, constituents:  the constituents for any
<br>
Friendly SI are any other intelligences (self-aware, self-interested, active
<br>
things) which exist and act within the SI's sphere of influence, i.e.
<br>
temporal-spacial range of activity.
<br>
<p>Satisfaction landscape:  assume all constituents have uniquely-defined
<br>
self-interests, and these self-interests may conflict with with the
<br>
self-interests of other constituents in various ways.  The satisfaction
<br>
landscape may be visualized as a three dimensional volume.  The proximity of
<br>
two individuals within the XY plane relates to the probability that their
<br>
self-interests may overlap, conflict, interfere, or otherwise negatively
<br>
effect each other.  The distance along the Z dimension relates to how closely
<br>
achieved, observable reality relates to the idealized, desired reality for any
<br>
given individual.
<br>
<p>Optimum distibution:  an optimum distribution across the satisfaction
<br>
landscape is that one which results in the highest average &quot;height&quot; (placement
<br>
along Z of individuals) throughout the model.  Additional considerations:
<br>
given two allocations across the landscape with identical average height
<br>
values, the preferred allocation is the one for which the average slope
<br>
relative to the XY plane between points in the landscape is minimized, i.e.
<br>
it's the &quot;smoothest.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, that's just a strawman.  The latter definition approximates Pareto
<br>
optimality, but like many questionable social systems (e.g. socialism) it
<br>
strives for equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity.  I'm not
<br>
sure that's the best option.
<br>
<p>I'd like to see a similar --- perhaps even more rigorous --- &quot;official&quot;
<br>
definition of the expectations we have for a Friendly SI.  Eli, Brian?
