</em><br>
<p>True, but...
<br>
<p>There is also a big difference between saying &quot;long-term predictions made from current
<br>
scientific understanding *may* be inaccurate&quot; and &quot;long-term predictions made from
<br>
current scientific understanding *must* be inaccurate.&quot;  What you are stating is much
<br>
closer to the latter than I am comfortable admitting, and again I will claim that
<br>
those kinds of comments are most often heard from people that are either ignorant of a
<br>
given field or predisposed to be antagonistic to the logical conclusions of a
<br>
particular field.  Given that you're neither, Eli, then I am rather surprised to hear
<br>
you make arguments like this.
<br>
<p>The science of cosmological eschatology is *much* more firmly grounded in real,
<br>
quantifiable, testable laws with a mass of available data and a track record of
<br>
prediction --- and an equal track record of gradual refinement rather than revolution
<br>
--- than, say, the relatively new art of predicting where technological progress may
<br>
lead.
<br>
<p>Ahem. ;-)
<br>
<p>Having said that, Dyson's a great person to look to for many of these issues.  The
<br>
link earlier is a good place to start.  BTW, I didn't point it out, but the answer to
<br>
the question of why Dyson's attempt to avoid the heat death conclusion is inaccurate
<br>
in the face of new information is actually *found* in his paper as a note:  most
<br>
current models predict proton decay.  This is consistent with some of the
<br>
information-theoretic implications of 2LT.  (To conclude with a nice bit of symmetry.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any attempt to establish &quot;ultimate physical limits on technology&quot; is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case in point.  Do you really think that an attempt to argue an ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical limit - as a reality, and not just as one model's interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolation - should be treated under the same rules as a disproof of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploded flat-Earth theory?  Disproving creationism or flat-Earth does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require that our current model be absolutely complete and that it stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all time, merely that we take into account the overwhelming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preponderance of negative evidence against a *disproven* theory.
</em><br>
<p>I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to explain to you why this scenario
<br>
you've just sketched out is broken, so I'm going to bail on the attempt.  I think
<br>
we're butting up against an incomplete understanding of some fundamental
<br>
epistemological constraints, here.  Suffice to say:  no, I do not believe that such
<br>
things are subject to the same rules of disproof.  On the other hand, this does NOT
<br>
speak to the unknowability of ultimate physical limits, technological or otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Establishing a physical limit is the hardest kind of result to establish,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since anything we don't know about could represent a possible loophole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Considering the rate at which this trick has failed in times past, one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in insisting that a given &quot;physical limit&quot; remain firm for, oh,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least a couple of centuries, before being accepted as anything other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an interim approximation.
</em><br>
<p>So here's what's wrong with this argument:  just as technology has been accelerating
<br>
non-linearly (perhaps asymptotically) over history, so has scientific understanding
<br>
(the accuracy of our models for making predictions at longer terms and finer levels of
<br>
&quot;resolution&quot;) been accelerating similarly.  (Indeed, the latter has driven the
<br>
former.)  So over time, our ability to use scientific models as predictive mechanisms
<br>
has improved, yielding longer and longer-term detailed predictions with higher and
<br>
higher accuracy.  At the same time, the &quot;churn&quot; in implications has been slowing
<br>
inversely --- i.e., the emphasis has shifted from the &quot;what&quot; to the &quot;how&quot; and even the
<br>
&quot;how come?&quot;  This isn't just an opinion, it's an observation about the nature and
<br>
history of scientific (rational) thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The historical record of &quot;technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossibilities&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Note we aren't talking about &quot;technological impossibilities,&quot; rather logical and
<br>
physical constraints.  Apples and oranges.  &quot;The world market for computers is around
<br>
five,&quot; &quot;we will never put a man on the moon,&quot; etc. are all dumb statements.  OTOH,
<br>
things like QED aren't about impossibilities, they are probabilistic models for actual
<br>
physical events.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; dying off almost as fast as religious text can't be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an argument for the latest crackpot theory of perpetual motion, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does mean that we should limit the confidence level of statements about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *all possible* future technologies.
</em><br>
<p>Modulo accepted physical and mathematical constraints that form the most essential
<br>
underpinnings of our most accurate theories:  things like c, the Beckenstein Bound,
<br>
2LT, Godel's theorem, the Halting Problem, Chaitin's incompleteness theorems, etc.
<br>
While I place a high probability on at least one of those being incorrect, there's
<br>
good reason to believe that the probability of all of them being incorrect is
<br>
approaching zero.
<br>
<p>To the extent that your world-view requires you to blissfully ignore the implications
<br>
of such things, you should recognize it as the former:  a psuedo-religious expression
<br>
of faith used to support belief in highly speculative hypotheses.  I want to believe
<br>
in Friendliness, Eli --- indeed I do believe that superhuman AI is an inevitability,
<br>
and I'd like for it to be benign.  But honestly, your arguments are inspiring less
<br>
confidence rather than more. :-(
<br>
<p>Hoping for a better tomorrow.
