<p>I can hardly believe this discussion is being had.  It's quite simple:  
<br>
there are two kinds of faith.  On one hand, there is 'faith', which 
<br>
means you think that something will happen based on what you know yet 
<br>
there is no conclusive proof that it will happen.  Then there is 
<br>
'Faith', a belief that something is true, regardless of the facts (or 
<br>
through the twisting of the facts).  This latter kind is the bad kind.
<br>
<p>Examples are simple enough.  I have faith that the Singularity is coming 
<br>
based on my current knowledge.  If it doesn't happen, though, it doesn't 
<br>
mean I was wrong, just that I mis interpreted the facts.  If I say I 
<br>
have Faith that the sun was spit out by a dragon, I have ignored or 
<br>
twisted the facts to get the result I want (i.e. rationalization has 
<br>
taken place).
<br>
<p>Of course, what is 'faith' and 'Faith' changes with time.  At one time, 
<br>
I would consider it safe to have said that 'the Universe was created by 
<br>
God' on a matter of faith, because the limited evidence available could 
<br>
have pointed in that direction.  Of course, today I consider this a 
<br>
matter of 'Faith', although I won't deny that it is entirely possible 
<br>
that something could be going on that there is no evidence of.  There 
<br>
could be some kind of supernatural stuff in the universe, but until it 
<br>
provides some proof of existing, then it effectively doesn't and there's 
<br>
no reason to go on thinking that it does exist since any such thinking 
<br>
will be total guesses in the dark.
<br>
<p>Of course, not everyone likes my use of capitalization, but those are 
<br>
the breaks.  If you have a better idea of how to distinguish these two 
<br>
subtly but importantly different ideas that use the same word, please 
<br>
let me know.
