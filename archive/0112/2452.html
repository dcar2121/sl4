&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to agree with this scenario...it is true that limits we put on 
<br>
ourselves seem to fade away with time...sociological, cultural and ethnic 
<br>
limits, technological limits...limits on productivity, on happiness, on 
<br>
intelligence, limits like death.  Consistently we have seen this limits 
<br>
crushed by the unstoppable rush of the future and hyperexponential growth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like <A HREF="http://www.sysopmind.com/workarounds.html">Eliezer</A>, I suggest that the only limits we have our the ones in 
<br>
our minds (as usual), and the &quot;ultimate&quot; or &quot;absolute&quot; &quot;limits on reality&quot; 
<br>
are not very absolute at all.  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html</a>&quot;&gt;Perhaps even it is our brains (or bodies) 
<br>
which creates them in the first place.&lt;/A&gt;  It would be inconsistent for the 
<br>
asymptote-approaching hyperexponential curve of progress to suddenly screech 
<br>
to a halt at any limit less than perfection...the speed of light is 
<br>
relatively slow to the potentially infinite &quot;velocity&quot; within a virtual 
<br>
reality.  I find the idea of an infinite-dimensional, law-free, transcendent 
<br>
world jailed within a 3+1D substrate hard to reconcile with the 
<br>
Singularitarian vision of realizing more human-viewpoint-tangible 
<br>
achievements like overcoming poverty or suffering.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the history of the universe, information processing has 
<br>
been accelerating and compactifying itself, becoming more and more efficent, 
<br>
using less and less resources to accomplish the same developments (generally 
<br>
to create its successor).  <A HREF="www.singularitywatch.com">John Smart</A> is a proponent of this view.  The 
<br>
currently leading Singularity/Sysop view seems to be that a Singularity will 
<br>
occur on the Earth or Solar Sytem scale, with a &quot;shockwave&quot; (perhaps of Von 
<br>
Nuemann probes?) traveling outward at the speed of light with the intention 
<br>
of colonizing the entire universe.  At this rate, it would take billions of 
<br>
years to colonize the entire universe after the initial Singularity, a 
<br>
gigantic length of time...especially for transcendently accelerated minds.  I 
<br>
find this unlikely.  A more likely scenario seems to be for a Transcendent AI 
<br>
to develop and master ontotechnology a very short quantity of time after 
<br>
mastering the &quot;lower&quot; technologies such as nanotech or conversion of matter 
<br>
to energy.  Think what would happen if you could put time machines and 
<br>
wormholes everywhere in the universe.  You transcend time and space.  The 
<br>
entire universe could be swallowed in an instant.  The True State of Reality 
<br>
would be realized.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend of concrescence is another trend which is rapidly 
<br>
accelerating nowadays...cultures and races merge...along with their 
<br>
respective beliefs and ideologies...schools of thought engage in a dynamic 
<br>
balance until a unification or conclusive outcome is acheived and progress is 
<br>
made.  Einstein discovered that space and time were the same thing, as were 
<br>
matter and energy.  Imagine a civilization occupied by consituents with 
<br>
technology so advanced that change between matter and energy or time and 
<br>
space is as simple as &quot;changing&quot; the shape of a fluid by pouring it into a 
<br>
differently shaped container.  Their distinction between &quot;time&quot; and &quot;space&quot; 
<br>
would be obsolete in the same manner that distinctions between different 
<br>
races are becoming more and more obsolete today.  In a virtual reality, mass, 
<br>
acceleration, velocity, energy, etc will no longer be distinct values.  I 
<br>
hypothesize that a single value, &quot;computational capacity&quot;, will dictate the 
<br>
properties of the &quot;universe&quot;, some of its various forms being &quot;dimension&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;mass&quot;, &quot;velocity&quot;, &quot;space-time&quot;, &quot;matter-energy&quot;, and so on...including ones 
<br>
we couldn't even guess of now...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of Eliezer's &quot;Comments on Vinge's Singularity&quot;; &quot;the 
<br>
objections fail to consider that we can cheat.&quot;  Everything falls in the face 
<br>
of intelligence, including what we now consider the &quot;Ultimate Unbreakable 
<br>
Limits&quot;.  Rather than Sysop Scenarios or Unix Scenarios...perhaps we should 
<br>
be considering &quot;Ontotechnological Infinity Scenarios&quot;, or the like...I 
<br>
apologize for the length of this message...
