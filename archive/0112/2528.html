Well, of course human communication in formal languages could only be
<br>
suggested (by me) as a joke....  Yes, of course, ambiguity allows very
<br>
compact communication within a group where there is ample tacit
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>As for the semantic web, I think it's a fine idea, but I think that, when it
<br>
finally
<br>
takes off, the semantic
<br>
markup is going to mainly be inserted by (initially primitive) AI's, not by
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>AI's that are costly to operate can read a Web page once and insert semantic
<br>
markups.
<br>
<p>Then, much dumber and cheaper computer programs can interpret the semantic
<br>
markups for
<br>
the reader... doing a little contextual thinking...
<br>
<p>For instance, an AI reading a commercial website can automatically create a
<br>
semantic
<br>
database of price information.  A dumber shopping bot can then consult this
<br>
semantic
<br>
database, telling the user if the prices on a given product are sufficiently
<br>
cheap for his
<br>
budget or not.
<br>
<p>This way, the semantic web can work.  But I agree, it's not likely to work
<br>
if it requires
<br>
humans to enter a lot of knowledge in formal languages.
<br>
<p>I have supervised a number of educated humans entering knowledge in a formal
<br>
language
<br>
(KNOW, a form of higher-order probabilistic term logic used to feed
<br>
knowledge into Webmind
<br>
sometimes), and I'm well aware of how hard this is even for very smart, very
<br>
motivated
<br>
people...
