<em>&gt; Lets say that you decide that to do that by spreading as quickly as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. As time passes the chance of any particular possible disaster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurring rises, so your chance of survival drops. But as the space/mass
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; race between increasing risk and decreasing vulnerability.
</em><br>
<p>Precisely my point --- *and* it's not just a question of spread, it's also a
<br>
question of architecture (how much of that mass is necessary to constitute &quot;you,&quot;
<br>
how much can you lose to local disaster without effecting your goals, etc.) and
<br>
substrate (i.e., dark matter reduces certain risks, may create others that we are
<br>
not aware of yet.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it a foregone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion that risk will win out in the long run? It seems that you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to last as long as the universe can support your mass and energy needs.
</em><br>
<p>So the final risk --- the one that is ultimately certain in an open universe --- is
<br>
that 2LT wins out and the universe cannot sustain the necessary energy needs.  So
<br>
eventually, you're done for under a certain set of assumptions.  But IMO, if you
<br>
*get* to that point, past all the other risks, that's a substantial thing.
<br>
<p>One way to avoid the heat death might be the creation of a steady-state (i.e.
<br>
&quot;flat,&quot; neither open or closed --- or oscillating controllably between those
<br>
states) pocket universe that could then be closed off from the regular one.  You
<br>
still have an issue with 2LT, but it's not clear what frame of reference 2LT refers
<br>
to in all cases --- there's a lot still to understand about the relationship
<br>
between entropy and the fine structure of spacetime.  Assuming you're doing
<br>
engineering *with* the structure of spacetime itself, you might be able to
<br>
manipulate such things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, is there necessarily a significant difference between personal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'species' survival? (if your backups are distributed enough any calamity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that destroyed all of them would necessarily destroy the whole species).
</em><br>
<p>Probably not an important distinction overall, though it probably comes up in the
<br>
context of individual &quot;moral&quot; decisions a Sysop might have to make.  E.g., say a
<br>
particular constituent was facing sure and undesirable annihilation, and the only
<br>
way the Sysop could save them was to &quot;sacrifice&quot; some other constituent, all other
<br>
constituents, or even itself.  In that case, the difference must be considered.
<br>
Overall, assuming Friendliness, the perpetuation of the Sysop is good for
<br>
everybody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Im not sure if there is really a point here or not.
</em><br>
<p>It's all worth considering.  :-)
