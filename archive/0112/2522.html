Faith... is not the idea that &quot;some things should not be rationally questioned&quot;, but if you have faith in something I would say it is more like knowing something is true or will happen although you don't have all the proof it wil. For example : the sun will rise next morning. You know it will happen, but you can't prove it or can you?

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: RE: The inevitability of death, or the death of inevitability?
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;About &quot;faith&quot; and whether Eli's gotta have it or not... (I really love these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;endless threads dissecting Eliezer's psychology.  We haven't gotten onto his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;potty training yet for some reason; I guess there's a paucity of Freudians
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on the list...)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I partly agree with Samantha here, actually.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But only partly!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as Hume observed back when I was in diapers, the problem of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;induction is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unsolvable.  *Purely* rational inference about the universe is not possible.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even highly-refined probabilistic inference engines like your own brain have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to make some a priori assumption about the background probability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(to cast Hume in Bayesian terms).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Call it faith, call it intuition, or call it Caledonia Mahogany's Elbows,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;there's something in addition rational calculation going on when we make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;judgments, particularly in such data-poor domains as the end-state of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the cosmos!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Eli's point that our physical models of the universe are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;very unstable and not to be taken that seriously in the &quot;big picture.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the problem of induction show itself rather clearly in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The time series of physical models of the universe is really not very long,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;there's a lot of faith/intuition/assumption in extrapolating it *or* even in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;estimating its variance as Eliezer is implicitly doing...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT -- I guess the problem with the word &quot;faith&quot;, Samantha, is that it often
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;goes along
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the idea that *some things should not be rationally questioned.*  If
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;faith in life after death, you should not even consider rational arguments
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;against
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the same as the kind of a-rational intuition that must underly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;assumption of background probability distributions.  The mind must make some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;underlying, biased assumptions in order to reason; but it can be flexible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;about what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;these assumptions are.  &quot;Faith&quot; implies a forced lack of flexibility in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;regard,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which is surely NOT optimal in terms of maximizing cognitive power (though
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;well be optimal as a mechanism of spreading a certain assumption throughout
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;society).
