<p>(1) Human beings (as example &quot;intelligent&quot; beings) are great at justifying
<br>
nonconsensual / coercive expression of will over other intelligent beings.
<br>
<p>(2)  You might want to be aware that there are a large number of software &quot;toys&quot;
<br>
today which have just exactly that purpose --- simulating &quot;life&quot; in various
<br>
environments.  Do you really think that we'll stop being amused by these at some
<br>
point, just because the quality of the simulation advances to the point that the
<br>
simulated beings are self-aware?
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this is right, I'm just saying let's not be naive about human beings.
<br>
<p>;-)

<p>What a question.  What do you mean by morality?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The possible resolutions:

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but now you are letting your own subjective morality override Bob's expression
<br>
of free will.  Is that moral?  Is it *ever* moral for party A to interfere with the
<br>
actions of another party B, when B's actions have no impact on party A?  Isn't that
<br>
just moral &quot;busybody-ness?&quot;

<p>I fear for our freedom if we cede control of the physical world to any Power,
