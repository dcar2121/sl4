<p>It's not an assumption. It's an hypothesis, the rejection of which is in as 
<br>
much in need of an argument as its affirmation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As far as we know right
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Science tells us that it will be possible to build computers that are 
<br>
powerful to run lots of ancestor-simulations. My paper explores the 
<br>
consequences of this finding.
<br>
<p>BTW, I've noticed that people tend to forget that the conclusion of the 
<br>
paper the denial of a trisjunction and they lop of two of the possibilities 
<br>
and arbitrarily focus on one of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would put this discussion in the same category
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the hypothesis that God created the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;5 minutes ago with all our memories just right
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That hypothesis should be assigned a very low prior probability. By 
<br>
contrast, it is by accepting what we see around us that we are led to the 
<br>
conclusion of my paper. Totally different category!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In either hypothesis, there is no evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can show the hypothesis true or false, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't make any difference to how we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;act in the future.
</em><br>
<p>What are your grounds for saying it makes no difference? I would think any 
<br>
information about what the plausible future possibilities are would be 
<br>
potentially useful. It may even have many subtle consequences for how we 
<br>
should act on today, some of which I allude to in the paper, some other of 
<br>
which Robin Hanson explores in his follow-up paper.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that your basically indicating that you don't like to think 
<br>
about this issues, which is fine, but don't mistake it for an argument. I 
<br>
would immodestly think that the paper makes more difference to how we 
<br>
should act in the future on important issues than &gt;99.9% of all papers that 
<br>
are published in reputable journals. Also, remember that we are gathering 
<br>
pieces of a puzzle. One piece in isolation may not give us much guidance, 
<br>
but when combined with other theoretical breakthroughs that may be made, it 
<br>
could turn out to be a critical piece of information. We've got to learn to 
<br>
love every piece of partial insight that we can get.
