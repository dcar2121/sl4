<p>[yawn]  Hey, did everyone forget the intelligent flame rule?  These are

putting me to sleep (albeit it was a bit exciting to actually see the

<br>
<p>While I'm on a matter of list behavior, will you folks out there PLEASE 
<br>
stop quoting the whole message when you reply unless it's actually 
<br>
relevant.  If you want to reply to the whole thing, just quote a couple 
<br>
of lines so we'll all know which message it's in reply to.  Also, HTML 
<br>
e-mail is an annoyance above all others.  The message is twice the real 
<br>
length is hard to read because everyone but me seems to think that 9pt 
<br>
[pick a Sans-Serif font] is a good font-face for e-mail messages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C'mon, man, this whole discussion deserves better than that.  The

</em><br>
<p>You seem to be shooting yourself in the foot here.  It looks to me like 
<br>
Eliezer took the priors (your rather silly comment and a knowledge of 
<br>
them (I've even made them in the short period I refer to as my Youth (it 
<br>
comes after the time I was in Sponge mode and before my current Adult 
<br>
mode (and before my future Post mode)) so I concur on the validity of 
<br>
the prior)) and drew an appropriate conclusion.
<br>
<p>Now, last time I checked there was a reason that I don't subscribe to 
<br>
that anti entropy list.
