<p>One thing I forgot to point out before was that it should be possible to 
<br>
write simulants who cannot think about the possibility that we live in a 
<br>
Simulation.  Sort of like the whole thing in /The Matrix/, which is 
<br>
poorly explained, but it's clear that no one can be told what the Matrix 
<br>
is because it is impossible inside the Matrix, or at least for someone 
<br>
still plugged into the Matrix to think about.  True, in /The Matrix/ 
<br>
it's less plausible given the specifics, but it's still an okay allusion 
<br>
to make.
<br>
<p>The counter argument is that simulants won't work if they are prevented 
<br>
from thinking about something (either they won't be accurate or they'll 
<br>
fall apart).  Well, as /The Matrix/ looked at, this does sometimes 
<br>
happen, but most people never bother to even think about their meta 
<br>
state more than casually, if at all.  Thus, assuming there were problems 
<br>
with this proposal, only a few would be lost who went crazy upon being 
<br>
sucked into the hole in their minds.
<br>
<p>The conclusion we get from this is that it is not likely than simulants 
<br>
can think about the possibility that they live in a simulation because, 
<br>
if they realize that they live in a simulation, it has shown to cause 
<br>
problems.  It is very possible that there have been no problems with 
<br>
this, as Nick suggests, thus this conclusion means nothing, but 
<br>
presuming that there *is* a problem with letting people know that, in 
<br>
fact, they live in a simulation run by some Powers in a post Singularity 
<br>
world, then that means we would have to conclude that we do not 
<br>
currently live in a simulation, else we wouldn't be able to have this 
<br>
conversation.
<br>
<p>One final counter argument is that if the simulants cannot think about 
<br>
living in a simulation, the simulation will not be accurate because the 
<br>
original world contained such discussions.  There's no getting around 
<br>
this one.  If the simulation is to see what happens when simulants find 
<br>
out the truth about their reality, we're all pretty much screwed 
<br>
already, so we might as well enjoy the rest of the ride until society 
<br>
falls apart or the simulators decide that nothing bad happens and turn 
<br>
us off.
<br>
<p>In short, if people know they live in a simulation causes problems, this 
<br>
is not a simulation because we wouldn't be able to think about it, 
<br>
because thinking about it would ruin the simulation.
