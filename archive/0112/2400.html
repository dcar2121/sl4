</em><br>
<p>No wonder.  ;-)  You're right, that was about as clear as mud --- had a couple of
<br>
glasses of Shiraz with dinner last night and apparently there was some problem between
<br>
brain and fingertips.  ;-)  Let me try again.  There's about three strands entagled
<br>
there, two not really directly on topic.  What I'm getting at is this:  most
<br>
conceivable paths through the singularity do *not* result in egalitarian Friendliness,
<br>
but rather result in shrieks followed, perhaps, by periods of tyrannical control of the
<br>
non-ascended locals by those or the one who ascends.
<br>
<p>Eli's strict definition of Friendliness seems to disfavor simulation;  Nick's stats
<br>
seem to favor the idea that we're currently in a simulation;  if that is the case ---
<br>
if we are likely in a simulation --- then it is likely that our simulators are not
<br>
Friendly but rather something else.  Perhaps this speaks to the very viability of the
<br>
concept of Friendliness, in the canonical Eli interpretation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see how one can use this argument to reason about the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of a simulating PSC as the outcome of a particular case.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability is one of the Bayesian priors; an unknown Bayesian prior, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Bayesian prior nonetheless.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good challenge;  I'm going to go jot down a quantification of this argument
<br>
and see if I can't get the stats to argue for me. ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also don't understand why you say that Friendly AI &quot;is&quot; a simulation,
</em><br>
<p>The Friendly Sysop needs to do exactly the same kind of modeling, etc. that a pure
<br>
simulation would do in order to fulfill its protective role;  its internal model at
<br>
time T must be a predictive model of what will happen in the external world at T+1 in
<br>
order to take whatever proactive behavior is necessary to prevent e.g. unwanted harm,
<br>
death, etc.  The analogy is complicated a bit because this simulation is &quot;convolved&quot;
<br>
with physical reality, but the Sysop's internal state is indeed a highly detailed and
<br>
comprehensive simulation of the physical environment, and that simulation molds
<br>
activity in the physical world.  This differs from the &quot;model&quot; maintained by e.g. a
<br>
human individual, as our instantaneous model need only cover our own immediate locale
<br>
in any degree of detail;  the Sysop, on the other hand, must maintain a similarly
<br>
comprehensive model of *every* locale a protected human must be in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; why you say that Friendly SI is a singleton scenario that supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation (I should think it would exclude it completely),
</em><br>
<p>Supports in the sense that any technology that enables Friendliness is likely
<br>
sufficient to do pure anscestor or other civilization simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or why you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the majority of singleton outcomes are non-Friendly.
</em><br>
<p>Simply because they are.  You yourself have previously described a number of paths
<br>
through Singularity that result in non-Friendliness, as have many others.  I'm not
<br>
speaking directly of likelihood, rather of the number of Friendly outcomes of
<br>
Singularity (i.e., 1) as a fraction of all possible outcomes of Singularity (unknown
<br>
but &gt; 1.)  If there is even 1 possible outcome other than Friendliness, then
<br>
Friendliness does not represent a majority of all possible outcomes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; None of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are required by Bostrom's argument.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, that's true.
