<p>Okay, here's how I make the difference:
<br>
<p>A SIMULATION involves creating new minds who are defined as being self 
<br>
aware and independent minds.
<br>
<p>A COMPUTATION would a simulation where the minds involved weren't 
<br>
independent or even really self aware, but function based on an 
<br>
algorithm very much like that in a mind.  Just as we can model simple 
<br>
life forms (e.g. ants), we will all look like little ants to Powers.
<br>
<p>The difference is important because, just like the artificial ants, the 
<br>
artificial humans won't be real in that they won't have been programmed 
<br>
as full minds, but to respond *like* they are full minds.  Maybe a way 
<br>
to think of it is that the fake humans needed for a computation are not 
<br>
generally intelligent, but rather a facsimile of how humans react with a 
<br>
Power behind them to insert a little real intelligence now and then when 
<br>
needed.  Classical AI grown up, maybe, and the possibility of 
<br>
intervention every now and again?
<br>
<p>Also, going back to your initial note, even if the problem can't be 
<br>
reduced, it should be possible to run a very large computation without 
<br>
having to go into simulations.  It's really a question of how many 
<br>
resources some SIs are willing to put into figuring out how some humans 
<br>
acted or might have acted.  Unless, of course, you're assuming that 
<br>
there is some inherent difference between algorithms that respond like 
<br>
humans and actual human mind algorithms.
