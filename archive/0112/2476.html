</em><br>
<p>ELI DROPS THE BALL #1:
<br>
<p>Some are, some aren't.  Consider the implications of the cosmological constant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alcubierre warp is &quot;some likelihood&quot; of (non)violation.  So is Van Den
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Broeck warp.  So are wormholes, and Tipler cylinders.  The point is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these specific methods are likely to be workable, but rather that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that modern-day physicists can even attempt to produce this plethora
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of workarounds should demonstrate that the character of the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves may not be so absolutely mathematically inviolable as commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought; or at least such inviolability is not as obvious as commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.
</em><br>
<p>And again, there's a big difference between phenomenological and epistemological / mathematical
<br>
laws.  As we dive down into the fine structure of spacetime, we find that the phenomenological and
<br>
the epistemological blur.  (HUP, for example.)  This is why I'm much more willing to believe that
<br>
things which work at a very large scale (e.g., GR) or in a complex fashion are much more likely to
<br>
have specific phenomenological loopholes -wrt- their implications than things which work at a very
<br>
fine scale or in a very simple fashion.  Most physicists I know have no qualms at all talking
<br>
about how much more credibility they place in predictions from the Standard Model than in
<br>
predictions from GR, for instance.
<br>
<p>ELI DROPS THE BALL #2:
<br>
<p>I'm not saying you are incorrect about any of your assertions, just that it's sloppy to assume (as
<br>
you have above) that the availability of some speculative loopholes in some (classes of)
<br>
currently- accepted physical laws implies there will similarly significant loopholes in all
<br>
(classes of) currently- accepted physical laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't trust human conceptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;logic&quot; because past experience has shown that the universe often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defies our intuitive conception of logic.
</em><br>
<p>ELI DROPS THE BALL #3:
<br>
<p>(Modulo your trust in your own conceptions, of course.)  Well, I think that about wraps things
<br>
up;  if the results of our best efforts to use mathematical (logical) reasoning to discuss various
<br>
issues cannot be trusted simply because human conceptions of &quot;logic&quot; are invalid, then we're
<br>
done.  I'll proceed to parse through the rest of this and bat away objections, but Eli --- you
<br>
just shot yourself in the foot -wrt- ever again having a &quot;rational&quot; conversation with a skeptic.
<br>
:-(  And I'm not even a skeptic, I'm a believer playing devil's advocate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Shades of &quot;Jupiter's moons are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not visible to the naked eye, and therefore can have no influence on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth, and therefore would be useless, and therefore do not exist&quot;, as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotelians said to Galileo.
</em><br>
<p>This is a complete red herring.  It isn't even loosely analogous to anything I've said.
<br>
<p>BTW, Aristotle lived around the mid-300s BC;  Galileo's life spanned the 16th and 17th centuries.
<br>
While some of his opponents may have studied Aristotle, I doubt that many would have identified
<br>
themselves as &quot;Aristotelians.&quot;  His opponents were Church officials (in particular, Inquisitors)
<br>
and the point of view they subscribed to which Galileo ran afoul of was known as &quot;Ptolemaic&quot;
<br>
cosmology, not Aristotlean.  But that's all splitting hairs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A monotonically improving model of *what*?
</em><br>
<p>Observed behavior.  That is, the Standard Model and other ancillary but mostly-consistent models
<br>
generate predictions that can be (and) compared with experimental observations.  Scientific Method
<br>
101.  The net result of this is a monotonically-increasing predictive ability from physical law,
<br>
and the accuracy of predictions in some areas is increasing at a much higher rate than accuracy of
<br>
predictions in other areas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that my own sentience
</em><br>
<p>There's an assumption.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is a product of the laws of physics, and was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product of the laws of physics long before humanity ever started coughing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up physicists, I don't need to be a Platonist to assert the existence of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics that predates humanity.
</em><br>
<p>But you do have to be a Platonist to assert a *laws* of physics that predate humanity.  Physics
<br>
itself is behavior, interaction, relations.  Any one model may be better or worse than some other
<br>
model;  our job as scientists is to produce and refine models that over time generate predictions
<br>
about the things that happen so that we may &quot;understand&quot; the universe.  This process, however,
<br>
does not in any way &quot;reify&quot; our &quot;laws&quot; of physics.  And only a physicist who's an admitted
<br>
Platonist will tell you otherwise.  ;-)
<br>
<p>BTW, to your corresponding earlier accusation that I'm a Platonist:  feh!  I don't believe that
<br>
&quot;The Truth is Out There,&quot; as you seem to;  I believe that &quot;The Truth is In There.&quot;  Let's get our
<br>
philosophical history straight:  to the extent that you are a Platonist or harbor Platonist memes,
<br>
I am to a similar level an Epicurean.  :-)  And this kind of argument is appropriate --- indeed
<br>
traditional --- between Platonists and Epicureans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The sun shone for billions of years before we discovered fusion, or so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current evidence indicates; I don't believe that this evidence was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retrospectively invented by the universe to cover its tracks when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered fusion.  And even if the evidence was retrospectively invented,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would be still higher laws, governing the rules by which universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were brought into correspondence with explanations.
</em><br>
<p>Yawn, again we're off in red herring land.  Nothing I have said was intended to or should (on
<br>
critical examination) imply that I subscribe to any of the ridiculous points of view that Eli is
<br>
ascribing to me here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But the only arguments you've given for long-term probability of disproof are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; methodologically inconsistent with the arguments you've bought into elsewhere to weight the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability of Singularity, as illustrated above!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if you think that &quot;Moore's Law is likely to continue for the next ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years&quot; should be analogized to &quot;no effective workaround to the second law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thermodynamics will be discovered over the next ten billion years&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>ELI DROPS THE BALL #4:
<br>
<p>You're having a scaling problem.  You have to consider Moore's Law relative to the history of
<br>
human existance, then consider the observable implications of 2LT relative to the current age of
<br>
the universe.  And BTW, I'm not speaking of Moore's Law in its strict form, I believe that in
<br>
order to justify prediction of Singularity you must, as Kurzweil does, look for a Moore's Law-like
<br>
principle operating throughout the age of humanity.  Point being, normalize your scales.  Point
<br>
noted for the future, when arguing with Eli be sure to be explicit about appropriate scaling
<br>
considerations.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yep, 180-degree opposition here... when I look at C, I hear the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking, and it says:  &quot;There is no such thing as simultaneity; the speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of light isn't just a speed limit, it's built into the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality.&quot;  When I look at the second law of thermodynamics, I see an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergent statistical phenomenon, an effect of the laws of physics, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a structuring cause of the laws of physics.  Perhaps I am wrong.
</em><br>
<p>And perhaps I am wrong.  I'm not an opponent of GR --- I think it's a great theory at appropriate
<br>
scales --- I just think it's much more likely to have loopholes than &quot;bottom-up&quot; theories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless you have a physics degree you've been concealing, and I'm pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure you would have mentioned it by now, both of us are simply listing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which laws of physics we like and dislike based on their character...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather a silly activity, really.
</em><br>
<p>ELI DROPS THE BALL #5, #6, #7:
<br>
<p>Now really, Eli.  You of all people should know that it doesn't take a degree to make significant
<br>
advances in a field --- which we are certainly not doing here ;-) --- or even fruitfully discuss a
<br>
topic intelligenty.  I *REALLY* don't think you want to make *that* argument on pain of hypocrisy.
<br>
<p>Second, this is another good example of failed reasoning.  You assume --- perhaps because
<br>
introspection reveals that this is true of you --- that we are both selecting and listing laws
<br>
base on some preferential subjective criteria.  Your selection criteria need not be mine.  I.e.
<br>
<p>&quot;Jeff doesn't have a physics degree&quot; --&gt; both of us are simply listing favorite laws
<br>
<p>doesn't make sense on many dimensions.  Why should my degree or lack thereof effect the process by
<br>
which *you* are engaging in this discussion?  Why should it impact *my* criteria?  Is the
<br>
implication that only a degreed person can have selection criteria other than an apparently
<br>
baseless emotional &quot;like&quot; or &quot;dislike?&quot;  Etc. etc. etc.  Muddy thinking, wrapped up with a pat
<br>
value judgement intended to devalue the whole endeavor:  &quot;rather a silly activity, really.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Here's a gedankenexperiment.  If we were to decide between the two following scenarios,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which would we choose:  a Friendly SI and successors that or capable of carrying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entirety of pre-Singularity humanity for the next 10^20 years in idyllic bliss but unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; escape some eventual catastrophe (due to resource allocations on achieving individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfaction vs. other considerations which ensure longevity and security) or a Friendly SI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and successors that are capable of eventually building a post-Human society that experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subjective infinite time, at the cost of some (perhaps large) amount of involuntary pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering, or termination for some (perhaps large) portion of immediately pre-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humanity?  I don't know which is preferable, and I have no bias one way or the other ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though I think the conversation is definitely worth having.  ?  I indeed believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choices we make now can impact such things;  the &quot;moral&quot; bias we provide to the first AIs is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very likely to determine which outcomes are possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's a decision predicated on the truth of physical law, then what a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI requires is the ability to make the correct decision based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth as known to it at that time.
</em><br>
<p>ELI DROPS THE BALL #8:
<br>
<p>But herein lies the handwaving.  That's tautological.  &quot;What's needed for the Friendly to make the
<br>
correct decision is the ability to make the correct decision based on what is known at the time.&quot;
<br>
Well tell me something I didn't know, Plato, that isn't specific to &quot;Friendly&quot; *or* &quot;artificial&quot;
<br>
intelligence.  And here's the problem:  &quot;The Friendly can only make the decision based on what is
<br>
known at the time, and as I have asserted it's foolhardy to speculate about cosmological
<br>
eschatology at this time since we are obviously too stupid to have any durable models of the
<br>
universe that are likely to be accurate enough at that time-distance to inform present
<br>
decisions.&quot;  Implication:  it's therefore very unlikely that the Friendly can make a correct
<br>
decision.  Yet we *might* (p &gt; 0) be forcing the issue by some definition of Friendly or other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you argue that our current model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics will affect how we now make moral decisions that establish basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values (supergoals) which are then not dependent on physics, a Friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with causal validity semantics would probably re-model the moral decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would have made at this point as if we had had accurate knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics.
</em><br>
<p>Explain the implications of the latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm not accusing you of that.  I'm merely pointing out that it's very hard for humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accurately assess their priors and reason about things in a manner divorced from sentiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, it's very hard.  But you have provided no evidence supporting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion that I am guilty of this flaw in any of the specific cases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question;
</em><br>
<p>Well, okay then.  After the first pass through this, I went back through the message and found
<br>
some representative examples of broken reasoning process, numbers 1-8 above.  It's true that most
<br>
of them appear to be simple mistakes in reasoning rather than issues with priors or sentiment.
<br>
However, I know you to be someone who values and strives for rigor, and therefore I conclude that
<br>
it's likely that the issue isn't an inability to be rigorous but an impact on this ability due to
<br>
sentiment or emotional attachment to certain priors, clouding the ability to build a rigorous
<br>
argument in those contexts.  Let's review the specific instances:
<br>
<p>[1]  Overly aggressive inductive argument, trivially invalidated by counterexample.
<br>
[2]  Quantifier problem, invalid deduction.
<br>
[3]  Eli throws logic out the window, rendering &quot;rational discourse&quot; untenable.
<br>
[4]  Scaling problem.
<br>
[5]  Probable hypocrisy.
<br>
[6]  Invalid deduction.
<br>
[7]  Unsupportable induction.
<br>
[8]  Tautological argument.
<br>
<p>And by the way, I have NO DOUBT that you could find EVEN MORE of these by dissecting one of my own
<br>
messages.  That's not the point.  ;-)  ALL of us make similar mistakes all the time, and probably
<br>
at a much higher frequency than you do.  But given that the entire future history of human-
<br>
originated intelligence *potentially* hangs in the balance -wrt- the validity of your reasoning
<br>
-wrt- the choices you make in creating &quot;Friendliness,&quot; I'd say we all have a vested interest in
<br>
that validity.  :-)  &quot;Twice as good&quot; isn't good enough if better than that is possible, and *any*
<br>
tendency to discard, ignore, or wish away considerations from the best reasoning tools we have
<br>
(i.e., formal logic, etc.) is something of a concern.  (If you read that last sentence carefully,
<br>
you'll note the sincere compliment:  I assume that significantly better than twice as good as
<br>
average is possible and accessible to you.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is an ad hominem.  Just not an arbitrarily chosen, one-size-fits-all ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hominem.  The phenomenon I'm referring to is the one where somebody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says... &quot;Hm... he thinks Y, which I don't like... he must believe this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he's an X.  And if he's an X, he must also believe silly ideas A,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B, and C.  Boy, ABC sure are silly!  That sure confirms he's an X!  What a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silly guy!&quot;  Meanwhile, I'm standing in some totally other corner of state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, metaphorically waving my arms and shouting:  &quot;I'm over here!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think you just described the phenomonology of your interaction with me, not the other way
<br>
around, pardner.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Asked for evidence for any of your assertions about flaws in my thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you point not to things I have said, but to things you think I might say,
</em><br>
<p>This statement wasn't true before, and it's not true now:  see above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; generally with some statement along the lines of &quot;You've said Y, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose is logical, but Y is only a short distance from X, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unacceptable...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Apparently you don't believe in inductive logic in particular, and are suspicious of logical and
<br>
formal reasoning in general?  That can't be true;  as I've pointed out above, you've used
<br>
inductive reasoning in your own discourse, and sometimes poorly.
<br>
<p>I'll go back to lurk mode for a while:  while apparently the wampeter is open to such discussion,
<br>
it apparently makes the rest of the natives nasty and restless.
