<p>Faith may be a word that has fallen into disrepute in some
<br>
camps.  However, if I did not have &quot;faith&quot; that X (SI,
<br>
singularity, immortality) was possible I wouldn't spend any time
<br>
at all working towards actually producing such.  In short, some
<br>
questions are not effectively tackled by armchair cogitations. 
<br>
They can only be resolved, to the extent they are resolvable, by
<br>
taking a working hypotheses and proceeding to check whether it
<br>
is or can be made real. 
<br>
<p>We know so very little about what &quot;the universe&quot; is and includes
<br>
that it is extremely hubristic to claim that the universe simply
<br>
does not allow X or that there is no way for anything that was
<br>
part of the universe to survive the &quot;death&quot; of said universe or
<br>
certain types of transformation thereof.
