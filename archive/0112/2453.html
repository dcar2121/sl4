Are you proposing that there ARE no absolute limits on reality? Or just 
<br>
suggesting that all the limits we define now will turn out to be false? 
<br>
Yes, we may be able to cheat our way around some 'laws', but even the 
<br>
cheats would have rules. Prehaps I'm missing something in what your saying?

<em>&gt; even it is our brains (or bodies) which creates them in the first

</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperexponential curve of progress to suddenly screech to a halt at any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit less than perfection...the speed of light is relatively slow to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially infinite &quot;velocity&quot; within a virtual reality.  I find the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of an infinite-dimensional, law-free, transcendent world jailed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a 3+1D substrate hard to reconcile with the Singularitarian vision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of realizing more human-viewpoint-tangible achievements like overcoming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty or suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Throughout the history of the universe, information processing has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been accelerating and compactifying itself, becoming more and more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficent, using less and less resources to accomplish the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developments (generally to create its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successor).  &lt;www.singularitywatch.htm&gt;John Smart is a proponent of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view.  The currently leading Singularity/Sysop view seems to be that a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity will occur on the Earth or Solar Sytem scale, with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;shockwave&quot; (perhaps of Von Nuemann probes?) traveling outward at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed of light with the intention of colonizing the entire universe.  At 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this rate, it would take billions of years to colonize the entire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe after the initial Singularity, a gigantic length of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time...especially for transcendently accelerated minds.  I find this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely.  A more likely scenario seems to be for a Transcendent AI to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop and master ontotechnology a very short quantity of t! ime after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mastering the &quot;lower&quot; technologies such as nanotech or conversion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter to energy.  Think what would happen if you could put time machines 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wormholes everywhere in the universe.  You transcend time and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space.  The entire universe could be swallowed in an instant.  The True 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State of Reality would be realized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The trend of concrescence is another trend which is rapidly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating nowadays...cultures and races merge...along with their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respective beliefs and ideologies...schools of thought engage in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic balance until a unification or conclusive outcome is acheived and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress is made.  Einstein discovered that space and time were the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, as were matter and energy.  Imagine a civilization occupied by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consituents with technology so advanced that change between matter and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy or time and space is as simple as &quot;changing&quot; the shape of a fluid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by pouring it into a differently shaped container.  Their distinction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between &quot;time&quot; and &quot;space&quot; would be obsolete in the same manner that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinctions between different races are becoming more and more obsolete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.  In a virtual reality, mass, acceleration, velocity, energy, etc 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will no longer be distinct values.  I hypothesize that a single value, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;computational c! apacity&quot;, will dictate the properties of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;universe&quot;, some of its various forms being &quot;dimension&quot;, &quot;mass&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;velocity&quot;, &quot;space-time&quot;, &quot;matter-energy&quot;, and so on...including ones we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't even guess of now...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        In the spirit of Eliezer's &quot;Comments on Vinge's Singularity&quot;; &quot;the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objections fail to consider that we can cheat.&quot;  Everything falls in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face of intelligence, including what we now consider the &quot;Ultimate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unbreakable Limits&quot;.  Rather than Sysop Scenarios or Unix 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scenarios...perhaps we should be considering &quot;Ontotechnological Infinity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scenarios&quot;, or the like...I apologize for the length of this message...
