<p>Ah, but here's where you get to have your cake and eat it, too.  Those 
<br>
wonderful simulations (I'm not talking about historical simulations or 
<br>
anything like that) can be used to trick a mind into getting what it 
<br>
wants.  Can't act out your fantasy in the real world because it steps on 
<br>
toes, then just do it in a simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; we should remember that the model the prediction

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yawn.  That's a very anti-scientific argument, Eli --- indeed one I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious folks (like the Creationist crowd) use to undermine the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments from a scientific bias.  Let's keep in mind that the model 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine-grained
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to verify
</em><br>
<p>I agree with Eliezer on this one.  The Fundies are interested in seeing 
<br>
physics work in a totally different way than it does, because their 
<br>
arguments don't work unless things change at a very basic level.  The 
<br>
the point here is that physics changes, but it doesn't really.  Our 
<br>
models change and the laws of physics *may* change with time, but all in 
<br>
all every day physics is still the same, just we don't know about it.  
<br>
There's nothing wrong with that; just the way it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Well... this is something I happen to disagree with, because personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the second law of thermodynamics strikes me as being statistical in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nature, and often rather fragile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go read up on it --- it's probably the best law we've got, and has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very, very deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications for the most essential workings of spacetime.  Yes, it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yes, there are issues with scope (i.e., clearly life violates 2LT 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a very local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale, but then the law doesn't talk about those scales.)  But it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still got some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazing properties relative to many other &quot;fundamental&quot; physical laws.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this isn't very SL4, but you're both right.  The 2nd Law is 
<br>
fragile, in the sense that it only applies in full effect in closed 
<br>
systems.  So long as the system is open, entropy is still in effect but 
<br>
energy doesn't (necessarily) run out.  Of course, entropy is always, 
<br>
always, always in effect (or at least as far as we know).  But, that's 
<br>
enough schooling for today.  ;-)
