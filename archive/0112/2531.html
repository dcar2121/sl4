<p>My apologies, I've apparently been trying to make my point a bit too subtly.
<br>
IMO, the process you describe --- using *any* tools to turn unstructured data
<br>
into structured data --- is dangerous and counterproductive.  Ontologies are
<br>
inherently brittle, static things, and require lots of care and feeding.  Using
<br>
expensive tools to turn unstructure into structure *today* just leads to more
<br>
noise and cost tomorrow.  I don't dispute that this can and will happen ---
<br>
indeed, *is* happening.  My point is it isn't a good thing, even temporarily.
<br>
<p>Consider:  over 90% of the lifetime cost of storing data isn't in the storage
<br>
media / hardware, it's in the operational and support --- i.e., information
<br>
management --- costs.  And the interesting (and counterintuitive) thing is that
<br>
structured data has *much* higher lifetime TCO than unstructured data.
<br>
Unfortunately, we're going to spend a whole lot of effort to create additional
<br>
(and brittle) structured (and metastructured) information that will ultimately
<br>
be &quot;noise.&quot;  I wish all that effort --- and all the &quot;cheaper, dumber tools&quot;
<br>
effort to extract value from that dubious process --- was instead spent on other
<br>
more useful things like:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sinope.nl/en/sinope/">http://www.sinope.nl/en/sinope/</a>
<br>
<p>Good, useful tools for dealing with unstructured data needn't be costly.  :-)
