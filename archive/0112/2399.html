<p>
Eliezer claims:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A Friendly SI outcome does not allow for nonconsensual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  simulations, and most ancestral simulations would presumably fall into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that category.
</em><br>
<p>I find it difficult to believe that nonconsensual simulations should 
<br>
not be allowed, ever ever ever.
<br>
<p>Suppose Bob is a puppeteer, known for his masterful manipulation of 
<br>
wooden marionettes representing human characters. In one sad skit we 
<br>
see a character to whom very unfortunate things happen, and we see 
<br>
its expressions of suffering. Bob feels *happy* doing this dramatical 
<br>
production. He himself does not feel the character's pain (except in 
<br>
the metaphorical sense). If all we saw was the puppet we would 
<br>
conclude that its suffering is nonconsensual. Is Bob's action immoral?
<br>
<p>And of course, you see where this is going. Suppose we have six 
<br>
billion happy puppeteers controlling six billion &quot;suffering&quot; human 
<br>
puppets in a simulation, including some who have the line &quot;I hope I'm 
<br>
not in a simulation; if I were, I'd want out of it now!&quot; (Don't 
<br>
nominate this drama for a Pulitzer.) Is this immoral?
<br>
<p>The possible resolutions:
<br>
<p>1.) What Bob does is immoral and should not be allowed. I truly fear 
<br>
for our freedom if a Friendly AI decides that a street puppeteer 
<br>
Pedestrian can't even put on a innocuous tragic puppet show (or, for 
<br>
that matter, that nobody can perform Shakespeare).
<br>
<p>2.) What Bob does is okay, but the six billion isn't allowed. How 
<br>
many happy puppeteers would have to get together before their 
<br>
sorrowful simulation isn't allowed? On what rational basis could a 
<br>
Friendly AI pick such a number without it being somewhat arbitrary? 
<br>
There is no such basis.
<br>
<p>3.) What Bob does is okay, and what six billion puppeteers do is 
<br>
(generally) okay.  Then I think one of the following would be true:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3a.) All simulations of civilizations, including ancestral ones, are okay, or
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3b.) There might be something special about ancestral simulations, as opposed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a simulation of a civilization that never historically existed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do a true ancestral simulation would require getting information that is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(as far as physics knows right now) irretrievably lost to history. 
<br>
Either this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remains impossible forever, in which case it is a moot point, or if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post-Singularity we discover some physics that allows this information to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retrieved, the very act of retrieving it might involve doing something else
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is definitely immoral. But note that the immorality would then lie in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that (currently unknown) &quot;something else&quot;, and not in the act of doing a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulation.
