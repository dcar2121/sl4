<em>&gt;      &quot;science moves forward, therefore our extrapolation of the next

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question isn't one of whether it changes;  we agree that it does.  The question is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *much* it changes, i.e. the accuracy of predictions from current understanding vs. later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that ultimate physical limits are very sensitive to the
<br>
eighteenth decimal place.  Apples didn't stop falling when Newton
<br>
discovered gravity, and planets didn't stop orbiting when Einstein
<br>
discovered General Relativity, but in both cases our conception of the
<br>
ultimate physical limits changed drastically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This observation, I rather like.  The problem, as my humorous post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggests, is workarounds where the physicists stand around innocently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying &quot;Violation?  What violation?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but until you demonstrate at least *some* likelihood of some non/violation, you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just argue from your gut that such are possible.  At least, not if we're having a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Alcubierre warp is &quot;some likelihood&quot; of (non)violation.  So is Van Den
<br>
Broeck warp.  So are wormholes, and Tipler cylinders.  The point is not
<br>
that these specific methods are likely to be workable, but rather that the
<br>
fact that modern-day physicists can even attempt to produce this plethora
<br>
of workarounds should demonstrate that the character of the laws
<br>
themselves may not be so absolutely mathematically inviolable as commonly
<br>
thought; or at least such inviolability is not as obvious as commonly
<br>
thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted.  And hence, I'm less inclined to believe such &quot;laws&quot; that are phenomenological ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the inviolability of c --- vs. things that are more abstract in both their construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their application, such as Godel's, 2LT, etc.  The latter transcend their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenological formalizations and speak of deep, formal, mathematical, epistemological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns.  As such, they are accessible to the tools of mathematics, logic, and reason ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and experiments related to them can be conducted in the mind, mostly independent of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given technological constraints or capabilities.  Advancing technology may increase the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accuracy of our predictions using such tools, but it is unlikely to overthrow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental concepts and relations.
</em><br>
<p>Aha, now I see the conflict!  You are a Platonist!  I trust C because C is
<br>
the universe's belief about causality.  I don't trust human conceptions
<br>
about &quot;logic&quot; because past experience has shown that the universe often
<br>
defies our intuitive conception of logic.  Shades of &quot;Jupiter's moons are
<br>
not visible to the naked eye, and therefore can have no influence on the
<br>
earth, and therefore would be useless, and therefore do not exist&quot;, as the
<br>
Aristotelians said to Galileo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; For that matter, something which appears possible under our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laws of physics could turn out to be impossible under the real laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physics!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aha, now I see the conflict!  You are a Platonist!  ;-)  What, exactly, pray tell, are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;real&quot; laws of physics?  Where are they kept? ;-)  Remember:  the &quot;laws of physics&quot; as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand them now, and as we will ever understand them at any given time, are only an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantaneous snapshot of a monotonically improving model.
</em><br>
<p>A monotonically improving model of *what*?
<br>
<p>Given that my own sentience is a product of the laws of physics, and was a
<br>
product of the laws of physics long before humanity ever started coughing
<br>
up physicists, I don't need to be a Platonist to assert the existence of a
<br>
physics that predates humanity.  Real effects are the product only of real
<br>
causes.
<br>
<p>The sun shone for billions of years before we discovered fusion, or so the
<br>
current evidence indicates; I don't believe that this evidence was
<br>
retrospectively invented by the universe to cover its tracks when we
<br>
discovered fusion.  And even if the evidence was retrospectively invented,
<br>
there would be still higher laws, governing the rules by which universes
<br>
were brought into correspondence with explanations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the only arguments you've given for long-term probability of disproof are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methodologically inconsistent with the arguments you've bought into elsewhere to weight the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of Singularity, as illustrated above!
</em><br>
<p>Only if you think that &quot;Moore's Law is likely to continue for the next ten
<br>
years&quot; should be analogized to &quot;no effective workaround to the second law
<br>
of thermodynamics will be discovered over the next ten billion years&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If, leaving workarounds aside, I had to pick one of these rules as *most*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely to survive, I'd pick c - it seems to be built into the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; causality in our universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, that's the one I'd rate as least likely to survive.  2LT is *much* more intimitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in causality --- &quot;c+1 only violates causality&quot; only holds true if many other things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold true, while &quot;systems tend from order to disorder&quot; (pardon the simplification) *by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself* explains one of the most puzzling assymetries in physics (&quot;The Arrow of Time&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without introducing an observer bias.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, 180-degree opposition here... when I look at C, I hear the universe
<br>
speaking, and it says:  &quot;There is no such thing as simultaneity; the speed
<br>
of light isn't just a speed limit, it's built into the nature of
<br>
causality.&quot;  When I look at the second law of thermodynamics, I see an
<br>
emergent statistical phenomenon, an effect of the laws of physics, and not
<br>
a structuring cause of the laws of physics.  Perhaps I am wrong.  But
<br>
unless you have a physics degree you've been concealing, and I'm pretty
<br>
sure you would have mentioned it by now, both of us are simply listing
<br>
which laws of physics we like and dislike based on their character...
<br>
rather a silly activity, really.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's a gedankenexperiment.  If we were to decide between the two following scenarios,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would we choose:  a Friendly SI and successors that or capable of carrying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirety of pre-Singularity humanity for the next 10^20 years in idyllic bliss but unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape some eventual catastrophe (due to resource allocations on achieving individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction vs. other considerations which ensure longevity and security) or a Friendly SI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and successors that are capable of eventually building a post-Human society that experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective infinite time, at the cost of some (perhaps large) amount of involuntary pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering, or termination for some (perhaps large) portion of immediately pre-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity?  I don't know which is preferable, and I have no bias one way or the other ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I think the conversation is definitely worth having.  ?  I indeed believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices we make now can impact such things;  the &quot;moral&quot; bias we provide to the first AIs is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very likely to determine which outcomes are possible.
</em><br>
<p>If it's a decision predicated on the truth of physical law, then what a
<br>
Friendly AI requires is the ability to make the correct decision based on
<br>
the truth as known to it at that time.  If it's a decision not predicated
<br>
on the truth of physical law, then this conversation is entirely
<br>
irrelevant to Friendly AI.  Even if you argue that our current model of
<br>
physics will affect how we now make moral decisions that establish basic
<br>
values (supergoals) which are then not dependent on physics, a Friendly AI
<br>
with causal validity semantics would probably re-model the moral decision
<br>
we would have made at this point as if we had had accurate knowledge of
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not accusing you of that.  I'm merely pointing out that it's very hard for humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurately assess their priors and reason about things in a manner divorced from sentiment.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, it's very hard.  But you have provided no evidence supporting the
<br>
assertion that I am guilty of this flaw in any of the specific cases in
<br>
question; *first* you must establish this, *then* you may sigh over the
<br>
fallibility of humans in general and me in particular.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, my sole crime is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that I attach a 20% probability to irrelevant-but-fun hypotheses to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you would rather grant a 90% probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ???  Which ones?
</em><br>
<p>The eternal (not just temporary, for-us-at-the-moment) endurance of the
<br>
second law of thermodynamics, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, well, I have some experience with the bizarre matrix of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-reinforcing misinterpretations that usually results in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statement.  You don't appear to be an advanced case, and hopefully can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extracted from whatever corner you're currently wedging yourself into.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And how exactly is that not an ad hominem?  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>It is an ad hominem.  Just not an arbitrarily chosen, one-size-fits-all ad
<br>
hominem.  The phenomenon I'm referring to is the one where somebody
<br>
says... &quot;Hm... he thinks Y, which I don't like... he must believe this
<br>
because he's an X.  And if he's an X, he must also believe silly ideas A,
<br>
B, and C.  Boy, ABC sure are silly!  That sure confirms he's an X!  What a
<br>
silly guy!&quot;  Meanwhile, I'm standing in some totally other corner of state
<br>
space, metaphorically waving my arms and shouting:  &quot;I'm over here!&quot;
<br>
<p>Asked for evidence for any of your assertions about flaws in my thinking,
<br>
you point not to things I have said, but to things you think I might say,
<br>
generally with some statement along the lines of &quot;You've said Y, which I
<br>
suppose is logical, but Y is only a short distance from X, which is
<br>
unacceptable...&quot;
