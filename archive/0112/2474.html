<em>&gt; &gt; OK, so it's &quot;psychoanalyze Eli&quot; time is it?  What could be more
</em><br>
exciting,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more relevant to the future of AI and the universe?  ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our annual imports and exports of dental floss?  No, just kidding.  I'm a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteer; I have no right to complain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would propose that our friend Eliezer has a strong personal desire to
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful and helpful, on a grand scale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this is bad... because of why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's true that up to, say, age fourteen or so, I had an emotional desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be helpful on a grand scale; this was later rationalized (that's in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of &quot;made normative&quot;, not &quot;irrationally justified&quot;) into a desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish the largest possible amount of good through my actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Practically the definition of a goal system, really.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to accomplish as much good as possible with my life.  The grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale happens to be available, so I go for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In emotional terms, you might phrase the transition as follows, from:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I want to do a huge amount of good&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I have the capability to do a huge amount of good, so of course I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do it; who wouldn't?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (I won't go so far as to call it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;savior complex&quot; ;).  I would propose that this desire is biasing (in a
</em><br>
+
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; direction) his estimate of the probability that it's possible for *any*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human being to be useful and helpful in terms of the Singularity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; associated events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One should be aware that there are psychological forces pushing in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite direction as well.  There are psychological forces pushing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passivity and refusal of responsibility - if the Singularity is beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your ability to affect, you don't have to do anything about it.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social forces pushing toward modesty.  There is a prevailing memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment designed to provide consolation for insignificance instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation to attempt significance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The truth is that whatever we as humans may be, the last thing we are is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insignificant.  Humanity's entire future hinges on us, and this future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains an unimaginable number of sentient beings.  Simple division says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if the future contains at least six quintillion beings, then each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living human carries the responsibility for at least a billion lives.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral weight flowing through pre-Singularity Earth is so heavy that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't even begin to diminish when divided by a paltry number like six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can only assume that you are measuring 'usefulness' as a percentage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity, rather than weighing it in absolute terms.  Very well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no point in blowing our fuses by trying to measure all moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantities in units of trillions.  Nonetheless, I can still hardly be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused of irrationality for focusing on the Singularity as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But, the thing is, our probability estimates as regarding such things
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *inevitably* pretty damn shaky anyway, and hence very highly susceptible
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bias....  Where do you draw the line between bias and intuition?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In normative terms, the line is very definite.  If your desires influence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your conclusions, that's bias.  If not, that's intuition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The processes by which desires influence conclusions (in humans) is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invisible.  They have distinct mental 'feels'.  It's just that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings usually goes unrecognized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where there is very little data, we have to use sentiment to guide our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intuitions.  There's not enough data to proceed by pure conscious
</em><br>
reason.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's wrong with trying to remain calm and letting our intuitions run on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own rails?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [By the way, in my view, &quot;sentiment&quot; may be analyzed as &quot;a lot of little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tiny unconfident reasoning steps merged together, many of them analogies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; based on personal experience&quot;.  so you can say it's a kind of reason,
</em><br>
but
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's different than &quot;conscious reason&quot;, which is based on a smaller
</em><br>
number
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of reasoning steps, most of which are fairly confident, and each of
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can be scrutinized extensively.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I rarely have the experience of having an intuition, or any subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling, without being able to figure out where it comes from.  I guess I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically see intuition as an extension of rationality by other means.
