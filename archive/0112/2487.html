Thanks Eli,
<br>
<p>There are so few of us working on - or trying to work on - Real AI, that
<br>
right now we are more like Brothers in Arms struggling to do clear the way
<br>
for doing what see as the most important (and stimulating) work that we can
<br>
imagine.
<br>
<p>I've had am overwhelming response from just a few emails to emails and a few
<br>
lists.
<br>
<p>I have no problem in sharing the database of people who want to work on Real
<br>
AI with Eli and Ben. I'm always looking for effective ways of collaborating
<br>
with other Real AI projects. In fact, there have been explorative talks...
<br>
<p>Some day in the future we may become serious competitors to each other, but
<br>
right now the real opposition is lack of resources.
<br>
<p>Peter
<br>
<p>PS. I guess my ideal programmer description sounds much the same, except for
<br>
the non-profit part.

That probably should have gone to Peter, not the list... no, it's not a
<br>
joke.  There's no reason why the post shouldn't have gone to SL4.  This is
<br>
a list for all Singularityfolk - technically, it has nothing to do with
<br>
SIAI at all; it's just one person's mailing list.
<br>
<p>I'll admit that my first thought on seeing this was &quot;Darn, he got there
<br>
first&quot; - but on reflection, it isn't necessarily true that we're competing
<br>
for the same pool of programmers.  SIAI's ideal programmer description
<br>
sounds something like this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Are you such an incredibly good programmer that you already have
<br>
basically as much money as you need, but you don't feel ready to give up
<br>
programming?  Are you willing to work for a nonprofit at a small salary in
<br>
exchange for working on the coolest project in the entire history of
<br>
time?  We need you!  Or at least we'll need you once we have enough money
<br>
to hire a few people simultaneously, so you don't get stuck with an insane
<br>
amount of work.  But we're collecting names.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From our perspective, the hard part - or one of the hard parts - is
</em><br>
finding people like this who aren't already too settled down to move to
<br>
Atlanta.  People who have already passed through their programmatic
<br>
apotheosis do sometimes tend to put down roots.
