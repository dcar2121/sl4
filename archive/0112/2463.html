So some of these things beg for a calm yet detailed response, so here's my attempt at that.
<br>
Let me set the stage up front:  I'm not trying to pick a fight just because, nor cast
<br>
aspersions on you or your efforts, Eli;  indeed, I agree with you more often than not.  That
<br>
having been said...

<em>&gt; &gt; current scientific understanding *must* be inaccurate.&quot;  What you are stating is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; closer to the latter than I am comfortable admitting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh... why?  In what way is this not a total strawman argument?
</em><br>
<p>So I'm not sure what the &quot;why&quot; in your first question is referring to;  if it's the &quot;big
<br>
difference&quot; then surely you can reflect on it and conclude that the qualifiers are the big
<br>
difference in question.  If you are asking why I see there being a similarity between your
<br>
statement and the &quot;must&quot; formulation, let's revisit what you said:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;science moves forward, therefore our extrapolation of the next
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion millennia changes every fifty years&quot;.
<br>
<p>The question isn't one of whether it changes;  we agree that it does.  The question is how
<br>
*much* it changes, i.e. the accuracy of predictions from current understanding vs. later
<br>
understanding.  Your position seems to assume that because our models of certain distant
<br>
cosmological environments (e.g. the first three minutes, etc.)  has changed dramatically
<br>
over the last 50 years, it must therefore change in a qualitatively similar way over the
<br>
next 50 years.  However that ignores the very real, very observable Moore's Law-like
<br>
appreciation in both the quantity of predictive models and the accuracy of their
<br>
predictions.  (IMO, there's something very fundamental about Moore's Law --- it may be that
<br>
indeed it is a close relative to some as-yet unexpressed theory about the way knowledge
<br>
builds and accumulates, much like Turing's and Godel's are related.)
<br>
<p>Given the application of Moore's Law to the argument for the Singularity Hypothesis, then I
<br>
find it surprising that you don't see the inconsistency you are introducing here.  The
<br>
pattern of reasoning that leads from Moore's Law to Singularity is closely analogous to the
<br>
argument from &quot;exponential increase in number and accuracy of scientific models&quot; to an
<br>
asymptotic level of accuracy of such models.
<br>
<p>Regardless of that, it's clear that some of the things that are clear priors in the
<br>
formulation of your world-view are indeed *less* justified by observation, logical proof and
<br>
experimental verification than, say, the evidence to suggest that the cosmological constant
<br>
has a certain value, that 2LT holds over an infinite expanse of spacetime, etc.  Given that,
<br>
if you believe in your own conclusions, it seems preferential for you to discount other
<br>
conclusions drawn from even more empirical biases.  If you believe that Singularity can be
<br>
predicted from existing limited observations with some degree of accuracy, then you should
<br>
believe that cosmological eschatology can be discussed with a proportionally greater degree
<br>
of accuracy given the greater degree of verifiability (and verification) of its priors.
<br>
<p>To believe otherwise is inconsistent.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; and again I will claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those kinds of comments are most often heard from people that are either ignorant of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given field or predisposed to be antagonistic to the logical conclusions of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular field.  Given that you're neither, Eli, then I am rather surprised to hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you make arguments like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... and in what way is this not a total ad hominem?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it's not an ad hominem, it's a genuine expression of surprise.  The appeal isn't
<br>
to personal considerations, it's to logical consistency and rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So here's what's wrong with this argument:  just as technology has been accelerating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-linearly (perhaps asymptotically) over history, so has scientific understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (the accuracy of our models for making predictions at longer terms and finer levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;resolution&quot;) been accelerating similarly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This observation, I rather like.  The problem, as my humorous post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests, is workarounds where the physicists stand around innocently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;Violation?  What violation?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but until you demonstrate at least *some* likelihood of some non/violation, you can't
<br>
just argue from your gut that such are possible.  At least, not if we're having a rational
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Note we aren't talking about &quot;technological impossibilities,&quot; rather logical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical constraints.  Apples and oranges.  &quot;The world market for computers is around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; five,&quot; &quot;we will never put a man on the moon,&quot; etc. are all dumb statements.  OTOH,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things like QED aren't about impossibilities, they are probabilistic models for actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is &quot;physical constraints&quot; that turn out to be merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;technological impossibilities&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Granted.  And hence, I'm less inclined to believe such &quot;laws&quot; that are phenomenological ---
<br>
like the inviolability of c --- vs. things that are more abstract in both their construction
<br>
and their application, such as Godel's, 2LT, etc.  The latter transcend their
<br>
phenomenological formalizations and speak of deep, formal, mathematical, epistemological
<br>
concerns.  As such, they are accessible to the tools of mathematics, logic, and reason ---
<br>
and experiments related to them can be conducted in the mind, mostly independent of any
<br>
given technological constraints or capabilities.  Advancing technology may increase the
<br>
accuracy of our predictions using such tools, but it is unlikely to overthrow the
<br>
fundamental concepts and relations.
<br>
<p>Another way to look at this is:  very general predictions far off in the future are much
<br>
more likely to be more accurate than very specific ones.  (Lots of reasons for this, but it
<br>
seems hardwired into our universe.)  Given that, I'm much more inclined to give weight to
<br>
cosmological eschatological arguments than more phenomenological considerations such as the
<br>
probability of constructing closed timelike curves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For that matter, something which appears possible under our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws of physics could turn out to be impossible under the real laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics!
</em><br>
<p>Aha, now I see the conflict!  You are a Platonist!  ;-)  What, exactly, pray tell, are the
<br>
&quot;real&quot; laws of physics?  Where are they kept? ;-)  Remember:  the &quot;laws of physics&quot; as we
<br>
understand them now, and as we will ever understand them at any given time, are only an
<br>
instantaneous snapshot of a monotonically improving model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Humanity may have at least as many surprises in waiting as all those it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has already encountered... or even a far greater number of surprises.
</em><br>
<p>I would grant this statement a probability approaching unity:  either the above conjunction
<br>
is true, or it is true that humanity may have encountered most of the surprises it will ever
<br>
encounter. ;-)  Even a strong belief that we have yet to face the majority of surprise we
<br>
will ever face doesn't render the field of cosmological eschatology meaningless, nor does it
<br>
imply that we should not attempt to use the tools we have today to make predictions and use
<br>
those predictions to guide our current decision-making.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am reminded of the line in Zindell's novel &quot;Neverness&quot; which mentions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing that physicists pursued the trail of fundamental particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composing fundamental particles down through 200,000 layers before finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving up.  (And before you accuse me of whatever, I want to say that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally believe that quarks are it - the fundamental particles do keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting simpler, so I doubt the trail continues forever.)
</em><br>
<p>I think you're right --- there *is* a bottom.  Here's my current guess-nearly-hypothesis.
<br>
We know that spacetime is likely to be discrete, quantized.  I suspect that we're going to
<br>
find that just as space/time, matter/energy, and the various forces have each been or are
<br>
likely to be unified via the various contemporary theories, so are we likely to unify
<br>
space/time with matter/energy.  QG, the various strings and branes are very close to this
<br>
view already.    IMO, the quarks are mostly-persistent deformations in the spacetime
<br>
fabric.  The whole thing has a single substrate.  Here's the more out-lying guess:  there's
<br>
really an even more fundamental thing, an &quot;information gradient.&quot;  The whole
<br>
space/time/matter/energy fabric --- the total phase space of the universe --- is actually a
<br>
complex information environment, in which information is conserved.  At the end of the day,
<br>
simulation or not, everything really *is* bits --- i.e., one kind of quantity.  :-)  And the
<br>
entire phenomenological universe is actually a result of the behavior of this fabric in the
<br>
presence of 2LT, an undiscovered opposing counterpart to 2LT, and perhaps a handful of other
<br>
simple rules that combine in complex nonlinear ways.
<br>
<p>But enough wild guessing on that front.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think that the size of the hole that would be left in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortable worlds by a stunning disproof should be allowed to mediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the long-term probability of disproof.
</em><br>
<p>But the only arguments you've given for long-term probability of disproof are
<br>
methodologically inconsistent with the arguments you've bought into elsewhere to weight the
<br>
probability of Singularity, as illustrated above!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If, leaving workarounds aside, I had to pick one of these rules as *most*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to survive, I'd pick c - it seems to be built into the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality in our universe.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that's the one I'd rate as least likely to survive.  2LT is *much* more intimitely
<br>
involved in causality --- &quot;c+1 only violates causality&quot; only holds true if many other things
<br>
hold true, while &quot;systems tend from order to disorder&quot; (pardon the simplification) *by
<br>
itself* explains one of the most puzzling assymetries in physics (&quot;The Arrow of Time&quot;)
<br>
without introducing an observer bias.
<br>
<p>c has lots of problems.  One of the most underdiscussed problems in physics today is that
<br>
not only is c different in different contexts (media) --- there's accumulating empirical
<br>
data which suggests that indeed c may be inconstant in the *same* context (media) over time,
<br>
that c indeed may be decreasing.  It's *very* unfashionable to publish about that, hence the
<br>
literature is scant and mostly confined to some rather fringey types without much
<br>
professional credibility with the mandarins.  ;-)  Let's hope that if this is true it's a
<br>
local phenomenon and not a universal one, as the cosmological implications of the latter are
<br>
very unpleasant, even worse than the conclusions that can be drawn from 2LT.  :-/
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To what extent does my world-view require me to blissfully ignore the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications of such things?  Obviously I'd rather live in a universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where true immortality is possible, but I acknowledge that this is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variable my actions can influence.
</em><br>
<p>While it's true that you cannot influence whether this is possible or not, if it *is*
<br>
possible your actions can influence the probability of achieving that goal.  Don't be
<br>
timid!  :-)  This is the crux of my cautionary statements to you:  the impact of the choices
<br>
we make now, the bias we give to our predecessors, may indeed fix the course and the
<br>
probability of achieving such things, and may limit the probability of achieving whatever
<br>
maximal positive outcome is achievable.
<br>
<p>Here's a gedankenexperiment.  If we were to decide between the two following scenarios,
<br>
which would we choose:  a Friendly SI and successors that or capable of carrying the
<br>
entirety of pre-Singularity humanity for the next 10^20 years in idyllic bliss but unable to
<br>
escape some eventual catastrophe (due to resource allocations on achieving individual
<br>
satisfaction vs. other considerations which ensure longevity and security) or a Friendly SI
<br>
and successors that are capable of eventually building a post-Human society that experiences
<br>
subjective infinite time, at the cost of some (perhaps large) amount of involuntary pain,
<br>
suffering, or termination for some (perhaps large) portion of immediately pre-Singularity
<br>
humanity?  I don't know which is preferable, and I have no bias one way or the other ---
<br>
though I think the conversation is definitely worth having.  ?  I indeed believe that the
<br>
choices we make now can impact such things;  the &quot;moral&quot; bias we provide to the first AIs is
<br>
very likely to determine which outcomes are possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; None of my current actions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicated on that variable taking on a particular value, so why am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being accused of religious faith?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not accusing you of that.  I'm merely pointing out that it's very hard for humans to
<br>
accurately assess their priors and reason about things in a manner divorced from sentiment.
<br>
You and I share at least in a general way the same cognitive architecture which makes that
<br>
true, and it's important that we be sure that we don't take the values of certain variables
<br>
on faith.  Not saying that you are --- I'm mostly just tweaking you --- I'm just throwing
<br>
flags where there appear to be relatively unexamined (or at least underexplained)
<br>
assumptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I can tell, my sole crime is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I attach a 20% probability to irrelevant-but-fun hypotheses to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would rather grant a 90% probability.
</em><br>
<p>???  Which ones?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it your thesis that I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignoring actions which I should be taking to prepare for the 20%/90%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability that some law remains solid over the long run?
</em><br>
<p>My thesis is that it's *possible* that you're ignoring such possibilities.  Given the
<br>
profound potential impact on the future course of humanity that a success in your endeavors
<br>
might have, I'm just throwing in my $0.02 to encourage you to be as diligent as possible in
<br>
such considerations.  That doesn't require an answer, it's just a checkpoint.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained why a resolution of this issue is not required to construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>To be fair, I don't wholly buy the arguments set forth in the various monographs --- all of
<br>
which I've read numerous times --- but I should pick those apart directly rather than
<br>
obliquely.  It wasn't my intent to do that in this thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I want to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Friendliness, Eli --- indeed I do believe that superhuman AI is an inevitability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I'd like for it to be benign.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dear me.  How biased.
</em><br>
<p>That statement wasn't an argument, hence expressing bias isn't inappropriate.  Indeed,
<br>
you've expressed various biases along those lines at various points in time.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, well, I have some experience with the bizarre matrix of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-reinforcing misinterpretations that usually results in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement.  You don't appear to be an advanced case, and hopefully can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extracted from whatever corner you're currently wedging yourself into.
</em><br>
<p>And how exactly is that not an ad hominem?  ;-)
