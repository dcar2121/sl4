From: <a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sysopmind.com?Subject=RE:%20Adaptive%20Intelligence%20Inc%20-%20Incubation">owner-sl4@sysopmind.com</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sysopmind.com?Subject=RE:%20Adaptive%20Intelligence%20Inc%20-%20Incubation">owner-sl4@sysopmind.com</a>]On Behalf
<br>
Of Dmitriy Myshkin
<br>
...
<br>
What irked me had nothing to do with SIAI... it was the blatant
<br>
declaration of the intent to directly monetize transhuman AI.
<br>

<br>
<p>Dmitry, the possibility is worth considering that, at the present time, the
<br>
fastest route to engineering real AI may be via the commercial world.
<br>
<p>Let's look at the other possibilities...
<br>
<p>Government research grant funding is in many ways more conservative than
<br>
business funding.
<br>
<p>The Linux-style model of open-source development is, I'm afraid, far more
<br>
appropriate to the building of an OS based on well-known principles than to
<br>
the building of something as specialized and advanced as the world's first
<br>
digital mind.
<br>
<p>The SIAI-style model of not-for-profit-but-secretive development has yet to
<br>
be validated.  So far Eli is as far as I know the only one working on AI
<br>
within this model.  Flare development has been offloaded, but Flare is more
<br>
Linux-like in that it's a relatively straightforward engineering project.
<br>
<p>My intuition is that developing a real AI requires a tightly-knit, full-time
<br>
team, and right now the most likely way to pull such a team together for
<br>
real AI is within the commercial world.  *Unless* someone who is already a
<br>
big shot within the (highly conservative) academic AI establishment decides
<br>
to seek grant funding for an ambitious general intelligence initiative.
<br>
This may happen, but I suspect it will only happen after some of our
<br>
maverick projects have achieved greater success.
<br>
<p>Using business funding for AI R&amp;D has problems that I know better than
<br>
anyone.  One is faced with a constant choice between pursuing long-range R&amp;D
<br>
and devoting all resources to solving short-term business problems.
<br>
Business funding is far from a panacea, unless one is talking about funding
<br>
within the R&amp;D group of some very wealthy company (Microsoft, IBM, etc.).
<br>
<p>But I don't have much patience for you or anyone else being uppity about
<br>
where Eli or Peter or I get money for Real AI development.  Unless you plan
<br>
to write us a check to cover engineers' salaries and hardware costs, I
<br>
suggest you get off your high horse and respect our passion for attempting
<br>
to create real AI rather than just talking about it or working on peripheral
<br>
projects, and understand our willingness to get real AI done by hook or by
<br>
crook.
<br>
<p>I'm not advocating a 100% &quot;ends justifies the  means&quot; mentality.  Nor am I a
<br>
fanatical right-wing libertarian who believes that everything necessarily
<br>
should be done for profit.  I'm just advocating a very simple pragmatism and
<br>
open-mindedness.  Nonprofit does not always mean &quot;good&quot;; the KKK is a
<br>
nonprofit organization.  And for-profit does not always mean &quot;bad.&quot;  This
<br>
kind of simplistic human thinking, in its 100000 manifestations, is a large
<br>
part of the reason why we don't have real AI yet.
<br>
<p>-- Ben Goertzel
