<p>Well, I tried to explain this, but apparently I was not clear enough.
<br>
<p>The point is, I predict that there are going to be many years during which
<br>
the following
<br>
two statements hold:
<br>
<p>1) There are AI's that can usefully extract the semantics from unstructured
<br>
data
<br>
<p>2) Such AI's are very expensive to operate, requiring highly expensive
<br>
computing resources
<br>
<p><p>Hence, there will be a benefit in having such an AI read a piece of text
<br>
*once*, outputting
<br>
the semantic information it has recognized IN A FORM THAT CAN THEN BE
<br>
UNDERSTOOD BY
<br>
CHEAPER, STUPIDER AI PROGRAMS.
<br>
<p>In fact, the years during which my two statements hold *are now upon us*, in
<br>
the sense that there
<br>
exist relatively simple but computationally expensive NLP systems that can
<br>
usefully extract a lot
<br>
of information from unstructured text.  LexiQuest, for example, is a firm
<br>
that markets such systems.
<br>
<p>The current non-existence of the &quot;semantic web&quot; is therefore, in my view,
<br>
basically due to sociological
<br>
reasons rather than due to the contradictoriness or unproductivity of the
<br>
idea.
<br>
<p>I.e., no one has created a business model founded on using
<br>
computationally-costly AI tools to mark up the
<br>
Web, and then allowing a variety of cheaper tools written by various people
<br>
to read these mark-ups. Which is too
<br>
bad because this would significantly increase the intelligence of the
<br>
Internet.
