</em><br>
<p>Hmm... I would suppose that ET would use the energy of stars in some way.
<br>
<p>ET might build big Dyson spheres around stars.  But the problem is
<br>
that usable energy is the difference between something's energy, and
<br>
the background energy.  If the Dyson sphere doesn't radiate energy as
<br>
rapidly as the sun inside it does, it will build up heat, and thus the
<br>
energy will be less usable.  Someone made a similar point about
<br>
computation; that the energy needed to perform computation is an
<br>
increasing function of the background energy.
<br>
<p>So ET needs to let heat radiate away from the star.  So it's still
<br>
going to look, to the naked eye, pretty much the same.
<br>
<p>ET's sun/Dyson sphere might radiate in different wavelengths than we
<br>
expect from a &quot;wild&quot; sun.  The sphere would be composed of some
<br>
different substance, maybe a metal, that would emit different
<br>
wavelengths, perhaps.
<br>
<p>I'm not aware of any stars that emit radiation at unexpected wavelengths.
<br>
However, if ET wants to make most efficient use of its star's energy,
<br>
I suspect that it will radiate heat like a black body.  And that is
<br>
exactly what stars do.  The spectra we receive from different stars
<br>
differ, AFAIK, only in ways caused by the stars' different
<br>
temperatures, their different velocities with respect to us, and by
<br>
absorbtion of some wavelengths by gas around the star and by
<br>
interstellar dust.  So the radiation we see coming from stars is
<br>
exactly what we would predict to come from a star computer.
<br>
<p>ET might modulate the radiation to use it as a form of communication.
<br>
The light coming from a star or sphere could be modulated so that it
<br>
would be a broadcast station.  But the data being broadcast would be
<br>
compressed, and the more efficient compression is, the more data looks
<br>
like the highest-entropy distribution.  So this modulation probably
<br>
would not make the radiation look any different to us.  It would
<br>
probably be modulated at frequencies or resolutions too fine for us to
<br>
detect, in ways that would appear random if we detected them.
<br>
<p>We could ask whether ET's local energy usage would vary over time.  If
<br>
so, the star's emission would vary over time.  I suspect that this
<br>
would not happen; that so much computation would be going on, and
<br>
that, since the cost of computation (in their currency) would likely
<br>
go down if demand went down, that the local energy usage (in their
<br>
star system) would stay pretty constant over time.
<br>
<p>They might choose to release their star's energy at a different rate
<br>
than a &quot;wild&quot; star.  So an ET-colonized system might appear to have
<br>
stars of a different type than that predicted in the wild.  (White
<br>
dwarfs would be star computers running very slowly, for instance.)
<br>
This would be a useful thing to look for.  I don't know if anyone has.
<br>
&nbsp;The predominant SETI approach, which is to assume that ET has exactly
<br>
our level of technological development, give or take a century, is
<br>
dubious IMHO.
<br>
<p>So, the short answer to your question, John, is &quot;yes&quot;.  The night sky
<br>
looks pretty much as I would predict it would, knowing ET existed.
<br>
