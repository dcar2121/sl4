<p>
As an economist with a PhD about discounting and project valuation, I find  
<br>
it highly disturbing that you are using such antiquated instruments as  
<br>
&quot;interest rates&quot; and &quot;discounting&quot;.
<br>
<p>The whole discussion is completely wrong for the following reasons.
<br>
<p>It is not justified to speak about required rate of return for an entity  
<br>
which lives inside a computer. When most of the projects are carried out  
<br>
inside a virtual space (i.e. subjective time is not equal to astronomical  
<br>
time), when growth rates are high (and not limited by the same things as  
<br>
they are today), when the entities themselves live in a virtual space,  
<br>
when there might not be competition based on growth rates, etc. it is just  
<br>
stupid to discount future resource flows in the same way as we do today.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From an economist viewpoint, there likely will not be any discounting  
<br>
whatsoever, since what matters is total subjective time (i.e. amount of  
<br>
calculations), which is unrelated to astronomical time and is related to  
<br>
resources only. If a posthuman civilization is no longer worried about  
<br>
&quot;real-time threats&quot; (space aliens, asteroid danger, supernovas, etc.) that  
<br>
have to be countered quickly, it will probably concentrate on using  
<br>
efficiently all avialable resources for its purposes (no longer directly  
<br>
tied to the real physical world). I ignore all possibilities of final  
<br>
resolutions such as creating new universes for computation or dyson/tipler  
<br>
infinity scenarios.
<br>
<p>Hope this helps.

<p>I find
<br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I did some math, and it turns out to be highly UNLIKELY that ET
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would find it worthwhile to travel to the stars!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Considering just the energy payoff, in order for it to be worthwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to gather the energy of a sun, it would have to be the case that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy investment, with interest, would be less than the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payoff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; T = time taken to harvest sun's energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S = energy of sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L = energy invested at launch time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I = 1 + &quot;interest rate&quot;, in same units as T
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We must have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L(I^T) &lt; S
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order for the sun-harvesting to be worthwhile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that the star is 6 light-years away.  This is a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposition, because, although you can find stars closer than that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they aren't distributed evenly throughout space, and rather soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're going to find yourself at the edge of your local cluster,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking more than 6 light-years to the next star.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find, from the Wikipedia entry on &quot;Orders of magnitude (energy)&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the theoretical total mass-energy of the sun is 1.8E47 J.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We will suppose that our high-tech ET can accelerate to the speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light instantaneously, and make the round-trip to the star and back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 years = 4380 days.  We then have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L(I^4380) &lt; 1.8E47 Joules
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ln(L) + 4380ln(I) &lt; ln(1.8) + 47ln(10)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We will suppose that ET is very energy-efficient, and can create and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch a spaceship using 1 Joule of energy, so ln(L) = 0.  We thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ln(I) &lt; [ln(1.8) + 47ln(10)] / 4380 = 0.0248423
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I &lt; 1.02515
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, even if ET is able to build an impossibly-perfect spaceship and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch it with 1 J of energy, it is not worthwhile for ET to do so, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gather the energy from a sun and bring it back, unless the &quot;interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate&quot; (on investments; in our society we would think of it as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest rate on money, but in ET's more advanced society they think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it as an interest rate on energy) is less than 2.5% per day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me more likely than not that the interest rate in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-human society would be more than 2.5% per day.  This is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because moving from thinking based on the stochastic movements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins in fluid and currents traveling at 3m/s, to thinking based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computer architectures we have today, would at first glance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest a subjective speedup factor of about a million, making an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest rate of 10%/year in human society translate to an interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of about 27,400%/day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only vulnerable point that I see to this argument is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposition that ET needs to bring the energy back to his starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.  I'm assuming that ET at home does not feel especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolent, and wants the benefit of that sun's energy for himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm also assuming that ET is part of a relatively large computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity, and that sending out an ET would amount to making a copy of ET
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and putting it on a spaceship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might argue that ET would be altruistic enough to let the copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ET stay out by the sun and use its energy there.  You might further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that we should then consider the travelling ET's subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, which will be very small, since it will travel near the speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that a stay-at-home ET would evaluate its return on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment from the point of view of the travelling ET.  I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider than an ET that planned to pull up stakes and travel itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might consider the time to be that experienced on the voyage.
</em><br>
