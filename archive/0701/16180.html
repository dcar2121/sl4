<p><em>&gt; &gt; 8. Goulash currency.  A combination of all of the above, in which you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; selling in every exchange, and software agents working on behalf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the buyer and seller would work out what was actually exchanged in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every transaction.  I'd lay my bets on this one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This makes the most sense.  It's the currency that I'd use if I could,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and had the attention to spare for the requisite valuations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; N.B.:  This currency will inherently cause different entities to value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different things differently.  Well,  of course that just makes it more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflective of reality...
</em><br>
<p>One interesting side effect is that music lovers will probably value
<br>
musical information higher, but will likely be better at predicting
<br>
the next bit of information in a song. Thus the amount of new
<br>
information in an unheard song will be less for someone with a more
<br>
developed musical modality.
<br>
<p>Generalising this beyond music, information buyers who are familiar
<br>
with a given type of information will be able to buy it cheaper then
<br>
buying information from a completely unknown domain. Ironically, a
<br>
true random number generator would be the most profitable information
<br>
source.
<br>
<p>If this was a form of currency, or even a way of overseeing the
<br>
transfer and purchase of information, then I envision a demand for
<br>
prediction tools in different knowledge domains. These tools would
<br>
save a consumer &quot;money&quot; by increasing the customers apparent domain
<br>
knowledge.
