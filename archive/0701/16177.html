<p>
In a recent post, I talked about using energy as currency in the future.
<br>
<p>Which of these do you think would make the best currency at, say, SL4
<br>
(wrt present day):
<br>
<p>1. Total mass-energy:  Has the advantage that it is definable and
<br>
objective, and is perhaps the ultimate valuable.  Has the advantage or
<br>
disadvantage that its value can't be manipulated easily to control an
<br>
economy.
<br>
<p>2. Usable energy:  If you give me power for a year, I could hand you a
<br>
small rock (or whatever; I haven't done calculations) and say we're
<br>
even.  Mass-energy's usability depends on your tech.  Also, if I give
<br>
you an object containing energy, say, in heat, that heat energy is
<br>
more or less valuable depending on how hot it is around the object.
<br>
The disadvantage is that this isn't a completely objective measure,
<br>
AFAIK.
<br>
<p>3. Information:  Bits of unknown information.  This may be the main
<br>
trading item of interest.  However, what conveys information to one
<br>
person may already be known by another.  To use information as
<br>
currency, you might have to create an exchange process, in which the
<br>
giver doles out bits one at a time, and the receiver continually
<br>
predicts the next bit.  The number of bits deemed to have been given,
<br>
to measure the exchange, would be taken as the total number of bits
<br>
transferred, minus the number of bits the receiver predicted correctly
<br>
(or possibly some more correct measure).  The receiver could waive
<br>
this process if it admits it doesn't have the information (say, a song
<br>
it hasn't heard).  A seller could require such a waiver as a condition
<br>
of a sale.  A difficulty is that the theoretical translation into
<br>
energy is, and may continue to be, orders of magnitude apart from the
<br>
practical translation into energy.
<br>
<p>4. Computation cycles.  As an AI, this might be of great interest to
<br>
you.  Because computer architectures differ, this might be best
<br>
expressed in terms of information.  However, it might be difficult to
<br>
measure the information gained from a computation, particularly if it
<br>
is private information (such as your personal thought process).  This
<br>
could be used in the near term; you could loan out your computer's CPU
<br>
to someone else, through a central &quot;bank&quot; that tracked peoples'
<br>
credit.
<br>
<p>5. Objects.  A gold currency, for instance.  Or a currency that I'd
<br>
like to see, McDonald's gift certificates, expressed in quarter
<br>
pounders, acceptable worldwide.
<br>
<p>6. Currency as we know it.  Manipulable by a government, corporation,
<br>
or other sufficiently powerful entity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6a.  Government currency: The dollar.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6b.  Corporate currency: The Paypal dollar.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6c.  Virtual currency: The Second Life dollar.
<br>
<p>7. Distributed currency.  A currency system in which factors such as
<br>
the amount in existence, and the interest rate paid on something like
<br>
a treasury note, was set by popular vote, or in a distributed manner.
<br>
Or, an &quot;open-source&quot; currency system which isn't under anyone's
<br>
control.  Could easily overlap with 4.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7a. Underground currency:  A currency outlawed by most governments
<br>
because it can be exchanged without revealing either buyer's or
<br>
seller's identity.  One can also put large amounts of cash in a bank
<br>
without revealing your identity.  This isn't really a feature of a
<br>
currency so much as it is of banks - you can put money in Swiss banks
<br>
in an anonymous manner - but I'm imagining an online dollar devised
<br>
largely for the purpose of being anonymous.  One can imagine a large
<br>
demand for this in China, where the government makes it hard for
<br>
people to get a credit card because it doesn't want them ordering
<br>
things from other countries online, and where people might like to buy
<br>
simple electronic files like books and movies without informing the
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>8. Goulash currency.  A combination of all of the above, in which you
<br>
might set your preferences about which currencies to be buying and
<br>
selling in every exchange, and software agents working on behalf of
<br>
the buyer and seller would work out what was actually exchanged in
<br>
every transaction.  I'd lay my bets on this one.
