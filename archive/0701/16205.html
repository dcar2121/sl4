</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>Credit is not a misnomer. Credit is the prearranged opportunity to borrow
<br>
(and take on a debt). Just as you are better off having a job, you are
<br>
better off having credit. Having a job entitles you to nothing but the
<br>
prearranged opportunity to sell your labor at a given price.
<br>
<p>Of course, credit does have two meaning. There's a credit to your account
<br>
meaning you have received money, and there's a credit line, meaning what I
<br>
mean above. But have any sort of option is always worthwhile.
<br>
<p>What is important with regard to money is not what it is based on. No doubt
<br>
a Roman legionnaire would laugh if someone tried to pay him in promises, but
<br>
I don't think you'd appreciate being paid in salt. Similarly with cigarettes
<br>
in prisons.
<br>
<p>What is important with money is what you can exchange it for, how convenient
<br>
it is to engage in transactions with it, the expected change in the value of
<br>
the commodity over time, and the uncertainty of the change over time. We
<br>
already have currencies diverging somewhat. Consider the differences between
<br>
cash in my wallet, money in a checking account, and money in a CD. They all
<br>
have different advantages and we exchange one currency for another to
<br>
optimize.
<br>
<p>Money isn't going to go away until scarce resources and separate entities
<br>
controlling those resources with differing interests go away, because money
<br>
is the most efficient method of allocating scarce resources. Even under
<br>
communism, the factory managers had to resort to barter systems in order to
<br>
keep things running as smoothly as they can.
<br>
<p>Improved technology, meaning lower transaction costs and lower cost of
<br>
information, opens up even more exotic forms of currency. Our current
<br>
monetary systems could not exist without the ability of banks to communicate
<br>
(the ... reserve rate? is that the name for the fraction of deposits held?
<br>
would have to be much higher).
<br>
<p>What's missing in the original post considering things like &quot;usable energy&quot;
<br>
is that we've advanced to the point that we don't need to say &quot;I'll give you
<br>
10kwh for that pack of cigarettes&quot; and I have to, I don't know, give him a
<br>
can of gasoline. A currency based on power would be exchanged just as any
<br>
other, and the unit of account would probably have a defined location and
<br>
medium, like 10kwh of electricity at the point of generation at X power
<br>
plant. But I'd still pay my electric bill, and it might cost me 30kwh to
<br>
have that 10kwh delivered to my home. Since the value varies at a given
<br>
location, the currency can be stabilized by instead pegging it to 1kwh
<br>
credit is 1/100 of a kwh at any of 100 power plants. You could establish
<br>
such a system by contracting to buy power from the powerplant (in your
<br>
kwh$), sell it to consumers (for kwh$), and also make loans to people (in
<br>
kwh$ for kwh$ interest), thus increasing the money supply beyond what can
<br>
actually be produced.
<br>
<p>I don't think the goulash currency example is that likely because we are so
<br>
good at basing currency on nothing. The only way I see that as likely is if
<br>
there is no single currency in sufficient supply.
<br>
<p>Oh, first time poster. Software engineer in California, studied some
<br>
cognitive science and economics at school.
