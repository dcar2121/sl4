What this proves is that a centralized control system would be 
<br>
inappropriate.  A distributed system might not have any such problem.   
<br>
(Well, there might well be distributed systems that don't have that 
<br>
problem.)
<br>
<p>A lot of this discussion is presuming a definition of &quot;I-me&quot; that is not 
<br>
inherent.   To an advanced civilization it might seem like the brain 
<br>
refusing to dole out energy to the heart.  (Well, that's a bit 
<br>
extreme...but perhaps you get the point.)
<br>
<p>I take the discussion about &quot;discount rates&quot; as important, but how you 
<br>
figure it depends partially on how you organize your system.   OTOH, it 
<br>
does seem  reasonable that after only 200 years there would still remain 
<br>
a large number of isolated &quot;centers of selfishness&quot; that don't identify 
<br>
with the system as a whole.  I don't expect that the projected &quot;space 
<br>
ship&quot; would contain any large amount of &quot;stuff&quot;, possibly not even self 
<br>
awareness.  What it would contain is mechanism to build a communications 
<br>
link back to the home system, and that once it was activated a download 
<br>
of various natures would happen.
