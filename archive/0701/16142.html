<p>
Okay, I did some math, and it turns out to be highly UNLIKELY that ET
<br>
would find it worthwhile to travel to the stars!
<br>
<p>Considering just the energy payoff, in order for it to be worthwhile
<br>
to gather the energy of a sun, it would have to be the case that the
<br>
energy investment, with interest, would be less than the energy
<br>
payoff.
<br>
<p>Let
<br>
<p>T = time taken to harvest sun's energy
<br>
S = energy of sun
<br>
L = energy invested at launch time
<br>
I = 1 + &quot;interest rate&quot;, in same units as T
<br>
<p>We must have
<br>
<p>L(I^T) &lt; S
<br>
<p>in order for the sun-harvesting to be worthwhile.
<br>
<p>Suppose that the star is 6 light-years away.  This is a reasonable
<br>
supposition, because, although you can find stars closer than that,
<br>
they aren't distributed evenly throughout space, and rather soon
<br>
you're going to find yourself at the edge of your local cluster,
<br>
looking more than 6 light-years to the next star.
<br>
<p>I find, from the Wikipedia entry on &quot;Orders of magnitude (energy)&quot;,
<br>
that the theoretical total mass-energy of the sun is 1.8E47 J.
<br>
<p>We will suppose that our high-tech ET can accelerate to the speed of
<br>
light instantaneously, and make the round-trip to the star and back in
<br>
12 years = 4380 days.  We then have
<br>
<p>L(I^4380) &lt; 1.8E47 Joules
<br>
<p>ln(L) + 4380ln(I) &lt; ln(1.8) + 47ln(10)
<br>
<p>We will suppose that ET is very energy-efficient, and can create and
<br>
launch a spaceship using 1 Joule of energy, so ln(L) = 0.  We thus
<br>
have
<br>
<p>ln(I) &lt; [ln(1.8) + 47ln(10)] / 4380 = 0.0248423
<br>
I &lt; 1.02515
<br>
<p>Thus, even if ET is able to build an impossibly-perfect spaceship and
<br>
launch it with 1 J of energy, it is not worthwhile for ET to do so, to
<br>
gather the energy from a sun and bring it back, unless the &quot;interest
<br>
rate&quot; (on investments; in our society we would think of it as an
<br>
interest rate on money, but in ET's more advanced society they think
<br>
of it as an interest rate on energy) is less than 2.5% per day.
<br>
<p>It seems to me more likely than not that the interest rate in a
<br>
post-human society would be more than 2.5% per day.  This is simply
<br>
because moving from thinking based on the stochastic movements of
<br>
proteins in fluid and currents traveling at 3m/s, to thinking based on
<br>
the computer architectures we have today, would at first glance
<br>
suggest a subjective speedup factor of about a million, making an
<br>
interest rate of 10%/year in human society translate to an interest
<br>
rate of about 27,400%/day.
<br>
<p>The only vulnerable point that I see to this argument is the
<br>
supposition that ET needs to bring the energy back to his starting
<br>
point.  I'm assuming that ET at home does not feel especially
<br>
benevolent, and wants the benefit of that sun's energy for himself.
<br>
I'm also assuming that ET is part of a relatively large computational
<br>
entity, and that sending out an ET would amount to making a copy of ET
<br>
and putting it on a spaceship.
<br>
<p>You might argue that ET would be altruistic enough to let the copy of
<br>
ET stay out by the sun and use its energy there.  You might further
<br>
argue that we should then consider the travelling ET's subjective
<br>
time, which will be very small, since it will travel near the speed of
<br>
light.
<br>
<p>I don't think that a stay-at-home ET would evaluate its return on
<br>
investment from the point of view of the travelling ET.  I might
<br>
consider than an ET that planned to pull up stakes and travel itself,
<br>
might consider the time to be that experienced on the voyage.
