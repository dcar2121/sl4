3. Entities that can engage in transactions or exchanges.
<br>
4. A suitable medium of exchange (someone suggested energy in this case)
<br>
5. Entities that prefer to have things sooner rather than later -- in

<br>
<p><p>It seems to me that the absence of any of these five conditions would

indeed invalidate the concepts of 'interest rates' and 'discounting'

and, unless I've failed to make my list exhaustive, the presence of all 
<br>
five is sufficient to enable those concepts.
<br>
<p>Discounting
<br>
<p>'Discounting' comes about by our attempt to allow for time -- and 'time 
<br>
preference'.  It attempts to answer the question, &quot;How much less is 
<br>
something worth if I get it later rather than now?&quot;  It should be 
<br>
obvious that if you have something that you are willing to exchange, 
<br>
now, for $100 you will possibly be unwilling to make that exchange if 
<br>
the $100 is to be received 10 years from now -- even if there is no 
<br>
possibility of default.  $100 to be received later is worth less, in 
<br>
your estimation, than $100 in hand now.  In other words, you 'discount' 
<br>
the value of the time-delayed return.
<br>
<p>(Clearly the concept transcends the specific medium of exchange.)
<br>
<p>Interest
<br>
<p>It can be argued that, at any instant, you attempt to choose the very 
<br>
best use of the resources you control.  (Of course, there may be little 
<br>
agreement between individuals as to what constitutes 'best'.)  If I want 
<br>
to use some of your resources, I must induce you to part with them -- 
<br>
for a time.  One of the most straightforward ways of persuading you is 
<br>
to offer to return those resources to you -- later.  With 'interest'.  
<br>
How much interest I must offer will depend on:
<br>
1. How long I want the use of your resources
<br>
2. Your 'time preference' (how much more I must offer to return to you 
<br>
simply to equal, in your estimation, the resources 'loaned' to me  -- 
<br>
discounting)
<br>
3. Perceived risk -- of default and any other risks that you might see 
<br>
eventuating from the loan
<br>
4. Expected return from your next best use of the resource.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole discussion is completely wrong for the following reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not justified to speak about required rate of return for an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity  which lives inside a computer. When most of the projects are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried out  inside a virtual space (i.e. subjective time is not equal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to astronomical  time), when growth rates are high (and not limited by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same things as  they are today), when the entities themselves live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a virtual space,  when there might not be competition based on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth rates, etc. it is just  stupid to discount future resource 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flows in the same way as we do today.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how anything you've said in this paragraph invalidates the 
<br>
concepts of 'interest rates' or 'discounting'.
<br>
<p>You dismissively introduce 'required rate of return' which is just a way 
<br>
of applying the concepts of 'interest rates' or 'discounting' to 
<br>
estimate whether a given effort will be productive over the time it 
<br>
takes to exert that effort.  And 'productive' is itself merely shorthand 
<br>
for 'will yield more of value than is expended'.  You suggest, by 
<br>
implication, that an entity &quot;which lives inside a computer&quot; need have no 
<br>
concerns about productivity.  Why?
<br>
<p>You assert that:
<br>
<p>a) &quot;When most of the projects are carried out  inside a virtual space 
<br>
(i.e. subjective time is not equal to astronomical  time),&quot;
<br>
<p>b) &quot;when growth rates are high (and not limited by the same things as  
<br>
they are today)&quot;
<br>
<p>c) &quot;when the entities themselves live in a virtual space,&quot;
<br>
<p>d) &quot;when there might not be competition based on growth rates&quot;
<br>
<p>-then-
<br>
<p>&quot;it is just  stupid to discount future resource flows in the same way as 
<br>
we do today.&quot;
<br>
<p>But none of your points, a through d, seem germane to the issue and I 
<br>
cannot see that they even support your conclusion let alone require it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From an economist viewpoint, there likely will not be any discounting  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever, since what matters is total subjective time (i.e. amount 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of  calculations), which is unrelated to astronomical time and is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to  resources only. If a posthuman civilization is no longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worried about  &quot;real-time threats&quot; (space aliens, asteroid danger, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supernovas, etc.) that  have to be countered quickly, it will probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrate on using  efficiently all avialable resources for its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes (no longer directly  tied to the real physical world). I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore all possibilities of final  resolutions such as creating new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes for computation or dyson/tipler  infinity scenarios.
</em><br>
<p><p>It seems to me that the speculation as to how things will (&quot;likely&quot;) be 
<br>
very different in a virtual environment should probably not be made 
<br>
unless you are first able to _prove_ that we are not _now_ living in a 
<br>
'virtual' environment.  :)
<br>
<p>I readily grant that things _may_ be different, even radically so; but 
<br>
unless one of the 'preconditions' I mention is absent it seems to me 
<br>
that there must be some analog of 'discounting'.
<br>
<p>Subjectively speaking, 'time' is just the observation that not 
<br>
everything happens at once.  The 'rate' at which things happen (and the 
<br>
&quot;amount of calculations&quot;) does nothing at all to alter the fact of 'time 
<br>
preference': that entities generally prefer certain desirable things to 
<br>
happen in their perceived _now_ rather than later.
<br>
<p>Candidly, I am unable to discern exactly what point you're making in the 
<br>
balance of your paragraph or even how it ties in to your prior comments.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>G.
