<em>&gt; Well, even if we prove that immortality is possible we won’t know that

<em>&gt; As I said immortality depends on Physics and Cosmology but as Gödel
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is probably not a physical theory of everything either.
</em><br>
<p>Goedel's theorems do not apply at all here. His theorems state that
<br>
there is no set of axioms that can express certain things under which
<br>
every true statement can be proven. The analogous statement for
<br>
physics would be that there is no set of laws such that every
<br>
phenomenon expressible as a mathematical sentence (including things
<br>
like &quot;the atoms can be read as a Turing machine that does not halt&quot;)
<br>
can be derived from these laws. We don't care about deriving every
<br>
phenomenon that is expressible as a mathematical sentence; we only
<br>
care about coming up with laws that merely imply every phenomenon that
<br>
can actually be measured. The analogous goal for mathematics would be
<br>
coming up with axioms that imply every statement that can be proven,
<br>
which is trivial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And even if there is such a theory figuring out all the implications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is almost certainly not possible; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can learn the basic laws of the game Go in a few minutes but it takes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifetime to get good at it and nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is even close to being perfect at it.
</em><br>
<p>Mechanical engineers do not design systems that can be proven correct
<br>
based on our theories of quantum chemistry. Go players do not use
<br>
strategies that perfectly match the minimax game tree.
<br>
Super-intelligent beings do not prove that every possible outcome
<br>
leads to them being immortal.
<br>
<p>Now for a counterexample. Suppose that I am a super-intelligent being,
<br>
and I've figured out the laws of physics. It turns out that they're
<br>
Conway's Game of Life. Having done this, I know what actions I can
<br>
take that could kill me; since I'm rational and I desire life, I know
<br>
that I will not take any of these actions. I also know that the
<br>
universe is finite and wraps around; knowing this, I know that it
<br>
contains nothing but me. Since I will not kill myself and nothing
<br>
other than me will kill me, I will never be killed; I am immortal.
