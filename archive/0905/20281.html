<em>&gt; You might say you are immortal, but if you really believed it and were rational, you would choose a contract paying $1 per day forever over any one-time payment no matter how large. Belief doesn't mean anything unless it results in an observable change in behavior.

<em>&gt; -- Matt Mahoney, <a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Is%20belief%20in%20immortality%20computable?">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>
</em><br>
Not clear.  You are assuming that the agent believes that you will be 
<br>
able to pay you $1/day, and that it believes the value of $1 remains a 
<br>
constant.  Both are probably false for a reasonably intelligent agent.  
<br>
And it also needs to believe that it can't invest the money in other 
<br>
ways for a better return.  Etc.
<br>
<p>If you are limiting the environments in which is it operating to 
<br>
extremely simple ones, or the agent is very naive about the external 
<br>
environment, then it might agree to your terms.  And if the agent is 
<br>
very trusting and significantly less intelligent that you, it might 
<br>
agree to your terms.  But if the agent is living in an environment that 
<br>
maps reasonably onto the world that we live in, then I doubt that it 
<br>
would believe that YOU would immortally honor the contract.
<br>
<p>There's more things going on in this decision that just it's belief 
<br>
about it's own immortality.  And to even have the concept as more than a 
<br>
label it's going to need a lot of connections and information about the 
<br>
external world.  So I'm not certain that the limited agent described in 
<br>
the prior paragraph could actually exist (and have actual beliefs about 
<br>
immortality...at least rationally based ones).
