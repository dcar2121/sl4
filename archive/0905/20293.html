&gt; said:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I assume as higher beings, that:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (1) we would want to be rational,
&gt; &gt; (2) we would want to be immortal,
&gt; &gt; (3) we would want to know that we are immortal.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And I claim you can't have both (1) and (3). 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, even if we prove that immortality is possible we won’t know that
&gt; WE are immortal; but can we even do that?
&gt; As I said immortality depends on Physics and Cosmology but as Gödel
&gt; proved there is not even a complete theory of consistent mathematics, so
&gt; there is probably not a physical theory of everything either. 
&gt; 
&gt; And even if there is such a theory figuring out all the implications of
&gt; it is almost certainly not possible; you
&gt; can learn the basic laws of the game Go in a few minutes but it takes a
&gt; lifetime to get good at it and nobody is even close to being perfect at it.
&gt; 
&gt; And even if you know all the implications of the theory
&gt; Cosmology also depends on initial conditions,
&gt; the point where you start the game, and we will almost
&gt; certainly never know that in sufficient detail
&gt; to work out the future of the universe for infinity. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For these reasons I think your above statement is true but we will never
&gt; be able to prove it true.
&gt; However I can’t prove that either.

Not to mention that Benja also showed that my claim was wrong. It is in fact possible to distinguish the 3 possible beliefs (mortal, immortal, don't know) for rational agents.
