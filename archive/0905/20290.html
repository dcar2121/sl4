&gt; &gt; Do there exist two computable real functions A(t) and
&gt; B(t) defined over t in R+ such that
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  integral_0^infinity A(t) dt &gt; integral_0^infinity
&gt; B(t) dt
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  integral_0^infinity A(t)P(t) dt &lt;
&gt; integral_0^infinity B(t)P(t) dt
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; for all P != I?
&gt; 
&gt; No. If P(t) is constant, then integral_0^infinity cF(t) =
&gt; c
&gt; integral_0^infinity F(t) (or am I missing something?).
&gt; Thus, if the
&gt; second inequality holds for all P != I, it must also hold
&gt; for P = I.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In other words, are there A and B such that a rational
&gt; agent that is certain of its immortality would always choose
&gt; A, and a rational agent that is uncertain would always
&gt; choose B?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If not, then I claim that rational certainty of
&gt; immortality is impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; As I hinted at in my other mail, I think that the right way
&gt; to extend
&gt; decision theory to a potentially immortal agent is to
&gt; compare the
&gt; expected utilities of all possible strategies over the
&gt; whole lifetime
&gt; of the agent. What you are doing is that you are trying to
&gt; compute
&gt; expected utilities for the actions taken on day one (=
&gt; prefixes of
&gt; whole-lifetime strategies), and you define the expected
&gt; utility of an
&gt; action to be the supremum of the expected utilities of all
&gt; lifetime
&gt; strategies that start with that action, even if the
&gt; supremum is not a
&gt; maximum (ie, when the set of strategies starting with that
&gt; action does
&gt; not have a maximum). This doesn't seem like a good
&gt; definition of
&gt; &quot;rational decision&quot; to me; if by picking A the agent can
&gt; get a higher
&gt; payoff than with any strategy that starts with picking B,
&gt; then IMO the
&gt; agent should pick A, and the fact that the &quot;expected
&gt; utilities&quot; of A
&gt; and B are equal just means that the proper definition of
&gt; the expected
&gt; utility of an action is the maximum, not the supremum of
&gt; the EUs of
&gt; the strategies starting with this action (so B does not
&gt; *have* an EU).
&gt; 
&gt; However, while I don't think your mathematical argument
&gt; stands in the
&gt; way of it, I don't see how we could ever be rationally
&gt; *completely*
&gt; sure of anything, so I don't expect to have your (1) and
&gt; (3). However,
&gt; if we could get evidence that makes it exponentially
&gt; probable that
&gt; we're immortal, that seems just fine to me at least on the
&gt; face of it.
&gt; 
&gt; All the best,
&gt; - Benja
&gt; 

I think you're right. From your last email, I saw that the utility B could depend on P, which I didn't consider.
