<p>No. If P(t) is constant, then integral_0^infinity cF(t) = c
<br>
integral_0^infinity F(t) (or am I missing something?). Thus, if the
<br>
second inequality holds for all P != I, it must also hold for P = I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, are there A and B such that a rational agent that is certain of its immortality would always choose A, and a rational agent that is uncertain would always choose B?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If not, then I claim that rational certainty of immortality is impossible.
</em><br>
<p>As I hinted at in my other mail, I think that the right way to extend
<br>
decision theory to a potentially immortal agent is to compare the
<br>
expected utilities of all possible strategies over the whole lifetime
<br>
of the agent. What you are doing is that you are trying to compute
<br>
expected utilities for the actions taken on day one (= prefixes of
<br>
whole-lifetime strategies), and you define the expected utility of an
<br>
action to be the supremum of the expected utilities of all lifetime
<br>
strategies that start with that action, even if the supremum is not a
<br>
maximum (ie, when the set of strategies starting with that action does
<br>
not have a maximum). This doesn't seem like a good definition of
<br>
&quot;rational decision&quot; to me; if by picking A the agent can get a higher
<br>
payoff than with any strategy that starts with picking B, then IMO the
<br>
agent should pick A, and the fact that the &quot;expected utilities&quot; of A
<br>
and B are equal just means that the proper definition of the expected
<br>
utility of an action is the maximum, not the supremum of the EUs of
<br>
the strategies starting with this action (so B does not *have* an EU).
<br>
<p>However, while I don't think your mathematical argument stands in the
<br>
way of it, I don't see how we could ever be rationally *completely*
<br>
sure of anything, so I don't expect to have your (1) and (3). However,
<br>
if we could get evidence that makes it exponentially probable that
<br>
we're immortal, that seems just fine to me at least on the face of it.
<br>
<p>All the best,
<br>
