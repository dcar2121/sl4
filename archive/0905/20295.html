<p><em>&gt; Goedel's theorems do not apply at all here.
</em><br>
<p>No at all?! Not even a little?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; His theorems state 
</em><br>
<p>It’s not a theorem, it’s a proof.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;that there is no set of axioms that can express 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain things under which every true statement can be proven.
</em><br>
<p>His proof states that there are true statements (that is to say
<br>
statements where you will never find a counterexample to prove them
<br>
wrong) that cannot be derived from any finite list of axioms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The analogous statement for physics would be that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of laws such that every phenomenon expressible as a mathematical sentence
</em><br>
<p>The analogous statement for physics would be that there will always be
<br>
observations that cannot be explained by existing laws of physics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The analogous goal for mathematics would be coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with axioms that imply every statement that can be proven
</em><br>
<p>Huh? If it can be proven then it can be derived from axioms; that’s what
<br>
proven means. And you don’t want axioms that can prove every statement,
<br>
only the true ones. It would be nice if it could also prove all true
<br>
statements, but Gödel proved that could not be dome. 
<br>
<p>It would also be helpful if we could identify all statements (Goldbach's
<br>
conjecture perhaps) that are either false or true but unprovable so we
<br>
could stop wasting time trying to prove them, but Turing proved we can’t
<br>
do that either. If Goldbach is one of these (and if it isn’t there are
<br>
an infinite number of similar statements that are) then a billion years
<br>
from now our decedents will still be looking, unsuccessfully for a proof
<br>
(a derivation from axioms) to prove it correct and still be crunching
<br>
huge numbers looking, unsuccessfully, for a counterexample to prove it
<br>
wrong.    
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Super-intelligent beings do not prove that every possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome leads to them being immortal.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, that’s one reason they can’t logically prove they are immortal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose that I am a super-intelligent being, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I've figured out the laws of physics. 
</em><br>
<p>OK, I’m feeling extraordinarily generous so I’ll give you that. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It turns out that they're Conway's Game of Life.
</em><br>
<p>Then the basic rules of Conway's Game can derive every physical
<br>
phenomenon, including Shakespeare’s Sonnets. However going from the
<br>
fundamental laws of physics to Shakespeare is not a trivial task; a
<br>
computation is a physical process requiring energy and I very much doubt
<br>
there is enough energy in the universe to power a mind to go from
<br>
Conway's Game or String Theory to Shakespeare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know what actions I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take that could kill me
</em><br>
<p>No you don’t, not even then. Immortality depends on Cosmology and
<br>
Cosmology depends on more than physics, it also depends on initial
<br>
conditions. Even if you know the rules of Conway's Life you can’t know
<br>
what the next iteration of the game will be unless you know the previous
<br>
one. Likewise the past can be foggy too even if you know the laws of
<br>
physics and the present state of the game; you can’t know the previous
<br>
iteration because there is more than one way the game could have gotten
<br>
into its present condition.
