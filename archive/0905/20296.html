</em><br>
<p>Is that different from what I said?

<p><em>&gt;&gt; The analogous statement for physics would be that there is no

</em><br>
<p>If by &quot;observation&quot; you mean &quot;phenomenon expressible as a mathematical
<br>
sentence&quot;, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The analogous goal for mathematics would be coming

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh? If it can be proven then it can be derived from axioms; that’s what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven means.
</em><br>
<p>That's why I said that this goal is trivial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Super-intelligent beings do not prove that every possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; outcome leads to them being immortal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, that’s one reason they can’t logically prove they are immortal.
</em><br>
<p>Not absolutely, no. I'll give you that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It turns out that they're Conway's Game of Life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the basic rules of Conway's Game can derive every physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon, including Shakespeare’s Sonnets. However going from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental laws of physics to Shakespeare is not a trivial task; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation is a physical process requiring energy and I very much doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is enough energy in the universe to power a mind to go from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conway's Game or String Theory to Shakespeare.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you care about absolute proof. If approximations are
<br>
sufficient, follow the xkcd 435 sequence: derive Shakespeare from
<br>
psychology, psychology from biology, biology from chemistry, and
<br>
chemistry from physics. As far as absolute proof goes, it's probably
<br>
practically impossible to derive the properties of water from quantum
<br>
mechanics, but if approximations are sufficient, it's much easier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I know what actions I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; take that could kill me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No you don’t, not even then. Immortality depends on Cosmology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cosmology depends on more than physics, it also depends on initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I was operating under the assumption that I had seen the entire universe.
