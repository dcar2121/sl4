<em>&gt;Could anyone here suggest any references on a much narrower subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this problem: limiting the form of AI designs being considered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human-like minds (possibly including actual emulations of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds), is it possible to solve the FAI problem for that subset - or,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put another way, instead of preventing Unfriendly AIs and allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only Friendly AIs, is it possible to avoid &quot;Unfriendly Humans&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encourage &quot;Friendly Humans&quot;? If so, do such methods offer any insight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the generalized FAI problem? If not, does that imply that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is no general FAI solution?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And, most importantly, how many false assumptions are behind these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions, and how can I best learn to correct them?
</em><br>
<p>Humans are not Friendly.  1% are schizophrenic.  4% are sociopaths.
<br>
Even the normal ones seem to go to war regularly, and that's against
<br>
other humans like them that they might be expected to have empathy
<br>
for.  I can't see why a human-like FAI would regard us as
<br>
conspecifics, so the relationship might be more like human to cow than
<br>
human to human.  I would therefore expect to do even worse with a
<br>
powerful human-like AI than losing a war with a bunch of humans.  
<br>
<p>Human society more-or-less works in part because that humans are
<br>
limited in their ability to wield power, both in time (because they
<br>
get old and die) and in cognitive capacity.  Neither of these
<br>
limitations would apply to a human-like AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If not, does that imply that there is no general FAI solution?
</em><br>
<p>Can't see why.  You haven't said anything about AI's that don't
<br>
resemble humans, nor did I say anything about them above, so it's not
<br>
clear how to convert your statements into a proof that there is no
<br>
general FAI solution.
<br>
<p>Sorry, I don't have references offhand.
