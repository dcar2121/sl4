</em><br>
<p>This has been written about, but not really as a separate set of
<br>
references from the FAI/AI risk/hard takeoff literature more
<br>
generally. It's not like the literature on FAI is huge and needs to be
<br>
narrowed anyway, if one wants to think about it seriously. (Of course
<br>
that's ignoring other relevant/related reading that is useful for
<br>
thinking about FAI in the first place, mostly from subsets of compsci,
<br>
cogsci, biology, math).
<br>
<p>So you'd need to read through the FAI-related lit to find the existing
<br>
commentary on human-type minds, or at least run a find query over the
<br>
soft copies for &quot;human&quot; to narrow down where you're looking.
<br>
<p>Michael Anissimov compiled sources on hard takeoff, which is tied
<br>
together with the AI risks / FAI issue:
<br>
<a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2011/05/hard-takeoff-sources/">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2011/05/hard-takeoff-sources/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, most importantly, how many false assumptions are behind these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, and how can I best learn to correct them?
</em><br>
<p>False (meta-)assumption: The questions you put forward implicitly
<br>
assume you think it's useful to look for insights into the issue
<br>
without reading through what some smart folks have already written
<br>
about it. This is a common human thing to do -- I'm sure I've done it,
<br>
too, and I will surely do it again -- but it is generally a waste of
<br>
time in terms of moving understanding of an issue forward (it is
<br>
potentially not a waste of time if you're doing it just to have fun
<br>
discussing/debating ideas).
<br>
<p>Compare: speculation on improving the standard model in physics
<br>
without reading prior work. Seems ridiculous in that context, but for
<br>
subjects that appear on the surface less obviously math-laden, our
<br>
habit is to try to jump to solutions pretty quickly.
