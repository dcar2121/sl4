A finite state machine (FSM) can perfectly emulate any other FSM with a
smaller Kolmogorov complexity limit. The KC of the architecture is going
to be substantially smaller than the KC of the physical state of the
machine, and therefore there is no theoretical limitation on humans
understanding the architecture of human intelligence.  We can't
understand our own state perfectly (though a much bigger machine could),
but we can understand our architecture.  Most of the complexity of
machines is in the state, not the machinery architecture itself.
