<p>
The world is moving so quickly now that institutional education,
<br>
&quot;experts&quot; and the like are becoming more obsolete.  With the web 4.0
<br>
technologies that are in the works right now, it will deal a final
<br>
death blow to the system, making the value of a college education
<br>
about as much as a circa 2001 investment in Enron, Corp.
<br>
<p>If you don't believe me, perhaps you may skim through the academic
<br>
chapter in the book &quot;Economic Facts and Fallacies&quot; for a detailed,
<br>
informed, and documented explanation.
<br>
<p>The credentials were the ye old inbound information filter which
<br>
excluded the ideas of those who did not have the credentials as
<br>
&quot;noise&quot;, a system which is becoming more obsolete with technology.
<br>
<p>The number of thinkers in the world who are truly &quot;good enough to
<br>
contribute ideas&quot; outnumbers those who have the &quot;credentials to have
<br>
their ideas accepted&quot;, and the quality gap between the ideas of the
<br>
credentialed vs uncredentialed is narrowing.
<br>
<p>A technological tsunami is coming.  In the next five years, we will
<br>
have the means to take those thinkers, organize their ideas
<br>
effectively, and determine the validity of the ideas on both the
<br>
objective and subjective level.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule :o)
<br>
<p>Anyway, welcome to the list, or what's left of it.  There hasn't
<br>
really been any posting for some time.  If you want singularity/AGI
<br>
discussion, it takes place here <a href="http://www.agiri.org/email/">http://www.agiri.org/email/</a> - or on
<br>
the Facebook Groups &quot;Singularity News Network&quot;, &quot;Transhuman
<br>
Separatists&quot; or &quot;Strong Artificial Intelligence&quot;.
<br>
<p>In any case, while it is nice to help others with help to get a
<br>
certificate that was once very prestigous, your question is not
<br>
appropriate for any of these lists.  I would recommend refining your
<br>
search abilities, learning abilities, and information filters, for
<br>
they are far more important than any certificate.
<br>
<p>Best of luck!
<br>
<p>Mark Nuzzolilo
