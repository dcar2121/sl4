Tomorrow I will have a lunch. _Myself_ will enjoy it.

What should I upload, to enjoy something (everything) after uploading?

My sense of self - and nothing else. (Everybody* has this same sense of self.)

So what if I die first - as Cezar did - what then?

If I have a transload somewhere, and this transload will be uploaded - I will be uploaded too!

Who is my transload? 

Everybody is.

That's my point. ;-)
