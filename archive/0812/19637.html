John,
<br>
<p>1. The question of critical mass for Pu-238 is not principle to the
<br>
main question, because it was discussed only with connection if
<br>
Cassini could igmnate Saturn which is very unprobable. The main
<br>
question: is the detonation of the planet is possible at all; (But
<br>
fast neutrons doesn''t mean fusion neutron. for exmple, we have fast
<br>
neutron reactors, and they are not fusion reactors, but fission.
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_reactor">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_reactor</a>)
<br>
<p><p>2. You mistakenly think that:
<br>
a) formula &quot;E = p**2  X**3 T**30&quot; cames from the article of
<br>
&quot;&quot;Necessary conditions for the initiation and propagation of nuclear
<br>
detonation waves in plane atmospheres&quot;. Tomas Weaver and A.  Wood,
<br>
<p>and you don''t want even to look on that article because you don''t
<br>
like power of 30. (X is concentration, *** must be ** - power.)
<br>
<p>b) that this formula is false.
<br>
<p>In fact this formula cames from the book
<br>
Shklovsky: Stars: Their Birth, Life, Death,San Francisco, 1978
<br>
This book is also old, but even wikipedia agrees that:
<br>
<p>&quot;The triple-alpha process is strongly dependent on the temperature and
<br>
density of the stellar material. The energy released by the reaction
<br>
is approximately proportional to the temperature to the 30th power,
<br>
and the density squared. Contrast this to the PP chain which produces
<br>
energy at a rate proportional to the fourth power of temperature and
<br>
directly with density. This strong temperature dependence has
<br>
consequences for the late stage of stellar evolution, the red giant
<br>
stage.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process</a>
<br>
<p>Don''t belive in your knowleges! Use wikipedia! :)
<br>
<p>But the question of possibility of thiple-alpha detonation of Jupiter
<br>
is also not main.
<br>
<p>The main quetion is that observed level of diterium in the Jupiter is
<br>
only 5 times below minimal level which is needed for detonation
<br>
<p>which is stated in the article which you don''t want to read beacuse
<br>
you don''t like power of 30 - and there power of 30 is not even
<br>
mentioned.
<br>
<p>3. I had source there it was said that teller desigh would work if it
<br>
would be sufficiently large but I lost link. This is real bullshit.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; US goverment think that Pu-238 may have critical mass:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;Updated Critical Mass Estimates for Plutonium-238&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most important sentence in the entire article is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Pu 238 is dependent on fast neutrons for criticality&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I want to emphasize that this came from a paper that YOU recommended, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  said &quot;FAST neutrons&quot; and fast neutrons come from fusion reactions not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fission. So we are NOT talking about a chain reaction; how could we be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Pu238 is not even a neutron emitter, not of the fast variety nor even of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the slow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You could have a solid sphere of Pu238 (or Uranium 239) the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Jupiter and it would not explode without fast neutrons, and even then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would not be a chain reaction; a small amount of fast neutrons would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  only produce a small explosion, if you wanted a huge explosion you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  need a huge amount of fast neutrons. In this regard Plutonium 238 is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  different from common cheap Uranium 238, indeed about 70% of the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of an H bomb comes from the splitting of cheap Uranium 238, but only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because it is hit by a HUGE number of fast neutrons caused by a nearby
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fusion reaction. Neither 238 substance can produce a chain reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; John, how would you explain that in 1979 scientists returned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to the question and wrote the article there they said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; detonation is possible if concentration of deiterium are higer then 1 to 300?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I know nothing about this 30 year old paper, nor do I know anybody who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  does; and after you quote one of the equations in it I am not in any big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hurry to learn more. You quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;E = p**2  X***3 T**30&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I have no idea what &quot;X&quot; is and I don't know what &quot;***&quot; means, presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;T**30&quot; means T^30, that is to say taking temperature to the power of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  30. But if you see any equation that has a term like T^30 in it then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can be almost certain it is physically unrealistic. I can't think of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  valid physical equation that rises ANY term to the power of 30! And my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  God, why are Fusion reactors so Damn hard to make? And why didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Jupiter blow up a long time ago? The power of 30?!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Maybe you remeber Teller''s idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Simple Super bomb which doesn''t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; work. It was a tube with liqiud deiterium,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; and it doesn''t want to propogate detonation wave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It was a mixture of Deuterium and Tritium, the most fusion friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  substance in the known universe and it STILL didn't work. The gas giant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  planets are composed of common hydrogen, common helium, a slight trace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of Deuterium and no Tritium. That is astronomically less fusion friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then Teller's mixture, but you expect it to work anyway. I don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; But why? Because it was too small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Size doesn't enter into it. If the ocean is big and you're a long way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from the bomb things are not extreme at all. If you're right next to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bomb things will get very hot but not super dense like they do in a H
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bomb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You need both high temperature and high density for things to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  explosive, that's because even at 100 million degrees when Deuterium and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Tritium collide most of the time nothing happens, they have to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  trying over and over and over before a successful fusion event happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If things are super dense then all those retries can happen in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  very short time, but if things are not dense (and I mean dense) after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the first failure by the time it finds another potential partner so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  time has passed that things have expanded and cooled off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; In fact if Teller Simple Super would have widhth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; of several hundreds meters it would work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Bullshit.
