<em>&gt; I still think I understand what you are saying, and yes, it would be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Um, again:

<a href="http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/">http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;...We then show that self-improving systems will be driven to clarify their
<br>
goals and represent them as economic utility functions. They will also
<br>
strive for their actions to approximate rational economic behavior....&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I may not believe that &quot;Friendly AI&quot; is actually possible, but I do believe
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominate, if I were the designer.  It would be important, because it must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be, but other things would be more important.  And one of those would be not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting in ways that were more detrimental to human survival that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of humans would act.

<p>(Note that there are still a multitude of dogs and cats around, which

</em><br>
<p><p>People value dogs and cats. Seen any dodos lately?

<p><p><em>&gt;  But it's not clear that an AI would be designed to so depress it's

<p><p>Its *what*?!
