From: &quot;Petter Wingren-Rasmussen&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:petterwr@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20OCD%20(was%20Re:%20[sl4]%20AI's%20behaving%20badly)">petterwr@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;A person with OCD might check if he turned off the stove several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundred times because each time he gets a little bit calmed down.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the long therm however, spending 3 hours a day checking the stove
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes him think more about the possibility that he hasnt turned it off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and raises the anxietylevel.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good example.  Suppose I have OCD, I want to drive to work,
<br>
and I keep getting into my car, getting out, going back into my house,
<br>
checking the stove, and getting into my car again.  The AI observes
<br>
all this, and it controls the working of my car, the door to my house,
<br>
it can talk to me, and it knows an effective therapy for OCD.  If
<br>
asked whether I want a fix, it correctly estimates that my odds of
<br>
wanting the fix are 50%.  What would a Friendly AI have to do in that
<br>
case to deserve to be called Friendly?
<br>
<p>My best guess is that it should let me run around in circles until I
<br>
find my own way out.  If I asked for some effective therapy for OCD,
<br>
it might give it to me, or maybe it asks me if I want the therapy.
<br>
Giving me the therapy without my permission does not seem Friendly.
<br>
<p>I would prefer to have some criterion by which OCD is wrong and, for
<br>
example, wanting sex without wanting to make babies is right, but I
<br>
don't see it.
