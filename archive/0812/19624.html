Okay, to put it right, all the time you say one can't compare
<br>
a &quot;slow burning&quot; in stars with a &quot;detonation&quot;. A star detonates all the time
<br>
if you want to look at it like that, it just can't explode to _somewhere_, because
<br>
the gravity holds it all together. That is the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium.
<br>
<p>What you are comparing is the detonation of explosives, a chemical reaction which
<br>
happens namely in the valence shell of the molecules with the detonation of
<br>
a nucleus reaction which happens on the inside of atom nuclei. 
<br>
They aren't comparable, it's not even the same force (electromagnetic vs. strong force)
<br>
<p>And a supernova explosion is even a far more absurd analogy. The supernova explosion
<br>
is drive by the gravitational force. When the star has burnt all of its fuel, which
<br>
means that the main part of the matter is now iron then the fusion reaction would consume
<br>
more energy than it would generate. Therefore the fusion reaction stops and because
<br>
there is no more hydrostatic equilibrium the gravity pulls all the mass together
<br>
compressing the whole star to the point where the atoms &quot;touch each other&quot;. That only
<br>
can happen when there is an enormous amount of mass, more than our sun has. 
<br>
At this point, when no more contraction is possible, all the kinetic energy the atoms 
<br>
gained while falling into the center of the star, produce a huge shock wave.
<br>
Therefore the kinetic energy is reversed (elastic collision) and besides of forming
<br>
atoms heavier than iron this energy is used to drive the matter in a huge explosion
<br>
outward into the space, what we see as a supernova explosion.
<br>
<p><p><p>Besides of all the lacking evidence for your thesis, I think we should concentrate our 
<br>
discussion here to the Singularity and AGI. That's the purpose of this list, and we 
<br>
can't discuss all risky stuff that we can think of. (wildly mutation of lethal virus,
<br>
creating black hole inside earth, the US president spontaneously decides to ignite
<br>
all atomic weapons at once, and so on...) 
<br>
<p>I always enjoyed reading good discussions here and wouldn't want to miss that for a
<br>
theory which in my eyes has no scientific foundation.
<br>
<p><p>Sincerely, GS
