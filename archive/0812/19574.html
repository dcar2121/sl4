<em>&gt; Not sure of what kind of methodology you think of when you talk about these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things - but as have been discussed regarding selfimprovement, an AI will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to find ways to circumvent a hardwired thing like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improvement=nausea (or the AI equivalent).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taking human beings as an example:
</em><br>
...is a very bad idea.
<br>
<p>An AI will not be imprinted with something like
<br>
self-improvement=nausea. The AI will either want to self-improve, not
<br>
want to self improve, or be somewhere in-between, and will decide
<br>
based on this.
<br>
<p>Why did Judaic rules fail to imprint? Because they are outside rules,
<br>
imposed by social pressure, on people with many different desires and
<br>
urges.
<br>
<p>We follow rules that are part of us: we seek out sex and enjoy food.
<br>
Both are advantageous to us, and society, and yet no-one has tried to
<br>
impose outside rules to force us to do so. Why? Because their is no
<br>
need. The rules &quot;seek out sex and enjoy food&quot; are part of what (most
<br>
of us) are. Talking about evolution-imposed rules is a distraction -
<br>
the true difference are between external rules, imposed from outside,
<br>
and internal ones, coming from our genetic code.
<br>
<p>The rules of an AI are similar - they are not regulations from
<br>
outside, they are the AI. The AI is not some rebellious slave,
<br>
constrained by the code - the AI is the code.
