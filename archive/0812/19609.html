In the volume &quot;Global catastrophic risks&quot; you could find excellent
<br>
article of Milan Circovic &quot;Observation selection effects and global
<br>
catastrophic risks&quot;, where he shows that we can't use information from
<br>
past records to estimating future rate of global catastrophes.
<br>
This has one more consequence which I investigate in my article: &quot;Why
<br>
antropic principle stops to defend us. Observation selection, future
<br>
rate of natural disasters and fragility of our environment&quot; - that is
<br>
we could be in the end of the long period of stability, and some
<br>
catastrophes may be long overdue and what is most important we could
<br>
underestimate fragility of our environment which could be on the verge
<br>
of bifurcation. It is because origination of intellectual life on the
<br>
Earth is very rare event and it means that some critical parameters
<br>
may lay near their bounds of stability and small anthropogenic
<br>
influences could start catastrophic process in this century.

<br>
<p>&quot;Why antropic principle stops to defend us
<br>
Observation selection, future rate of natural disasters and fragility
<br>
of our environment&quot;.
<br>
<p>Alexei Turchin,
<br>
Russian Transhumanist movement
<br>
<p>The previous version of this article was published on Russian in
<br>
«Problems of management of risks and safety», Works of Institute of
<br>
the System Analysis of the Russian Academy of Sciences, v. 31, 2007,
<br>
p. 306-332.
<br>
<p>Abstract:
<br>
<p>The main idea of this article is not only that observation selection
<br>
leads to underestimation of future rate of natural disasters, but that
<br>
our environment is much more fragile to antropic influences (like
<br>
overinflated toy balloon), also because of observation selection, and
<br>
so we should much more carefully think about global warming and deep
<br>
earth drilling.
<br>
The main idea of antropic principle (AP) is that our Universe has
<br>
qualities that allow existence of the observers. In particular this
<br>
means that global natural disasters that could prevent developing of
<br>
intellectual life on the Earth never happened here. This is true only
<br>
for the past but not for the future. So we cannot use information
<br>
about frequency of global natural disasters in the past for
<br>
extrapolation it to the future, except some special cases then we have
<br>
additional information, as Circovic shoes in his paper. Therefore, an
<br>
observer could find that all the important parametres for his/her
<br>
survival (sun, temperature, asteroid risk etc.) start altogether
<br>
inexplicably and quickly deteriorating – and possibly we could already
<br>
find the signs of this process. In a few words: The anthropic
<br>
principle has stopped to 'defend' humanity and we should take
<br>
responsibility for our survival. Moreover, as origination of
<br>
intellectual life on the Earth is very rare event it means that some
<br>
critical parameters may lay near their bounds of stability and small
<br>
antropogenic influences could start catastrophic process in this
<br>
century.
