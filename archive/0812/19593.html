Your conclusion here is the same as mine through work with behavioural
<br>
psychotherapy.
<br>
We are so rigged for dealing with short-term goals that we often are
<br>
contraproductive in the long-term.
<br>
<p>A person with OCD might check if he turned off the stove several hundred
<br>
times because each time he gets a little bit calmed down.
<br>
In the long therm however, spending 3 hours a day checking the stove makes
<br>
him think more about the possibility that he hasnt turned it off and raises
<br>
the anxietylevel.
<br>
I think the vast majority have similar behavioural patterns although not as
<br>
obvious.
<br>
<p>Maybe a good solution would be for the AI to rig games for us that satisfy
<br>
our short-term goals where the results might be used for satisfying the AIs
<br>
(and all of civilizations) long-term goals - in something similar to the way
<br>
Luis von Ahn is doing it with gwap right now.
