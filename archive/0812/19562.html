Dear Tim,
<br>
<p>For your paper, I'm taking &quot;compassion&quot; as a short-hand for the AI
<br>
wanting to increase someone's utility function, and &quot;respect&quot; as a
<br>
short-hand for the AI not wanting to decrease anyone's utility
<br>
function.
<br>
<p>Two situations: the first one is where the AI is excessively short
<br>
term. Then the disaster is rather clear, as the AI runs through all
<br>
available ressources (and neglects trying to accumulate extra
<br>
ressources) trying to please humans, leading to an
<br>
environmental/social/economic collapse (if the AI is short term, then
<br>
it MUST privilege short term goals over any other considerations;
<br>
using up irreplaceable ressources immediately, in a way that will fill
<br>
the atmosphere with poisonous gas, is something the AI is compelled to
<br>
do, if it results in a better experience for people today).
<br>
<p>The second situation is where the AI can think longer term. This is
<br>
much more dangerous. What is the ideal world for an AI? A world where
<br>
it can maximise human's utilities, without having to reduce anyone's.
<br>
As before, brains-in-an-armoured-jar, drug-regressed to six months,
<br>
boredom removed and with repeated simple stimuli and a cocaine high,
<br>
is the ideal world for this.
<br>
<p>And if the AI has its way, this is the world we will end up with. It
<br>
might do this in a single mass intervention, or, if we've got the
<br>
&quot;respect&quot; part well programmed (a very tricky prespective), it will
<br>
push up in that direction over the long term (and will prevent actual
<br>
human babies from evolving beyond a six month stage). Fiddling around
<br>
with &quot;respect&quot; and short/long term will not prevent this, as it is an
<br>
attractor - every intermediate stage on the way to that world results
<br>
in a better situation for the AI. It wants dumb, isolated, easily
<br>
satisfied hedonists.
<br>
<p>Stuart
<br>
<p>PS: fixing the AI to obeying people's current utilities won't help
<br>
much - it will result in the AI giving us gifts we don't want any
<br>
more, bound only by respect considerations we no longer have. And the
<br>
next generation will be moulded by the AI into the situation above.
