Hi
<br>
<p>I have mailed this question to some specialists in the field but I can
<br>
understand they didn't have/take
<br>
the opportunity to answer me, but maybe SL4 have people aboard who consider
<br>
this a worthwhile
<br>
topic.
<br>
<p>In short, I read that there have been pulsars detected with telltale
<br>
planetary wobble. This appears to be
<br>
easy, because neutron stars are small, very bright and have very precise
<br>
spectral signatures. Now
<br>
I am wondering about a few things . If you like to enlighten me, can anyone
<br>
please add &quot;cinematic
<br>
desciptions&quot;? *Just pretend you are instruction a movie director on how it
<br>
would look and he has to
<br>
make a realistic depiction of your descriptions.*
<br>
<p>1 - how much hard radiation do these planetary companions experience. How
<br>
does that amount
<br>
compare to what the sun emits on average and during peak events (such as
<br>
when a comet slams into
<br>
a neutron star surface? What does energy of that magnitude do to stuff we
<br>
know? Say, a block of
<br>
iron a meter big at 1AE? To what can I compare these phenomena?
<br>
<p>2 - neutron stars (pulsars) are very small objects, yet their surface
<br>
temperature (!!) reaches over a
<br>
billion degrees. Nevertheless these planets revolve about the stellar husk
<br>
at distances of at least millions
<br>
to hundreds of millions of klicks. At that distance even a pulsar would be a
<br>
point object. So how much
<br>
output does it have, compared to the sun? What is the composition of the
<br>
light compared to the sun?
<br>
<p>3- I saw analysis that pulsars create light pressure of such vicious power
<br>
they can strip the gas of a
<br>
companion star that was under several million clicks away. How would such a
<br>
spiraling outawrd plume
<br>
of gas look when watched from a safe distance?
<br>
<p>4 - Most loaded question that many people will resist answering - in purely
<br>
cinematic terms, how would
<br>
a pulsar look seen from &quot;safe distance&quot;. What is safe distance? How would
<br>
pulsar planets look? How
<br>
strong are aurorae on such a planet compared with terrestrial aurora, and
<br>
how would they look? What
<br>
geochemistry processes would occur on a pulsar planet? Wouldn't a pulsar
<br>
strip any gaseous envelopes
<br>
away real fast?
<br>
<p>5- when would a pulsar planet have formed - from pre-nova conditions, or
<br>
from coalesced (!!) post nova
<br>
material? Would a pulsar former after the main star when berzerk have a high
<br>
composition of materials
<br>
heavier than iron? Would a high element compostion of such a planetary body
<br>
cause it to heat up
<br>
relative to earth due to radioactive composition?
<br>
<p>6 - what escape velocities relative to C would a neutron star, pulsar (quark
<br>
star, magnetar) have? What
<br>
would be the features of a heavy stellar remnant as it goes up in escape
<br>
velocity closer to C?  What
<br>
auroric phenomena would a pulsar show, when viewed from a safe distance?
<br>
Would some of these objects
<br>
be anything else other than very bright? Would interstellar gas caught in a
<br>
pulsars beams light up?
<br>
Would the nova cloud of a pulsar be visible from within the system or is it
<br>
too dim? Would the light of
<br>
&quot;very heavy&quot; neutron stars &quot;dim&quot; due to &quot;gravity well redshift&quot;?
<br>
<p>7- Do pulsars/neutron stars have a physiology other than that caused by the
<br>
sequence of the star,
<br>
spin and mass? Or there other formative elements that determine distinct
<br>
fysiological qualities (that have
<br>
distinct effect on their outward features) ? ... such as having been part of
<br>
a double system, with companion
<br>
material raining down on the star in an earlier epoch?
<br>
<p>8- Neutron stars form when very big stars go supernova. I am stunned at the
<br>
idea that the very moment a
<br>
star stars fissioning out iron, the iron literally &quot;absorbs&quot; energy and the
<br>
star collapses in a minisecond.
<br>
Implicitly this means that these stars detonate with a more or less solid
<br>
iron core. That means they eject
<br>
a particularly large amount of heavy stuff. Would an area &quot;close to&quot; a
<br>
neutron star be seeded with stable
<br>
heavy elements?  How would a nearby star (that was not in the blast range of
<br>
a GRB) experience a
<br>
supernova? Would it notice supernova ejecta &quot;raining in&quot; after a decade?
<br>
<p>Thanks, anyone.
