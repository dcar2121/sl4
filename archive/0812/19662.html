</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was thinking today about a puzzle. Let's say you're a friendly AI, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're going to enact rolf's gambit. But before you do that, you take over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few solar systems, and you discover obvious proof that your world is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. For the sake of argument, let's say it's an indestructible tuba
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the third moon of saturn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is this: assuming you continue with rolf's gambit, do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include the tuba in your subsimulations? Why or why not?
</em><br>
<p>An interesting question. I think I would reason as follows.
<br>
<p>If we find a tuba, then we know we're in a simulation. All of a
<br>
sudden, our attitude towards the gambit changes. Before, we acted
<br>
believing that all kinds of universes were possible; now we're
<br>
restricted to that small subset of universes in which entities would
<br>
simulate entities like ourselves, and Rolf's gambiteers* make up a
<br>
distressingly large fraction of that subset - much larger than they
<br>
were before. Thus, we/the AI now has that much greater an incentive to
<br>
act nicely than before.
<br>
<p>How does that affect the sub-simulations? I am not sure. Intuitively,
<br>
I want to say, 'No - You dummy, if you give the RAI any usable way to
<br>
discern between reality and simulation, then deception maximizes its
<br>
gains - it'll act nice when it finds itself in a universe with tubas,
<br>
and it will act rogue in non-tuba-containing universes!'
<br>
<p>But the problem is this view is for a FAI standing in reality; I'm not
<br>
sure how to deal with the higher levels. Why did *they* choose to add
<br>
a tuba? Presumably they didn't have to, presumably it was optional.
<br>
The FAI knows the gambit is not directed at it, so perhaps it can
<br>
assume that the upper levels are allied with it; which would suggest,
<br>
analogous to 'Bayesians cannot disagree', the FAI should just trust
<br>
the upper levels and imitate them and add tubas to its simulations.
<br>
<p>* can I coin this nickname along the lines of &quot;Pierson's puppeteers&quot;?
