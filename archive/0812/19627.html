<em>&gt; Let's get real here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To fuse, deuterium nuclei have to come together physically in an area the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size of the atomic nucleus. This takes a great deal of pressure and heat.
</em><br>
<p>This happens in an H-bomb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More likely than two deuterium nuclei fusing is that a deuterium nucleus and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hydrogen nucleus will fuse to form helium 3. I doubt that the pressures in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a gas giant are anything like high enough to support detonation of the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet. Unlike nuclear fission, where fast neutron cause fission ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shock front resulting from the release of energy by prior fission events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus generate true detonations, fusion requires extremely high pressures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and temperatures such as are found in the centers of stars.
</em><br>
<p>Or in a fusion detonation wave, especially in a liquid hydrogen ocean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even assuming that you could set of an H bomb in the center of a gas giant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the heat released would cause the surrounding material to expand and thereby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce the probability of further fusion.
</em><br>
<p>Actually the heating would come only after the detonation wave. High temp 
<br>
plasma is opaque to light, neutrinos are the only thing that would out run 
<br>
the wave. The wave travels faster than the speed of sound, the molecules
<br>
wouldn't &quot;know&quot; to move out of the way due to prior heating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As long as significant fusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues, there is a homeostatic relationship between pressure and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; release of heat. As the rate of fusion increases and more heat is released
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the star expands to reduce the rate of fusion.
</em><br>
<p>Stars begin there initial nuclear ignition slowly, pressure slowly grows 
<br>
until conditions are right, at that point it self regulates. Of course you
<br>
might not want to be right next to a star that just &quot;turned on&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conceivably, if the temperature of a gas giant was raised locally by a bomb,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps there would be enough pressure in the core to sustain a continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of fusion. With luck, you might end up with a short-lived brown dwarf.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if the surface temperature of the planet reached the temperature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sun, several factors would mitigate any significant impact on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperature and ecology of the earth.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe it would have sustained fusion, only a possible
<br>
detonation. Of course this doesn't need to be argued about, nuclear
<br>
physics can provide a definite answer. Regrettably I don't have
<br>
the background to do this math, the people who are most qualified
<br>
likely have very high security clearances. However I certainly can't
<br>
claim to rule it out, it certainly seems a liquid hydrogen ocean might
<br>
be able to support a fusion detonation wave.
