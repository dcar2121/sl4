&lt;<a href="mailto:alexeiturchin@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20giant%20planets%20ignation%20-%20one%20more%20existential%20risk">alexeiturchin@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Use google!
</em><br>
<p>Read books. I’ll let you in on a little secret, not everything on the
<br>
internet is true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; US goverment think that Pu-238 may have critical mass:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Updated Critical Mass Estimates for Plutonium-238&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sti.srs.gov/fulltext/ms9900313/ms9900313.html">http://sti.srs.gov/fulltext/ms9900313/ms9900313.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>The most important sentence in the entire article is:
<br>
<p>“Pu 238 is dependent on fast neutrons for criticality”.
<br>
<p>I want to emphasize that this came from a paper that YOU recommended, it
<br>
said “FAST neutrons” and fast neutrons come from fusion reactions not
<br>
fission. So we are NOT talking about a chain reaction; how could we be,
<br>
Pu238 is not even a neutron emitter, not of the fast variety nor even of
<br>
the slow.
<br>
<p>You could have a solid sphere of Pu238 (or Uranium 239) the size of
<br>
Jupiter and it would not explode without fast neutrons, and even then it
<br>
would not be a chain reaction; a small amount of fast neutrons would
<br>
only produce a small explosion, if you wanted a huge explosion you’d
<br>
need a huge amount of fast neutrons. In this regard Plutonium 238 is no
<br>
different from common cheap Uranium 238, indeed about 70% of the energy
<br>
of an H bomb comes from the splitting of cheap Uranium 238, but only
<br>
because it is hit by a HUGE number of fast neutrons caused by a nearby
<br>
fusion reaction. Neither 238 substance can produce a chain reaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; John, how would you explain that in 1979 scientists returned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the question and wrote the article there they said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detonation is possible if concentration of deiterium are higer then 1 to 300?
</em><br>
<p>I know nothing about this 30 year old paper, nor do I know anybody who
<br>
does; and after you quote one of the equations in it I am not in any big
<br>
hurry to learn more. You quote:
<br>
<p>“E = p**2  X***3 T**30”
<br>
<p>I have no idea what “X” is and I don’t know what “***” means, presumably
<br>
“T**30” means T^30, that is to say taking temperature to the power of
<br>
30. But if you see any equation that has a term like T^30 in it then you
<br>
can be almost certain it is physically unrealistic. I can’t think of any
<br>
valid physical equation that rises ANY term to the power of 30! And my
<br>
God, why are Fusion reactors so Damn hard to make? And why didn’t
<br>
Jupiter blow up a long time ago? The power of 30?!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe you remeber Teller''s idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simple Super bomb which doesn''t
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work. It was a tube with liqiud deiterium,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it doesn''t want to propogate detonation wave.
</em><br>
<p>It was a mixture of Deuterium and Tritium, the most fusion friendly
<br>
substance in the known universe and it STILL didn’t work. The gas giant
<br>
planets are composed of common hydrogen, common helium, a slight trace
<br>
of Deuterium and no Tritium. That is astronomically less fusion friendly
<br>
then Teller’s mixture, but you expect it to work anyway. I don’t.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But why? Because it was too small 
</em><br>
<p>Size doesn’t enter into it. If the ocean is big and you’re a long way
<br>
from the bomb things are not extreme at all. If you’re right next to the
<br>
bomb things will get very hot but not super dense like they do in a H
<br>
bomb.
<br>
You need both high temperature and high density for things to become
<br>
explosive, that’s because even at 100 million degrees when Deuterium and
<br>
Tritium collide most of the time nothing happens, they have to keep
<br>
trying over and over and over before a successful fusion event happens.
<br>
If things are super dense then all those retries can happen in a very
<br>
very short time, but if things are not dense (and I mean dense) after
<br>
the first failure by the time it finds another potential partner so much
<br>
time has passed that things have expanded and cooled off.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; In fact if Teller Simple Super would have widhth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of several hundreds meters it would work.
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit.
