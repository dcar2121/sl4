<p>
The main problem with giant planet explosion is that people think that
<br>
it is ridiculues before considering arguements. So they don''t
<br>
consider arguments and don''t find that they are much more convicing
<br>
than they thouight a priori. The same problem is  with strong AGI.
<br>
<p>Samanta: On what basis?  I estimate (with no basis but light knowledge
<br>
of astronomy and gravitational pressure for hydrogen to fuse) that
<br>
this is at least several  orders of magnitude too high.
<br>
<p>In the mentioned article &quot;detonation of plane atmospheras&quot; was told
<br>
that 1 to 300 concentration is enogh for detontion of oceans on the
<br>
earth. The pressure in the bowels of Jupiter is much higer.
<br>
<p>Samanta: any planet?
<br>
<p>Yes,  we can even detonate some ammounts of heavy water on the Earth,
<br>
if we find large deposits. Such deposits could be on the bottom of
<br>
Arctic ocean, where conditions are good for separation of heavy water.
<br>
(Because heavy water is 10 percent havier then ordinary water and
<br>
freeze on +4 C).
<br>
<p>Samanta: we would do it because?
<br>
<p>Because it is exellent Doomsaday machine for blackmail of all Solar
<br>
system, but it also could happened occasionaly.
<br>
<p>Samanta: 1 to 300. That is much, much richer than any naturally
<br>
occurring body we know of.
<br>
<p>Yes, we don''t know any object with such concentration (except some
<br>
nebulas of interstellar gas), but it doesn''t prove that such objects
<br>
are impossible. And they are quite probable because deiterium easily
<br>
separats from common hydrogen in many natural processes, like
<br>
freesing, mass separation and vaporation.
<br>
<p>And about the nebula was said: &quot;e.g., the D:H concentration ratio in
<br>
the ~10**2 ë Great Nebula in Orion is about 1:200. &quot; in the article
<br>
about theromonuclear detonation.
<br>
<p>Samanta: And how would you bring it up to such a concentration exactly
<br>
or have it spontaneously become that concentrated?
<br>
<p>If in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter the concentration is 1 to 1600,
<br>
then in the lower layers it is higher because of mass separation,
<br>
which is proved for helium,  - helium concentration is lowered in the
<br>
upper level of of Jupiter and Saturn atmospheres.
<br>
<p><p><p>Petter Wingren-Rasmussen :What are exactly the risks involved here?
<br>
Having a brief second sun in the sky wouldn't cause much in terms of
<br>
permanent damage to the planet.
<br>
<p><p>If all deiterium in the Jupiter reacts it would relize energy of 30
<br>
000 years of Sun work in less then 10 seconds.
<br>
In this case the Earth will lose its atmosphere and several kilometers
<br>
of upper curst.
<br>
<p>This risk is different from others, because it will affect ALL Solar
<br>
system, and NO spase bases on the Moon etc will save humanity.
<br>
<p>Petter Wingren-Rasmussen: However, lets assume its a real risk -
<br>
wouldnt it be (relatively) easy to solve by detonating Jupiter while
<br>
its on on the opposite side of the sun from earth?
<br>
<p>No, becasue the reaction will result in huge nucler radioactive
<br>
fallout which would reach  the Earth after several days or weeks.
