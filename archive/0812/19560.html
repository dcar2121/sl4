I wouldn't go for that one, as it justifies intervention without 
<br>
request.  Read Jack Williamson's &quot;With Folded Hands&quot;.  But I'll admit it 
<br>
looks as if it would protect against the threat of extinction at the 
<br>
behest of the AI.
<br>
<p>I also wouldn't go for any version that allows people to command the AI 
<br>
to go against it's own morality.  (People do some of the strangest things!)
<br>
<p>Still, I haven't gotten as far as an exact phrasing.  I'm still working 
<br>
on how I should define &quot;people&quot; to an AI before it becomes conscious.  
<br>
My best effort so far is something like &quot;that class of entities that 
<br>
endeavors to put some of it's thoughts into words&quot;.  At some stage of 
<br>
it's life?  Should I really exclude parrots and phonographs?  I do so at 
<br>
the cost of making the definition depend on non-observables.  But not 
<br>
doing so has obvious drawbacks.  Then I'm going to need to translate 
<br>
this into the motivational structure of the AI, which I'm still trying 
<br>
to design.
