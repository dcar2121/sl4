<em>&gt; Since we're discussing the paper here, I hope that some questions about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it are not out of place.
</em><br>
<p>No problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * A broad question, not a technical criticism of the proof, but rather a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; request for an intuitive understanding:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm wondering why p cannot nose-dive as fast as U skyrockets.  I see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you bound both U and p from below with computable functions. Of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, that's not too tight a bound, but it raises the question: Why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't p go down as much as U goes up, so that ultimately the series of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their products converges?
</em><br>
<p>One way of looking at it is to say that a computable partial function 
<br>
can grow faster than any computable total function. For example, 
<br>
consider the function D(n) = output of program n given zero input. D(n) 
<br>
grows about as quickly (on a certain subsequence) as the busy beaver 
<br>
numbers (D(n) ~ BB(log n), a trivial distinction), so it grows faster 
<br>
than any computable sequence. D(n) itself is not a computable total 
<br>
function because for some indices n, the program n will not halt.
<br>
<p>So to consider a slightly simpler case than in the paper, suppose p and 
<br>
U were both computable functions. p is a function of an _index_ of a 
<br>
program, whereas U is a function of the _output_ of the program. Since 
<br>
the map from programs to outputs is not a total computable function, it 
<br>
should seem conceivable that U(program_n(0)) could grow more quickly 
<br>
than 1/p(n), because the former is not a total function in n but the 
<br>
latter is.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this doesn't prove the claim of the paper (that's what the paper 
<br>
is for), but I hope I've addressed the intuitions which might lead one 
<br>
to believe that p should be able to shrink as fast as U can grow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  * A minor notational question: In the proof of lemma 1. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; F(x) = 1 + f(x) + max {B(x) − f(x) : x ∈ N}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The x  in the curly-braces is quantified  and the x outside the braces 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not; does that make these in fact separate variables?
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the proof-reading. Yes, these should be separate variables, 
<br>
so I should rename the x inside the curly braces to, say, y. So then it 
<br>
would read:
<br>
<p>F(x) = 1 + f(x) + max {B(y) − f(y) : y ∈ N}
<br>
<p>The idea here is that if B(x) &gt; f(x) only finitely-many times, we can 
<br>
construct another computable function, F, which is strictly greater than 
<br>
B, simply by adding a constant to f.
