<p>
Alexi,
<br>
<p>Let's get real here. 
<br>
<p>To fuse, deuterium nuclei have to come together physically in an area the
<br>
size of the atomic nucleus. This takes a great deal of pressure and heat.
<br>
More likely than two deuterium nuclei fusing is that a deuterium nucleus and
<br>
a hydrogen nucleus will fuse to form helium 3. I doubt that the pressures in
<br>
a gas giant are anything like high enough to support detonation of the whole
<br>
planet. Unlike nuclear fission, where fast neutron cause fission ahead of
<br>
the shock front resulting from the release of energy by prior fission events
<br>
and thus generate true detonations, fusion requires extremely high pressures
<br>
and temperatures such as are found in the centers of stars. 
<br>
<p>Even assuming that you could set of an H bomb in the center of a gas giant,
<br>
the heat released would cause the surrounding material to expand and thereby
<br>
reduce the probability of further fusion. As long as significant fusion
<br>
continues, there is a homeostatic relationship between pressure and the
<br>
release of heat. As the rate of fusion increases and more heat is released
<br>
the star expands to reduce the rate of fusion.
<br>
<p>Conceivably, if the temperature of a gas giant was raised locally by a bomb,
<br>
perhaps there would be enough pressure in the core to sustain a continuing
<br>
rate of fusion. With luck, you might end up with a short-lived brown dwarf.
<br>
Even if the surface temperature of the planet reached the temperature of the
<br>
Sun, several factors would mitigate any significant impact on the
<br>
temperature and ecology of the earth. 
<br>
<p>Earth's orbit has a radius of 1 AU, Jupiter's is 5 AU. At its very closest
<br>
approach to Earth, Jupiter is 4 times as far from Earth than the Sun is
<br>
every day, and has a radius a tenth that of the Sun, or a disk area of
<br>
1/100th that of the Sun. The amount of radiation drops of as a function of
<br>
the square of the distance. Thus, at closest approach, assuming equal
<br>
surface temperatures, the amount of radiation from Jupiter would be
<br>
something on the order of 1/1600 th of that from the Sun. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4^2 * 100
<br>
<p><p>When Earth and Jupiter are on opposite sides of the Sun, the distance is 6
<br>
AU, and thus, the amount of radiation received from Jupiter would be 1/3600
<br>
that of the Sun. 
<br>
<p>Also, the temperature of a star is a function of its mass (increasing as a
<br>
function of its mass) and that the gas composition of Jupiter is not greatly
<br>
different from that of the Sun, if fusion was sustained at all, it would
<br>
take place at a VERY much lower rate than in the Sun. 
<br>
<p>As it is, Jupiter is known to be radiating slightly more heat than it
<br>
absorbs from the Sun. Someone has suggested that the excess energy to
<br>
maintain the temperature above thermal equilibrium might actually be the
<br>
consequence of a very low rate of deuterium fusion already going on in the
<br>
core. More likely though is that the planet is still radiating heat from
<br>
gravitational contraction continuing from the time of its initial formation.
<br>
<p>In any event, your scenario that Earth would be threatened by a detonation
<br>
of deuterium within Jupiter is so far from what we know about astrophysical
<br>
processes and possibilities that it must be treated as pure fantasy. It is
<br>
simply too easily refuted by even the most basic understanding of nuclear
<br>
physics, astrophysics and classical astronomy.

<br>
<p>Look. There is a big difference between very slow burning of ordinary
<br>
hydrogen in  the Sun and detonation of deiterium. Detonation means
<br>
explosion.
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonation</a>
<br>
<p>Ordinary hydrogen could not detonate - the p-p reaction takes time.
<br>
D+D  could react immediately. So, D+D  could give an explosion, and
<br>
p+p - can''t.
<br>
<p>Ammount of D (deiterium) on the Jupiter is very large. If its
<br>
concentration is only 1 to 1600, then its ammount is in order of 20
<br>
masses of the Moon. This is in order of 10**24 кг.
<br>
<p>If all it reacts 1/100 of this mass will be transformed into energy.
<br>
It is 10**21 kg. it is aproximately 10**37 J.
<br>
<p><p>But the Sun every second creates only 10**26 J (3.83×10**26 W)
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun</a>
<br>
<p>That means that if reaction would take 1 second, the Jupiter will
<br>
shine 10**11 times brighter then the Sun.
<br>
<p>This is 100 billion times!
<br>
<p>This is upper limit, of course, and we could reduce it on several
<br>
orders of magnitude easily, because not all D will react, because
<br>
Jupiter is futher from the earth then Sun (and so earth would receive
<br>
25 times less share of its energy) and so on.
<br>
<p>But it still huge enough to think about it.
