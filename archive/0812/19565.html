<p>
Not sure of what kind of methodology you think of when you talk about these
<br>
things - but as have been discussed regarding selfimprovement, an AI will
<br>
try to find ways to circumvent a hardwired thing like
<br>
self-improvement=nausea (or the AI equivalent).
<br>
<p>Taking human beings as an example: about 1500-2000 years ago Islam and
<br>
Christianity tried to imprint rules on us to follow, with fairly good
<br>
success. (Ie the ten commandments, believe in God and his representatives on
<br>
earth - Heaven if you do, Hell if you dont).
<br>
Nowadays few academics (ie those that drive our evolution forward) believe
<br>
in this reward/punishment model and even fewer take the rules literally.
<br>
This development has taken about 80 generations.
<br>
<p>Now traits that we have that have came into being through evolution (for
<br>
example all kinds of phobias) are still fairly active in all types of
<br>
people. There are no spiders in Scandinavia, but arachnophobia is still
<br>
pretty common and there has been people here since 10.000 BC.
<br>
<p>If we should use evolitionary pressure it will be much harder to imprint
<br>
detailed rules in an AI. I believe however that the stability it will
<br>
provide is well worth the tradeoff.
