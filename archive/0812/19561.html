<em>&gt; @Stuart, what about &quot;Above efficiency and all other goals, put first the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival and overall health of the species homo sapiens and its direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological descendants [in the case of speciation]. Do not commit any action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may conflict with this goal.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Too easy :-)
<br>
<p>&quot;Folded hands&quot; is far too mild a dystopia for what can go wrong here.
<br>
First note that you have put this goal above all other goals - a very
<br>
dangerous step.
<br>
<p>First of all, the AI will take control of human reproduction.
<br>
Depending on what you mean by &quot;the species and its desendants&quot; it will
<br>
either forbid humans from reproduction, or carry out its own mass
<br>
artificial reproduction. In all cases, standard human reproduction
<br>
will be a dangerous risk for both mother and child, and hence will be
<br>
banned.
<br>
<p>Secondly, the AI will entomb each human in an artificial coffin,
<br>
feeding them intraveinously and keeping them safe from any exterior or
<br>
self-inflicted damage. If mental health is not included in &quot;health&quot;,
<br>
then the AI will destroy people's brains and keep their bodies
<br>
healthy. If mental health is included, then the AI will probably store
<br>
brains and bodies seperately (uploading the brains, if that is allowed
<br>
by its definition of health), and keep the brains mentally healthy.
<br>
<p>The best way to keep humans mentaly healthy would be through either
<br>
constant drugs and/or a lobotomy of their higher brain functions
<br>
(drugs being preferred if &quot;lobotomy&quot; is forbiden by the AI's
<br>
definition of health). The best efficient method would probably be to
<br>
regress everyone to six-mounth old status, suppress the parts of the
<br>
brain that refer to boredom, and keep them experiencing the same fuzzy
<br>
and warm experience - moving colours, heat, a full belly, a mother's
<br>
voice - for all eternity.
<br>
<p>Why would the AI do that? Because it values health above all else -
<br>
above any objections you might have to this behaviour. It will
<br>
disregard human orders, human rights, human fondess for variety,
<br>
human fondness for occasional pain and challenge, or human programmers
<br>
screaming &quot;that's not what we meant&quot; - because it is compelled to by
<br>
its code.
<br>
<p>Stuart
<br>
<p>PS: If you want to claim that the AI will not behave the way described
<br>
above because of your own definition of mental health, please send me
<br>
your definition of mental health.
