</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the mentioned article &quot;detonation of plane atmospheras&quot; was told

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samanta: any planet?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes,  we can even detonate some ammounts of heavy water on the Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we find large deposits. Such deposits could be on the bottom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arctic ocean, where conditions are good for separation of heavy water.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Because heavy water is 10 percent havier then ordinary water and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freeze on +4 C).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samanta: we would do it because?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because it is exellent Doomsaday machine for blackmail of all Solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, but it also could happened occasionaly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samanta: 1 to 300. That is much, much richer than any naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurring body we know of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, we don''t know any object with such concentration (except some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nebulas of interstellar gas), but it doesn''t prove that such objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are impossible. And they are quite probable because deiterium easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separats from common hydrogen in many natural processes, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freesing, mass separation and vaporation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And about the nebula was said: &quot;e.g., the D:H concentration ratio in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ~10**2 ë Great Nebula in Orion is about 1:200. &quot; in the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about theromonuclear detonation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samanta: And how would you bring it up to such a concentration exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or have it spontaneously become that concentrated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter the concentration is 1 to 1600,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then in the lower layers it is higher because of mass separation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is proved for helium,  - helium concentration is lowered in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upper level of of Jupiter and Saturn atmospheres.

<em>&gt; Petter Wingren-Rasmussen :What are exactly the risks involved here?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If all deiterium in the Jupiter reacts it would relize energy of 30

<em>&gt; 000 years of Sun work in less then 10 seconds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case the Earth will lose its atmosphere and several kilometers

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This risk is different from others, because it will affect ALL Solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, and NO spase bases on the Moon etc will save humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Petter Wingren-Rasmussen: However, lets assume its a real risk -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldnt it be (relatively) easy to solve by detonating Jupiter while

<em>&gt; its on on the opposite side of the sun from earth?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, becasue the reaction will result in huge nucler radioactive

It seems to me that were your assertions correct, then we would have had 
<br>
working hydrogen fusion decades ago.  As such I find myself compelled to 
<br>
presume that either your sources (for conditions of detonation) are 
<br>
incorrect, or that you have grossly misunderstood what they were 
<br>
saying.  I know for a (reported, not witnessed) fact that heavy water 
<br>
has been used as a coolant in fission reactors.  It didn't explode.
<br>
<p>Now I'm not capable of doing the calculations to determine conditions 
<br>
for the fusion of Deuterium, but the popular reports that I have read 
<br>
all indicate that it requires something that would cause the nuclei to 
<br>
collide with considerable force.  Such force that we have not been able 
<br>
to manage it (to a significant degree) on purpose except with the assist 
<br>
of a fission bomb.  As such, I'm rather certain that you have 
<br>
misunderstood the conditions required for detonation.
