I still think I understand what you are saying, and yes, it would be 
<br>
economically advantageous to kill off (or at least fail to support) 
<br>
people.  But this only dominates if economics is the most significant 
<br>
motive.  I may not believe that &quot;Friendly AI&quot; is actually possible, but 
<br>
I do believe that an AI with a goal defined morality is.  And economics 
<br>
would not dominate, if I were the designer.  It would be important, 
<br>
because it must be, but other things would be more important.  And one 
<br>
of those would be not acting in ways that were more detrimental to human 
<br>
survival that the majority of humans would act.  (I'm being a bit 
<br>
weasely here, because I don't have a clear design in mind.)
<br>
<p>To project actions one must assume a motivational structure.  To me it 
<br>
seems as if, by default, you are adopting a human model.  If you are 
<br>
not, then I admit that I don't understand your point, but then you also 
<br>
aren't explaining it.  To me it looks as if you are assuming an 
<br>
&quot;economic determinism&quot; model, which is oversimplified even when applied 
<br>
only to people.  (Note that there are still a multitude of dogs and cats 
<br>
around, which economic determinism would also have consigned to be 
<br>
discarded.)
<br>
<p>Possibly you are considering that organizations run by people and 
<br>
composed of people as the executive agents don't have human motivational 
<br>
structure.  This isn't exactly correct, though they certainly amplify 
<br>
certain elements of human nature and suppress others.  But it's not 
<br>
clear that an AI would be designed to so depress it's inherent 
<br>
morality.  (It's not clear that it wouldn't, but I wouldn't design it to 
<br>
suppress it's morality.  I'd consider that an existential risk.  Perhaps 
<br>
this is the focus of our divergent predictions.)
