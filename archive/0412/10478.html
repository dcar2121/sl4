This looks potentially interesting and relevant.

<br>
<p>AAAI FALL 2005 SYMPOSIUM ON MACHINE ETHICS
<br>
<p>Call for Participation
<br>
<p>Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has
<br>
largely focused on responsible and
<br>
irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being
<br>
interested in how human beings ought to
<br>
treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical
<br>
reasoning. The time has come for adding
<br>
an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical
<br>
ramifications of behavior involving
<br>
machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy,
<br>
necessitates this. In contrast to
<br>
computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics
<br>
normally ascribed to computer ethics,
<br>
machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human
<br>
users and other machines.
<br>
<p>We contend that research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns
<br>
with autonomous systems—it could be
<br>
argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at
<br>
the root of all fear concerning
<br>
machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable
<br>
the discovery of problems with current
<br>
ethical theories, advancing our thinking about ethics. We intend to bring
<br>
together interested participants from a wide
<br>
variety of disciplines to the end of forging a set of common goals for
<br>
machine ethics investigation and the research
<br>
agendas required to accomplish them. Topics of interest include, but are not
<br>
restricted to:
<br>
<p>.. improvement of interaction between artificially and naturally intelligent
<br>
systems through the addition of an
<br>
ethical dimension to artificially intelligent systems
<br>
.. enhancement of machine-machine communication and cooperation through an
<br>
ethical dimension
<br>
.. design of systems that provide expert guidance in ethical matters
<br>
.. deeper understanding of ethical theories through computational simulation
<br>
.. development of decision procedures for ethical theories that have
<br>
multiple prima facie duties
<br>
.. computability of ethics
<br>
.. theoretical and practical objections to machine ethics
<br>
.. impact of machine ethics on society
<br>
<p>Submission Information
<br>
<p>Potential participants are requested to submit either a full technical paper
<br>
(not exceeding 5000 words) or a brief
<br>
statement of interest (not exceeding 1000 words). Also invited are proposals
<br>
for panels that state one or more
<br>
fundamental issues/questions concerning machine ethics and take a stand on
<br>
them supported by cogent arguments.
<br>
Send submissions via email attachments to anderson@hartford.edu. Further
<br>
