<em>&gt; Modafinil, for example, was designed by my boss's colleague, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man whom we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has overhyped the product, and we're thinking about starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trials to test its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficacy against caffeine.  Previous work has shown that Modafinil only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marginally improves psychomotor vigilance over repeated doses of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caffeine, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's nowhere near as potent as amphetamines.  It's a glutamate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agonist, though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so it doesn't have the addiction potential of the dopaminergic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drugs, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't create the anxiety that caffeine does.  I doubt the claim that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMPROVES intelligence/cognitive ability.  More than likely, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extends your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to remain at your innate peak performance.
</em><br>
<p>In my personal experience, modafinil allows me to stay awake all night and
<br>
then operate at 90% of my normal effectiveness the following day.  Caffeine
<br>
does not do that.   I've never taken amphetamines, but my impression is that
<br>
they have a lot of side-effects including psychological ones, whereas
<br>
modafinil seems not to.
<br>
<p>Modafinil seems to give a mild mood lift, but doesn't appear to me to
<br>
improve my cognitive ability in any way.  Perhaps due to its mood elevating
<br>
effects it makes some people *happier* with their cognitive ability, rather
<br>
than actually improving it ;-)
<br>
<p>On the other hand, a friend of mine took modafinil and said it made her feel
<br>
too weird and lightheaded and nervous, although it did let her stay awake a
<br>
long time.  She won't take it anymore.  So not surprisingly, as with many
<br>
drugs, the effect shows a lot of individual variation.
