</em><br>
<p>This is precisely why they are NPC's even if they
<br>
are part of the PC. Your dream characters do not
<br>
have full agency because your 'self-symbol' or
<br>
self-awareness is functionally separate from
<br>
them. If a dream character includes your
<br>
self-symbol as part of the activated neural
<br>
pattern, you do not report in the morning that &quot;I
<br>
dreamed of a pirate who was fully self-aware&quot;,
<br>
you report &quot;I dreamed I was a pirate.&quot; You could
<br>
dream of a character who was not you, while
<br>
knowing from within that it was not you, but then
<br>
you would report something like &quot;I dreamed I was
<br>
a pirate, but somehow I knew that the pirate was
<br>
not me.&quot; In the end, whatever you do encounter is
<br>
part of you, even the feeling that it is not.
<br>
But, ahem, this is a bit far afield of the
<br>
original topic. I don't want to go in circles
<br>
about theodicy either, except to note that Tipler
<br>
asserts any cosmology will eventually engulf
<br>
theology as more mysteries become explainable
<br>
facts, and when one is building worlds (however
<br>
sim or real) one becomes responsible for deciding
<br>
about such issues as agency and suffering within
<br>
them.
<br>
Also, it's well to remember that most of us are a
<br>
bit gullible about Turing tests and are apt to
<br>
assign agency to a telephone answering machine,
<br>
if the replies are cleverly arranged enough.
<br>
<p>I once descended a spiral stair to a shop
<br>
somewhere on Cape Cod and heard a well-bred
<br>
middle-aged lady greet me with the warmest, most
<br>
convivial &quot;Hello!&quot; you could ask for. She was a
<br>
mynah bird.
