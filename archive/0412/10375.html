<p>
I must give a brief apoligy for my previous post, my current situation
<br>
and frequent bouts of depression have given my a rather jaundiced view 
<br>
on reality. Sorry for my unproductive angst.

<em>&gt; It is probably one of the most fundamental instances of  free will we

</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewed from a longer perspective.   Also it is important to realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that what you think of yourself and your possibilities in the current
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; says very little about what is ultimately possible or about you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running in much improved circumstances with better instantiation at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher capability.
</em><br>
<p>What I was trying to allude to was that I am fully open to achieving
<br>
a rather constant desire to exist and live. Every now and then I do
<br>
get this, which is what keeps me going I guess, as well as the
<br>
incredible difficulty in finding a full proof method of
<br>
self-termination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seeming not smart enough now is not very important compared to how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart you can become.   It is a huge loss to our species that most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us can't think beyond what is in front of us and our programming to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date to see what is possible and commit to making it real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once you are dead then one set of possibilities is ended.   Game Over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for you and all potential that started with you now.  No more chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to play and thus no chance to win or to find/create a compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;reason to be&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'm aware that it isn't important in the long term picture, but
<br>
being the creatures we are it is difficult to just wait around
<br>
5-20 years hoping that the ability to improve ourselves will
<br>
eventuate while still getting on with ones hum-drum existance.
<br>
In the mean time I am doing everything I can to elevate my
<br>
intelligence/consiousness: meditation, daily exercise, healthy
<br>
eating, various nootropics.
<br>
<p>Once dead the possibilities for someone do end, but my point
<br>
is that the end of these possibilities are only a concern for other
<br>
observers, not the now non-existant person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Perhaps if the things going on in the world didn't seem so bleak and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;general populace so uncaring and ignorant then I'd feel more kinship for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;other people and that there was a point to everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel kinship with them simply because I find what is &quot;out there&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be &quot;in here&quot; also.  The point to everything is what we make the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be.  It is not something handed to us from outside.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps that is my problem, I don't associate alot of what is &quot;out 
<br>
there&quot; with my inner space. I don't expect to be handed a meaning to 
<br>
life, but when the majority of humanity has no foresight to where we
<br>
are going it makes me unsure of any reason to continue.
<br>
<p>I guess that is why I love SL4 and some of the people I've met, because
<br>
we are looking ahead and I feel less disjointed from society. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Anyhow, despite my blase attitude to nonexistance, I'm still doing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I can to forward the singularity so that maybe my attitude will change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you will have to deal with your attitude on your own.  
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but I meant that once the singularity occurs there will be so many
<br>
things that will make me want to stay around and see what is in store
<br>
for us all.
<br>
<p>NB: I guess this really is slightly distant from any real SL4 topic,
<br>
so if you want to continue conversation maybe we should do so off list?
