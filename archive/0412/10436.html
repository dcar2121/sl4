<p>Well, here's a nutshell of what I really think is
<br>
going on:
<br>
Look at, say, a visual graph of the Mandelbrot
<br>
set, which you can zoom in on and find similar
<br>
but not identical detail at any arbitrary level,
<br>
so that the Mandelbrot set is a sort of
<br>
'information multiverse'. You could enlarge it so
<br>
much that you had a printout of a trillion
<br>
trillion square feet, and each square foot
<br>
encodes uniquely a certain amount of data, which
<br>
can be enlarged just as much again if you want.
<br>
If we analyze a single square foot, we may be
<br>
able to 'reverse-engineer' the much simpler
<br>
formula that gives rise to the whole set. It's
<br>
much simpler (Occam's razor) to conclude that
<br>
this simple formula has created the graph, and
<br>
that there are a trillion trillion other sections
<br>
making up the whole picture even if we have but
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>Our visible universe can be expressed as a
<br>
certain amount of information. In fact, our
<br>
existence at the most elemental levels (QM) is so
<br>
'information-like' rather than 'stuff-like' that
<br>
there is nothing silly about regarding it as part
<br>
of a larger set. Insisting that we live in the
<br>
'only universe' sounds to me like saying that
<br>
75698725623 is the only number, and the others
<br>
are useful but somehow artificial.
<br>
<p>It is easy to get around this objection by
<br>
invoking the idea that a single
<br>
complexity-generating phenomenon underwrites all
<br>
realities: perhaps a sort of Mandelbrot set-like
<br>
fractal composed of a binary arrangement of two
<br>
possible states: exist, unexist. Because no
<br>
matter how far we delve into the physics toward
<br>
unified and comprehensive theories, the biggest
<br>
mystery is still that stubborn background. Why
<br>
does anything exist at all?
<br>
<p>If we posit only one universe, we have to explain
<br>
many, many things about it, as well as the
<br>
stubborn background. It is oddly and delicately
<br>
balanced for us to exist, against enormous odds
<br>
if several 'cosmic constants' were of different
<br>
strengths. A complexity generator that creates
<br>
all logically possible universes explains our
<br>
being as an inevitable thing.
<br>
<p>Another way to illustrate the MWI as a logical
<br>
solution is to look at a chessboard. Now suppose
<br>
that each possible arrangement of the pieces
<br>
codes for the physical state of a very, very
<br>
small universe. You might have just enough
<br>
information to completely describe a few
<br>
elementary particles. Any micro-universe
<br>
corresponding to one of the possible meetings of
<br>
pieces in a game is a lawful universe under the
<br>
chess physics we describe. There are a few
<br>
combinations of pieces which cannot occur,
<br>
especially early in the game. You can't just move
<br>
all your pawns past your opponent's pawns without
<br>
some disruption in the line. You can't start with
<br>
your pawns lined up in front of your pieces. So
<br>
if we were using chess to run an micro-universe,
<br>
these impossible positions would be parts of the
<br>
equation that never happened in that little
<br>
universe in any possible history.
<br>
<p>We also get the concept of time since any given
<br>
arrangement can only be lawfully derived in chess
<br>
by certain preceding moves. It can only be
<br>
followed by certain moves. How much 'free will'
<br>
does a particle coded for by a game position
<br>
have? It is free under chess physics rules to
<br>
follow any path coded for by logical paths from
<br>
that position. There will be plenty of possible
<br>
future arrangements which can never be, because
<br>
they require a series of moves that is not
<br>
allowed.
<br>
We can follow the particles through chess
<br>
universes by thinking of each succeeding possible
<br>
arrangement of the chessboard as a page in a
<br>
flipbook, and we get time by flipping the pages
<br>
with our thumbs. It's the creation of the
<br>
universe and the birth of cinema!
<br>
<p>For amusement, watch this Java replay of perhaps
<br>
the oldest recorded game of chess (from 1475),
<br>
which just turned up in a googling of the phrase
<br>
chess universe.

<br>
<p>When you hit the forward button, just think of
<br>
the pieces as elementary particles, reacting in
<br>
strict faith to the rules, as if the game were a
<br>
carefully planned dance. Chess is a pretty good
<br>
complexity generator to watch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--*--
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the form .... but it is only theory ....
<br>
<p>So: Tegmark, in his article, bids to be the
<br>
Linnaeus of theoretically possible universes,
<br>
dividing the universe kingdoms into their phyla
<br>
of mathematically permitted constructions. He
<br>
isn't telling us they do exist, yet. He's talking
<br>
about what might be permitted by any possible
<br>
physics, and how to detect it. I suppose my
<br>
little chess universe is an educational toy model
<br>
of a Level IV, by the look of it.
<br>
I'll give Max Tegmark the last word:

Parallel Universes
<br>
Author:
<br>
Max Tegmark
<br>
Abstract:
<br>
I survey physics theories involving parallel
<br>
universes, which form a natural four-level
<br>
hierarchy of multiverses allowing progressively
<br>
greater diversity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Level I: A generic prediction of inflation
<br>
is an infinite ergodic universe, which contains
<br>
Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions -
<br>
including an identical copy of you about
<br>
10^{10^29} meters away.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Level II: In chaotic inflation, other
<br>
thermalized regions may have different effective
<br>
physical constants, dimensionality and particle
<br>
content.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Level III: In unitary quantum mechanics,
<br>
other branches of the wavefunction add nothing
<br>
qualitatively new, which is ironic given that
<br>
this level has historically been the most
<br>
controversial.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Level IV: Other mathematical structures
<br>
give different fundamental equations of physics. 
<br>
<p>The key question is not whether parallel
<br>
universes exist (Level I is the uncontroversial
<br>
cosmological concordance model), but how many
<br>
levels there are. I discuss how multiverse models
<br>
can be falsified and argue that there is a severe
<br>
&quot;measure problem&quot; that must be solved to make
<br>
testable predictions at levels II-IV&quot;
