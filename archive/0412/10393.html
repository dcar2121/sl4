<em>&gt; AI research itself has had a poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; track record, so why do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume future AI research will be more prodigious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than future nanotech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics, biomedical research, etc.?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hans Moravec has estimated the processor power
<br>
required for AI is 10 Tflops.  Until a few years
<br>
ago no machine was that powerful, and right now
<br>
no machine used for AI research (as far as I know)
<br>
is that powerful yet.  So AI progess has been
<br>
held up by lack of suitable hardware.
<br>
<p>I believe that if you plot the complexity of the
<br>
AI software measured in lines of code or similar
<br>
metric vs processor power required to achieve AI,
<br>
there will be some curve below which human-equivalent
<br>
AI can't be done, and above which it can. 
<br>
Unfortunately, we have very little idea where that
<br>
curve lies.
<br>
<p>At one extreme, you could have a program that is
<br>
as simple as:
<br>
<p>For NEURON = 1 to 10^11
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Update state of NEURON
<br>
NEXT
<br>
<p>Where NEURON is a sufficiently detailed model of
<br>
human neurons to behave similarly.
<br>
<p>I call this the 'brute force' approach, and my
<br>
wild-assed gues is that it would require on the
<br>
order of 3000 Tflops to run at human real-time 
<br>
rate, but I wouldn't be surprised to be off by
<br>
a factor of 30.
<br>
<p>At the other extreme, the size of the software would
<br>
dominate the processor power costs when trying to
<br>
configure a system (RAM and Disk storage) or would
<br>
create data transfer bottlenecks.  So beyond some
<br>
point it dosn't make sense to try to save processor
<br>
power with better software.
<br>
<p>An example at the other extreme would be a lookup
<br>
table that answers every question that can be asked.
<br>
Huge storage requirement, but not very much processor
<br>
time to answer any given question.
<br>
<p>Looking at developing an AI from another angle, the
<br>
human Genome and a Windows XP installation CD have
<br>
about the same data storage capacity (~700 MB).  The
<br>
human genome generates a human intellect, so in theory
<br>
a piece of software of similar complexity should
<br>
be able to generate an AI. but
<br>
<p>But no AI project has come within several orders of
<br>
magnitude of the resources Microsoft has used to
<br>
develop their operating system, and their product
<br>
is still a long way from having the 20 year uptime
<br>
it takes a human to mature.
<br>
<p>So besides inadequate hardware to date, another
<br>
explanation of AI research's poor track record is
<br>
inadequate software development resources.
<br>
