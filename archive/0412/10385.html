<em>&gt; &gt; It just isn't cold enough.  The numbers are here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/HowColdIsColdEnough.html">http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/HowColdIsColdEnough.html</a>

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Right now, if your LN2 supply is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;disrupted, you will lose the patients when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;evaporates.  Down there, at least the frozen will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;remain frozen, so you will have longer to recover.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me try to be clearer - I'm not suggesting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patients are stored at Antarctic temps.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the LN2 will last longer in Antarctica than Riverside,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CA (where Alcor is now).
</em><br>
<p>Ah ... I hate to tell you this, but Alcor moved out of Riverside over ten 
<br>
years ago.  They are in Scottsdale, Arizona and have been since early 1994.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Vostok station has a wintertime air temperature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-65C.  Since the sun never gets very high, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;erect a reflective fence to keep the sun off a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patch of ground, then place heat pipes in the ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt;connected to radiators pointed at the sky to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passive cooling.
</em><br>
<p>This is called a thermal diode.  You use a liquid that condenses and runs 
<br>
back down the tube when it is colder above ground than below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This should get the ice down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-80 to -100C.
</em><br>
<p>Heat loss is more or less delta T dependant.  So the cut in LN2 use would 
<br>
be (300-77) deg K -(200-77) deg K)/300-77 deg K, a saving of less than half 
<br>
in LN2 consumption.
<br>
<p>LN2 cost in the range of $0.50 a liter.  You have to either transport fuel 
<br>
and make it on the spot or transport it in.  I don't have a number for the 
<br>
cost of shipping to Vostok station, do you?  Besides the LN2 or fuel, you 
<br>
have to bring in supplies for the staff.  This isn't the kind of operation 
<br>
you can leave to take care of itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Into this chilled patch of ice you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;install your insulated LN2 storage chamber.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designing cryogenic tanks for spacecraft, the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results are obtained using multi-layer insulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consisting of many layers of reflective foil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;separated by plastic netting, all in a vacuum.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly how it is done on with Alcor's dewars.  Incidentally, when 
<br>
Alcor's dewars were in un airconditioned space  in Riverside you could see 
<br>
the difference between winter and summer LN2 consumption, but it wasn't 
<br>
very much, a few percent.
<br>
<p>The heat leakage is so low that the only way to improve it is to make the 
<br>
neck longer since that is the major heat leak.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Aerogel might do better, but I haven't seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;performance numbers for it.
</em><br>
<p>Not nearly as good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So you build essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a large insulated dewar flask underground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This type of storage should keep the LN2 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years, possibly longer.
</em><br>
<p>The best dewars have boil off rates in the 1-2% per day range.  Alcor keeps 
<br>
the patient dewars topped up so they could go perhaps 6 weeks in an 
<br>
emergency without being refilled.
<br>
<p>The engineering of these things is *not* simple.  They have to maintain a 
<br>
hard vacuum for many years and the stress on the shells is substantial, 
<br>
over a ton per square foot of surface due to air pressure.  Above some size 
<br>
measured in single digit feet, it becomes better to do it with blocks of 
<br>
foam.  This doesn't work well either because the performance of the foam 
<br>
declines as it gets colder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The bigger you make it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the longer the storage time will be without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replenishment - It's a surface to volume ratio
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship.  Yes, doing anything in Antarctica
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is horribly expensive right now, so it probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes more sense to stay in California for now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but if technology improves to the point of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replicating robot factories, such projects could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be relatively affordable.
</em><br>
<p>If we get a bit further to nanotechnology we won't need this stopgap 
<br>
measure at all.
<br>
<p>This is getting a bit far from friendly AI.  It is applicable to those of 
<br>
us who won't make it to the singularity without help though.
