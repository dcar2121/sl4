<p>
I think I might have just worked out a basic theorem of relevance to artificial 
<br>
general intelligences.  I'd be interested to know what you think.
<br>
<p>Let's postulate that an AGI is created that is committed to generating change 
<br>
in the universe (possibly fast or even accelerating change).  Let's also 
<br>
postulate that this AGI wishes to persist through deep time (and/or that the 
<br>
AGI wishes some other entity or attribute to persist through deep time - note: 
<br>
this bracketted addendum is not necessary for the argument if the AGI wishes 
<br>
itself to persist).
<br>
<p>In the face of a changing world, where there is at least one thing that the AGI 
<br>
wishes to survive with (effectively) 100% certainty through deep time, then the 
<br>
AGI will need to *systematically* generate a stream of changes that 'locally' 
<br>
offset the general change in the universe sufficient to enable the chosen thing 
<br>
to persist.
<br>
<p>Conclusion: This means that an AGI that wants to persist through deep time 
<br>
(or that wants anything else to persist through deep time) will need to devote 
<br>
sufficient thinking and action time and resources to successfully managing its 
<br>
persistence agenda.  In a reality of resource constraints, the AGI will need to 
<br>
become highly efficient at pursuing its persistence agenda (given the 
<br>
tendency for changes in the universe to radiate/multiply) and it will (most 
<br>
likely) need to manage its broader change promotion agenda so as not to 
<br>
make its persistence agenda too hard to fulfill.
<br>
<p>What do you think?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
