<p>
Hope no one here is annoyed by this, but I have to ask
<br>
the question, since many here profess to believe in
<br>
the 'Many Worlds' interpretation of qauntum mechanics,
<br>
yet at the same time, several leading transhumanists
<br>
(Eli and Klein) were recently lamenting the death of
<br>
loved ones.
<br>
<p>Isn't it really the case that lost loved ones have
<br>
*not* in fact been obliterated, *if* in fact, MWI is
<br>
true?  Their consciousness has simply concentrated in
<br>
the QM branches where they survived has it not?
<br>
<p>I've really been thinking hard about the MWI of late. 
<br>
One major hypothesis I'm favoring is that the strength
<br>
of consciousness in a given time track is *weighed*
<br>
according the frequency of qauntum states
<br>
corresponding to that particular time track.  For
<br>
instance this implies that low probability time tracks
<br>
wouldn't have strongly conscious observers associated
<br>
with them.  Any thoughts on this?
<br>
<p>Another thought that has occurred to me is that MWI
<br>
seems to create difficulties for the ethics of
<br>
computer simulations.  For instance, a major argument
<br>
against ancestral simulations is that it would be
<br>
unethical because of the suffering created.  But if
<br>
MWI is true, all these computations already exist with
<br>
a certain frequency anyway, and if we run an ancestral
<br>
simulation which matches the real universe then we
<br>
will not have changed the frequency of time tracks
<br>
where suffering is occuring, so why would it be
<br>
unethical?
<br>
<p>Food for thought.
