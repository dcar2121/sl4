Simon Gordon: &quot;This is illogical. If the world does end because of a
<br>
Singularity it will only be the simulated world that has ended, which
<br>
doesnt matter right?&quot;
<br>
Robin Lee Powell: &quot;It matters a lot to the people who only exist in
<br>
the simulation, i.e. you and me.
<br>
Simon: &quot;You are telling me you are an NPC? Ok. But speak for yourself ;-)&quot;
<br>
<p>For &quot;Robin exists only in the simulation&quot; to imply &quot;Robin is an NPC&quot;
<br>
(hence &quot;Robin is a non-conscious, non-volitional 'prop' character
<br>
whose actions are decided by a 'Dungeon Master' - or Simulation Master
<br>
in this case, I suppose&quot;), you would need the additional premise that
<br>
computation (e.g., a simulation) cannot give rise to consciousness.
<br>
One would imagine that to be a rather unconventional view among
<br>
SL4ers.
<br>
<p>Simon, do you believe real AI is not possible? Or that, even if it
<br>
could appear to be a thinking thing, it would somehow not possess
<br>
consciousness? (Or possess a lesser consciousness than humans?)
<br>
<p>If not, your allusion is misleading. Robin, me, and you could all be
<br>
conscious beings who only exist in a computer simulation, without
<br>
being &quot;NPCs&quot;.
<br>
-----
<br>
Simon: &quot;An individual consciousness that was terminated would
<br>
presumably return to the world where it began prior to entering the
<br>
simulation.&quot;
<br>
<p>This again implies that a consciousness in a computer simulation could
<br>
not have originated there. Since this is contrary to common
<br>
Singularitarian views, it not surprising struck Robin as a bizarre
<br>
assumption. I find it strange as well.
<br>
-----
<br>
Simon: &quot;I suppose it boils down to what you would expect the ethical
<br>
standards of our hosts to be. Would they really allow sentient beings
<br>
to be born and destroyed for self-interest in the same way that humans
<br>
treat cattle? Or is it more likely that we are here for experience or
<br>
education or some other perhaps more sophisticated motive?&quot;
<br>
<p>Here, I agree; the moral status attributed to sentient Sims (following
<br>
Weatherson's reply to Bostrom) by the maintainers of the simulation
<br>
(if any have stuck around to watch over us) is critical to whether
<br>
Sims should fear for their lives. But, seeing as we have no direct
<br>
knowledge of our sim-creators, any assumption about their ethics is
<br>
dubious at best, so we can and should take seriously the possibility
<br>
that our sim-creators do not care about our well-being.
<br>
<p>Further, the argument from evil (*) has a clear analogue in this
<br>
situation. Given the amount of suffering in our world, some may find
<br>
it implausible our sim-creators could have any concern for our
<br>
well-being.
<br>
<p>(*) argues that if there is a God, It is not notably benevolent,
<br>
because a benevolent deity would've created a world with less
<br>
suffering than ours has. For more details, see
