<em>&gt; You mean that when you write code, you have no way of knowing what any
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; time?  That must make it awfully difficult to write code.  How many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomly generated strings do you need to test before you find one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compiles?
</em><br>
<p>The distinction is between writing code to a specification, and
<br>
deciding what the specification should be.
<br>
<p>If I know what output a program needs to produce for a given input,
<br>
and write code to do this... well, in practice, I can never be quite
<br>
sure my code is correct, and it needs to be tested to be even somewhat
<br>
sure of that. However, if I know the desired output well enough that I
<br>
could write it into a formal spec, I _could_ in principle write code
<br>
together with a formal proof of correctness (not that there's ever
<br>
time to do that in practice, but in principle an AI might be able to
<br>
do this faster than I can).
<br>
<p>However, formal proof is relative to a formal specification. Improving
<br>
the intelligence of an AI (as opposed to merely its computational
<br>
efficiency) involves changing the output - so if there was a formal
<br>
specification of the old version, the specification will have to be
<br>
changed; therefore, formal proof no longer applies.
<br>
<p>So how do you propose to solve this problem?
<br>
<p>(Disclaimer of personal bias: I'd like full recursive self-improvement
<br>
to work, so I'm hoping for a reply that'll make me go &quot;oh, yes, I
<br>
hadn't thought of that; now I see how that could work&quot;, though I
<br>
unfortunately think that's unlikely.)
