<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reasoning is this:  sometime between 2020-2030,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano revolution is going to start hitting, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk from existential threats (Terrorist goo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfriendly A.I)  is really going to start becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant.  
</em><br>
<p>Manufacturing productivity trends point to highly
<br>
automated production arriving in 10-15 years.  The
<br>
trends I track are for the US durable goods sector
<br>
(things designed to last more than 3 years), which
<br>
is the total productivity for all existing plants
<br>
in place no matter how old or new.  The trend for
<br>
new factories is already highly automated.  For
<br>
example, a current news story:
<br>
<a href="http://www.turkishpress.com/business/news.asp?id=041206130347.becjyfy6.xml">http://www.turkishpress.com/business/news.asp?id=041206130347.becjyfy6.xml</a>
<br>
says Samsung will invest $24 billion in chip
<br>
factories in the next 6 years, which will yield
<br>
10,000 new jobs.  That's $2.4 million in factory
<br>
investment per job.  
<br>
<p>Compare that to an established
<br>
set of factories like Boeing's (whom I work for).
<br>
We have $8.3 billion in plant and equipment for
<br>
157,000 employees, or $53K per person.
<br>
<p>It's just going to take a while for the new highly
<br>
automated factories to take over the bulk of the
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>Once retail stores like WalMart go to robots for
<br>
stocking shelves, and automated self-checkout, and
<br>
factory production goes highly automated, there are
<br>
two big issues:
<br>
<p>1) What happens to the ~1/2 of the workforce that
<br>
has had their jobs automated?
<br>
<p>2) What becomes possible when a set of automated
<br>
factories can produce all of each other's parts,
<br>
or enough of each other's parts plus selling
<br>
surplus production to pay for the remainder, so that
<br>
they become a self-sustaining ecosystem?
<br>
<p>These issues will be hitting before the nanotech
<br>
and AI risks, most likely.  The manufacturing jobs
<br>
issue is already politically significant in US states
<br>
that have a high share of such. In this
<br>
economic recovery, productivity improvements are
<br>
eliminating jobs faster than demand increases are
<br>
creating them, so there is a net job loss in the
<br>
manufacturing sector.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A person 40 or under today has a greater than 50%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of living to 2040 naturally, even assuming no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant life extension.  So you see, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of an under-40 dying from existential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats assuming no FAI is roughly comparable to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of them dying through natural wear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tear.  The rational option is to prevent death then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<p>My plan involves building a strong defensible
<br>
residence in a remote location in case of civil
<br>
disruption in the next 10-15 years.  It happens it
<br>
will look like a castle, because medieval re-enactment
<br>
is my hobby.  But castles were defensible residences
<br>
in their time.  It won't stop a government attack,
<br>
but it should be proof against looters with small
<br>
arms.
<br>
<p>Part of what I want to do at the residence is study
<br>
automation/robotics/replication/parts closure.
<br>
The power source problem looks already solved.
<br>
Spectrolab, a division of Boeing that makes solar
<br>
cells mostly for satellites, has a triple-junction
<br>
cell that is 30% efficient at 400 suns.  So while
<br>
the cells themselves are more expensive per sq cm
<br>
than conventional solar cell panels, you don't need
<br>
very many square cm of cells, and reflectors are
<br>
much cheaper per square meter than semiconductors.
<br>
Overall they require 1/10 the dollar value of flat
<br>
panel cells for the same output, which makes solar a
<br>
cost competitive power source.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The one thing I'm reasonably sure about is this:  if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't get FAI before 2045 or so, then, to borrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrase from Damian Broderick's 'The Spike': '&quot;We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all perish most horribly&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What we need is for life expectancy to improve ten
<br>
times faster than it has been (i.e. 1.0 year per
<br>
year rather than 0.1 year per year).  At the current
<br>
rate of improvement, you can expect to live a few
<br>
years longer than the previous generation.  At a
<br>
sufficiently high rate of improvement, your chances
<br>
of lasting long enough for a long term-solution like
<br>
uploading improve dramatically.
<br>
<p>That can come in theory from piecemeal medical
<br>
advances each of which only adds a few years, but
<br>
in the aggregate add decades.
