<p>Thirty years ago it was sci-fi crazy talk. Now,
<br>
it's strong enough to get the *cover* of
<br>
Scientific American.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually says a lot about how reality really is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unknown.   It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubtful there could actually be a way to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; same laws.   We know of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no  way to prove the existence of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes.
</em><br>
<p>That's why they run experiments. As I recall,
<br>
recent progress in 'particle teleportation' tends
<br>
to support MWI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet we treat the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory so seriously as to use it to define our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps it is just me but this seems really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd.   We should define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality
</em><br>
<p>(I don't like the word 'morality', people misuse
<br>
and abuse it; I prefer 'ethics' which still has a
<br>
clear meaning).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; first and foremost in terms of our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature and concerns.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After we have a good handle on that and after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadening the scope, we can broaden our moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning and action.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead we theorize about the moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications of the universe while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often doing precious little in this one or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this one world we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is fun and all to speculate.  But it feels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masturbation much of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -s
</em><br>
<p>It would be, except I have come to understand
<br>
that humans base their morals on what sort of
<br>
world they think they live in (as well as
<br>
rationalizing what they already were inclined to
<br>
do). There are millions of people in this country
<br>
who think the world is supposed to end soon, that
<br>
there are no others worth considering, and that
<br>
trying to keep this one running would be
<br>
paganistic and show a lack of faith in God's
<br>
plan. There are others who sincerely think
<br>
everything repeats infinitely and that one may as
<br>
well be one of the winners, and that ruthlessness
<br>
is perfectly acceptable. There are still others
<br>
who will form a mob and lynch one of their
<br>
neighbors because they think he's a witch doctor
<br>
and has used magic to cause their penises to
<br>
retract into their bodies! (I'm not making this
<br>
up, folks!)
<br>
I find MWI convincing because of the principle of
<br>
'what nature does not forbid is compulsory.' It
<br>
seems whenever a scientist rejects the
<br>
implication of some equation because it's 'too
<br>
crazy,' it later turns out to be true. Do I
<br>
believe in other universes I can't see? Well, I
<br>
believe in China, and I never saw it. For me,
<br>
it's simpler to believe, and explains where all
<br>
that Wal-Mart stuff is coming from. To doubt it,
<br>
I must depend on all sorts of epicycles,
<br>
phlogistons, and dormitive principles. MWI gives
<br>
me a framework for thinking about what is and is
<br>
not possible, even in terms of my own creativity.
<br>
I've been sold on it for many years and I don't
<br>
see it getting weaker (I can think of quite a few
<br>
cherished ideas that have not aged so well).
<br>
<p>Much of our behavior is directly based on what we
<br>
think is real, and it would be a big mistake to
<br>
think everyone you meet lives in the same
<br>
'perceptual universe' as you. They may not
<br>
*literally* live in other universes, but they
<br>
might as well.
<br>
In view of all this, I try to comprehend the
<br>
deepest levels of reality as an adjunct to
<br>
ethical decision making. It's not a perfect
<br>
approach, because nobody has perfect information,
<br>
but I find that it allows me to spot most
<br>
charlatans a mile away, because so many of them
<br>
make claims I know to be logically impossible in
<br>
any universe. If more people-in-the-street were
<br>
conversant with the subtleties of our world as
<br>
scientists like Tegmark understand it, it would
<br>
be very, very hard to get a cult or lynch mob to
<br>
gel.
<br>
<p>Does that sound like intellectual masturbation to
<br>
you?
