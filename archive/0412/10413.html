Here's a flaw Marc: What you are essentially trying to do is shift the 
<br>
'average' of the multiverse by making it less likely that
<br>
important people could be killed repeatedly in closely related 
<br>
universes, right, and shifting it presumably for the better.
<br>
<p>Now, I have no physics degree, but it seems to me there are two problems 
<br>
with your idea: The first is universes diverge pretty quickly
<br>
(chaotically)-there are a lot of possiblities to explore, so any even 
<br>
drastic action would affect only a few. The second is better:
<br>
Doesn't MWI say that *all* possible universes exist? So how could you 
<br>
possibly affect the totality? All you could do is maybe improve
<br>
your own local universe (the essence of altruism, neh?), in which case 
<br>
your suggestion is null, since flipping 50-50 between two routes
<br>
to work equally likely to kill you isn't going to help anything.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thinking about MWI of QM, it occurred to me that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true altruist needs to consider the well being of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentients in all the alternative QM branches, not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this particular branch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now...suppose that something bad were to happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leading FAI researchers like Eli and Ben?  Say they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were both hit by trucks.  Then I think it's fair to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that the chances of a successful Singularity would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be somewhat reduced.  But what would the situation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the multiverse as a whole be if we lost Eli and Ben? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, assuming that the human brain is a classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer and doesn't use quantum indeterminacy (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty reasonable assumption), then it is likely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the deaths of Eli and Ben would already be largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined by classical physics (at least in the QM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;branches that diverged from this time forward).  So if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we lost Eli and Ben in this QM branch, chances are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they would die in most of the other QM branches of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse as well.  So if Eli and Ben were hit by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trucks here, and it was mostly classical physics at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work leading to their death (a likely assumption, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mentioned) then they'd probably be dead in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like 99% of all the other QM branches as well.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be bad news for the sentients in most other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;branches of the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I realized that there is a way to 're-distribute risk'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the multiverse, so as to ensure that a minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of alternative versions of Eli and Ben would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survive!  As I mentioned a true altruist has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider the well being of sentients all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative branches.  It would be bad news for most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentients in the multiverse if leading A.I researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were lost.  Therefore altruist A.I researchers should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follow my 'Quantum Insurance Policy' in order to safe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guard the alternative versions of themselves!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's how it works.  The reason why the deaths of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leading A.I researchers in this QM branch would cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a problem across the multiverse (from this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forward) is the assumption that largely classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics is at work in the human brain.  So decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taken by the version of yourself here in this QM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;branch are globally linked to decisions taken by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the alternative versions of yourself across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse (in the time tracks that diverge from this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time forward).  In short, given the reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assumption that classical physics is largely at work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in your brain, if you do something dumb here then most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the alternative versions of yourself have done the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same dumb thing. across the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's how to safeguard some of the alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;versions of yourself:  simply base some of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions on quantum random events.  There are devices
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that can easily generate quantum random numbers.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instance at the web-site:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/</a> you can get quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random numbers from a lab where radioactive decay is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used to generate them.  Simply link some of your daily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions to these numbers.  For instance at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beginning of the day you might draw up a table saying:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll take this route to work if I get a quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heads, and that route to work if I get a quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tails.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;See then what happens across the multiverse if leading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A.I researchers started to use this strategy: the high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correlations between alternative versions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves across the multiverse are broken.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect of this is to' re-distribute' risk across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse, which actually works to ensure that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimum fraction of your alternative selves are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shielded from bad things happening.  For instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppose Eliezer was hit by a truck walking to work. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Suppose he'd been linking the decision about which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;route to walk to work to a 'quantum coin flip'.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;half the alternative versions of himself would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taken another route to work and avoided the truck.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in 50% of QM branches he'd live on.  Compare that to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the case where Eli's decision about which route to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;walk to work was being made mostly according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;classical physics.  If something bad happened to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he'd be dead in say 99% of QM branches.  The effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the quantum decision making is to re-distribute risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the multiverse.  Therefore the altruist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategy has to be to deploy the 'quantum decisions'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheme to break the classical physics symmetry across
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In fact the scheme can be used to redistribute the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;risk of Unfriendly A.I across the multiverse.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a certain probability that leading A.I researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will screw up and create Unfriendly A.I.  Again, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human brain is largely operating off classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics, a dumb decision by an A.I researcher in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;QM branch is largely correlated with the same dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decision by alternative versions of that researcher in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all the QM branches divergent from that time on.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an example:  Let's say Ben Goertzel screwed up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;created and Unfriendly A.I because of a dumb decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same thing happens in most of the alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;branches if his decisions were caused by classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics!  But suppose Ben had been deploying my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'quantum insurance scheme', whereby he had been basing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some of his daily decisions off quantum random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers.  Then there would be more variation in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative versions of Ben across the Multiverse.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least some versions of Ben would be less likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make that dumb decision, and there would be an assured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimum percentage of QM branches avoiding Unfriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A.I.
