I'm a transhumanist (calling myself a transhuman would simply be 
<br>
unrealistic) who hasn't signed up for cryopreservation because of the 
<br>
financial issues. Unless you assign different (intrinsic) values to 
<br>
different human lives (a distinction that may be justifiable, but which 
<br>
I'm definitely not willing to make with my current biases), saving one 
<br>
human life is equivalent to stopping dieing in general (e.g. with a 
<br>
Friendly Singularity) less than one second earlier than it would happen 
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p>Considering the current prices for cryopreservation of a single person, 
<br>
a donation of the same amount of money to a promising (and not already 
<br>
overfunded) Friendly Singularity researching organization is in my 
<br>
opinion likely to cut their research time by at least one second without 
<br>
compromising Friendliness.
<br>
Considering that reaching a Friendly Singularity earlier also 
<br>
(everything else being equal) decreases the chance of an existential 
<br>
disaster happening in the meantime makes the second alternative look 
<br>
like an even better option.
<br>
<p>Which of the actions you assign a higher expected utility to depends 
<br>
among other things on your estimation of the involved probabilities 
<br>
(e.g. that cryopreservation saves sufficient information, that the 
<br>
cryopreservation team will get to the body in time, that any of the (not 
<br>
overfunded) organizations you are aware of is likely to be able to 
<br>
trigger a Friendly Singularity, etc.).
<br>
And, obviously, if you really value the life/identity of certain persons 
<br>
over that of a bunch of (probably) total strangers it makes sense to try 
<br>
to save the former at the cost of the latter.
