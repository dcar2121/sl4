<p>
For those people over 40 today it may be best to
<br>
pursue stop-gap measures such as anti-aging methods
<br>
and cryonics.  But for those under 40 (such as
<br>
myself), one could argue that Existential threats are
<br>
more likely to kill them before aging does.  So for
<br>
the under 40's at least, donations to FAI research is
<br>
probably the more rational option. 
<br>
<p>My reasoning is this:  sometime between 2020-2030, the
<br>
nano revolution is going to start hitting, and the
<br>
risk from existential threats (Terrorist goo,
<br>
Unfriendly A.I)  is really going to start becoming
<br>
significant.  So a definite probability of the
<br>
extinction of humanity starts to appear from 2020
<br>
onwards, and that probability starts going up from
<br>
then on.  Without FAI the cumulative probability of
<br>
the extinction of humanity may have exceeded 50% by
<br>
2040.
<br>
<p>A person 40 or under today has a greater than 50%
<br>
chance of living to 2040 naturally, even assuming no
<br>
significant life extension.  So you see, the
<br>
probability of an under-40 dying from existential
<br>
threats assuming no FAI is roughly comparable to the
<br>
probability of them dying through natural wear and
<br>
tear.  The rational option is to prevent death then is
<br>
to donate to FAI research, since FAI is the best way
<br>
to avert existential threats and it would also be able
<br>
to deal with the aging problem.
<br>
<p>In fact, I think only FAI will be able to get a real
<br>
handle on aging.  The human body is an enormously
<br>
complex system and the hoped for anti-aging methods so
<br>
far have proved to be nothing but hype.  In fact most
<br>
of the drugs developed by drug companies today
<br>
actually have side-effects just as bad as the original
<br>
condition they fix.  That's the thing with the human
<br>
body: a large number of different systems requiring
<br>
very precise methods to fix.  Lack of precision in
<br>
treatments leads to side-effects which shorten life
<br>
more than the treatment lengthens life.  Then there is
<br>
the problem of balances.  Altering one part of the
<br>
human body system can create an imbalance else where. 
<br>
In short, aging is one hell of a problem.  I wouldn't
<br>
put my hopes on cryonics or vitrification either. 
<br>
FAI's still your best bet for a fix over the longer
<br>
term.
<br>
<p>Those of you who have been following my posts know, of
<br>
course, that I'm not as optimistic about the
<br>
time-frame for FAI as Sing Inst enthusiasts.  I still
<br>
see FAI as being 15-30 years away at the earliest. 
<br>
Looking at the 30 years or less time frame, then it
<br>
might be better to pursue options like cryonics,
<br>
bio-medical life extension avenues etc.
<br>
<p>The one thing I'm reasonably sure about is this:  if
<br>
we don't get FAI before 2045 or so, then, to borrow a
<br>
phrase from Damian Broderick's 'The Spike': '&quot;We will
<br>
all perish most horribly&quot;
