<p><p>I think that skepticism about MWI comes from a

misunderstanding about what science actually is.
<br>
<p>Skeptics tend to regard science as simply a practical
<br>
tool for manipulating the world, rather than a method
<br>
of *explanation* 
<br>
<p>MWI is not &quot;a philosophical solution looking for a
<br>
problem&quot;, it's a metaphysical *conclusion* based on
<br>
what our best current theories of the world (QM) are
<br>
telling us.  The mathematics of QM is *telling us*
<br>
that multiple alternative outcomes co-exist with each
<br>
other.  Since QM makes correct predictions about
<br>
things that we *can* observe, there is good and
<br>
sufficient reason for trusting it on the things we
<br>
can't directly observe.
<br>
<p>Now skpetics tend to view the mathematics as simply a
<br>
tool or device used to get practical results.  So they
<br>
don't take the mathematical 'picture' coming from QM
<br>
as seriously representing reality, instead regarding
<br>
all such pictures as simply existing in human heads. 
<br>
This is to misunderstand what science is all about. 
<br>
Science is *not* just a tool for manipulating the
<br>
world.  It's also about trying to *explain* reality. 
<br>
I call the mistake the skeptics are making:  'The
<br>
Fallacy Of Logical Positivism'.  Here is how I
<br>
summarized this fallacy:
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------
<br>
The Logical Positivist Fallacy 
<br>
<p>Skeptics about the efficacy of the scientific method
<br>
think that the role of reason is simply to describe or
<br>
predict directly perceivable things, and abstract
<br>
concepts are merely ‘devices’ invented by humans for
<br>
this purpose.  They regard abstract concepts as models
<br>
which don’t represent anything real.  This is a
<br>
philosophical position known as positivism (also
<br>
‘non-realist’). 
<br>
<p>But the role of reason is not merely to describe or
<br>
predict things, it is to explain reality.  The nature
<br>
of reality is what we are trying to find out.  One
<br>
cannot presuppose in advance which things should
<br>
qualify as being part of ‘observable reality’ and
<br>
which are mere ‘mental devices’.  Reality is infinite.
<br>
&nbsp;A rational observer will only have a partial
<br>
understanding of it at any given time.  The very
<br>
foundation-head of scientific thought is the idea that
<br>
there are things in reality beyond what we currently
<br>
understand.  The role of reason is to broaden our
<br>
understanding of what constitutes reality by
<br>
attempting to extrapolate beyond our direct
<br>
observations to parts of reality that are currently
<br>
hidden to us.  Positivists who refuse to grant that
<br>
there are as yet unobservable things that exist ‘out
<br>
there’ that we are capable of understanding none the
<br>
less have prevented themselves from ever finding these
<br>
things!  This is comparable to a cave man watching
<br>
shadows on the wall who thinks that the shadows are
<br>
reality and thus doesn’t bother turning his head to
<br>
find the source. 
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>A 'realist'(a person who believes in the existence of
<br>
objective reality) has to trust the pictures being
<br>
suggested by the best avaliable theories of the world
<br>
do in fact correspond to actual reality, until proven
<br>
underwise.  The MWI of QM is the only sensible realist
<br>
picture of reality consistent with QM.  Therefore the
<br>
rational person has to accept it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The power of the many-worlds interpretation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly psychological.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me, and is the consensus among the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people I know who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand quantum mechanics, that some people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn it when they are older, just get weirded out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics. If you look at quotes from physicists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were around near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the birth of quantum mechanics, you'll see this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Things like: &quot;No one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands quantum mechanics.&quot; My friends and I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really tired of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing freshmen quote things like this before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is possible to understand quantum mechanics, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done it without resorting to philosophical nonsense.
</em><br>
<p><p>We cannot presuppose in advance what the nature of
<br>
reality is.  The nature of reality is what we are
<br>
trying to find out.  Therefore we must assume that
<br>
there is a reality wider than the one we can currently
<br>
directly perceive, and that we can use reason to grasp
<br>
these portions of reality currently hidden from us. 
<br>
In order to make progress, we must trust that the
<br>
pictures of reality suggested by our best avaliable
<br>
theories are correct, until proven otherwise.
<br>
<p>We cannot presuppose the nature of reality in advance.
<br>
&nbsp;Therefore *we cannot be certain* which aspects of
<br>
what we currently think of as 'philosophy' may
<br>
actually later turn be testable.  The history of
<br>
science shows that what starts out as philosophy can
<br>
later become science.  Every thing on the frontier of
<br>
knowledge starts out as philosophy  But without
<br>
philosophical speculation no progress could ever be
<br>
made.  Later the philosophy gets turned into science,
<br>
after a way to test it is found.
<br>
<p>In the case of the differing interpretations of QM, it
<br>
simply isn't true that they are untestable.  David
<br>
Deutsch has suggested actual experiments to
<br>
distinguish the MWI from other interpretations.  And
<br>
just recently, Shariar S. Afshar perfromed a variation
<br>
of the famous double slit experiment which appears to
<br>
disprove &quot;The Copenhagen Intepretation'of QM.  So you
<br>
see, what started out as philosophy got turned into
<br>
science as people later figured out how to test the
<br>
different interpretations.  But if no one had bothered
<br>
doing the philosophy to start with, no progress would
<br>
have been made.
<br>
<p>For a hugely powerful case for the MWI I recommend you
<br>
read the book 'The Fabric Of Reality, by David
<br>
Deutsch.  That gets my vote as the best science book I
<br>
ever read.
