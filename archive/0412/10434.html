<p>The mathematics of qauntum mechanics is describing
<br>
multiple alternative outcomes that co-exist with each
<br>
other.  Now the mathematics of QM was not made up out
<br>
of thin air.  It was developed by scientists over many
<br>
decades (from 1900-1955) in order to explain
<br>
observatvions.  The predictions of QM have been tested
<br>
over and over and over and it's passed every
<br>
observational test. 
<br>
<p>The multiple alternative outcomes which co-exist in
<br>
the maths can only be referrring to 'Many Worlds'.  If
<br>
you don't believe this is real, then just what you
<br>
think the maths is in fact referring to?  Or do you
<br>
simply regard the maths as a tool or 'human device'
<br>
being used to make correct predictions?  This 'logical
<br>
positivist' approach is actually pure solipsism
<br>
though, since we can *never* observe *anything*
<br>
directly and all the conclusions we draw about reality
<br>
are to some degree logical extrapolations.  
<br>
<p>For instance you are not directly observing the
<br>
computer screen in front you right now.  It is a
<br>
mental model in your mind.  Does that mean you should
<br>
doubt the existence of the computer?
<br>
<p>It's just the same with QM.  If you believe in
<br>
objective reality at all, you have to trust that the
<br>
picture that the maths is telling you is referring to
<br>
actual concrete 'things' out there in reality, until
<br>
proven otherwise.  The maths is the best avaliable
<br>
theory and the predictions drawn from it have been
<br>
proven correct over and over and over again in real
<br>
experiments.  Either you trsut the picture that the
<br>
maths is giving youy, or you've simply lapsed into
<br>
pure solipsism.
<br>
<p>In fact I'd say that your reasons for believing in the
<br>
alternative uiverses are *stronger* than your reasons
<br>
for believing that the computer in front of you
<br>
exists.  After you, how many people are seeing what
<br>
you are seeing right now?  How do you know you're not
<br>
dreaming or seeing things?  After all, you've never
<br>
directly observed your computer have you?  Your idea
<br>
that the computer in front of you is real is a
<br>
*theory* based on the mental model existing in your
<br>
head.  But QM on the other hand has been checked and
<br>
tested by a huge number of different people.
