<em>&gt; &gt; I don't agree that hardware is the problem at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You can get 10 Tflops now simply by adding on extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processors.  You don't need a super-computer.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; link together a large number of less powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computers and you have a 'cheapo' super-computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, for about $2 million if a Beowulf cluster is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequate.  See my &quot;Hardware Progrss&quot; series of posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the SL4 archives.  Someone could, if they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the money, but my point above was that no one actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has built a 10 Tflops machine for AI work.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are several machines in that performance class at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present, but they are doing weather and atomic bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work mostly.
</em><br>
<p>At the recent AAAI fall symposium series there was a funding
<br>
seminar with program managers from NSF, DARPA, ARDA, etc.
<br>
During a panel I asked if there were any AI projects using
<br>
ASCI-scale machines. The only answer came from Dave Gunning
<br>
of DARPA, who referred to the SRI PAL project funded under
<br>
the DARPA Cognitive Systems program. But I cannot find any
<br>
evidence that the PAL project is using very large machines.
<br>
<p>Dean Collins of ARDA, which does R&amp;D for the &quot;intelligence
<br>
community&quot;, said their goal was to avoid surprises. If they
<br>
really mean that, then they ought to have some AI and machine
<br>
learning projects using very large machines. It is plausible
<br>
that they are too dumb to do that, but it is equally
<br>
plausible that they are doing such work in secret.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Caveat - I'm not up on all the AI projects going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on in the world right now.  But I think collectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list has knowledge of a significant fraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such work.  So I'll ask the list - what's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most powerful hardware installation you know of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is being applied to AI work?
