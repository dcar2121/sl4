<p>
O.K, my latest thought may actually qualify as the
<br>
weirdest argument ever to be posted on SL4 ;)  I can’t
<br>
see any flaw in my argument, but I just thought of it
<br>
so I may be speaking nonsense here.  Have a read and
<br>
see what you think.  Obviously you need to make the
<br>
starting assumption that MWI of QM is true for the
<br>
argument to make sense.
<br>
<p>Thinking about MWI of QM, it occurred to me that a
<br>
true altruist needs to consider the well being of
<br>
sentients in all the alternative QM branches, not just
<br>
this particular branch.
<br>
<p>Now...suppose that something bad were to happen to
<br>
leading FAI researchers like Eli and Ben?  Say they
<br>
were both hit by trucks.  Then I think it's fair to
<br>
say that the chances of a successful Singularity would
<br>
be somewhat reduced.  But what would the situation in
<br>
the multiverse as a whole be if we lost Eli and Ben? 
<br>
Well, assuming that the human brain is a classical
<br>
computer and doesn't use quantum indeterminacy (a
<br>
pretty reasonable assumption), then it is likely that
<br>
the deaths of Eli and Ben would already be largely
<br>
determined by classical physics (at least in the QM
<br>
branches that diverged from this time forward).  So if
<br>
we lost Eli and Ben in this QM branch, chances are
<br>
they would die in most of the other QM branches of the
<br>
multiverse as well.  So if Eli and Ben were hit by
<br>
trucks here, and it was mostly classical physics at
<br>
work leading to their death (a likely assumption, as
<br>
mentioned) then they'd probably be dead in something
<br>
like 99% of all the other QM branches as well.  It
<br>
would be bad news for the sentients in most other
<br>
branches of the multiverse.
<br>
<p>I realized that there is a way to 're-distribute risk'
<br>
across the multiverse, so as to ensure that a minimum
<br>
fraction of alternative versions of Eli and Ben would
<br>
survive!  As I mentioned a true altruist has to
<br>
consider the well being of sentients all the
<br>
alternative branches.  It would be bad news for most
<br>
sentients in the multiverse if leading A.I researchers
<br>
were lost.  Therefore altruist A.I researchers should
<br>
follow my 'Quantum Insurance Policy' in order to safe
<br>
guard the alternative versions of themselves!
<br>
<p>Here's how it works.  The reason why the deaths of
<br>
leading A.I researchers in this QM branch would cause
<br>
a problem across the multiverse (from this time
<br>
forward) is the assumption that largely classical
<br>
physics is at work in the human brain.  So decisions
<br>
taken by the version of yourself here in this QM
<br>
branch are globally linked to decisions taken by all
<br>
the alternative versions of yourself across the
<br>
multiverse (in the time tracks that diverge from this
<br>
time forward).  In short, given the reasonable
<br>
assumption that classical physics is largely at work
<br>
in your brain, if you do something dumb here then most
<br>
of the alternative versions of yourself have done the
<br>
same dumb thing. across the multiverse.
<br>
<p>Here's how to safeguard some of the alternative
<br>
versions of yourself:  simply base some of your
<br>
decisions on quantum random events.  There are devices
<br>
that can easily generate quantum random numbers.  For
<br>
instance at the web-site:
<br>
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/</a> you can get quantum
<br>
random numbers from a lab where radioactive decay is
<br>
used to generate them.  Simply link some of your daily
<br>
decisions to these numbers.  For instance at the
<br>
beginning of the day you might draw up a table saying:
<br>
&nbsp;I'll take this route to work if I get a quantum
<br>
heads, and that route to work if I get a quantum
<br>
tails.
<br>
<p>See then what happens across the multiverse if leading
<br>
A.I researchers started to use this strategy: the high
<br>
correlations between alternative versions of
<br>
themselves across the multiverse are broken.  The
<br>
effect of this is to' re-distribute' risk across the
<br>
multiverse, which actually works to ensure that some
<br>
minimum fraction of your alternative selves are
<br>
shielded from bad things happening.  For instance
<br>
suppose Eliezer was hit by a truck walking to work. 
<br>
Suppose he'd been linking the decision about which
<br>
route to walk to work to a 'quantum coin flip'.  Then
<br>
half the alternative versions of himself would have
<br>
taken another route to work and avoided the truck.  So
<br>
in 50% of QM branches he'd live on.  Compare that to
<br>
the case where Eli's decision about which route to
<br>
walk to work was being made mostly according to
<br>
classical physics.  If something bad happened to him
<br>
he'd be dead in say 99% of QM branches.  The effect of
<br>
the quantum decision making is to re-distribute risk
<br>
across the multiverse.  Therefore the altruist
<br>
strategy has to be to deploy the 'quantum decisions'
<br>
scheme to break the classical physics symmetry across
<br>
the multiverse.
<br>
<p>In fact the scheme can be used to redistribute the
<br>
risk of Unfriendly A.I across the multiverse.  There
<br>
is a certain probability that leading A.I researchers
<br>
will screw up and create Unfriendly A.I.  Again, if
<br>
the human brain is largely operating off classical
<br>
physics, a dumb decision by an A.I researcher in this
<br>
QM branch is largely correlated with the same dumb
<br>
decision by alternative versions of that researcher in
<br>
all the QM branches divergent from that time on.  As
<br>
an example:  Let's say Ben Goertzel screwed up and
<br>
created and Unfriendly A.I because of a dumb decision.
<br>
&nbsp;The same thing happens in most of the alternative
<br>
branches if his decisions were caused by classical
<br>
physics!  But suppose Ben had been deploying my
<br>
'quantum insurance scheme', whereby he had been basing
<br>
some of his daily decisions off quantum random
<br>
numbers.  Then there would be more variation in the
<br>
alternative versions of Ben across the Multiverse.  At
<br>
least some versions of Ben would be less likely to
<br>
make that dumb decision, and there would be an assured
<br>
minimum percentage of QM branches avoiding Unfriendly
<br>
A.I.
