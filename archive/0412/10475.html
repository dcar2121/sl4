<em>&gt; &gt; Why do you think Red Bull is a smart drug? You can get the same thing

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Red Bull Ingredients: carbonated water, sucrose, glucose, sodium

<em>&gt; &gt; citrate, taurine, glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, niacin, 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the way, Red bull is a westernised version of Krating Daeng
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which as I remember means Red Bull in Thai. It is similar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but doesn't have carbonation and is also seems more concentrated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, it is not a smart drug.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I prefer the term nootropics over &quot;smart drugs&quot;, because nootropics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are specifically safe with minimal side effects. In fact, the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well known nootropic, piracetam, is amoung the safest pharmaceutical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compounds around. Piracetam is also reasonably priced too if you buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the powder direct and capsule your own.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, from my experience, piracetam, aniracetam, and oxiracetam don't
<br>
seem to do very much (the last only gives me a headache).  Nootropics are a
<br>
subset of the nutrition/pharma scam.  Well, scam may be a strong word, but the
<br>
claims certainly don't live up to the hype, and there's a strong current in
<br>
Western culture that wants to take magic bullet pills.  
<br>
<p>Modafinil, for example, was designed by my boss's colleague, a man whom we know
<br>
has overhyped the product, and we're thinking about starting trials to test its
<br>
efficacy against caffeine.  Previous work has shown that Modafinil only
<br>
marginally improves psychomotor vigilance over repeated doses of caffeine, and
<br>
it's nowhere near as potent as amphetamines.  It's a glutamate agonist, though,
<br>
so it doesn't have the addiction potential of the dopaminergic drugs, and it
<br>
doesn't create the anxiety that caffeine does.  I doubt the claim that it
<br>
IMPROVES intelligence/cognitive ability.  More than likely, it extends your
<br>
ability to remain at your innate peak performance.  
<br>
<p>The only drugs that I've experienced that give me the subjective feeling of
<br>
improved performance are those which improve blood flow to, and therefore
<br>
oxygenation of, the brain.  These include vinpocetine and ginko biloba.  I say
<br>
subjective, because even after 10 mg of vinpocetine I did not appear to do
<br>
better on a PVT.  Also, I've noticed that if I read a verbally challenging
<br>
piece of literature for about an hour, I suddenly find myself better able to
<br>
articulate, probably due to increased blood flow to Broca's, Wernicke's and
<br>
Geschwind's areas, and the sense of improved cognitive enhancement is far
<br>
stronger than any chemical I've used. 
<br>
<p>None of these things are magic bullets to cram for an interview or an exam,
<br>
though, and good old fashioned repeated exposure to the material will still
<br>
work much better, imho.
<br>
<p>That's not to say that increases in intelligence won't happen, but drugs can
<br>
only effect things like neurotransmitter output, receptor density, and so
<br>
forth.  Some part of intelligence is controlled by the myelination of the axon,
<br>
which is a process that's complete when the neuron differentiates, or the
<br>
higher-order organization of neurons and their synapses, which determines
<br>
SMARTNESS, the qualitative aspect of intelligence.  I doubt that any drug will
<br>
suddenly make problems with inconceivable solutions seem obvious.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Martin

<p>I love this quote, btw: &quot;There are no hard problems, only problems that are
<br>
hard to a certain level of intelligence.&quot; -- Yudkowsky
