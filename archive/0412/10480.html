Sorry, I just realized my previous email used HTML formatting in an annoying
<br>
way.  Here is a better-formatted version:
<br>
<p><p><p>********
<br>
<p><p><p>Hi all,
<br>
<p>Recently David Hart -- who's been working with me on AGIRI (the nonprofit
<br>
<p>side of the Novamente project, which hasn't been very active, but we'd like
<br>
<p>to make it more so, because funding Novamente AGI development via the
<br>
<p>minimal revenue from our narrow-AI consulting projects is proving
<br>
<p>*massively* too sluggish for our tastes...) -- recently posted an email on
<br>
<p>the list pertaining an AGIRI fundraising drive.
<br>
<p><p><p>By way of commentary on this, I'll post here an excerpt from the informal
<br>
<p>&quot;Concluding Remarks&quot; to the latest, still-not-yet-finished draft of the
<br>
<p>ever-evolving and improving &quot;Novamente book&quot; (now three books). I have 6
<br>
<p>chapters to revise out of the 29 in the book and then this version will be
<br>
<p>ready to send off to the publisher ;-))
<br>
<p><p><p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p><p><p>The excerpt:
<br>
<p>**********************
<br>
<p>Reactions of people who have read early drafts of this book have varied
<br>
<p>widely. Most readers are surprised and at least mildly impressed that
<br>
<p>anyone has taken the trouble to work out a serious AGI design in so much
<br>
<p>detail. However, not surprisingly, there is a lot of skepticism regarding
<br>
<p>our conjecture that, when fully implemented and tuned and taught, the
<br>
<p>Novamente design will actually lead to general intelligence at or beyond the
<br>
<p>human level. The only complaints that really interest us are the ones made
<br>
<p>by people who believe that some AGI design is possible. Among these
<br>
<p>readers, the primary complaints made seem to be things like:
<br>
<p><p><p>Complaint: The design is too complicated, there are too many parts to
<br>
<p>coordinate, too many things that could go wrong
<br>
<p><p><p>Answer: Yes it IS complicated, and we wish it were simpler, but we haven’t
<br>
<p>found a simpler design that doesn’t seem patently unworkable. Note that the
<br>
<p>human brain is also mighty complicated – this may just be the nature of
<br>
<p>making general intelligence work with limited resources.
<br>
<p><p><p>Complaint: BOA and PTL are not enough, you need some kind of more
<br>
<p>fundamentally innovative, efficient, or (whatever) learning algorithm. This
<br>
<p>complaint never comes along with any suggestion regarding what this &quot;mystery
<br>
<p>algorithm&quot; might be, though – most often it is hypothesized that detailed
<br>
<p>understanding of the human brain will reveal it.
<br>
<p><p><p>Answer: This is possible, but it seems to us that a hybrid of BOA and PTL
<br>
<p>will be enough. The question is whether deeper integration of BOA and PTL
<br>
<p>than we’ve done now will allow BOA learning of reasonably large (500-1000
<br>
<p>node) combinator trees. If so, then we almost surely don’t need any other
<br>
<p>learning algorithm, though other algorithms may be helpful.
<br>
<p><p><p>Complaint: You’re programming in too much stuff: you should be making more
<br>
<p>of a pure self-organizing learning system without so many in-built rules and
<br>
<p>heuristics
<br>
<p><p><p>Answer: Well, the human brain seems to have a lot of stuff programmed in, as
<br>
<p>well as a robust capability for self-organizing learning. Conceptually, we
<br>
<p>love the idea of a pure self-organizing learning system as much as anyone,
<br>
<p>but it doesn’t seem to be feasible given realistic time and processing power
<br>
<p>and memory constraints.
<br>
<p><p><p>Complaint: Programming explicit logical rules is just wrong; logic should
<br>
<p>occur as an emergent phenomenon from more fundamental subsymbolic dynamics
<br>
<p><p><p>Answer: Probabilistic logic is not necessarily symbolic; in the Novamente
<br>
<p>design we use PTL for both subsymbolic and symbolic learning, which we
<br>
<p>believe is a highly elegant approach. The differences between subsymbolic
<br>
<p>probabilistic logic and e.g. Hebbian learning are not really very great when
<br>
<p>you look at them mathematically rather than in terms of verbiage. The
<br>
<p>Novamente design is not tied to programming-in logical knowledge a la Cyc.
<br>
<p>It’s true that the PTL rules are programmed in (though in Novamente 2.0 they
<br>
<p>will be made adaptable), but this isn’t so different from the brain having
<br>
<p>particular kinds of long-term potentiation wired in, is it?
<br>
<p><p><p>Of course, we don’t expect our answers to fully please the complainants –
<br>
<p>but they generally seem to convince the complainants that we’ve thought
<br>
<p>through the issues carefully. Almost no one who has seriously studied
<br>
<p>Novamente has accused us of being naïve or foolish in our approach, though
<br>
<p>obviously many have considered our confidence excessive, and have proposed
<br>
<p>other directions as seeming more promising.
<br>
<p><p><p>At time of writing, our biggest frustrations with the Novamente project are
<br>
<p>twofold. The first is a technical frustration: existing software tools are
<br>
<p>a pain to work with. Both Windows and Unix carry with them their own forms
<br>
<p>of irritation, similarly with all existing programming languages: C++, Java,
<br>
<p>LISP, functional and logical languages. All existing operating systems and
<br>
<p>programming languages place unnecessary hassles in the way of creating a
<br>
<p>powerful general AI. As a Novamente software developer, one spends too much
<br>
<p>of one’s time wrestling with purely software-level issues that have no
<br>
<p>direct connection to AI. And needless to say, the software industry does
<br>
<p>not put much effort into creating software development environments that are
<br>
<p>specifically conducive to AGI R&amp;D!
<br>
<p><p><p>The second frustration is financial: because of the radical nature of the
<br>
<p>project, we have not been able to secure a significant amount of R&amp;D
<br>
<p>funding. We have sustained the project, so far, based on a combination of a
<br>
<p>small amount of R&amp;D funding with revenues derived from small businesses that
<br>
<p>we’ve built by deploying portions of the Novamente system within narrow-AI
<br>
<p>software products. This is not the right way to build a thinking machine.
<br>
<p>What the Novamente project needs is a small group of programmers and
<br>
<p>scientists dedicated full-time to creation of AGI. We view the current
<br>
<p>phase of Novamente development as preliminary – our goal is to get the
<br>
<p>system to the stage where it does things that are exciting enough that
<br>
<p>marshalling significant R&amp;D funding becomes easy. At that point we’ll be
<br>
<p>able to pay a top-notch full-time team (including the authors and the other
<br>
<p>Novamente originators) to complete the job, and progress will start going an
<br>
<p>awful lot faster.
<br>
<p><p><p>We mention these frustrations not out of the desire to personally vent, but
<br>
<p>mainly because of the general point that they illustrate: neither
<br>
<p>contemporary human society, nor the computer science community, nor even the
<br>
<p>AI community is at all supportive of the quest to create powerful AGI
<br>
<p>software. We believe that in hindsight, after AGI has been created, this
<br>
<p>lack of support and enthusiasm will be viewed with incredulity. AGI is a
<br>
<p>hard problem but it’s far from an impossible problem – it seems clear that
<br>
<p>there are many possible solutions, and we believe that Novamente is one of
<br>
<p>them. Almost surely it’s not the best one, but so far as we know it’s the
<br>
<p>only likely-looking solution that’s been proposed in detail so far.

<p>Subject: [agi] Artificial General Intelligence Research - Help Wanted
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>Hi All,
<br>
<p>AGIRI (the Artificial General Intelligence Research Institute) is pleased to
<br>
<p>launch a new drive to raise $80,000 dedicated to pure AGI research with a
<br>
<p>specific goal: to complete the next major milestone of Novamente development
<br>
<p>by the end of 2005.
<br>
<p><p><p>Milestone M10, shown in the Novamente Development Roadmap, is the deployment
<br>
<p>of a Novamente system specialized to control an embodied agent, interacting
<br>
<p>linguistically and &quot;physically&quot; with other agents and objects in a simulated
<br>
<p>world. For more information on the project, see the AGI-SIM Development
<br>
<p>Plan. AGIRI is also seeking capable programmers, for both volunteer and paid
<br>
<p>positions.
<br>
<p>We believe that upon completion of the AGI-SIM project, AGIRI will be
<br>
<p>well-poised to raise the larger-dollar research funding needed to move
<br>
<p>Novamente quickly toward its longer-term AGI goals. The AGI-SIM application
<br>
<p>of Novamente may also open up new commercial possibilities, for instance in
<br>
<p>the area of partnerships with firms developing mobile robotics technology.
<br>
<p>For more information about Novamente, see the new concise but deep
<br>
<p>single-page description located at the AGIRI home page, and the eight-page
<br>
<p>technical paper at Novamente: An Integrative Architecture for General
<br>
<p>Intelligence. A new series of books that will describe Novamente's
<br>
<p>conceptual and technical under-pinnings in great detail is due for
<br>
<p>publication in 2005.
<br>
<p>Read more about fundraising at AGIRI on the contributions page.
<br>
<p><p><p>Best Regards,
<br>
<p>from all of us at AGIRI
