I like the idea, but my first impression is that to make it work would 
<br>
require one of
<br>
<p>1) someone dedicated to doing curation, by hand, of the new, 
<br>
nicely-organized SL4 archive.  I estimate this would take about 10 hours per 
<br>
week, on average.
<br>
<p>2) someone to spend a lot of time creating a software framework that does 
<br>
automated categorization of messages in a clever way (several months of 
<br>
work, for someone really good with relevant knowledge)
<br>
<p>3) someone to spend a lot of time creating a nice user interface that makes 
<br>
it relatively effortless for posters to associated metadata with their 
<br>
messages in a way that allows a fairly dumb categorization system to insert 
<br>
their message appropriatel into a nicely-organized archive (probably a 
<br>
couple months work, also)
<br>
<p>Of course, in cases 2 or 3, the solution would probably be reusable for 
<br>
other mailing lists.  But I'm not sure anyone wants to volunteer to do the 
<br>
work...
<br>
<p>I'll be happy to have my first impression proved wrong, of course, and to be 
<br>
shown that there's a simple solution....

Subject: Organized list?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I have been thinking of a way of getting more structure into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the SL4 group and/or other groups.  I have contributed to the sl4 wiki
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I have been to other wikis but even though they have more structure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a mailing list, they don't show the reasons *why* the different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories are believed.  They also don't show how many others share the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion of the author of the information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the starting pages for the SL4 list says to study the SL4 archives 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine what has and hasn't been said before posting.  With over 10,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emails, however, that is impossible for anyone.  Also, the above complaint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how many others agree (or disagree but didn't make a rebuttal) is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.  Another mailing list I have been on has a word search capability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is nice but still no organized theories backed by the reasons you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe them and how many people agree/disagree.  In some cases it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice to see 2 or more mutually exclusive ideas and their reasons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for/against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if no consensus can be found.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am wondering how many other posters to the SL4 would be interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participating in a web system that solved the above problems.  There might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be other programs that can do what I have described and I would be happy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear any information on these.  I have looked at how the wikipedia was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created and the ongoing battles when anyone can just write or change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever they like.  This is not the solution I envision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The end result of what I am talking about would show a collapsible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of topics with the current theory specified and the arguments for/against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right underneath.  Rebuttals and changes to the theory would be voted on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a way that multiple arguments that are essentially the same would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consolidated and only rebuttals/support to the current theory would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed.  No off topic material would be allowed by voting out the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material.  If someone wanted to revisit a discussion that some had thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closed in the past, they could do so by posting new and significant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to back up their proposed changes.  New topics and there position in topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure could be started by many but not necessarily everyone.  New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posters would have the structure of current theories and their supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons so that they could contribute quickly, even if only in a small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the system.  Whole sections could be ignored by disinterested people so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all topics wouldn't have to be answered by all posters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The SL4 list is *owned* by Eliezer and I am not proposing that that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change or that a rival site would steal it's members.  If Eliezer doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the idea then this list will hear no more from me on this topic.
