<p>
I am a huge fan of Ray Kurzweil and all of his writing.  I have read his new
<br>
book Fantastic Voyage - Live Long Enough to Live Forever.  Prior to that the
<br>
co-author Terry Grossman wrote Baby Boomers Guide to Living Forever in 2000
<br>
which I read in 2003.  They recommend taking many supplements as well as
<br>
many other recommendations, including cryonics in Grossman's book (which I
<br>
signed up for too).  I recommend everyone read Kurzweil's marvelous book. I
<br>
have taken supplements and feel much better on a daily basis. (Before
<br>
reading these books, I would never take anything unless I was almost dying).
<br>
The key supplements are multivitamins and fish oil, which I have taken for
<br>
two years.  Since reading Kurzweil's book, I now have added several more
<br>
such as cholesterol control for my high LDL count, melatonin at night, just
<br>
started phosphatydicholine, and others.  These ideas really work as Ray,
<br>
himself, is living proof.
<br>
<p>I am working with co-author Terry Grossman's office remotely (he's in
<br>
Denver)to obtain the genomics tests. His office is 877-liv4ever or
<br>
877-548-4387 or www.liv4evr.com. I am unable to find these tests anywhere
<br>
else.  They mentioned the costs is $438 for all plus you may have to fork
<br>
over $250 for consultation.  You can do these tests through the mail with
<br>
his office. If you want the full nine yards of tests, Grossman's office in
<br>
Denver will do it for $5,000 - which is more than I want to spend currently.
<br>
<p>This stuff I understand.  I just have no idea on what to make of this
<br>
multi-verse talk, which makes no sense to me.  I wish someone would explain
<br>
why I should believe in the multi-verse and what it is.

Subject: life extension - genomic tests
<br>
<p>Not sure if this is off-topic, but I have just purchased Ray Kurzweil's book
<br>
<p>&quot;fantastic voyage - live long enough to live forever&quot; in which he recommends
<br>
<p>a special diet and particular supplements to extend life-span until more 
<br>
radical life extension technologies become available.
<br>
<p>In this book, the author recommends getting a full panel of genomic tests, 
<br>
to find out anomalies in your genetic code and taking specific supplements 
<br>
to counteract the effects of these mutations.
<br>
<p>I was just wondering if anyone on the list is following this regime and if 
<br>
they have noticed any difference, especially with brain supplements such as 
<br>
phosatydil-choline and phosphatidyl-serine and intravenous shots.
<br>
<p>PS: if anyone has done genetic testing, could you mail me privately and tell
<br>
<p>me the cost, scope and location where you took the exams?
