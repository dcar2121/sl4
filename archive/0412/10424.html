<p><em>&gt; Thinking about MWI of QM, it occurred to me that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true altruist needs to consider the well being of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients in all the alternative QM branches, not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this particular branch.
</em><br>
<p>Acting to maximize the probability of an event produces the same
<br>
actions as acting to maximize the number of descendant quantum
<br>
realities with the desired event. I believe this has been covered
<br>
before on this list.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose Eliezer was hit by a truck walking to work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose he'd been linking the decision about which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; route to walk to work to a 'quantum coin flip'.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half the alternative versions of himself would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken another route to work and avoided the truck.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 50% of QM branches he'd live on.  Compare that to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case where Eli's decision about which route to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk to work was being made mostly according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical physics.  If something bad happened to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he'd be dead in say 99% of QM branches.  The effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the quantum decision making is to re-distribute risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across the multiverse.  Therefore the altruist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy has to be to deploy the 'quantum decisions'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme to break the classical physics symmetry across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the multiverse.
</em><br>
<p>This only works because our fictional Eli assigned a 99% probability
<br>
to the lethal path being more desirable. Your &quot;insurance policy&quot; boils
<br>
down to the following piece of advice: If you make a decision that
<br>
you're really sure about, and happen to be wrong, you're better off
<br>
flipping a coin. Sure, that's sound advice, but it doesn't do me any
<br>
good. If I knew I was wrong, it wouldn't be very sane of me to keep
<br>
that 99% estimate of desirability. You started with a *really* bad
<br>
decision, scrapped the decision in favor of a fifty-fifty method, saw
<br>
that it drastically improved the survival of your quantum descendants,
<br>
and said &quot;behold the life-saving power of randomness&quot;. Sorry, but it
<br>
doesn't work like that. Intelligence works better than flipping coins.
<br>
If you trust coin flips instead of intelligence, you're more likely to
<br>
get killed. Applying this to MWI translates it to &quot;If you go with
<br>
intelligence, you survive in a greater number of quantum realities.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In fact the scheme can be used to redistribute the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk of Unfriendly A.I across the multiverse.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a certain probability that leading A.I researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will screw up and create Unfriendly A.I.  Again, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human brain is largely operating off classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, a dumb decision by an A.I researcher in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; QM branch is largely correlated with the same dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision by alternative versions of that researcher in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the QM branches divergent from that time on.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an example:  Let's say Ben Goertzel screwed up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created and Unfriendly A.I because of a dumb decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The same thing happens in most of the alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branches if his decisions were caused by classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics!  But suppose Ben had been deploying my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'quantum insurance scheme', whereby he had been basing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of his daily decisions off quantum random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers.  Then there would be more variation in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative versions of Ben across the Multiverse.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least some versions of Ben would be less likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make that dumb decision, and there would be an assured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum percentage of QM branches avoiding Unfriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A.I.
</em><br>
<p>And if he doesn't screw up the AI? What if Ben was right? Your
<br>
insurance scheme just killed half of that branch of the multiverse
<br>
because a lot of Bens decided to go on coin flips instead of a correct
<br>
theory, and I don't see why the second batch of fifty-gazillion
<br>
sentients is less valuable than the first batch. Also, keep in mind,
<br>
there's going to be some that hit the ultimately desirable state.
<br>
Somewhere out there there's a quantum reality where Friendly AI
<br>
spontaneously materialized out of a gas cloud. You can't really drive
<br>
the number of desirable quantum realities down to zero, any more than
<br>
you can accurately assign something a Bayesian probability of zero.
