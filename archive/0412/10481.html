<p>I know I have mentioned this before, Win Wenger
<br>
(at www.winwenger.com ) has a program he says
<br>
will raise your IQ by more than ten points in a
<br>
matter of weeks, consisting of two things:
<br>
1. Image streaming (a sort of
<br>
visualization/description method best done with
<br>
others)
<br>
and 
<br>
2. Underwater swimming, which increases the
<br>
carotid arteries' width, thus blood flow to the
<br>
brain, without drugs.
<br>
The particular page, &quot;Two GUARANTEED Ways to
<br>
Profoundly Improve Your Intelligence, by Win
<br>
Wenger&quot; can be found at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.winwenger.com/ebooks/guaran.htm">http://www.winwenger.com/ebooks/guaran.htm</a>
<br>
<p>and I quote the first couple of paras here:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Introduction
<br>
<p>1. For accumulating 20 hours of held-breath
<br>
underwater swimming within 3 weeks from start to
<br>
finish-- 10 or more points I.Q. gain; better span
<br>
of attention; better span of awareness; better
<br>
awareness of the interrelatedness of things and
<br>
of ideas and/or perceptions; finding yourself way
<br>
better at winning arguments or disputes! (20 or
<br>
so seconds to 3 minutes at a time underwater,
<br>
stretching the time a little each dip but
<br>
remaining well within the bounds of comfort and
<br>
safety - be sure someone with you there is aware
<br>
of what you are doing. By the procedure we
<br>
describe herein, you must be truly underwater,
<br>
not just dipping your face in or just holding
<br>
your breath, because the brain-circulation
<br>
enhancement induced by the marine diving response
<br>
- common to all mammals - is unexpectedly
<br>
powerful in this combination of effects.)
<br>
<p>The other procedure--
<br>
<p>2. Accumulate at least 30 hours, 5-20 minutes at
<br>
a time, of true Image Streaming as directed
<br>
herein, and you will gain at least 20 points
<br>
&quot;I.Q.&quot; Your language skills will jump noticeably,
<br>
contributing to 100 points or greater gain
<br>
overall in such standardized tests as the G.R.E.
<br>
(assuming you aren't already close to the test's
<br>
ceiling -- see below). Your gain in more numinous
<br>
aspects will be even more striking. This must be
<br>
- or rapidly become - true Image Streaming as
<br>
described herein, using a tape recorder or a live
<br>
person listening.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not have regular access to a pool and so
<br>
have not tested this procedure (I read a real
<br>
estate listing for a $65,000 house in Arkansas
<br>
with a big indoor pool and wonder why I remain in
<br>
Massachusetts!) However, the simple fact that you
<br>
can access so much info from his site for free
<br>
reflects favorably in my eyes. Charlatans
<br>
generally expect big bucks for selling their
<br>
'secrets'.
