<p>
I have been thinking of a way of getting more structure into the discussions
<br>
of the SL4 group and/or other groups.  I have contributed to the sl4 wiki
<br>
and I have been to other wikis but even though they have more structure than
<br>
just a mailing list, they don't show the reasons *why* the different
<br>
theories are believed.  They also don't show how many others share the
<br>
opinion of the author of the information.
<br>
<p><p><p>One of the starting pages for the SL4 list says to study the SL4 archives to
<br>
determine what has and hasn't been said before posting.  With over 10,000
<br>
emails, however, that is impossible for anyone.  Also, the above complaint
<br>
about how many others agree (or disagree but didn't make a rebuttal) is not
<br>
there.  Another mailing list I have been on has a word search capability
<br>
that is nice but still no organized theories backed by the reasons you
<br>
believe them and how many people agree/disagree.  In some cases it would be
<br>
nice to see 2 or more mutually exclusive ideas and their reasons for/against
<br>
if no consensus can be found.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am wondering how many other posters to the SL4 would be interested in
<br>
participating in a web system that solved the above problems.  There might
<br>
be other programs that can do what I have described and I would be happy to
<br>
hear any information on these.  I have looked at how the wikipedia was
<br>
created and the ongoing battles when anyone can just write or change
<br>
whatever they like.  This is not the solution I envision.
<br>
<p><p><p>The end result of what I am talking about would show a collapsible structure
<br>
of topics with the current theory specified and the arguments for/against
<br>
right underneath.  Rebuttals and changes to the theory would be voted on in
<br>
such a way that multiple arguments that are essentially the same would be
<br>
consolidated and only rebuttals/support to the current theory would be
<br>
allowed.  No off topic material would be allowed by voting out the offending
<br>
material.  If someone wanted to revisit a discussion that some had thought
<br>
closed in the past, they could do so by posting new and significant material
<br>
to back up their proposed changes.  New topics and there position in topic
<br>
structure could be started by many but not necessarily everyone.  New
<br>
posters would have the structure of current theories and their supporting
<br>
reasons so that they could contribute quickly, even if only in a small area
<br>
of the system.  Whole sections could be ignored by disinterested people so
<br>
that all topics wouldn't have to be answered by all posters.
<br>
<p><p><p>The SL4 list is *owned* by Eliezer and I am not proposing that that would
<br>
change or that a rival site would steal it's members.  If Eliezer doesn't
<br>
like the idea then this list will hear no more from me on this topic.
