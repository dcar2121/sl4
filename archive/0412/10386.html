</em><br>
<p>Do you know what cryopreservation costs?  Most people fund it with life 
<br>
insurance.  If you are reasonably young, the cost is under a dollar a day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unless you assign different (intrinsic) values to different human lives (a

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;one second earlier than it would happen otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>This sort of makes sense from an inclusive fitness perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Considering the current prices for cryopreservation of a single person, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;donation of the same amount of money to a promising (and not already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overfunded) Friendly Singularity researching organization is in my opinion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely to cut their research time by at least one second without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compromising Friendliness.
</em><br>
<p>If you *have* the money that's probably the case.  I don't know how much 
<br>
typical insurance payments for cryonics patients would help.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Considering that reaching a Friendly Singularity earlier also (everything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else being equal) decreases the chance of an existential disaster 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happening in the meantime makes the second alternative look like an even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which of the actions you assign a higher expected utility to depends among 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other things on your estimation of the involved probabilities (e.g. that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryopreservation saves sufficient information, that the cryopreservation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;team will get to the body in time, that any of the (not overfunded) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organizations you are aware of is likely to be able to trigger a Friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity, etc.).
</em><br>
<p>True.  You might feel the need to factor in the chances (despite their best 
<br>
efforts) of a Friendly Singularity organization accidently screwing up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And, obviously, if you really value the life/identity of certain persons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over that of a bunch of (probably) total strangers it makes sense to try 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to save the former at the cost of the latter.
</em><br>
<p>Your genes have been selected for this bias:  You should value yourself as 
<br>
much as two children, or two brothers, or 4 cousins or 8 second 
<br>
cousins.  (See William Hamilton)  Since we evolved in tribes with an 
<br>
average relationship about that of second cousins, our genes probably 
<br>
overvalue those we know as if they were tribe members.  And while we don't 
<br>
share a lot of relationship with total strangers, there are an awful lot of 
<br>
them to weigh in the balance.
<br>
<p>Of course, if you have substantial income, you can afford to donate to 
<br>
Friendly AI work and get yourself frozen if you need it.
<br>
<p>If you think you might want cryonic suspension if you needed it, *at least* 
<br>
get enough inexpensive life insurance to fund it.  You can always assign 
<br>
the insurance proceeds to SI if you are lost at sea.
