<em>&gt; Manufacturing productivity trends point to highly

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the total productivity for all existing plants

<em>&gt; in place no matter how old or new.  The trend for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new factories is already highly automated.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, a current news story:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<a href="http://www.turkishpress.com/business/news.asp?id=041206130347.becjyfy6.xml">http://www.turkishpress.com/business/news.asp?id=041206130347.becjyfy6.xml</a>

<em>&gt; says Samsung will invest $24 billion in chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factories in the next 6 years, which will yield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10,000 new jobs.  That's $2.4 million in factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment per job.  
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  Well yup, the 15 year time-frame takes
<br>
us to 2020, which is when the nano-tech revolution is
<br>
predicted to start hitting and most manufacturing jobs
<br>
should rapidly get eliminated.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 1) What happens to the ~1/2 of the workforce that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has had their jobs automated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) What becomes possible when a set of automated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factories can produce all of each other's parts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or enough of each other's parts plus selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surplus production to pay for the remainder, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they become a self-sustaining ecosystem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These issues will be hitting before the nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and AI risks, most likely.  The manufacturing jobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue is already politically significant in US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have a high share of such. In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic recovery, productivity improvements are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminating jobs faster than demand increases are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating them, so there is a net job loss in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing sector.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there may not be that much disruption.  What
<br>
percentage of the work-force is actually in the
<br>
manufacturing sector?  Less than 20%.  80% of jobs
<br>
won't be disrupted by automation/nano-tech.  But yes,
<br>
that 20% of jobs scheduled for elimination might still
<br>
cause a fair bit of trouble.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My plan involves building a strong defensible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; residence in a remote location in case of civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disruption in the next 10-15 years.  It happens it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will look like a castle, because medieval
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-enactment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is my hobby.  But castles were defensible residences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their time.  It won't stop a government attack,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it should be proof against looters with small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms.
</em><br>
<p>I think a 'clean win' to Singularity requires FAI
<br>
before 2020.
<br>
<p>If FAI comes later than 2020, then we can still win,
<br>
but things will be 'messy'.  After that date I do
<br>
think that we are at risk of serious civil disruptions
<br>
and techno-disasters.  I think the mess will get worse
<br>
the longer we are without FAI.
<br>
<p>If we get into the 2040's and FAI is still not here,
<br>
then I think we are at serious risk of existential
<br>
threats leading to total extinction.  So the 2040's
<br>
could well be the final dead-line for FAI. 
<br>
<p>Had you considered a move to the state of New
<br>
Hampshire?  A number of Libertarian-Transhumanists
<br>
have agreed to start gathering in New Hampshire.  The
<br>
'Free State Project' aims to get 20 000 liberty
<br>
oriented people to move there.  I'm seriously
<br>
considering a move there at some point.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Part of what I want to do at the residence is study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automation/robotics/replication/parts closure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The power source problem looks already solved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spectrolab, a division of Boeing that makes solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells mostly for satellites, has a triple-junction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell that is 30% efficient at 400 suns.  So while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cells themselves are more expensive per sq cm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than conventional solar cell panels, you don't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very many square cm of cells, and reflectors are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much cheaper per square meter than semiconductors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Overall they require 1/10 the dollar value of flat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panel cells for the same output, which makes solar a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost competitive power source.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds cool.  I'll see you in New Hampshire then?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we need is for life expectancy to improve ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times faster than it has been (i.e. 1.0 year per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year rather than 0.1 year per year).  At the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of improvement, you can expect to live a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years longer than the previous generation.  At a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently high rate of improvement, your chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of lasting long enough for a long term-solution like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading improve dramatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That can come in theory from piecemeal medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances each of which only adds a few years, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the aggregate add decades.

See my other post.  I think that there is only so much
<br>
the bio-medical route can do.  You should be able to
<br>
extend life-span by 20-40 years through the
<br>
bio-medical route, but I don't see max life-span going
<br>
above 120 through the bio-medical route.  Really
<br>
radical extension will require substantial
<br>
intervention over the entire human body system - for
<br>
that we'll need AI and Nano.
