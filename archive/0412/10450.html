</em><br>
<p>I believe real AI is possible certainly. And yes, i
<br>
also believe it is possible to create the exact
<br>
appearance of a thinking thing without it actually
<br>
thinking (as a proof of concept: consider making a 3D
<br>
movie recording of someone performing some action and
<br>
then play it back as a hologram to a naive observer,
<br>
obviously this relies on technology much more advanced
<br>
than we have today, but the point is...illusion can 
<br>
demonstrate behaviour which is indistinguishable from
<br>
real, but appearance is not reality).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If not, your allusion is misleading. Robin, me, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could all be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious beings who only exist in a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being &quot;NPCs&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yep it is, i apologise for the misunderstanding, its a
<br>
bit obscure. I was taking it for granted that the most
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
probable simulated worlds similar to our own are
<br>
mostly occupied by zombie NPCs and perhaps a small
<br>
number of genuinely conscious beings (the PCs) - a
<br>
good reason being that this would minimize the total
<br>
amount of suffering endured in a simulation of the
<br>
modern world. The PCs of course are in the simulation
<br>
to do whatever their purpose is and then return to the
<br>
host world. NPCs are just there to make everything
<br>
seem more realistic and dont have an afterlife or a
<br>
purpose, but if they are not conscious then there are
<br>
no ethical issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simon: &quot;An individual consciousness that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminated would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably return to the world where it began prior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to entering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This again implies that a consciousness in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer simulation could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have originated there. Since this is contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarian views, it not surprising struck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robin as a bizarre
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption. I find it strange as well.
</em><br>
<p>same answer here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Simon: &quot;I suppose it boils down to what you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect the ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards of our hosts to be. Would they really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow sentient beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be born and destroyed for self-interest in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same way that humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treat cattle? Or is it more likely that we are here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for experience or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education or some other perhaps more sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motive?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here, I agree; the moral status attributed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentient Sims (following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Weatherson's reply to Bostrom) by the maintainers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if any have stuck around to watch over us) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical to whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sims should fear for their lives. But, seeing as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of our sim-creators, any assumption about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their ethics is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dubious at best, so we can and should take seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our sim-creators do not care about our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-being.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, how much they care about us seems tied
<br>
to how good we are at creating a friendly
<br>
posthumanity, since there is a kind of recursiveness
<br>
to the whole thing.. our decisions in-sim may be just
<br>
as important as if we werent (depending on how
<br>
realistic the simulation is).
