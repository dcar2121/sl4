I've read &lt;<a href="http://alcor.org/BecomeMember/scheduleA.html">http://alcor.org/BecomeMember/scheduleA.html</a>&gt; and 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://alcor.org/SuspFunding/index.html">http://alcor.org/SuspFunding/index.html</a>&gt;, though not anything on the 
<br>
prices of other cryonics organizations, or for that matter any other 
<br>
material on life insurance. I don't expect them or their estimations to 
<br>
be worse than the best offer by more than one order of magnitude, and 
<br>
they would have to be for my current conclusion to be incorrect on 
<br>
grounds of insufficient data about this topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you *have* the money that's probably the case.  I don't know how much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical insurance payments for cryonics patients would help.
</em><br>
Even if we assume that life insurance has a favorable cost/benefit ratio 
<br>
for someone, there is still the question of what to do with the money in 
<br>
the event of their death; i.e. they could also have it donated to a FAI 
<br>
researching organization.
<br>
If they survive until the end of involuntary death or the destruction of 
<br>
society, whichever happens first, the insurance fees will (for our 
<br>
purposes) have been wasted in any event.
<br>
If they die earlier and use the money to pay for a suspension, they get 
<br>
a chance at having their identity preserved, and, assuming that society 
<br>
sorts out the relevant challenges, of being woken up and living for 
<br>
potentially a very long time.
<br>
If they die earlier and have the money donated to the FAI researching 
<br>
organization, they will probably stay dead; however, the money they give 
<br>
to the organization may save a lot of other people. Or it may not; it 
<br>
depends on whether they already have enough money to do what they are 
<br>
planning, whether the other preconditions for a success are met, etc.
<br>
<p>There are lots of unknowns in both options.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; True.  You might feel the need to factor in the chances (despite their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best efforts) of a Friendly Singularity organization accidently screwing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.
</em><br>
True. However, all of the alternatives known to me look even worse. The 
<br>
best you can do is to choose the organization that is, according to the 
<br>
data available, least likely to screw it up entirely while still having 
<br>
a reasonable chance at succeeding at transhuman FAI.
<br>
Getting cryogenically suspended doesn't solve that problem for you; if 
<br>
society doesn't sort out enough of the current issues to develop ways to 
<br>
defeat death and retrieve the critical information from frozen brains 
<br>
before it destroys itself (if ever), no one will wake you up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; And, obviously, if you really value the life/identity of certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; persons over that of a bunch of (probably) total strangers it makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sense to try to save the former at the cost of the latter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your genes have been selected for this bias:  You should value [...]
</em><br>
The biases you describe are the ones that prevent me from just assigning 
<br>
different inherent undesirabilities to the death of certain specific 
<br>
persons; since I'm not capable of completely cancelling them with 
<br>
reasonable effort, I simply avoid these judgments altogether.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, if you have substantial income, you can afford to donate to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI work and get yourself frozen if you need it.
</em><br>
Then again, you could always donate more to FAI research. It would take 
<br>
a lot of income to completely overfund all projects which you expect to 
<br>
have positive outcomes (high P(Friendly_SI)/P(existential_disaster) 
<br>
ratios). Up to that point, donating more instead of having yourself 
<br>
suspended remains a viable alternative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you think you might want cryonic suspension if you needed it, *at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least* get enough inexpensive life insurance to fund it.  You can always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assign the insurance proceeds to SI if you are lost at sea.
</em><br>
That depends on how rational I expect my future self to be about these 
<br>
matters. Maybe I'll turn into a complete egoist, and make the (from my 
<br>
current perspective) foolish decision to opt for the suspension even 
<br>
though the donation would probably save more lives.
<br>
Another relevant factor is whether the insurance proceeds be payed out 
<br>
before the relevant issues are resolved (s.a.), and how much good the 
<br>
whole sum would do at that point compared to smaller amounts at earlier 
<br>
points of time.
<br>
<p>The only thing I'm aware of that is reasonably likely to make all of 
<br>
these estimations absolutely, horribly wrong are the 
<br>
P(Friendly_SI)/P(existential_disaster) ratios. Incorrect estimations for 
<br>
those could, as you mentioned, lead to a donator actively increasing the 
<br>
chance for a catastrophe through your resource diversion.
<br>
As long as one can exclude that possibility with a sufficiently high 
<br>
probability, donating to the FAI organization looks (given the prior 
<br>
assumptions) like the safe course of action to me (the most you have to 
<br>
lose is your identity, as opposed to that of a pretty high number of 
<br>
other people) - that doesn't mean that it is better on average, of 
<br>
course, but from the data currently available to me that also appears to 
<br>
be the case.
