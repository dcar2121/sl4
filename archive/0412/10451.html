Annual Christmas address by
<br>
Marc Geddes, Spiritual Adviser to Singularity
<br>
Institute ;)
<br>
<p><p>The date of December 25th was actually adopted by the
<br>
Christians from an earlier religion - the Persian
<br>
religion of Mithras.  Mithras was a cosmic warrior
<br>
fighting for truth and justice.  The word in Persian
<br>
means 'Contract' and/or 'Friendliness'.  Mithras
<br>
fought and won the battle against evil, and his
<br>
victory bought altruistic abundance to the Earth.  The
<br>
birthday of this ancient Eastern God?  Believe it or
<br>
not:  It is December 25th.    
<br>
<p>Events continue to accelerate towards the post-human
<br>
future.  We have crossed the lower slopes of the curve
<br>
representing 'The Spike' and now the curve is
<br>
steepening.  The early adopter/pioneering days of
<br>
transhumanism - the days of F.M.Esfandiary and of the
<br>
young Max More - are over.  The 'time of quickening'
<br>
is  upon us, as gems of ideas from the early days are
<br>
deepened and developed, as what was a little known
<br>
band of enthusiasts becomes a movement, as dreams
<br>
start to crystallize into reality and what was
<br>
marginalized starts to morph into the mainstream. 
<br>
<p>Yet there is cause for concern.  Existential threats
<br>
loom on the horizon, closer perhaps than they first
<br>
appeared.  The promised fruits of Bio-tech, Info-tech
<br>
and Nano-tech are still tantalizingly out of reach,
<br>
further away perhaps than we may have hoped.  As to
<br>
AI, there is no way of knowing how far one is from
<br>
destination until one reaches it.  Further away yet
<br>
perhaps, than its enthusiasts may like to believe. 
<br>
Several leading transhumanists lost loved ones this
<br>
year, reminding us of the precarious and often brutal
<br>
nature of our current human condition.
<br>
<p>The transhumanist future can still be won, but the
<br>
chances of success are perhaps not as high they once
<br>
seemed to us.  It is clear that at the least a much
<br>
greater effort will be needed if we are to win through
<br>
to the world we fondly dream of.  This time of
<br>
quickening now demands action, not words.  It demands
<br>
deep thinking and level headed analysis, not hype or
<br>
facile optimism.  The world may yet fall into the
<br>
shadow of darker side of human nature.
<br>
<p>Yet the Christmas period of gift-giving, feasting and
<br>
celebration reminds us of the promises implicit in the
<br>
light in humanity.  Altruism, fertility and peace. 
<br>
The ancient Persian God ‘Mithras’ - the word means
<br>
'Friendliness' - defeated evil and ushered in a new
<br>
age.  This was signified by the dis-lodging of the
<br>
Bull -represented by Taurus - from its prominent place
<br>
in the Zodiac.  The blood of the Bull bought endless
<br>
altruism, fertility and peace to the Earth.  The
<br>
promise of altruism as first grasped by the ancient
<br>
Persians is what we are celebrating on December 25th.
