</em><br>
<p>I second this sentiment.  Harvey, I think you must have encountered the 
<br>
wrong version of many-worlds.  I also find Everett-Wheeler the best 
<br>
quantum theory, and not because of any emotional consequences it might 
<br>
or might not have.  As Tegmark points out, once you think the universe 
<br>
to be spatially infinite, the existence of quantum worlds is quite 
<br>
irrelevant/unnecessary philosphically; the spatial infinity provides as 
<br>
many worlds as one could wish, or fear.  I find MW the best theory 
<br>
because of its pure, mathematical elegance.  In fact, I confess myself 
<br>
utterly incapable of comprehending quantum physics without it.
<br>
<p>The so-called &quot;Copenhagen interpretation&quot; contains hidden informal 
<br>
parameters by refusing to specify what constitutes an &quot;observation&quot; or 
<br>
how far a &quot;quantum collapse&quot; extends; the Copenhagen &quot;theory&quot; (it does 
<br>
not even deserve the phrase) is fitted to the facts post-facto using 
<br>
this informal parameter.  We eliminate this ill-specified adjunct of the 
<br>
&quot;quantum collapse&quot;, delete the strange interloper that is so utterly 
<br>
incompatible with the quiet elegance of unitary evolution, just subtract 
<br>
&quot;collapse&quot; entirely from the theory, and lo, we arrive at exactly the 
<br>
same experimental predictions - except that predictions are delivered in 
<br>
advance, rather than fitted post-facto.  Everett tells us exactly how to 
<br>
calculate when decoherence occurs and how much decoherence it is, all 
<br>
under exactly the same quantum laws that are already necessarily 
<br>
postulated to explain &quot;uncollapsed&quot; behaviors.
<br>
<p>As a slight side effect we find that &quot;worlds&quot; (in a quantum 
<br>
configuration space filled with swirling clouds of probability amplitude 
<br>
in close mutual causal connection) &quot;fork&quot; (a cloud of amplitude develops 
<br>
into separate clouds, groups of points in configuration space 
<br>
interacting with each other but not with nearby clouds of amplitude), a 
<br>
phenomenon interpreted by embedded observers as the other clouds 
<br>
&quot;vanishing&quot;.  But it would be exceedingly strange to take an elegant 
<br>
theory which describes exactly how the clouds diverge, and adjoin a 
<br>
weird and grossly unnecessary postulate which says that as soon as two 
<br>
clouds fall out of causal contact (which, according to Everett, is not a 
<br>
discontinuous process, but a smooth one), all but one of the diverging 
<br>
clouds suddenly vanishes from quantum configuration space (when? why?)
<br>
<p>I emphasize that many-worlds is simply the straightforward extrapolation 
<br>
of quantum theory exactly as it stands, with the unnecessary &quot;collapse 
<br>
postulate&quot; eliminated.  Quantum theory already yields decoherence.  And 
<br>
decoherence is sufficient to explain - nay, predict quantitatively in 
<br>
advance - everything observed.  We do not need to see it post facto and 
<br>
call it a &quot;collapse&quot;, afterward saying that it was caused by an 
<br>
&quot;observation&quot;, and lift our hands and shrug over why the observation 
<br>
collapsed only so much and no more.  Under Everett, all matter in the 
<br>
universe is governed by exactly the same laws.  There is no 
<br>
distinguished event of &quot;observation&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now that I understand many-worlds I cannot imagine a quantum theory that 
<br>
works any other way.  It is like understanding natural selection and 
<br>
then trying to imagine exactly the same biology except that it works by 
<br>
&quot;elan vital&quot;.  Elan vital was an early misinterpretation of biology, 
<br>
grossly ad-hoc and post-facto.  The same may be said of Copenhagen and 
<br>
quantum mechanics.  When they set forth the Schrodinger equation they 
<br>
had *already* explained, formally, with a theory capable of making 
<br>
advance predictions, all that they had observed, without any need of a 
<br>
collapse postulate; yet no one realized that the Schrodinger equation 
<br>
sufficed by itself, until Everett wrote his beautiful paper years later. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So they adjoined a collapse postulate, awkward and ill-specified and 
<br>
informal and out of joint with the rest of physics.  As if angel's wings 
<br>
had been adjoined to Newton's equations to fulfill the task of pushing 
<br>
planets about in the sky, because no one had thought to apply Newton's 
<br>
equations to planets and see that the task of explaining was already 
<br>
done - until a few decades later; and then people said, &quot;Oh, but it is 
<br>
already explained, it is done by angel's wings.  And since the angel's 
<br>
wings already explain the motions of the planets - we just look and 
<br>
whatever we see, we say it is the angel's wings - your theory can never 
<br>
be proven.&quot;
<br>
<p>As a slight side effect of Everett's simpler quantum mechanics, obtained 
<br>
*purely* by eliminating one awkward dangling postulate from a theory 
<br>
already complete without it, we find predicted the high-level phenomenon 
<br>
previously interpreted as &quot;collapse&quot; caused by &quot;observation&quot;, and now 
<br>
revealed as diverging clouds of amplitude - that is, forking worlds. 
<br>
But for one who has already come to terms with the spatial infinity of 
<br>
the universe, this should be no additional burden.
<br>
<p>I have not used the term &quot;MWI&quot;.  Many-worlds is not an &quot;interpretation&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many-minds, the deranged mad cousin of Everett, is an &quot;interpretation&quot; 
<br>
and one which makes no sense.  Copenhagen is an &quot;interpretation&quot;. 
<br>
Many-worlds is a unified theory that applies to quantum fields, period; 
<br>
making no mention of observers, minds, or anything else.  MW is not an 
<br>
&quot;interpretation&quot;.  It is a formal model, unlike its competitors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pardon my incredulity, but I find your statement offensive; and doubly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so due to your having presented zero justification for your strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slander.
</em><br>
<p>These are the possibilities:
<br>
<p>1)  Harvey has not seen the elegance of the math, and having not seen 
<br>
the elegance of the math, is extremely disturbed by the possibility of 
<br>
himself forking a million times per second.
<br>
<p>2)  Harvey has enough knowledge that he *should* have seen the math, but 
<br>
is extremely disturbed by the prospect of forking a million times per 
<br>
second, and so he searches for an excuse.
<br>
<p>3)  Harvey has already come to terms with the spatial infinity of the 
<br>
universe implied by contemporary astrophysics, and so many-worlds means 
<br>
nothing to him emotionally one way or the other; but Harvey has not seen 
<br>
the elegance of the math, has encountered the wacky philosophical 
<br>
deranged brother of Everett known as &quot;many-minds&quot;, or heard some other 
<br>
extremely poor justification of many-worlds.
<br>
<p>4)  Harvey has not come to terms with spatial infinity, so MW would be a 
<br>
new emotional shock to him, and also he has not heard the good physics 
<br>
reasons for MW.  This would explain his reaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Call me crazy for suggesting this, but how 'bout we avoid dismissing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posit of physics found plausible by a number of actual physicists
</em><br>
<p>63% according to that legendary informal poll.  Certainly a very large 
<br>
number of prominent physicists.  That is mere argument from authority, 
<br>
of course.  But I see no reason to suppose that these prominent 
<br>
physicists are messianic transhumanists, when so great a bounty of 
<br>
mathematical elegance lies at hand, to explain their choice of explanation.
