<em>&gt; I am completely accepting about it. My grandmother slowly died of cancer
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am afraid that only you can decide that you actually want to live. 
<br>
It is probably one of the most fundamental instances of  free will we
<br>
have.   Current sucky circumstances can look a bit different when
<br>
viewed from a longer perspective.   Also it is important to realize
<br>
that what you think of yourself and your possibilities in the current
<br>
world is all the low end of potential currently in demonstration.  It
<br>
says very little about what is ultimately possible or about you
<br>
running in much improved circumstances with better instantiation at
<br>
higher capability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm ambivalent to whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I die, I don't delude myself into thinking I'm particularly special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'm smart enough to know I'm not smart enough) so I don't feel it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a loss to our species. I also think that once I'm dead, that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existance is over so I won't have any regrets about dieing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Seeming not smart enough now is not very important compared to how
<br>
smart you can become.   It is a huge loss to our species that most of
<br>
us can't think beyond what is in front of us and our programming to
<br>
date to see what is possible and commit to making it real.
<br>
<p>Once you are dead then one set of possibilities is ended.   Game Over
<br>
for you and all potential that started with you now.  No more chances
<br>
to play and thus no chance to win or to find/create a compelling
<br>
&quot;reason to be&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps if the things going on in the world didn't seem so bleak and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general populace so uncaring and ignorant then I'd feel more kinship for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people and that there was a point to everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I feel kinship with them simply because I find what is &quot;out there&quot; to
<br>
be &quot;in here&quot; also.  The point to everything is what we make the point
<br>
be.  It is not something handed to us from outside.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyhow, despite my blase attitude to nonexistance, I'm still doing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can to forward the singularity so that maybe my attitude will change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think you will have to deal with your attitude on your own.
