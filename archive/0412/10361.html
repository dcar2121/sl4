<p><p>Well in that case, everyone should just send their money to me instead, 
<br>
if results matter.
<br>
<p>My qualifications:
<br>
<p>1.) No one has written a pop-sci book that covers the theoretics of my 
<br>
work.
<br>
2.) I can actually explain why the systems work the way they do and why 
<br>
it is important, with math even.
<br>
3.) Demonstrable critical capabilities in implementation that are 
<br>
unique in computer science.
<br>
4.) I made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.
<br>
<p><p>With all due respect Gaurav, why did you even bother to stump for cash 
<br>
on this list when you offer no reason why anyone should give you any?  
<br>
No design theory offered, let alone a defense of it, and you are a new 
<br>
face around these parts (okay, at least to me).  There is nothing to 
<br>
differentiate yourself from the hundred other wannabe AI hacks that 
<br>
infest the field.  AI is littered with the carcasses of smart people 
<br>
with credentials, and even the survivors fight for the scraps of a 
<br>
world that basically ignores them.  I think Ronald Reagan was President 
<br>
of the US the last time AI was actually sexy to the public at large.
<br>
<p>This list is all about red meat, as in standing in an arena full of 
<br>
lions with it tied around your neck.  You better be bold and prepared 
<br>
to make your case.
<br>
<p>And last, but not least, what is the kind of organization that you want 
<br>
people to give money to?  Non-profit organization?  Privately held 
<br>
for-profit venture (like mine)?  A rogue band of Amish building an AI 
<br>
Babbage Engine out of wood in a barn?  This matters to people, and your 
<br>
website is essentially content-free.
<br>
<p>cheers,
