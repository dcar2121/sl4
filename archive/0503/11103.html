| Chess players get this if they start very young and have talent.

<br>
<p>Chess sequences can be learned - an experienced player will always
<br>
beat an inexperienced player of equal skill.
<br>
<p>Chess games require excellent visualisation, and dare I say it,
<br>
Chesstelligence. It's not just raw intelligence, but also the mindset
<br>
for paying attention to detail, imagining move sequences,
<br>
understanding position etc. A higher ranked player will always beat a
<br>
lower ranked player.
<br>
<p>Frankly, most adults aren't very good at chess. It's easy to beat them
<br>
not because you are smart, but because they are not actually good
<br>
chess players. Chess has simple rules, and a fascinated child will
<br>
beat an adult who only plays once a year.
<br>
<p>There are child prodigies in many areas, but that is not a good
<br>
counter-argument to the principle that 5-year old braniacs can go
<br>
around beating adult intelligences with ease.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
