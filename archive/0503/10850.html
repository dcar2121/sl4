<p>
I have lately read a profile of the man on whom
<br>
the Dustin Hoffman Rain Man character is mainly
<br>
based. One article can be found at
<br>
<a href="http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/kimpeek.cfm">http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/kimpeek.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>He is not autistic nor institutionalized like the
<br>
movie character, but is not neurologically normal
<br>
either, born in 1951 with &quot;an enlarged head, with
<br>
an encephalocele, according to his doctors. An
<br>
MRI shows, again according to his doctors, an
<br>
absent corpus callosum--the connecting tissue
<br>
between the left and right hemispheres; no
<br>
anterior commissure and damage to the cerebellum.
<br>
Only a thin layer of skull covers the area of the
<br>
previous encephalocele.&quot; Although he has the
<br>
nickname 'Kimputer,' he can't really dress
<br>
himself, and it's thought that both his abilities
<br>
and disabilities have to do with the 'split
<br>
brain', or lack of corpus callosum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the article:
</em><br>
Fran Peek describes his son this way: &quot;Kim is not
<br>
behaviorally autistic. He has a warm, loving
<br>
personality. He truly cares for people and enjoys
<br>
sharing his unique skills and knowledge capacity.
<br>
Known as Kimputer' to many, his knowledge-library
<br>
includes World and American History, People and
<br>
Leaders, Geography (roads and highways in U.S.
<br>
and Canada), Professional Sports (baseball,
<br>
basketball, football, Kentucky Derby winners
<br>
etc), the Space Program, Movies and movie themes,
<br>
Actors and Actresses, the Bible, Mormon Church
<br>
Doctrine and History, Calendar Calculations
<br>
(including a person's day of birth, present
<br>
year~s birthday, and the year and the date the
<br>
person will turn 65 years old so he or she can
<br>
retire), Literature/Authors, Shakespeare,
<br>
Telephone Area Codes, major Zip Codes, all TV
<br>
stations and their markets. He can identify most
<br>
classical music compositions and tell the date
<br>
the music was written and the composer's birth
<br>
date and place of birth and death Kim has read
<br>
(and can recall) some 7600 books. He also keeps
<br>
current on world, U.S. and most local events by
<br>
reading newspapers, magazines and by listening to
<br>
the media. He reads constantly He can also
<br>
describe the highways that go to a person's small
<br>
town, the county, area code and zip code,
<br>
television stations available in the town, who
<br>
the person's pay their telephone bill to, and
<br>
describe any historical events that may have
<br>
occurred in their area. His expertise includes at
<br>
least 14 subject areas.&quot;
<br>
<p>A different article fills in the details a bit:
<br>
<a href="http://www.prideindustries.com/news_and_events/press_releases.php?id=147">http://www.prideindustries.com/news_and_events/press_releases.php?id=147</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;You and I have a left brain and a right brain,&quot;
<br>
Fran explained. &quot;We only have to remember half of
<br>
what we hear because it goes through a filtering
<br>
system... Kim doesn't have a left and right
<br>
brain. He has no filtering system. Everything
<br>
that goes into his corpus callosum, which is
<br>
extremely damaged...is all saved. He's been
<br>
blessed with a total photogenic [sic] memory.&quot;
<br>
<p>The only scary part is this: &quot;Peek is currently
<br>
working with NASA's artificial intelligence
<br>
department, in which scientists are trying to
<br>
recreate a 3-dimensional replica of Kim's brain.&quot;
<br>
Given NASA's track record over the last twenty
<br>
years... (shudders)
<br>
<p>What interests me about savants is that they are
<br>
the closest thing we have right now to superhuman
<br>
general intelligence, and there might be a few
<br>
clues we can glean about the attitudes and
<br>
behaviors of a general SAI. Somehow, I'm not
<br>
surprised to read that Peek is a kindly man;
<br>
nasty people tend to be a bit stupid or narrow,
<br>
even if they are clever about getting what they
<br>
narrowly want. And I am tempted to fantasize
<br>
about getting him to take an interest in
<br>
programming and helping create a FAI. If anyone
<br>
can keep all the details straight, it would be
<br>
him.
