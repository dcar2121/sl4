<p>
Greetings, everyone. As I'm sure most of you realize, SIAI's mission
<br>
is of the utmost importance. I'm very excited to have this opportunity
<br>
to participate in increasing the likelihood of a safe Transition.
<br>
<p>Some of my initial thoughts on activities follow; your comments and
<br>
feedback are welcome.
<br>
<p>1. Build a list of sites from which we might request links or link exchanges.
<br>
<p>2. Build a list of bloggers to contact. A few times, I've had e-mails
<br>
to popular bloggers quoted or referenced in subsequent posts, greatly
<br>
increasing the exposure my comments would otherwise have received.
<br>
There are two approaches here, both of which we might pursue. First,
<br>
becoming more active in the technology and/or ethics blogspheres, to
<br>
win the hearts (minds) of more people already dedicating some of their
<br>
time to tech, ethics, or both. Second, contacting a few popular
<br>
&quot;general&quot; blogs with interesting e-mails, with the hope that they will
<br>
take to the message (doubtful) or just think our issues are so odd or
<br>
wrong as to deserve mention (ridicule even). That's fine to me to an
<br>
extent, because the exposure still seems a net good and because we can
<br>
in many cases defend ourselves in the relevant comments section,
<br>
increasing public awareness that we exist and promoting FAI-directed
<br>
public dialogue.
<br>
<p>3. Work with volunteers, where plausible, to initiate...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Local talks/lectures on SIAI-relevant issues
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Discussion/reading groups with books from the SIAI reading list
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Student groups, for volunteers at university
<br>
<p>I am involved in growing these activities in the D.C. area, and will
<br>
gladly help you establish a successful local presence in your area. In
<br>
some cases, I may even be able to travel to your city to better help
<br>
set up events, speak on Singularity ethics &amp; issues, or participate in
<br>
discussion groups. Contact me if you're interested!
<br>
<p>4. Create and distribute a bullet list of talking points on the
<br>
Singularity and the importance of SIAI's work.
<br>
<p>5. Similarly, create and distribute a list of frequent objections and
<br>
our responses to those objections.
<br>
<p>The information content of 4 &amp; 5 is already available spread across
<br>
articles on intelligence.org and the SL4 wiki and archives, so this is
<br>
more about repackaging/consolidating than creating new arguments,
<br>
although new compelling arguments are always welcome.
<br>
4 &amp; 5 would both be useful in pursuing 1, 2, &amp; 3.
<br>
<p>6. I would also like to gather resources for SIAI on effective
<br>
advocacy techniques, the social psychology of successful movements,
<br>
ways of (non-deceptively) framing our message that make it more likely
<br>
for people to connect to the importance of our goals.
<br>
<p>I've already begun doing a net search for relevant materials. If you
<br>
know of anything that would be useful in this regard, speak up.
<br>
<p>7. Lastly, this list is not exhaustive. I would love to hear any
<br>
thoughts you might have on directions the SIAI volunteer community
<br>
might take or resources we might use.
<br>
<p>In addition to this e-mail address (<a href="mailto:analyticphilosophy@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20SIAI:%20New%20Volunteer%20Coordinator">analyticphilosophy@gmail.com</a>),
<br>
which I check regularly, you can also add me to your AIM contact list
<br>
and/or give me a call. My username is &quot;wwfaid&quot;, which stands for &quot;What
<br>
would Friendly A.I. do?&quot;, and my mobile number is (703) 944-1386. Feel
<br>
free to contact me by any of these methods to discuss SIAI volunteer
<br>
opportunities or related matters.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
