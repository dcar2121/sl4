<p><em>&gt; You also asked for examples of what an AI could infer about humans from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at its source code. Here are some, off the top of my head:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Look at the last modified dates. Humans take a long time to write code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Human-written code contains many lengthy, ignorable comments; humans do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not think in code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Humans use long variable names; they need to be constantly reminded of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what each variable is for.
</em><br>
<p>These can all be eliminated. Also, as far as the machine is concerned, &quot;source
<br>
code&quot; (e.g. uncompiled C/C++/Java/...) is no different from plain machine code,
<br>
so long as the AI has the privileges to modify it. This doesn't have long
<br>
variable names (%ebx again! hah! they must have weak cognitive faculties) or
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Human code is highly modular, to the detriment of performance. By this and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the above, humans have a small short-term memory.
</em><br>
<p>It looks a lot less modular when you compile it. Also, this doesn't tell you
<br>
that they have weak memories. It might tell you they have little patience, but
<br>
how would you infer that if you had no concept of &quot;human,&quot; &quot;date,&quot; &quot;reminded,&quot;
<br>
&quot;patience,&quot; and so on.
<br>
<p>A good exercise is to try to reason to the existence of aliens without using
<br>
any facts about the physics of our universe, or the existence of humans, or how
<br>
biology works, or any of that. I don't think it can be done. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you seem to be saying that your AI has this concept of a mind, which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumes must be a Bayesian rationalist, and so when it encounters a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being, it will not have anticipated a mind which is irrational. What seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to me is that a mind-in-general would view a mind-in-general as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just another type of system which can be manipulated into a desired state.
</em><br>
<p>I can't tell if you're talking about the story I gave, or the application to
<br>
AI. If we mean the AI, why would it even think it was dealing with a
<br>
mind-in-general? Remember, the AI is like a solipsist who has no reason to
<br>
presuppose any facts about the outside world, other than that it exists
<br>
(assuming it has anything resembling a conscious state). But unlike most
<br>
solipsists, it doesn't have a wealth of sense-data that suggests that its
<br>
solipsism might be wrong. The information being fed into the AI would not be
<br>
like talking to someone on IRC. It would be like God speaking straight into 
<br>
your mind.
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
