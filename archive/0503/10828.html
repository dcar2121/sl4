<p>If it is 100% complete, hopefully you won't mind being asked to expand
<br>
on some parts. I think you have a good basis for your theory, but I
<br>
need to probe it a little.
<br>
<p>| It is the ability of the mind to form metaphors/analogies which is
<br>
| the heart of intelligence and it this which gives rise to qualia
<br>
<p>How does forming a metaphor help give rise to qualia? This
<br>
mis-understanding might be the same one that holds me up later also.
<br>
<p>| The mind as a whole is a complex system which can be decomposed
<br>
| into sub-system ?Rationality? (lower sub-level) and sub-system
<br>
| ?Morality? (higher sub-level).  The key is the interaction between
<br>
| the two, which is *the ability of the mind to form metaphors which
<br>
| enables it to understand models of physical processes in terms of
<br>
| models of it?s own internal value systems*! (Bridging the physical
<br>
| and mental worlds through metaphors ? similarities between moral
<br>
| laws and physical laws).
<br>
<p>I think the term morality is not a good one - it appears to be saying
<br>
that the formation of metaphors (and thus qualia) has some kind of
<br>
good/evil distinction involved. Is that a proper understanding? Why
<br>
not call them Rationality and Intuition for example?
<br>
<p>You seem to be very deliberately using the term morality - yet surely
<br>
there we have some metaphorical knowledge that is not morally laden?
<br>
Such as an inductive partial understanding of physics, for example. Or
<br>
are you using indiction in a different meaning to me?
<br>
<p>What is the thinking behind calling rationality a &quot;linear&quot; process,
<br>
and induction a &quot;non-linear&quot; one? I doubt you literally mean the
<br>
mathematical concept of linear, you must be employing one of those
<br>
metaphors to which you referred, but unfortunately, I am not forming a
<br>
bridge between your metaphor and my rationality!! :)
