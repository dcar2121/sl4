<em>&gt; algorithmic systems vastly exceeds the intrinsic complexity of the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the frequently glossed over issue of model starvation.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot solve the problem of model starvation by churning on the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits over and over, as no new information (i.e. potential knowledge) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is added to the system.  Nor can the system automagically obtain more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information than is intrinsic to what it has been exposed to. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence is powerful precisely because it is a reflection of its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment and nothing more (except perhaps whatever simple biases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in its machinery).  There is a bootstrap problem here; an AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too ignorant to be a threat is too ignorant to become a threat on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  own without a lot of help from its environment, and computers live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in sensory deprivation chambers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could one design a system and environment that allows the AI to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly become adept at understanding and manipulating human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior?  Sure! But the point is that this is not a feature of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence but of the internal model built via the intelligence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and would require a vast quantity of environmental data in support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  achieving that model.  A sufficiently complex AI system with a rich 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment may arrive at that capability eventually on its own, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll have to wait a while. It would be a trivial thing to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain specific super-intelligence via selective model starvation on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the part of its designers.  Obviously, this would significantly limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  some of the theoretical utility of such a system.  But the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is that model starvation is the default state for intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems generally, and that it is quite expensive to extend knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any given direction, something that the designers of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can easily control; whether they actually do or not is another issue.
</em><br>
<p>James,
<br>
<p>Do you believe this limitation on intelligence holds true for the 
<br>
infinite-computing power version of AIXI?  That is, do you think it's a 
<br>
hard information-theoretical limit, rather than an inefficiency of 
<br>
bounded computing power?
<br>
<p>Also, would you care to quantify the minimum environmental information 
<br>
required to produce a model capable of manipulating a human?  To a guess 
<br>
if you cannot calculate.
