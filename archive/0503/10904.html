</em><br>
This reminds me of a passage from some book by my
<br>
fave author, Robert Anton Wilson. He was talking
<br>
about this very issue, using the example of the
<br>
Double Cross. The Double Cross was a mindfuck
<br>
British military intelligence laid on the German
<br>
military intelligence during the Second World
<br>
War, IIRC. When the Brits would catch an Abwehr
<br>
spy working in England, they would 'turn' him if
<br>
possible, getting him to agree to continue as a
<br>
double agent and feed his bosses back in Berlin
<br>
bad data. About 20% of all Abwehr staff were
<br>
double agents, even including Admiral Canaris,
<br>
the head honcho! And the British added to the
<br>
mischief by using the double agents to tell the
<br>
Germans that &quot;The British have turned a large
<br>
number of Abwehr agents and are using them to
<br>
feed Abwehr bad info.&quot; This nasty little
<br>
Epimenides trick was called the Double Cross, and
<br>
it created a double bind for the Germans. If
<br>
true, the Brits were feeding them lies, and if
<br>
not, then the Brits had fed them a lie, and who
<br>
were the doubles, and which info was bad? As RAW
<br>
points out, &quot;the Double Cross could never be
<br>
penetrated by so crude an engine as simply
<br>
believing the opposite of what one was told.&quot;
<br>
And, as RAW has Aleister Crowley say to a
<br>
character in a completely different book, &quot;Did
<br>
you think the truth was a dog, that would come
<br>
running when you whistled?&quot;
<br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; But the life lesson still holds.  I don't much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credit the beliefs of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people whom I don't think are applying their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual intellects to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.  Nor would the modesty argument have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; served me well.
</em><br>
And one more pithy quote about truth:
<br>
The nearest each of us can come to God is by
<br>
loving the truth. 
<br>
— Buckminster Fuller
<br>
It doesn't take me long to tell whether someone
<br>
loves the truth or not, and that's pretty much
<br>
how I choose my friends (and regrettably my
<br>
enemies).
