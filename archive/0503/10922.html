<p>Did you perhaps mean friendly rather than &quot;honest&quot; above?

<p><em>&gt;I have just finished an essay titled &quot;Can Evolutionary considerations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;account for the origins of human morality?.&quot; I don't go so far as to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that evolution LEADS to morality, but that humans have evolved to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social and moral, in a way that is both a natural extension of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;animal ancestry and in which morality is a dynamic concept.
</em><br>
<p>If you are going to invoke evolution . . . .  if morality is an outcome of 
<br>
human psychological traits, and those psychological traits are the result 
<br>
of evolution morality as we know it is an outcome of evolution.
<br>
<p>The problem is that the majority of our evolution occurred in the stone 
<br>
age, where the environment was competing hunter gatherer tribes.  There has 
<br>
been time since the beginning of agriculture for some evolution if there 
<br>
was heavy selection pressure, but not a lot.  (I think genes for working 
<br>
like beavers to get the crops in for winter might have been selected since 
<br>
those who failed often starved in the winter.)
<br>
<p>The other aspect of morality as an outcome of evolved psychological traits 
<br>
is that it has to close a feedback selection loop right back to the 
<br>
genes.  Hamilton's inclusive fitness criteria is essential to understanding 
<br>
why mothers sacrifice for their children and why warriors will fight to the 
<br>
death for their tribes and why these are considered &quot;moral.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another thing to consider is that morality is situational.  Humans have had 
<br>
no serious predators for millions of years.  Thus when we over taxed the 
<br>
environment or a weather glitch made resources tight, fighting with 
<br>
neighbors instead of trading with them became the moral thing to do.
<br>
<p>Building a social AI with the conditional psychological traits we seem to 
<br>
have could result in &quot;interesting times&quot; if the AI sensed a resource tight 
<br>
future.
