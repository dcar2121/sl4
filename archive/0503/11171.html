</em><br>
<p>I think the question here was over terminology. What I think Mr.
<br>
Leeuwenburg was saying is that it's incorrect to say that an adaptive
<br>
trait can &quot;misfire&quot;, because that presumes a teleological origin of
<br>
the trait, which for a literal interpretation of evolution is a no-no.
<br>
However, I tend to agree with you, Keith, that it's perfectly OK to
<br>
use this terminology to describe certain phenomena. But let's make
<br>
sure we're clear on what we're describing.
<br>
<p>A &quot;misfiring&quot; of an adaptive trait is a consequence of that trait that
<br>
affects the organism adversely in certain situations (such that the
<br>
organism would survive more often in those situations without the
<br>
particular adaptation). If these &quot;misfirings&quot; for any particular trait
<br>
were worse than the advantages overall (in the EEA), the trait would
<br>
have never evolved, and thus the negative consequence is usually only
<br>
seen in unusual circumstances. Sometimes, as with sugar consumption
<br>
and fat storage, it is seen more often, when the circumstance is a
<br>
novel feature of modern society.
<br>
<p>But I think this usage, metaphorical as it is, isn't too dangerous, is
<br>
it, Tennessee? Certainly to use it is not necessarily to
<br>
&quot;misunderstand the nature of evolution&quot;, though it may obscure the
<br>
actual method of evolutionary adaptation. I think the paragraph of
<br>
Keith's to which you were replying to originally didn't abuse the
<br>
term.
