<em>&gt; I am surprised that the responses to the original post don't mention William 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamilton's inclusive fitness or evolutionary psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The root of what looks like altruism is selfish genes, evolved to do the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the can with whatever nastiness nature deals out.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't look like altruism, it is altruism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The classic example is that we have evolved to make the ultimate sacrifice of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying if it will save relatives from dying.  In particular, over the eons we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have evolved to give up our lives doing so would save more than two sibs, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 4 half sibs or more than 8 cousins.  (Or some mix of relatives 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you rate sibs as being worth 1/2 of your own value, half sibs as 1/4 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.)
</em><br>
<p>The math is being very over simplified here. The number of identical
<br>
versions of genes we share with someone does not fall off at this rate. Self
<br>
sacrifice to save some reasonably number small of humans picked at random,
<br>
will still tend to favor the propogation of your genes, because amongst
<br>
that random sample will be multiple copies of your particular versions of
<br>
genes.
<br>
<p>We end up with two competing curves:
<br>
<p>1) How many of your versions of a gene can be duplicated by helping
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someone else.
<br>
<p>2) How many of your versions of a gene can be duplicated by pushing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them out of the way to make room for more relatives.
<br>
<p>In both cases altruism is involved, in the first of a nice variety and
<br>
in the second of a not so nice variety. Going to war rarely benefits those
<br>
who do the fighting personally, and has a high risk of death and severe
<br>
injury.
<br>
<p>The intersection of these curves is the point between 'nice' and 'nasty'
<br>
altruism, cooperation vs. war. Of course we arn't just gene carriers,
<br>
we are meme carriers as well, the difference between a cave man and a
<br>
modern human is memes, and these can be quickly transfered far beyond 
<br>
boundaries of close genetic relations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, humans didn't come with genetic analysis kits during the stone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age, so our ancestors had to do with such information as they had at hand, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuing those they grew up with as somewhere between sibs and half sibs and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the tribe as between cousins and second cousins (on average).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus to save the rest of the human race (which maxes out &quot;relatives&quot;) Robin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I would be willing to make an ultimate sacrifice.  It's simply the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our genes have built our psychological traits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altruism between unrelated people can be considered a misfiring of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved psychological traits.
</em><br>
<p>There are no unrelated people. There is only the balance I mention above,
<br>
a competition resources played off against the fact that we are all related
<br>
to each other to varying extents.
<br>
<p>This goes beyond humans even, lets say you where the last human alive,
<br>
space aliens gave you a choice. You could live out the rest of your
<br>
natural life, but they would destroy all non human life. Or you could die
<br>
and they would spare all non human life. Sacrificing yourself is the only
<br>
way to keep some of your genes in the gene pool, since you share them to
<br>
an extent with other earthly life forms. I believe most peoples instinct
<br>
would be to sacrifice themselves for the sake of non human earth based
<br>
life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We just don't live in related tribes to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent we did in the stone age so we treat others better than their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatedness to us would justify in gene terms.
</em><br>
<p>No quite the opposite. We are on the verge of expanding into space.
<br>
Because of this curve #1 above dominates over #2, however our instincts
<br>
are leading us to put much more effort into fighting over earths resources
<br>
than into getting human habitation established in space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another aspect of what is sometimes called altruism is &quot;reciprocal altruism.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best non primate example of this is vampire bats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there is status &quot;altruism.&quot;  People are strongly wired up by genes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strive for social status.  We are largely descended from people (men mostly) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who  obtained attention and high status by killing large animals and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole tribe feasting off their kills.  The high status got them a wife (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second/third wife).  Bill Gates gives away money even though he doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convert doing so into more offspring.  (Well, not that I know about anyway.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the extent &quot;pure&quot; altruism exists, it is a misfiring of psychological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms that usually worked to enhance &quot;inclusive fitness&quot; in our hunter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gatherer past.
</em><br>
<p>I think your still trying too hard to make altruism not real. The simple
<br>
fact that we die makes altruism rather than self interest our primary
<br>
driving instinct. However this is not always a nice instinct, there is 
<br>
always a tension between 'nice' and 'nasty' altruism. Do you help someone, 
<br>
thus helping to propagate genes/memes you share with them, or do you bump 
<br>
them off and try to replace them with someone who shares more genes/memes 
<br>
with you.
