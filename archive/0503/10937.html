</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You here talk about the interaction between a

</em><br>

...
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I am not talking about idea formation, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather about how choices
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; function, which is a key
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that we have intuitive beliefs about emotion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally able to reason logically about both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, both of us have identified that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two kinds of ways in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which ideas get affected by mental processes - one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way is relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formal, involving the kind of deduction one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe with logic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and another which is less formal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless, of course, you want to say that you meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your &quot;non-linear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inductive&quot; mode to still be formalisable.
</em><br>
<p>My system of reasoning about morality is not meant to
<br>
be any less formal than the system reasoning about
<br>
physics.  I think the non-linear inductive mode is
<br>
totally formalisable as well.  My values/physics split
<br>
is NOT a split between intuition and formal reasoning.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | The mind as a whole is a complex system which can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | decomposed into sub-system ?Rationality? (lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | sub-level) and sub-system ?Morality? (higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | sub-level).  The key is the interaction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | two, which is *the ability of the mind to form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | metaphors which enables it to understand models of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | physical processes in terms of models of it?s own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | internal value systems*! (Bridging the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | mental worlds through metaphors ? similarities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | moral laws and physical laws).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems to me to be very similar to a dialectic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two kinds of thinking in my model.
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  See above.  I was NOT suggesting an
<br>
intuition/formal reasoning split.  Both my system of
<br>
reasoning about morals/values and my system of
<br>
reasoning about physics are meant to be totally
<br>
rational and formalisable.  
<br>
<p>I have pairs of functions which are synergistic, NOT
<br>
pairs of functions which are opposites (dialectic).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You clearly regard moral laws as the exclusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain on the non-linear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode you identify, 
</em><br>
<p>Not at all!  Don't forget the recursive nature of my
<br>
idea!  I had meant for there to be many different
<br>
*kinds* (levels) of inductive.  Only from the point of
<br>
view of the highest level of coarse graining is moral
<br>
reasoning inductive.  I am talking about many
<br>
different levels of organization here O.K?  I think
<br>
only high level reasoning about morality is inductive.
<br>
&nbsp;Lower levels of reasoning about morality involve
<br>
linear deduction as well.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;whereas I think it is clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we reason in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linear fashion about moral ideas.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  In fact I think we reason in both an
<br>
inductive and a linear fashion about moral ideas, just
<br>
like everything else we reason about.  Probably you
<br>
were confused because I was using the words
<br>
'inductive' and 'deductive' to refer to many different
<br>
levels of reasoning.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The same logic that we use in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regards to physics (laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of non-contradiction, implication, transitive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intransitive relations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc) applies to moral ideas also.
</em><br>
<p>Well, kind of.  But be careful!  I think reasoning
<br>
about morality is a higher level form of reasoning.  I
<br>
do not believe that the logic used for physics can be
<br>
directly used for morality as well.  That is the
<br>
mistake being made by the Yudkowksy's and Goertezel's
<br>
&nbsp;of this world.  They are trying to squeeze all of
<br>
moral reasoning into the strait jacket of current
<br>
probability theory.  But I strongly suspect that
<br>
current probability theory is not up to task! 
<br>
<p>I suspect some kind of major generalization of
<br>
probability theory will be needed to properly handle
<br>
moral reasoning.
