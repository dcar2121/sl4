<p><p>It used to be a maximum of 17 years from the date a patent was granted. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this led to the &quot;submarine patent&quot; problem where a patent 
<br>
could be kept in-process for decades using procedural tricks without 
<br>
starting the clock but still having claim from the original filing 
<br>
date.
<br>
<p>This was fixed a few years ago by making the patent only valid for 20 
<br>
years from the filing date, not the grant date, thereby rendering the 
<br>
submarining of patents largely pointless.
<br>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies have a different set of problems.  After 
<br>
filing for a patent on a new medicine and then getting FDA approval, 
<br>
they typically only have five years on the patent left in which to 
<br>
recover several hundred million dollars before the generics swoop in.  
<br>
However, many people are not aware that there is a kind of evil 
<br>
relationship here.  By law, any medical technology that is not FDA 
<br>
approved must be sold at cost until the approval date, but this does 
<br>
not preclude the widespread usage of the product on a provisional basis 
<br>
while the FDA is reviewing it.
<br>
<p>The Federal government is a very large medical purchaser, and many 
<br>
times will universally adopt a patented medical technology prior to 
<br>
official FDA approval.  In cases like this, the FDA has a bad habit of 
<br>
not approving some medical technology until the last possible date 
<br>
before they are legally required to make a decision.  By using their 
<br>
leverage in the FDA to delay approval of some hot new medical 
<br>
technology that the government and everyone else has been using for 
<br>
years, the Federal government buys themselves a few years of at cost 
<br>
usage of the technology before the company that created it is legally 
<br>
allowed to make a profit on it.  Unfortunately, this also substantially 
<br>
reduces the window in which the company can recover their sunk cost 
<br>
because the clock is running out on the patents.  Having the Federal 
<br>
government being both a major medical purchaser and running the FDA 
<br>
creates a clear conflict of interest that is exploited to its 
<br>
advantage.
<br>
<p><p>Intellectual property is largely irrelevant with respect to FAI as it 
<br>
is a commercial issue, and therefore mostly irrelevant to SL4.
