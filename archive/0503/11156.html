<p><em>&gt;It has been interesting to see the chats concerning the self-proclaimed

</em><br>
<em>&gt;(originator of the Cryonics Organization in Michigan).
</em><br>
<p>Snip
<br>
<p>I am surprised that the responses to the original post don't mention 
<br>
William Hamilton's inclusive fitness or evolutionary psychology.
<br>
<p>The root of what looks like altruism is selfish genes, evolved to do the 
<br>
best the can with whatever nastiness nature deals out.
<br>
<p>The classic example is that we have evolved to make the ultimate sacrifice 
<br>
of dying if it will save relatives from dying.  In particular, over the 
<br>
eons we have evolved to give up our lives doing so would save more than two 
<br>
sibs, more than 4 half sibs or more than 8 cousins.  (Or some mix of 
<br>
relatives where you rate sibs as being worth 1/2 of your own value, half 
<br>
sibs as 1/4 etc.)
<br>
<p>Of course, humans didn't come with genetic analysis kits during the stone 
<br>
age, so our ancestors had to do with such information as they had at hand, 
<br>
valuing those they grew up with as somewhere between sibs and half sibs and 
<br>
the rest of the tribe as between cousins and second cousins (on average).
<br>
<p>Thus to save the rest of the human race (which maxes out &quot;relatives&quot;) Robin 
<br>
and I would be willing to make an ultimate sacrifice.  It's simply the way 
<br>
our genes have built our psychological traits.
<br>
<p>Altruism between unrelated people can be considered a misfiring of the 
<br>
evolved psychological traits.  We just don't live in related tribes to the 
<br>
extent we did in the stone age so we treat others better than their 
<br>
relatedness to us would justify in gene terms.
<br>
<p>Another aspect of what is sometimes called altruism is &quot;reciprocal 
<br>
altruism.&quot;  The best non primate example of this is vampire bats.
<br>
<p>Then there is status &quot;altruism.&quot;  People are strongly wired up by genes to 
<br>
strive for social status.  We are largely descended from people (men 
<br>
mostly) who  obtained attention and high status by killing large animals 
<br>
and the whole tribe feasting off their kills.  The high status got them a 
<br>
wife (or second/third wife).  Bill Gates gives away money even though he 
<br>
doesn't convert doing so into more offspring.  (Well, not that I know about 
<br>
anyway.)
<br>
<p>To the extent &quot;pure&quot; altruism exists, it is a misfiring of psychological 
<br>
mechanisms that usually worked to enhance &quot;inclusive fitness&quot; in our hunter 
<br>
gatherer past.
<br>
<p>It's really not a mystery.
