<em>&gt; reverse-engineer in part even most simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic systems vastly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceeds the intrinsic complexity of the systems
</em><br>

</em><br>
I agree with what you say here except that the
<br>
hypothetical about 'everything being encoded in
<br>
pi' is a statement about how complexity can be
<br>
generated from a simple prior, and not about how
<br>
you can hope to get information about that
<br>
complexity. It's the difference between splashing
<br>
paint on a canvas to generate a complex pattern
<br>
(easy) and predicting beforehand the exact
<br>
pattern of the splash (impossible, or at least
<br>
far beyond our power).
<br>
As to the difficulty of understanding human
<br>
behavior, an AI may do a better job than we do
<br>
when it gets a good enough model. For example,
<br>
our behavior seems illogical on many levels, but
<br>
results from logical, if complex, processes and
<br>
needs. A good understanding of underlying needs
<br>
provides a shortcut to real motivations and
<br>
allows an observer to ignore much that is
<br>
irrelevant. For example, if we know a con man is
<br>
trying to get us to give him personal
<br>
information, we confidently conclude (without any
<br>
other evidence) that he is not really a Nigerian
<br>
government minister.
<br>
Another advantage an AI might have is an ability
<br>
to detect human deception from direct physical
<br>
cues. I can cite perfectly reasonable examples
<br>
from at least three science fiction films in
<br>
which a robot or computer AI does this, by
<br>
reading lips, detecting chemical signals, and
<br>
observing pupil dilation; so can a small number
<br>
of talented human observers (in an episode of
<br>
Deadwood, Al Swearengen asserts that a lying man
<br>
'smells like cat piss').
<br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; The idea of a laboratory AGI very rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bootstrapping into a human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulating monster makes a *lot* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions about its environment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I would assert are not particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic in most cases.  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could specifically create an environment where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is likely to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen, but it won't be the likely environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even by accident.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be an eventual problem, but it probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be an immediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
Let me take this opportunity to revive (for a
<br>
moment) the ghost of Sergeant Schulz. I know that
<br>
nobody else here considers the stratagem of
<br>
'human-engineering the stupidest guard' to be of
<br>
interest to a sandboxed AI, on the grounds that a
<br>
SAI could gull any human it chose. However, there
<br>
is a factor which may not have been mentioned,
<br>
which is time. Even an AI that can think 10K
<br>
times faster than any human must still deal with
<br>
humans on their time scales, not ver own. Ve may
<br>
be able to process the information gleaned from a
<br>
half-hour conversation in a tenth of a second,
<br>
but ve still has to spend half an hour talking to
<br>
you to get that information, and impart ver own
<br>
views to you. Ve may conceive a perfect strategy
<br>
in two seconds flat which still requires six
<br>
weeks of patient (even sphexish) cultivation
<br>
before the human interlocutor is sold on
<br>
'pressing the button' that opens the sandbox. If
<br>
there's a Schulz on site, and the SAI concludes
<br>
that Schulz will open the sandbox in only three
<br>
weeks, ve would need a very good reason *not* to
<br>
go to work on Schulz.
