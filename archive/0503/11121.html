<br>
|&gt;I saw immediate parallels between the
<br>
|&gt;inductive/deductive dichotomy
<br>
|&gt;which you identified in your philosophy, and the
<br>
|&gt;Intuition/Formal
<br>
|&gt;System dichotomy which I identify in mine.
<br>

<br>
| Sorry, my ideas have nothing in common with yours.  A
<br>
| vague fuzzy idea like what you had does not make a
<br>
| theory.  People on SL4 have flamed me enough times in
<br>
| the past for blurting out vague fuzzy ideas here.
<br>
<p>Well, you are entitled to your opinion, but I still think there is a
<br>
similarity. You presented to the list no more than a fuzzy idea
<br>
yourself, with no links to anything more detailed. The above sentence is
<br>
nothing more than a claim, with no argument in it. However, if you
<br>
merely want to distance yourself from supporting my ideas, fine.
<br>
<p>| My inductive/deductive division is not a 'Dialectic'
<br>
| like your intuition/reason.  Instead it's a synergy.
<br>
| I hopefully clarified this in my previous post: I have
<br>
| two systems of reasoning: one for reasoning about
<br>
| morals/values/agents, the other for reasoning about
<br>
| physics/inanimate things.  But both are systems of
<br>
| reasoning.  Just in cazse you're interested, here are
<br>
| some more of the synergistic pairs in my theory:
<br>
|
<br>
| Heath-Happiness
<br>
| Altruism-Growth
<br>
| Eudaimonia-Volition
<br>
| Explanation-Perception
<br>
| Pattern-Meaning
<br>
| Coherence-Causality
<br>
<p>I don't think that I am, in my mind, at all mistaken about what you are
<br>
doing with your system. Neither do I think you are mistaken about my
<br>
ideas. I do, however, think you mis-understood what I was trying to say
<br>
to the list. I'm not going to bother going further into it - I think we
<br>
are talking at cross-purposes.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
