<p>
Durable goods are defined by economists as those
<br>
products with an intended useful life of more than
<br>
3 years.  Included within this category are things
<br>
like vehicles, furniture, and factory equipment.
<br>
In particular it includes most of the equipment used
<br>
to make more equipment.  At a sufficiently high
<br>
level of automation, factories could effectively
<br>
become self-reproducing without human labor.  This
<br>
can be achieved without human-level AI.  It just
<br>
requires each factory to be automated in the products
<br>
it produces, and the set of factories as a whole to
<br>
produce all of each other's needed inputs.
<br>
<p>To investigate how much progress we are making
<br>
towards this end, I have looked at economic data
<br>
gathered by the US department of Commerce on the
<br>
durable goods manufacturing sector of the economy.
<br>
<p>Over the period from 1992 to 2003, investment in
<br>
structures and equipment in this sector increased
<br>
63%, and output increased 57%.  Thus roughly output
<br>
has kept pace with investment.  On the other hand,
<br>
labor hours decreased by 11.5%, yielding a 78%
<br>
increase in labor productivity over that 11 year
<br>
period.  In other words, it has taken 5% less labor
<br>
each year to produce a given amount of products.
<br>
<p>The plant and equipment in place in 1992 had a range
<br>
of ages from brand new to nearly obsolete.  Over the
<br>
1992-2003 period 5/8 of the in-place investment
<br>
depreciated away - either due to wearing out or
<br>
becoming obsolescent.  This 63% 'old stuff' was
<br>
replaced by 'new stuff', and an additional 63% of
<br>
'new stuff' was added to expand production.  Thus
<br>
of the new stuff installed over the 11 years, half
<br>
was for replacement and half for growth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this data I calculated that 'new stuff' installed
</em><br>
in the 1992-2003 period was twice as productive as
<br>
the average 'old stuff' in place in 1992.  That
<br>
assumes that the inherent productiveness of the 
<br>
workers themselves, as separate from the tools they
<br>
have to work with, has not changed.  That implies
<br>
new stuff has been improving at about an 5.3% per
<br>
year.  The next level of analysis would be to look
<br>
at shorter time intervals to see if there is an
<br>
upward trend in the rate of change.
<br>
<p>A 5%/year rate of improvement may not qualify as a
<br>
singularity level change, but it is comparable to
<br>
rates seen in the industrial revolution of the
<br>
18-19th century, the mechanization of agriculture
<br>
in the 20th, and the rapid development being seen
<br>
in some Asian countries at present.  Rapid
<br>
technology change can lead to disruptive social and
<br>
economic change.  I think it is prudent to keep
<br>
an eye on which way the wind is blowing so as not
<br>
to be caught unawares.
<br>
