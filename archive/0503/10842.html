<em>&gt; Insights are not patentable.  Theories are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patentable.  Recently there have been rulings that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms, notably RSA, are patentable, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closer to what you're worried about.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure this is the right forum for this discussion, but these are some
<br>
examples of things that are patentable: a genetic sequence (whether it
<br>
exists in nature), an alloy for an electromagnet, a method of doing
<br>
business, a mathematical algorithm, an artifact of software engineering
<br>
(todo list anyone?), a sequence of exercises (yoga patent case) etc etc.
<br>
<p>In principle, in Europe some of these ought not be patentable per the EPC,
<br>
but in practice they often are due to patent office corruption (or lack of
<br>
funding, to be more charitable). In any case, even inventions are insights:
<br>
a steam engine is, before anything else, the application of the insight that
<br>
you can use steam to do work. There are physical processes which are optimal
<br>
or even unique, and patenting their application for inventions stops or
<br>
restraints progress. Also, from the viewpoint of ethics, I don't see what
<br>
justifies patents, since two teams of researchers that arrive to the same
<br>
invention will be able to make it viable or not depending on who submits a
<br>
paper to the relevant bureaucratic body first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Land grabs can be good.  Land grabs are how we settled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Western US.  The human genome might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been sequenced yet if people didn't hope to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents from it.  Yes, I know one team was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government-led, but without Celera's competition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might have taken much longer.
</em><br>
<p>And then it might not, and it is unclear to me whether it taking, say, as a
<br>
very bad case, 3x longer would be such a bad thing if it would be ensured
<br>
that the results are available to all. Would I rather have genetic
<br>
information in 2003 that I need permission to use, or in 2006 such that I
<br>
can use it freely? I guess it depends, I just don't see a clear case either
<br>
way.
<br>
Landgrabs are how the US was set up, indeed. Personally I find little
<br>
admirable in that. Nature and its laws (and inventions are applications of
<br>
these, necessarily) is something that we all have equal access too, and it's
<br>
very dubious to me that creating monopolies (and thus artificial scarcity)
<br>
in their use is a good thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, the period for patents is apparently now 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.  I think it's 12 for pharmaceuticals?
</em><br>
<p>I do not know for sure, I thought it was 20 years but I was not sure and I
<br>
didn't want to correct you without the exact information. It is
<br>
jurisdiction-dependent anyway.
<br>
<p>--David.
<br>
PS FFT is patented.
