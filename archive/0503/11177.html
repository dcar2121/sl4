<p>| But I think this usage, metaphorical as it is, isn't too dangerous, is
<br>
| it, Tennessee? Certainly to use it is not necessarily to
<br>
| &quot;misunderstand the nature of evolution&quot;, though it may obscure the
<br>
| actual method of evolutionary adaptation. I think the paragraph of
<br>
| Keith's to which you were replying to originally didn't abuse the
<br>
| term.
<br>
<p>Actually, I thought Keith was misled by that metaphorical framework.
<br>
<p>For example : &quot;Altruism between unrelated people can be considered a
<br>
misfiring of the evolved psychological traits.&quot;
<br>
<p>Can they? Why? I object on the following dot-point bases:
<br>
<p>* Factual error
<br>
* Metaphorical/ontological error
<br>
* Error on its own terms
<br>
<p><p><p>I completely deny that hunter-gatherer tribal structures were the
<br>
foundation of evolution in modern man, who has been, biologically
<br>
speaking, essentially static for tens of thousands of years, well into
<br>
the past of hunter-gatherer society.
<br>
<p>* From the first oral and artistic record, it is clear that morality and
<br>
altruism has been a defining trait of humans from day one.
<br>
* From archaeological evidence, it is clear that artistic awareness,
<br>
trading and societal values have been a defining trait of humans from
<br>
day one
<br>
* From archaeological evidence, it is clear that Neanderthals did not
<br>
have these to the same degree
<br>
<p>- --- Factual Error --
<br>
I would say these refute the idea that a hunter-gatherer lifestyle was
<br>
the evolutionary cause of altruism in humans. Rather I would say it is
<br>
impossible to extricate any specific factors from the context of early
<br>
human life, including but not limited to lifestyle, brain structure,
<br>
language and communication, environmental factors, sexual selection and
<br>
mere chance. To claim that early humans would have been better off with
<br>
a narrower, more genetically-focused sense of loyalty, is wild and
<br>
unfounded speculation.
<br>
<p>- -- Error on its own terms, or mistaken beliefs about the goal
<br>
If you accept my factual account that altruism evolved in a context
<br>
where there were several variables, then it is clear the altruism did
<br>
not clearly arise to deal with any specific new factor. Assigning
<br>
evolution a goal is mistake, because it leads us to look for evidence of
<br>
its truth. The example of genetic loyalty makes a degree of sense,
<br>
because it seems intuitive that it would promote an individual's
<br>
reproductive power. But look around - it is genetic *diversity* which is
<br>
valuable, not breeding for a single fittest individual. In fact, a
<br>
society who had an inbred sense of altruism would fall far more rapidly
<br>
to the attacks of disease and genetic aberration.
<br>
<p>- -- Metaphorical / ontological error
<br>
Evolution is essentially a description of system dynamics, something
<br>
which is basically a truism. Only the fit survive. Subject to death as a
<br>
lower bound, and overpopulation as an upper bound, organisms are free to
<br>
express randomly, and occasionally some traits will become societally
<br>
successful, such as the modern attractiveness of Capri jeans and pop
<br>
music. To call such genetic diversity a &quot;misfiring&quot; is clearly an error.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

<br>
|&gt;&gt;Psychological-traits are not goal oriented, they are evolved. To
<br>
|&gt;&gt;consider any evolved system to be &quot;mis-firing&quot; is to misunderstand the
<br>
|&gt;&gt;nature of evolution, which is simply the mechanism by which organisms
<br>
|&gt;&gt;adapt to circumstances.
<br>
|
<br>
| [snip]
<br>
|
<br>
|&gt;But let me give you an example of misfiring.  We have chemically mediated
<br>
|&gt;reward systems in our brains that for the most part reward us for things
<br>
|&gt;like sex, attention, and food.  This reward system is very well adapted to
<br>
|&gt;promote reproductive success in hunter gatherer tribes.
<br>
|&gt;
<br>
|&gt;The reward system misfires when it is activated by addictive drugs.  This
<br>
|&gt;has been determined in great detail most recently with fMRI studies.  Now
<br>
|&gt;the trait to get addicted to drugs is an obvious misfiring of the social
<br>
|&gt;reward system evolved for other reasons.  (Otherwise you need to make a
<br>
|&gt;case that being nodded out on plant narcotics made you more likely to
<br>
|&gt;reproduce (instead of being eaten) in a hunter gatherer world.)
<br>
|
<br>
|
<br>
| I think the question here was over terminology. What I think Mr.
<br>
| Leeuwenburg was saying is that it's incorrect to say that an adaptive
<br>
| trait can &quot;misfire&quot;, because that presumes a teleological origin of
<br>
| the trait, which for a literal interpretation of evolution is a no-no.
<br>
| However, I tend to agree with you, Keith, that it's perfectly OK to
<br>
| use this terminology to describe certain phenomena. But let's make
<br>
| sure we're clear on what we're describing.
<br>
|
<br>
| A &quot;misfiring&quot; of an adaptive trait is a consequence of that trait that
<br>
| affects the organism adversely in certain situations (such that the
<br>
| organism would survive more often in those situations without the
<br>
| particular adaptation). If these &quot;misfirings&quot; for any particular trait
<br>
| were worse than the advantages overall (in the EEA), the trait would
<br>
| have never evolved, and thus the negative consequence is usually only
<br>

<br>
