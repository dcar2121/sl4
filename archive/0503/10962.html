<br>
<p>This is a paraphrase of something I heard asked of Peter Singer, a
<br>
moderately well-known consequentialist philosopher.
<br>
<p>&quot;In order to be a good utilitarian, do you have to have a good
<br>
imagination, in order to have a proper appreciation of the alternatives&quot;.
<br>
<p>I thought this might have some implications for AI and theory of
<br>
knowledge.
<br>
<p>If we assume that all beliefs are imprecise, then *even if* we accept
<br>
some form of Bayesian calculation as the &quot;best we can do&quot; and that
<br>
it's not bad, we still have something left over. Let me introduce some
<br>
terminology from Phenomenology :
<br>
<p>Immanent : What appears to us as phenomena because of reality
<br>
Transcendent : What is true about reality
<br>
<p>Some immanent phenomena are also transcendent, but there are some
<br>
things which are transendent things which we can never know.
<br>
<p>Now, let's assume that physics is a remarkably accurate and reliable
<br>
model of what is immanent, and as such we can say that a perfect model
<br>
is as close to true knowledge of the transcendent as one needs to get,
<br>
because one will never be wrong. If physics is a good approximation
<br>
(i.e. very high reliability of prediction of immanent phenomena), then
<br>
that's great.
<br>
<p>Using that framework, there must be some ways in which we can (a)
<br>
establish the statistical reliability of any particular model in
<br>
predicting immanent events and (b) some understanding of how much
<br>
truth much be transcendant if a particular level of imprecision is
<br>
inevitable.
<br>
<p>Let's say we know all the immanent factors affecting a toss of a coin,
<br>
but we still don't get 100% accuracy. Let's say we have 98% accuracy.
<br>
The remaining 2% must lie in transcendant, unknowable and
<br>
un-modellable aspects of reality. Perhaps reality is truly &quot;random&quot; or
<br>
perhaps it is merely un-knowable, but because it's purely
<br>
transcendant, we can't know which is &quot;true&quot;.
<br>
<p>Considering this in the context of an artificial intelligence, do you
<br>
think this affects decision making?
<br>
<p>I'm sorry to clog the list with what is merely a question, but as
<br>
people who are interested in decision-making, I thought someone here
<br>
might have an opinion.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
