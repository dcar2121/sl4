<em>&gt; Hmm. Well, how are we defining altruism here? If you say that altruism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is acting against your own self-interest to benefit others, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a point. That definition breaks down under close scrutiny. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's replace it with a more robust definition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altruism is a quality that some people attribute to others, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruists, to explain their actions. The others, which we may call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruists, have unusual value systems which cause them to act in ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which, to non-altruists, seem to go against the self-interest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruist. This is often because the actions of the altruist benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others at the expense of some sort of societal success indicator, such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as money, popularity, or free time, which are held to be more valuable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by most people than the group which is benefitting from the altruist's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions. But the altruist is still acting purely in his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest, from a behavioral point of view. The altruist himself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my agree with this assessment, or he may agree with other people. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either case, the altruist holds two different value systems in mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He describes himself to the world using the world's value system, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts using his own value system. If he is especially perceptive, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also describes himself using the value system he acts by. If so, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; label &quot;altruist&quot;, to him, doesn't mean that he acts against his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest, but is simply a word to describe his peculiar value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, which he is still consistent to. He may describe himself as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruist to identify those notable aspects of his value system, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for no other reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone have a problem with this definition? I think it resolves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any difficulties.
</em><br>
<p>Chris, I think that the essential confusion here rests on a failure to 
<br>
distinguish the possession of a want from the reference of a want.  My 
<br>
goal system is made up of wants - that's who I am, in that facet of me 
<br>
that is my goal system.  The &quot;wants&quot; may *refer to* internal quantities 
<br>
like happiness, or external quantities like Jane having a lollipop.  If 
<br>
the referent of my want is a nice thing that happens to me, like 
<br>
happiness, we usually distinguish those kinds of wants as 
<br>
&quot;self-interested&quot;, while if the referent of my want is a nice thing that 
<br>
happens to Jane, we call that kind of want &quot;altruistic&quot;.
<br>
<p>But to chide me as being &quot;self-interested&quot; for implementing my wants is 
<br>
confused.  It mixes up the map and the territory.  My goal system is 
<br>
made out of wants, and the difference between selfishness and altruism 
<br>
lies in the referents of those wants.  It's like saying that I am 
<br>
&quot;neuron-interested&quot; because my goal system is implemented by a brain or 
<br>
&quot;atom-interested&quot; because my brain is made of atoms.  Clearly, since all 
<br>
this wanting and goal-directed behavior takes place inside a brain, it 
<br>
isn't really about Jane getting a lollipop - it's about atoms.  These 
<br>
notions of &quot;self-interest&quot; and &quot;altruism&quot; are equally incoherent; 
<br>
whatever you do, it *really* happens &quot;because of&quot; atoms.
<br>
<p>That's about how much sense I hear in saying that all goals have 
<br>
self-interested *referents*, just because, no matter what I achieve, it 
<br>
happens &quot;because of&quot; my goals.  Of course.  What else should it happen 
<br>
because of?  But it doesn't follow that my goals' referents, the things 
<br>
I'm trying to achieve, are internal events.
