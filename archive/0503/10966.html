<p>This is still a poor definition. For one thing, it fails to add
<br>
anything to the simpler definitions already given.
<br>
<p>However, let's just look at it.
<br>
<p>Firstly, altruism is not at all unusual. Almost all people are
<br>
altruists. Any attempt to deny this is merely a line-drawing argument.
<br>
<p>Secondly, you define the goals of a non-altruist to be &quot;some sort of
<br>
societal success indicator&quot;. To accept this, you are already accepting
<br>
that your so-called non-altruist is accepting society's morality,
<br>
which is in itself giving your own &quot;goal system&quot; to society's goal
<br>
system. Furgermore, you claim that these goals are such because they
<br>
are considered the &quot;most worthy goals of any, by most people&quot;. Worthy
<br>
is a loaded word, meaning &quot;the the good&quot; or &quot;for the good&quot;. The
<br>
concept of worthiness is similarly laden with both societal and
<br>
altruistic overtones.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, you claim that the outward-facing goal system of the altruist
<br>
is unthinkable to the majority, which is clearly false in Australia
<br>
because of the average donation of $60 per person to the Tsunami appeal.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

| Altruism is a quality that some people attribute to an unusual
<br>
| breed, the altruist, to explain his actions. The altruist has an
<br>
| unusual goal system, one which causes him to act in ways which, to
<br>
| non-altruists, seem to be self-contradictory--to go against the
<br>
| goal system of the altruist, which must, after all, *really* be
<br>
| self-centered deep down. After all, that is true for most people.
<br>
| This is often peceived to be such because the actions of the
<br>
| altruist benefit others at the expense of some sort of societal
<br>
| success indicator, such as money, popularity, or free time, which
<br>
| are held to be the most worthy goals of any, by most people. The
<br>
| illusion of this self-contradiction is only effective because the
<br>
| outward-facing goal system of the altruist is so unthinkable to the
<br>
| majority, conditioned as they are to be good little mindless
<br>
| consumers with one-sided interpersonal relationships.
<br>
|
<br>
| The label &quot;altruist&quot;, to the altruist, doesn't mean that he acts
<br>
| against his own self-interest, against his own goal system(!), in
<br>
| other words, but is simply a word to describe the fact that his
<br>
| goals, which he is still tautologically consistent to, are more
<br>
| outward-facing than usual. He may describe himself as an altruist
<br>
| to identify those notable aspects of his goal system, but for no
<br>
| other reason.
