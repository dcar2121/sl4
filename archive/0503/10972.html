<em>&gt; People have only scratched the surface of the &quot;selfish gene&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea. Looking only at the first level of implications. Does a &quot;selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene&quot; work only to copy those which are exact base pair for base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pair copies of itself? Or does it work to copy those similar to itself?
</em><br>
<p>What you're talking about here is not a &quot;selfish gene&quot; but rather a &quot;selfish
<br>
base pair.&quot;
<br>
<p>Based on what I understand about genetics (which is quite a lot, in fact), I
<br>
strongly suspect this is merely a minor correction to the selfish-gene
<br>
paradigm...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example the four color genes of the human eye (red,green,blue,night
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision green), they are all very similar. A &quot;selfish gene&quot; might do well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support the copying of many variations of itself, as diversity of forms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will tend to insure its survival, over a single form. Diversity of genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variations is so important that we have sex, instead of cloning for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher life forms, and many lower.
</em><br>
<p>Yah, good point, but there's no way it's going to explain sacrificing
<br>
yourself for 10 distant genetic relatives, sorry...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It comes out of Darwinism is you look at it closely. Survival of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fittest simply has to look beyond the individual organism, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual variant of a gene. Its a very very complex equation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe you.  Do some back of the envelope calculations, and you'll
<br>
see this idea is VERY far from working....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Altruism (in the sense I'm using it here) is a psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the quasi-altruism that the selfish genome promotes has pushed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains toward that attractor.  Guiding AGI's into this psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attractor will be an important topic in AGI psychology...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The psychological attractor is there because evolution built it in.
</em><br>
<p>No -- it is there because it self-organized from other things that were
<br>
sculpted by evolution...
<br>
<p>Not every trait in an evolved organism is there because it, specifically,
<br>
was adaptive (for the organism or the gene or any other level in the
<br>
selection hierarchy).  This is one of the basic evolutionary-theory errors
<br>
that Gould was always (correctly) railing against.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Altruism is selected for ultimately, and its not always 'nice', it also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means altruistically fighting off parasites, for example people in games
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will tend to punish cheaters even if its not to there direct benefit to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so.
</em><br>
<p>I'm aware of the evolutionary-theory explanations of altruism, and although
<br>
powerful it's apparent to me that they're incomplete.
<br>
<p>I don't believe your hand-wavy workaround to my point at all ;-)
