</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does one train themselves to this? What I mean is yes, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar with Bayes theorem, yes, I understand the idea, and if you

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious mistakes...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, other than those cases that one is explicitly handed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities on a computronium platter, how does one actually train
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself to parse everyday life/thinking in terms of it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ie, lots and lots of incoming info, not obvious to me how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitively parse it into a form suitable for this type of reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So... to those who are learned in the Craft, I ask: how does one train
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself to gain the appropriate intuitions? Does one practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meditating on venn diagram &quot;mandalas&quot;? (I'm only half-joking here, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really am stumped as to how to actually organize my mind for this)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I appologise if this isn't really an SL4worthy, but since the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to be discussed lately anyways, and simply since I'd have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clue where else to ask this... :)
</em><br>
<p>The first question to be asked is:
<br>
<p>Have you read _Judgment Under Uncertainty_, _Heuristics and Biases_, 
<br>
_Choices, Values, and Frames_, and some volume of social psychology 
<br>
(say, the Blackwell Reader in social psychology)?  And have you browsed 
<br>
some Jaynes?  Robyn Dawes's _Rational Choice in an Uncertain World_ 
<br>
makes for a good intro if you're not ready to plunge straight into 
<br>
_Judgment Under Uncertainty_.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I have not yet gotten around to founding the Baisutsukai 
<br>
Order of Solemn Rationalists, starting a Bayesian monastery, or even 
<br>
founding a Bayescraft dojo - I have these other minor things on my mind 
<br>
- so I think that's pretty much as far as it currently goes for aspiring 
<br>
rationalists.  Just do plenty of reading.  The above will get you 
<br>
started and tell you where to poke around for more.
