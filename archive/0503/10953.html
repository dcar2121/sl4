<p>
It has been interesting to see the chats concerning the self-proclaimed
<br>
altruism of Eleizer and the differing view proposed by Robert Ettinger
<br>
(originator of the Cryonics Organization in Michigan).
<br>
<p>The purpose of this is to either debunk the self-proclaimed view of altruism
<br>
or find a view that altruism really exists.  I am clearly leaning to the
<br>
view of Ettinger and that all claims of altruism relate to self-interest or
<br>
self-values. If true, the claims of altruism would be stated as personal
<br>
values.
<br>
<p>His view is basically that people are motivated by self-interest to feel
<br>
good. He calls this view &quot;me-first, feel-good&quot;.  He basically states that no
<br>
one does anything, ever, for altruistic purposes. The only sacrifice anyone
<br>
chooses, ever, is that of one value or facet of his psyche in favor of
<br>
another. Thus, your only motivation is to please yourself or avoid something
<br>
worse.  His book, Youniverse, is on the cryonics organization web page.  The
<br>
following is from page 89 of Youniverse relating to altruism as quoted:
<br>
<p>&quot;The main point is the primacy of self-interest cannot be denied, claims of
<br>
altruism are always language traps. To the extent the behavior is motivated
<br>
(rather than accidental or a hard-wired habit pattern), no one &quot;ever&quot; makes
<br>
a &quot;sacrifice&quot; for someone else or something else.  The only sacrifice anyone
<br>
chooses, ever, is that of one value or one facet of his psyche in favor of
<br>
another, the momentarily dominate value or personality aspect.  In other
<br>
words, your only motivation is to please yourself - the currently dominant
<br>
aspect of your psyche- or to avoid a worse alternative.  There is no
<br>
exceptions.
<br>
<p>In other words: it is not possible to sacrifice oneself for another person
<br>
or for a principle.  It is only possible to set one value, or one presently
<br>
perceived good, above another. In the extreme case ( I assume he means
<br>
sacrificing your life for someone), you value your prospect of survival less
<br>
than your desire for virtue or guilt avoidance.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thanks for any comments.
