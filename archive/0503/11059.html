<br>
<p>Marc,
<br>
<p>Had a few more ideas.
<br>
<p>Your metaphor idea resonates with me. I have been reading Wittgenstein
<br>
- - or more accurately I have had the highlights pointed out to me. He
<br>
talks about the way in which we use language in many senses, and calls
<br>
the different ways which we use language to be &quot;language games&quot;.
<br>
<p>For example &quot;I have a pin in my foot&quot; versus &quot;I have a pain in my
<br>
foot&quot;. Nobody gets these mixed up, but the surface grammar is the
<br>
same. His idea was that there is also a depth grammar, which means
<br>
something deeper than mere syntax. Our knowledge of what is being
<br>
referred to also helps us not to make mistakes about whether you could
<br>
just take the pain out of the foot, or whether you could interact with
<br>
the pain using physical objects etc. Consider you have a sore foot,
<br>
and then it seems to get better, but a short while later it becomes
<br>
painful again. The doctor may ask you &quot;Is it the same pain?&quot; to which,
<br>
if it feels similar, you might reply &quot;yes&quot;. However, this is meant in
<br>
a totally different sense to asking if two different pins are actually
<br>
the same pin.
<br>
<p>This is just one tiny example of where humans are able to use similar
<br>
sentences to mean quite different things (where meaning is defined as
<br>
the interpretations given by a person, the way in which they use
<br>
something etc etc). What Wittgenstein terms &quot;language games&quot; have been
<br>
taken by many to reflect not just how humans use language, but more
<br>
deeply how humans think.
<br>
<p>Some people have said that human thinking is *precisely* this, but I
<br>
think that's false. I think there is indeed a difference between
<br>
thinking and speaking. Your description of metaphors being formed
<br>
through some interaction of a normative system (I dislike using
<br>
morality/value because it doesn't seem to me to be describing what you
<br>
are saying) and some kind of laws-of-physics rationality seems to be
<br>
similar to language games and idea-creation. From our existing
<br>
metaphors (equated henceforth with the language games we understand)
<br>
and experience, we acquire knowledge of the world, either
<br>
understanding facts in terms of existing metaphors, or sometimes
<br>
building new ones.
<br>
<p>This has some startling implications, not least that our ability to
<br>
*actually think* is limited by the language games which we correctly
<br>
understand. For example, we could never understand psychology without
<br>
the metaphors which study has produced. It is not merely the case that
<br>
we could naively understand psychology perfectly, the only limitation
<br>
being our expression. Rather, without the pre-existence of certain
<br>
metaphors, there are some things which we cannot even think. We could
<br>
not grasp the implication of Artificial Intelligence without metaphors
<br>
for mentality.
<br>
<p>This is nowhere reflected better than the attempt to build one. First
<br>
we must build the metaphors, then we can acquire knowledge.
<br>
<p>As a complete idea of thinking however, this might rankle. Nobody
<br>
wants to be reduced to little more than speech software.
<br>
<p>I hope that has been interesting...
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
