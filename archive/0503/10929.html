<p>| I'm no fan of Wittgenstein and I certainly don't think
<br>
| that thinking is all language games and idea creation.
<br>
|  His ides influenced the logical positivists and were
<br>
| apparently the beginning the post-modern disease.  He
<br>
| seemed to think that language had no meaning outside
<br>
| it's social context (it's only a small step from there
<br>
| is the idea that 'everything is a social construct').
<br>
<p>I can see how you get from A to B there, but I don't make the same
<br>
connection. I think Wittgenstein was reacting in a valid way to the way
<br>
in which humans use language. I don't think he was trying to make claims
<br>
about logic, but rather about language use. From there, he tried to
<br>
equate human thinking with human language. There is clearly a sense in
<br>
which he is correct - language allows us to hear many ideas, including
<br>
entire frameworks for thought, that we do not have access to naively.
<br>
<p>I never interpreted that as attacking the meaning of language. Rather, I
<br>
thought of it as describing how it can be that human can use language in
<br>
which ungrammatical ways, and still communicate effectively. I thought
<br>
of it like ... different rules for different card games. The cards are
<br>
the same, but the rules we use to play the game can vary - sometimes a
<br>
lot, and sometimes less so. However, within the context of their use,
<br>
the meaning is very precise.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I can see how you could progress from the idea of
<br>
language games to postmodernist ideas, which can be quite destructive to
<br>
meaning. Sometimes postmodern techniques are useful for breaking down an
<br>
accepted morality, but can be quite harmful to someone who is reasoning
<br>
logically.
<br>
<p>| The difference between me and him is probably that I
<br>
| think that is an objective reality out there which our
<br>
| metaphors can approximate.  We have to start with some
<br>
| initial metaphors but these get modified as we acquire
<br>
| new knowledge and eventually everyone's metaphors will
<br>
| start to converge.  The internal metaphors and
<br>
| external knowlegde are not independent of each other.
<br>
| There will have to be a convergence to objective
<br>
| reality outside the initial language games.
<br>
<p>Yes, that is quite correct. Wittgenstein, meet Rand. Rand, meet
<br>
Wittgenstein. :)
<br>
<p>| Perhaps in place of the word metaphor I should have
<br>
| used the more general term 'analogy'.  And I should
<br>
| have said that my theory consists of the interactions
<br>
| of two systems but both of them are *reasoning*
<br>
| systems: one is a system for reasoning about
<br>
| morals/values/agents, the other a system for reasoning
<br>
| about physics/inanimate things.
<br>
<p>No, I'm the one who was interpreting metaphor to carry a cognitive
<br>
meaning, I think your use of language was fine.
<br>
<p>What is the nature of the interaction between the two systems, in that
<br>
case? I think I know, but I would like to hear you give the description
<br>
as you see it, rather than responding to particular statements of mine...
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
