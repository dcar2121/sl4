</em><br>
<p>That's very instructive, thanks. I think, though, that there is some
<br>
confusion over the term &quot;self-interest&quot;. I believe that the word, as
<br>
really used by many people, means &quot;whatever is consistent with your
<br>
goal system.&quot; Since most people have goal systems centered around
<br>
themselves, the term &quot;self-interest&quot; was appropriate and natural, and
<br>
thus came into use even though it's not generally accurate--it fails
<br>
in the unusual case of altruists. (Perhaps this is the source
<br>
linguistic confusion that lead this whole messy question in the first
<br>
place.) So if you substitute &quot;acting consistently with your own goals&quot;
<br>
in my definition for self-interest, I think it makes sense, in light
<br>
of your response. In fact, I think it's basically what you were saying
<br>
in different words.
<br>
<p>Actually, this use of &quot;self-interest&quot; can be a philosophical assertion
<br>
of sorts. People can and do believe that the only real, proximate
<br>
referents of human goals are parts of the human psyche. I think this
<br>
may be central in the mind of the original poster. But thus far in
<br>
this thread this particular question has been completely begged by
<br>
those attacking the idea of altruism. Perhaps the OP would like to
<br>
expand on why he believes this, if that is the case?
<br>
<p>Let me have a go at my definition with the substitution performed.
<br>
<p>Altruism is a quality that some people attribute to an unusual breed,
<br>
the altruist, to explain his actions. The altruist has an unusual goal
<br>
system, one which causes him to act in ways which, to non-altruists,
<br>
seem to be self-contradictory--to go against the goal system of the
<br>
altruist, which must, after all, *really* be self-centered deep down.
<br>
After all, that is true for most people. This is often peceived to be
<br>
such because the actions of the altruist benefit others at the expense
<br>
of some sort of societal success indicator, such as money, popularity,
<br>
or free time, which are held to be the most worthy goals of any, by
<br>
most people. The illusion of this self-contradiction is only effective
<br>
because the outward-facing goal system of the altruist is so
<br>
unthinkable to the majority, conditioned as they are to be good little
<br>
mindless consumers with one-sided interpersonal relationships.
<br>
<p>The label &quot;altruist&quot;, to the altruist, doesn't mean that he acts
<br>
against his own self-interest, against his own goal system(!), in
<br>
other words, but is simply a word to describe the fact that his goals,
<br>
which he is still tautologically consistent to, are more
<br>
outward-facing than usual. He may describe himself as an altruist to
<br>
identify those notable aspects of his goal system, but for no other
<br>
reason.
