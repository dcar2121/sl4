<br>
<p>Marc,
<br>
<p>Here is what I did earlier. I wasn't trying to say what constitutes a
<br>
mind, but looking at what it's like to make a decision.
<br>
<p><a href="http://melbournephilosopher.blogspot.com/2005/01/theories-of-decisions.html">http://melbournephilosopher.blogspot.com/2005/01/theories-of-decisions.html</a>
<br>
<p>I think what I describe there is a useful tool for understanding what
<br>
it's like to make a decision as a person in the world.
<br>
<p>I saw immediate parallels between the inductive/deductive dichotomy
<br>
which you identified in your philosophy, and the Intuition/Formal
<br>
System dichotomy which I identify in mine.
<br>
<p>Your description of &quot;bridging&quot; and &quot;metaphor creation&quot; seemed at first
<br>
quite similar to the &quot;dialectic&quot; which I describe as the process of
<br>
decision making, but I realised your system has several strengths that
<br>
mine lacks. (Not that our two ideas are doing exactly the same thing,
<br>
mind you). I present a short comparison :
<br>
<p>Your system
<br>
~   * Is defined recursively, and facilitates analysis at any level of
<br>
detail
<br>
~   * Talks about how the mind builds its ideas of the world
<br>
~   * Describes what it is to be a mind, by describing what it does
<br>
and how
<br>
<p>My system
<br>
~   * Is defined at only one level (albeit a useful one)
<br>
~   * Takes knowledge of the world as an input, not a process.
<br>
(obviously it's a dynamic process - but I am talking about a
<br>
*particular* decision
<br>
~   * Has been attacked for not giving enough richness in terms of
<br>
describing emotion
<br>
~   * Describes the process of decision-making
<br>
<p>I think both systems have their place. Here are some issues :
<br>
<p>&quot;It seems natural to equate the generation of metaphors with qualia.&quot;
<br>
I agree. However, &quot;it seems&quot; is not a very convincing argument.
<br>
Perhaps we can provide a better argument for why this is the case.
<br>
After all, could you not imagine a metaphor without qualia? Or is
<br>
having qualia the same thing as having a thought?
<br>
<p>And then you say : &quot;So I certainly didn?t mean that all metaphors are
<br>
connected to morals/values.&quot; You are talking here merely about
<br>
understanding things, but how do you see this relating to qualia? Do
<br>
all metaphors map 1:1 with qualia?
<br>
<p>&quot;At the highest level of course graining I have divided
<br>
the mind in two ? into a sub-system dealing with
<br>
morals/values and a sub-system dealing with reasoning
<br>
about inanimate objects.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the one thing which conflicts to some extent with my model. I
<br>
make a distinction between intuition and formal reasoning, but don't
<br>
see the use in separating between moral and physical. I think we
<br>
probably use the same kind of reasoning to proceed from our beliefs
<br>
about morals as we do to proceed from our beliefs about physical facts.
<br>
<p>However, I strongly agree that our sense of &quot;what we ought to do&quot; can
<br>
be separated into two parts. The first part corresponds to having a
<br>
good understanding of cause and effect , and means how well we can
<br>
decide on how to cause a desired effect. The second corresponds to our
<br>
moral/value goals, and means how we form goals.
<br>
<p>In terms of making a decision, I think both kinds of normative forces
<br>
play on us through the intuition and through formal systems. I have
<br>
made my fundamental dichotomy a functional one, whereas you have made
<br>
yours a qualitative one.
<br>
<p>I would love to hear your comments on that Marc! Hopefully I am not
<br>
way off base understanding what you are saying, and hopefully I am
<br>
being sufficiently clear.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
- -Tennessee
