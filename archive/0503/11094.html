<p>I don't think the correct term for this is &quot;genetic component&quot; - that 
<br>
would imply a large variance between humans attributable to genetic 
<br>
differences.  You're talking about evolutionary psychology, not 
<br>
behavioral genetics.  The correct phrasing would probably be, &quot;it seems 
<br>
hard to believe this doesn't arise from our species psychology&quot; or &quot;it 
<br>
seems hard to believe there isn't a specific adaptation&quot;, depending on 
<br>
which of these propositions you meant.
<br>
<p>Anyway...
<br>
<p>Once upon a time I believed I was right and others wrong about a certain 
<br>
issue, even though I was only five years old, even though I was 
<br>
surrounded by people older and wiser than me, who said to me: you'll 
<br>
understand when you're older, and meanwhile do as we tell you.  So very 
<br>
arrogant was I, that I dared to defy them, and listen to the voice of my 
<br>
own reason which said that the adults' proposition was ridiculous.
<br>
<p>I suppose I could go back and try to rebuild my psychology from scratch 
<br>
by reversing that five-year-old decision, since it is, after all, quite 
<br>
absurd to suppose that a lone five-year-old could face down full adult 
<br>
intelligences and win.  Is it not arrogant of me to believe, as I still 
<br>
believe even today, that I know so much better than my parents who have 
<br>
decades more of life experience?
<br>
<p>But the Jewish religion still seems to me ridiculous, including that 
<br>
particular proposition to which I objected at the age of five, the 
<br>
requirement to pray in Hebrew when I didn't understand Hebrew.
<br>
<p>Sabine Atkins once hypothesized to me that this childhood experience, my 
<br>
rejecting Judaism in the face of all adult assurance and then turning 
<br>
out to be right, had warped my entire psychology.  Perhaps so!  But this 
<br>
thing happened in the real world, and it is therefore appropriate to 
<br>
treat it as information.
<br>
<p>I do think I originally learned the wrong lesson.  Up until around, oh, 
<br>
2002 or so, I thought the lesson was that intelligence was the most 
<br>
important thing in the universe.  For that my parents and rabbis had 
<br>
said to me: you may be intelligent, but experience is more important 
<br>
than intelligence; listen to us, when we tell you that the Jewish 
<br>
religion is right, and you'll understand when you're older.  I therefore 
<br>
concluded that sheer, raw intelligence was far more powerful than 
<br>
experience, that intelligence was the most important thing in the world 
<br>
- a conclusion that would later influence my beliefs about Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence, when in 1996 I first declared the quest for the Singularity.
<br>
<p>In retrospect, I learned the wrong lesson.  I acted as if, just because 
<br>
my parents and rabbis said &quot;experience is greater than intelligence&quot;, I 
<br>
could arrive to the truth simply by reversing their mistake.  I was 
<br>
foolish to let foolish people define my question for me.  The truth is 
<br>
very hard to find.  Other people's mistakes have no power to tell you 
<br>
where the truth hides, even if you reverse the mistakes.  You cannot 
<br>
attain the precise dance of the Way by reversing someone else's randomly 
<br>
wandering error.  But human nature is to say &quot;Nay&quot; where your opponent 
<br>
says &quot;Yea&quot;, to let yourself be defined by the positions you oppose...
<br>
<p>When I was five years old, I was probably not more intelligent than my 
<br>
parents; my brain was not that mature.  Even when I was thirteen years 
<br>
old, my parents could have used their greater life experience to defeat 
<br>
me - had my parents actually *used* their intellects, instead of 
<br>
searching for rationalizations for their birth religion.  The lesson was 
<br>
not that intelligence defeated experience, but that rationality defeated 
<br>
rationalization.  Intelligence, to be useful, must be used for something 
<br>
other than defeating itself.  One five-year-old's lone common sense 
<br>
defeated all those adult intellects, not because they were that stupid, 
<br>
nor because I was that smart, but because my five-year-old brain was 
<br>
actually processing the question instead of rationalizing a fixed 
<br>
answer.  As a five-year-old I couldn't possibly have defeated a 
<br>
reasonably smart and scientifically literate adult, if the adult were 
<br>
uncertain of the question and using their intelligence and life 
<br>
experience to curiously seek out an answer.  My parents could have 
<br>
defeated me handily, but they weren't in the game.
<br>
<p>But the life lesson still holds.  I don't much credit the beliefs of 
<br>
people whom I don't think are applying their actual intellects to a 
<br>
question.  Nor would the modesty argument have served me well.
