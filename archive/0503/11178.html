</em><br>
<p>Heh heh.
<br>
<p>At the moment we are stuck with being what we are.  This may not be the 
<br>
case in the future when we really can change human nature.  This may or may 
<br>
not be a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The way the world works now, it seems obvious that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;useful way to describe people's idealism and altruism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is via memetics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From &quot;I have but one life to give for...&quot; through &quot;just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say no&quot; and &quot;mind your own business&quot;, our behavior indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is deeply affected not only by sound bytes, but by ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So the recent spate of noble testimonials we've just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heard on this list doesn't surprise me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This manifestation of altruism is definitely less selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than the more directly gene-based variety!
</em><br>
<p>The wisdom of those who are experts in this area says that *all* 
<br>
manifestations of altruism are ultimately based on genes.  In fact, every 
<br>
physical and psychological trait humans have (as well as those of every 
<br>
other animal) is either the direct result of natural selection or a side 
<br>
effect, by-product, spandrel, &quot;misfire,&quot; etc. of some trait that was 
<br>
selected over evolutionary time.
<br>
<p>That *includes* people's unwillingness to recognize this situation.  :-)
<br>
<p>The problem is that we have psychological mechanisms that change the very 
<br>
*class* of memes that predominate in a human society--and there are very 
<br>
few people who are willing to even consider the line of thinking that leads 
<br>
to this depressing conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(This buttresses the point that altruism exists. For what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's worth I too debated Ettinger through dozens of emails
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on Cryonet on the subject of altruism---it seems hopeless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to get him to try to broaden his concept.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is a 20 page paper on this topic that I am trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to have published.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Good. I will be requesting a copy; perhaps it reflects some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of your earlier ideas on memetics.
</em><br>
<p>It does and it doesn't.  My thinking on memetics has changed over the 
<br>
years.  Memetics is a useful way to think about the spread and persistence 
<br>
of elements of culture, but it doesn't do a good job of answering the 
<br>
implied question such as why does *this* meme becomes ascendent now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From  MEMES, META-MEMES AND POLITICS (1988)
</em><br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>&quot;Some memes (for example Nazism) are
<br>
observed to thrive during periods of economic chaos just as diseases
<br>
flourish in an undernourished population.  Thus it is not much of a
<br>
surprise that Nazi-related beliefs emerged in the Western farm states
<br>
during the recent hard times. &quot;
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>&quot;The vast majority of the memes we pass from person to person or generation 
<br>
to generation are either helpful or at least harmless. It is hard to see 
<br>
that these elements of our culture have a separate identity from us. But a 
<br>
few of these replicating information patterns are clearly dangerous. By 
<br>
being obviously harmful, they are easy to see as a separate class of 
<br>
evolving, parasitic, lifelike forms. A very dangerous group leads to 
<br>
behavior such as the People's Temple suicides, or similar cases that dot 
<br>
our history. The most dangerous class leads to vast killings like that of 
<br>
the Nazis in WW II, the Communists in post-revolutionary Russia, and the 
<br>
Kampuchea self-genocide.
<br>
<p>&quot;The development of memetics provides improved mental tools (models) for 
<br>
thinking about the influences, be they benign, silly, or fatal, that 
<br>
replicating information patterns have on all of us. Here is a source of 
<br>
danger if memetics comes of age and only a few learn to create meme sets of 
<br>
great influence. Here too is liberation for those who can recognize and 
<br>
analyze the memes to which they are exposed. If &quot;the meme about memes&quot; 
<br>
infects enough people, rational social movements might become more common.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.alamut.com/subj/evolution/misc/hensonMemes.html">http://www.alamut.com/subj/evolution/misc/hensonMemes.html</a>
<br>
<p>(It is amusing that there are 180 links to this article and a dozen copies 
<br>
of it up on the net after 17 years.)
<br>
<p>I no longer think it is memes that cause wars or related social 
<br>
disruptions, though memes *are* one of the causal links.  (*Some* 
<br>
xenophobic meme--no matter how silly--will evolve out of random noise if 
<br>
there is no preexisting population divisions to split along.)  The root 
<br>
cause is a population that perceives a bleak future, most often from 
<br>
population growth exceeding the ecological carrying capacity.  I can cite a 
<br>
ton of examples.
<br>
<p>The path to this painfully acquired knowledge that linked memetics and 
<br>
evolutionary psychology for the answer to why xenophobic memes thrive in 
<br>
stressed human populations is detailed in the &quot;Sex, Drugs and Cults&quot; 
<br>
article.  I credit a woman who was a former scientologist for starting me 
<br>
down this path and Kennita Watson for helping me make the breakthrough 
<br>
connection late in 1998.

<br>
<p>PS.  Perhaps the most depressing aspect of this knowledge is that we 
<br>
evolved and have the trait to suppress thinking rationally in some 
<br>
circumstances.  If you have the slightest doubt about this &quot;feature&quot; of 
<br>
human psychology, then you have not been paying attention to the news.
