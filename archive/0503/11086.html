</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, precisely, computing power buys very little direct intelligence.  
<br>
The idea that an AI will be able to deduce all manner of behavioral 
<br>
characteristics of humans in any kind of detail from a few trivial 
<br>
samples and interactions is pretty anthropomorphic and essentially 
<br>
ignores the vast amount of learned context and patterns that allows 
<br>
humans to read the behaviors of other people.  Humans aren't born with 
<br>
this knowledge either, nor do we infer it in a vacuum.  It takes humans 
<br>
a long time to acquire enough useful samples and experience, and most 
<br>
humans are drinking from a fire hose of real data every day.
<br>
<p>No amount of navel-gazing will make an AI any smarter than it was a few 
<br>
minutes prior, assuming any vaguely efficient design.  Just because the 
<br>
secret to all human behavior may exist in the digits of pi does not 
<br>
imply that there is any more meaningful knowledge in pi than its 
<br>
intrinsic information (which is damn little).  Every argument that I've 
<br>
ever seen claiming significant utility from AI navel-gazing and RSI has 
<br>
simply moved where the vast body of learned knowledge is hidden to 
<br>
somewhere else.  Environmental data is not fungible and you need gobs 
<br>
of it to have an internal model that is even loosely valid, and the 
<br>
intelligence cannot exceed the total environmental information in the 
<br>
system or make meaningful predictions outside its domain of 
<br>
applicability.  The amount of data required to usefully 
<br>
reverse-engineer in part even most simple algorithmic systems vastly 
<br>
exceeds the intrinsic complexity of the systems themselves.
<br>
<p>This is the frequently glossed over issue of model starvation.  You 
<br>
cannot solve the problem of model starvation by churning on the same 
<br>
bits over and over, as no new information (i.e. potential knowledge) is 
<br>
added to the system.  Nor can the system automagically obtain more 
<br>
information than is intrinsic to what it has been exposed to.  
<br>
Intelligence is powerful precisely because it is a reflection of its 
<br>
environment and nothing more (except perhaps whatever simple biases 
<br>
exist in its machinery).  There is a bootstrap problem here; an AI too 
<br>
ignorant to be a threat is too ignorant to become a threat on its own 
<br>
without a lot of help from its environment, and computers live in 
<br>
sensory deprivation chambers.
<br>
<p><p>Could one design a system and environment that allows the AI to quickly 
<br>
become adept at understanding and manipulating human behavior?  Sure!  
<br>
But the point is that this is not a feature of intelligence but of the 
<br>
internal model built via the intelligence, and would require a vast 
<br>
quantity of environmental data in support of achieving that model.  A 
<br>
sufficiently complex AI system with a rich environment may arrive at 
<br>
that capability eventually on its own, but you'll have to wait a while. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a trivial thing to build domain specific 
<br>
super-intelligence via selective model starvation on the part of its 
<br>
designers.  Obviously, this would significantly limit some of the 
<br>
theoretical utility of such a system.  But the real point is that model 
<br>
starvation is the default state for intelligent systems generally, and 
<br>
that it is quite expensive to extend knowledge in any given direction, 
<br>
something that the designers of the system can easily control; whether 
<br>
they actually do or not is another issue.
<br>
<p>The idea of a laboratory AGI very rapidly bootstrapping into a human 
<br>
manipulating monster makes a *lot* of assumptions about its environment 
<br>
that I would assert are not particularly realistic in most cases.  One 
<br>
could specifically create an environment where this is likely to 
<br>
happen, but it won't be the likely environment even by accident.  It 
<br>
will be an eventual problem, but it probably won't be an immediate 
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>(some other theoretical problems omitted)
