<p>Hmm. Well, how are we defining altruism here? If you say that altruism
<br>
is acting against your own self-interest to benefit others, then you
<br>
have a point. That definition breaks down under close scrutiny. So
<br>
let's replace it with a more robust definition:
<br>
<p>Altruism is a quality that some people attribute to others, the
<br>
altruists, to explain their actions. The others, which we may call
<br>
altruists, have unusual value systems which cause them to act in ways
<br>
which, to non-altruists, seem to go against the self-interest of the
<br>
altruist. This is often because the actions of the altruist benefit
<br>
others at the expense of some sort of societal success indicator, such
<br>
as money, popularity, or free time, which are held to be more valuable
<br>
by most people than the group which is benefitting from the altruist's
<br>
actions. But the altruist is still acting purely in his own
<br>
self-interest, from a behavioral point of view. The altruist himself
<br>
my agree with this assessment, or he may agree with other people. In
<br>
either case, the altruist holds two different value systems in mind.
<br>
He describes himself to the world using the world's value system, but
<br>
acts using his own value system. If he is especially perceptive, he
<br>
also describes himself using the value system he acts by. If so, the
<br>
label &quot;altruist&quot;, to him, doesn't mean that he acts against his own
<br>
self-interest, but is simply a word to describe his peculiar value
<br>
system, which he is still consistent to. He may describe himself as an
<br>
altruist to identify those notable aspects of his value system, and
<br>
for no other reason.
<br>
<p>Does anyone have a problem with this definition? I think it resolves
<br>
any difficulties.

<em>&gt; Purely natural-selection-based reasoning leads one to the conclusion that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And this takes care of the rest of them. But I think neither my
<br>
explanation nor Ben's can describe all instances of altruistic
<br>
behaivor. My explanation may be more useful in cases where altruism is
<br>
more of a philosophy for the person, cultivated because of the
<br>
person's religious or political beliefs, and Ben's in cases where the
<br>
altruistic actions were what simply felt &quot;right&quot; in the circumstances.
<br>
I imagine the latter is the case often where maternal instinct comes
<br>
into play, or in other cases where limited altruism would be predicted
<br>
by game theory in the EEA. But note that people's natural humanitarian
<br>
leanings eventually have their roots in evolutionary adaptation as
<br>
well, so there is no thin line.
