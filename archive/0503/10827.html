<p>
As you know, I’d been pursuing a purely philosophical
<br>
approach over the past couple of years.  I’d mainly
<br>
been spending my time looking into maths, not AI
<br>
stuff.  As regards AI I deliberately stayed away from
<br>
the books and journals because I wanted to try to see
<br>
what general principles I could come up with through
<br>
the philosophical approach first (although it must be
<br>
said I did skim over Eliezer’s LOGI stuff a number of
<br>
times and of course I read his CV theory and went over
<br>
the summaries on the Sing Inst web-site).
<br>
<p>Any way, I think I've finally completed a theory of
<br>
general principles.  Here follows a very short Q&amp;A
<br>
which gives you the final key definitions I'm using
<br>
for my theory.
<br>
<p><p>Question:  What is a sentient mind?  What does it
<br>
actually do?
<br>
<p>My final answer:  
<br>
<p>A mind is a complex system which seeks to understand
<br>
other complex systems.  More specifically a mind is
<br>
that which seeks to understand the relationship
<br>
between the mental world (morals/vales) and the
<br>
physical world (facts).
<br>
<p><p>Question:  How does a sentient mind work?  
<br>
<p>My final answer:
<br>
<p>The mind works through the interactions of two
<br>
distinct modes of thought – a non-linear (inductive)
<br>
mode and a linear (deductive) mode.  The interaction
<br>
is the generation of metaphors.  Every cognitive
<br>
system can be decomposed into interacting pairs of
<br>
functions – one representing an inductive mode, the
<br>
other a deductive mode.  The key is the *interaction*
<br>
between the two modes – which takes the form of
<br>
*metaphors/analogies*.  It is the ability of the mind
<br>
to form metaphors/analogies which is the heart of
<br>
intelligence and it this which gives rise to qualia. 
<br>
Metaphors are *bridges* between two distinct levels of
<br>
organizations.  
<br>
<p>Any complex system (including any cognitive
<br>
sub-system) can be decomposed into *content* (the
<br>
lower sub-level) and *structure* (the higher
<br>
sub-level).  The inductive mode of thought deals with
<br>
the content (lower sub-level), the deductive mode
<br>
handles the structure (higher sub-level).  The
<br>
generation of metaphors is the key (bridge) which ties
<br>
together the inductive mode and the deductive mode
<br>
into a unified cognitive system.
<br>
<p><p>Question:  So what the crux?  Summarized as briefly as
<br>
possible, what is the deepest secret of general
<br>
intelligence?
<br>
<p>My final answer:
<br>
<p>The mind as a whole is a complex system which can be
<br>
decomposed into sub-system ‘Rationality’ (lower
<br>
sub-level) and sub-system ‘Morality’ (higher
<br>
sub-level).  The key is the interaction between the
<br>
two, which is *the ability of the mind to form
<br>
metaphors which enables it to understand models of
<br>
physical processes in terms of models of it’s own
<br>
internal value systems*! (Bridging the physical and
<br>
mental worlds through metaphors – similarities between
<br>
moral laws and physical laws).
