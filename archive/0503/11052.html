<em>&gt; &gt; Bear in mind that I am referring you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; steal elections, by thwarting transparency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sunlight being the best disinfectant, as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying goes. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My understanding is exactly the opposite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Information is declared proprietary only when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is NOT legally intellectual property.  To claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyright on computer code, you have to send in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a copy to the copyright office, which can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examined.  Proprietary information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is kept secret, not information that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to intellectual property laws.  At least, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is how we used it in my company.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is true that there is an exemption for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code, saying that only the first and last 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or something like that) need be submitted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyright office.  But this makes proving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infringement harder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a rule:  The existence of intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws encourages the revelation of details such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how voting machine works.  The nonexistence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandates secrecy.  So Thom's long article on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting machines is a clear case in favor of IP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<p>One might think that, if only the corporation
<br>
could somehow be called to account for excessive
<br>
zeal in the protection of its IP. However, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0311/S00224.htm">http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0311/S00224.htm</a>
<br>
<p>in which &quot; Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH),
<br>
today, sent a letter to the Chairman and the
<br>
Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee
<br>
requesting that the Committee hold a hearing to
<br>
investigate abuses of the Digital Millennium
<br>
Copyright Act (DMCA) by Diebold Inc., one of the
<br>
nation’s largest electronic voting machine
<br>
manufacturers.
<br>
<p>Recently, Diebold has waged an intimidation
<br>
campaign to repress circulation of employee
<br>
e-mails that raise concerns about the security of
<br>
its electronic voting machines. Since early
<br>
October 2003, Diebold has sent more than a dozen
<br>
cease-and-desist letters to Internet Service
<br>
Providers (ISPs) and universities that host
<br>
websites that either posted Diebold employee
<br>
e-mails or merely hyperlinked to other websites
<br>
with the e-mails. &quot;
<br>
<p>This article is dated 24 November, and as it is
<br>
one of my top Google results, we can safely infer
<br>
that Diebold's friends who run the Judiciary
<br>
Committee have not chosen to heed Kucinich.
<br>
<p>The only inconvenience Diebold seems to have
<br>
suffered has been to send intimidating letters to
<br>
student websites which link to any material about
<br>
its software flaws, claiming the sites violated
<br>
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act:
<br>
&quot;Diebold went the typical DMCA takedown one
<br>
better, though. Not only did it go after the ISPs
<br>
whose clients were posting the Diebold memos, it
<br>
also began sending cease-and-desist letters to
<br>
secondary sites that were reporting the
<br>
controversy and merely contained hyperlinks to
<br>
sites that were hosting the Diebold material. One
<br>
such website and its ISP refused to accede to the
<br>
DMCA takedown order and are being defended by the
<br>
Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<br>
<p>In other words, not only are you subject to DMCA
<br>
takedown for what's on your own site, but you and
<br>
your ISP are responsible for what might be on a
<br>
site you link to. From a journalist's point of
<br>
view, this raises some interesting questions
<br>
about how one can fairly report this story and
<br>
provide readers with resources for making up
<br>
their own minds without incurring Diebold's
<br>
wrath.
<br>
<p>When I asked Diebold spokesman Mike Jacobsen
<br>
whether I could provide links to Diebold-targeted
<br>
sites as Blackbox Voting or Why-War, he
<br>
acknowledged I could but said that it was
<br>
possible I could get a cease-and-desist notice.
<br>
&quot;I'm not saying we're going to do it, but you
<br>
would be at risk for getting a letter,&quot; he said.
<br>
&quot;Anyone that's hosting a direct link to someone
<br>
hosting those files, we want them to understand
<br>
this is our stolen property and we want those
<br>
links to be removed. Looking at it from a legal
<br>
perspective, we were advised the DMCA was the
<br>
best resource for getting that done. All we're
<br>
really requesting that the links be removed from
<br>
the site, although it does seem that the ISPs
<br>
wind up taking down the whole site.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, I'm probably going to have a long wait
<br>
for my cease-and-desist letter, because Diebold's
<br>
actions have backfired in a number of ways. A
<br>
mushrooming number of sites are now mirroring the
<br>
entire set of memos, and by claiming intellectual
<br>
property rights to them, Diebold has given
<br>
backhanded authentication to the material. But in
<br>
using the DMCA to try to suppress the debate
<br>
about its voting machines, Diebold has made
<br>
another tactical error - it's closed off the
<br>
discussion to all but its most virulent
<br>
detractors. Academicians or journalists who might
<br>
find evidence in the memos to debunk the more
<br>
sensational claims about stolen elections are
<br>
going to feel their hands are tied.
<br>
<p>The Diebold controversy has raised a number of
<br>
troubling questions that can only be answered by
<br>
an unbiased, transparent examination of the
<br>
facts. Trying to avoid that examination through
<br>
questionable intellectual property will only
<br>
leave a lingering cloud of suspicion hanging over
<br>
the electoral process. And it proves yet again
<br>
that the DMCA is in practice totally antithetical
<br>
to everything Americans believe about how a
<br>
democracy is supposed to work.&quot;
<br>
from
<br>
<a href="http://www.gripe2ed.com/scoop/story/2003/10/30/9197/8110">http://www.gripe2ed.com/scoop/story/2003/10/30/9197/8110</a>
<br>
Diebold seems to have lost that case, but it can
<br>
always try again after Republican lawyers have
<br>
made it impossible to sue a corporation in the
<br>
name of 'tort reform.'
<br>
'proprietary' is a word I have repeatedly seen in
<br>
reference to vote-counting software although it
<br>
is clearly under some sort of copyright; the
<br>
problem here is not that the companies fear
<br>
losing their secrets (for buggy, insecure Windows
<br>
software) to a competitor, but to the public
<br>
itself! The public would be better served by open
<br>
source software which could be examined for flaws
<br>
by anyone who knew how.
<br>
In summary, Diebold has used copyright to prevent
<br>
disclosure. Other clear examples are to be found
<br>
in the article I have repeatedly cited,
<br>
<a href="http://www.deoxy.org/aip.htm">http://www.deoxy.org/aip.htm</a>
<br>
There are simply some things that should not be
<br>
done for profit and this is one of them.
<br>
Honestly, Phil, I ask you the same question I
<br>
have asked others in a similar debate: What would
<br>
it take to change your mind? How bad would X have
<br>
to get before you admitted X could become a
<br>
problem? If you cannot clearly imagine a
<br>
situation which would negate your present belief,
<br>
you might not recognize it in the real world.
