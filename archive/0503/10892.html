<p><em>&gt; Any code written by humans is bound to have plenty of bugs

<p>Yes, but from this it does not necessarily follow that
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An AI programmed for recursive self-improvement will find these
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; code. 
</em><br>
<p>since this ignores the most important part of my argument, namely that the AI
<br>
would not necessarily have any conception of &quot;humans&quot; in the first place. It
<br>
wouldn't even have a notion of, &quot;Whatever it was that created me.&quot; It would just
<br>
know, &quot;I am imperfect.&quot; I agree that if it were to reason to the existence of
<br>
humans, and to their imperfection in writing code then
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It wouldn't be a huge step to generalize this into humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being fallible in other things as well, and thus prone to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated.
</em><br>
<p>but the first step is a big jump, and I don't think a lot of people understand
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An alternate way for an RSI-capable AI to reason the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be to compare its own functioning before and after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making changes to itself. It would see that the changes led to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it being able to process information better or worse than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before. 
</em><br>
<p>Probably, but again, I don't think that from this, it follows that
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would imply that other beings would also have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different information processing capabilities, depending on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the level of self-improvement they were capable of. 
</em><br>
<p>because &quot;other beings&quot; may not be a concept that the AI is familiar with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beings with an inferior information processing capability could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated by one with a superior capability.
</em><br>
<p>And I'm not sure this is always true. I think that if I have a sufficiently
<br>
strong understanding of the set of probabilities involved in a situation, then
<br>
while you can see to it that I can't make a reliable guess, you can't make it
<br>
so I think I'm making a reliable guess when I'm actually not. But this point
<br>
isn't as important as the previous ones.
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
Daniel
