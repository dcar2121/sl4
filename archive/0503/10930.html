<br>
<p>Hey Marc,
<br>
<p>In case you thought I was trying to say &quot;Hey, I had that idea too&quot;, I
<br>
thought I'd clarify what I meant when I said I thought our ideas were
<br>
very similar, and what parallels I saw.
<br>
<p>| The mind works through the interactions of two
<br>
| distinct modes of thought ? a non-linear (inductive)
<br>
| mode and a linear (deductive) mode.  The interaction
<br>
| is the generation of metaphors.  Every cognitive
<br>
| system can be decomposed into interacting pairs of
<br>
| functions ? one representing an inductive mode, the
<br>
| other a deductive mode.  The key is the *interaction*
<br>
| between the two modes ? which takes the form of
<br>
| *metaphors/analogies*.  It is the ability of the mind
<br>
| to form metaphors/analogies which is the heart of
<br>
| intelligence and it this which gives rise to qualia.
<br>
| Metaphors are *bridges* between two distinct levels of
<br>
| organizations.
<br>
<p>I posited an interaction between an intuition and a formal system. I
<br>
thought of these as being a lot like the relationship between the ego
<br>
and the id, but different in important ways also.
<br>
<p>You here talk about the interaction between a &quot;non-linear&quot; inductive
<br>
mode of thinking which interacts with the deductive mode to create
<br>
metaphors/analogies, which I interpreted as being cognitive objects like
<br>
ideas or thoughts.
<br>
<p>Later in other emails, you say that the split is much stronger, and the
<br>
interaction less important. You say that the two systems split into one
<br>
which deals primarily with morals/values and one which deals primarily
<br>
with physics. Now, I would say that morals/values are things we
<br>
typically associate with strong emotion, and that deductive reasoning is
<br>
not something we associate with feeling.
<br>
<p>You talk about forming ideas, and having those as the basis of qualia.
<br>
Metaphors, it seems from this account, are how we bridge between what we
<br>
feel about things, and what our reasoning tells us about things. You
<br>
seem to be talking about idea creation to me. It is not entirely clear
<br>
whether you regard these reasoning systems as conscious processes.
<br>
<p>Now, I am not talking about idea formation, but rather about how choices
<br>
are made. I don't separate reasoning process by function, which is a key
<br>
difference. I think we have intuitive beliefs about physics in the same
<br>
way that we have intuitive beliefs about emotion, and that we are
<br>
equally able to reason logically about both.
<br>
<p>However, both of us have identified that there are two kinds of ways in
<br>
which ideas get affected by mental processes - one way is relatively
<br>
formal, involving the kind of deduction one could describe with logic,
<br>
and another which is less formal.
<br>
<p>Unless, of course, you want to say that you meant your &quot;non-linear
<br>
inductive&quot; mode to still be formalisable.
<br>
<p>| The mind as a whole is a complex system which can be
<br>
| decomposed into sub-system ?Rationality? (lower
<br>
| sub-level) and sub-system ?Morality? (higher
<br>
| sub-level).  The key is the interaction between the
<br>
| two, which is *the ability of the mind to form
<br>
| metaphors which enables it to understand models of
<br>
| physical processes in terms of models of it?s own
<br>
| internal value systems*! (Bridging the physical and
<br>
| mental worlds through metaphors ? similarities between
<br>
| moral laws and physical laws).
<br>
<p>This seems to me to be very similar to a dialectic process between the
<br>
two kinds of thinking in my model.
<br>
<p>You clearly regard moral laws as the exclusive domain on the non-linear
<br>
mode you identify, whereas I think it is clear that we reason in a
<br>
linear fashion about moral ideas. Clearly that is what people are doing
<br>
when they are creating objective ethical systems, for example. They may
<br>
be grounded on intuitive ideas, and creating a logical system is a
<br>
different thing to actually thinking that way, but it's clearly not just
<br>
a one-way street. The same logic that we use in regards to physics (laws
<br>
of non-contradiction, implication, transitive and intransitive relations
<br>
etc) applies to moral ideas also.
<br>
<p>You might claim this is the level at which metaphors are created - they
<br>
are how the feedback occurs, and how we form models to apply reasoning
<br>
to. However, this seems to me a lot like the idea of a dialectic process.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
