<p>This is not an un-controversial definition.
<br>
<p>For example, some people propose the conscious mind only to be &quot;what
<br>
you are thinking about at the moment&quot;. Additionally, many things
<br>
present in your &quot;subconscious&quot; can through introspection eventually be
<br>
brought into the conscious mind. I'm not just referring to paying
<br>
attention to something, but rather through analysis of your own
<br>
behaviour you can learn about things which are effecting you but which
<br>
you were not previously aware of, you can recover suppressed memory,
<br>
etc. So talking about things which are &quot;not globally accessible and
<br>
not able to be subjected to reflective thought&quot; is always and
<br>
inaccurate definition.
<br>
<p>There are some things which we can concentrate on, some things which
<br>
we can think of but require unusual concentration, some things which
<br>
require learning, some things which we choose to leave as a
<br>
subconscious process, some things which can be either consciously or
<br>
subconsciously performed, and probably some things which can never be
<br>
made conscious.
<br>
<p>That's not to attack his paper, but to point out that you can't walk
<br>
in to this area expecting to be able to always draw a clear distinction.
<br>

<p>| Well, &quot;unconscious&quot; is not really a well-defined term, since
<br>
| &quot;conscious&quot; isn't, which was one of the points in my post.
<br>
|
<br>
| In his paper, Block decomposed the term &quot;conscious&quot; in a useful
<br>
| way, and that implies a parallel decomposition of the term
<br>
| &quot;unconscious.&quot;
<br>
|
<br>
| So, &quot;unconscious&quot; according to your understanding, in Block's
<br>
| language, would be reformulated as &quot;in the mind/brain but not
<br>
| globally accessible and not able to be subjected to reflective
<br>
| thought.&quot;  Whether things in this category have *phenomenality* is
<br>
| then treated as a separate issue...

|&gt; Before commenting I need to ensure I've grasped a definition
<br>
|&gt; correctly.
<br>
|&gt;
<br>
|&gt; I understand &quot;unconsciousness&quot; to the &quot;Stimuli that are too weak
<br>
|&gt; to enter consciousness [but] nevertheless influence behavior ...&quot;
<br>
|&gt;
<br>
|&gt;
<br>
|&gt; Correct?
