</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this what you are getting at (atleast, in part)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hofstader (I highly reccomend GEB if you havn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked at it) talks about isomorphisms (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognizing them) being essential to meaning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence in a way similiar to your use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphors. 
</em><br>
<p>It seems that you didn't see what I was getting at
<br>
all.  For some reason I've found it's nearly
<br>
impossible to communicate highly abstract ideas in
<br>
short posts *sigh*
<br>
<p>I was talking about complex systems theory and its
<br>
possible application to general intelligence.  Complex
<br>
systems are systems with many parts interacting
<br>
harmoniously together to enact some goal.  They
<br>
consist of different 'levels of organization'.  And of
<br>
course the mind is a complex system.
<br>
<p>We can describe any level of a complex system in terms
<br>
of two variables: Structure and Content.  But the
<br>
'Structure' might itself be considered a complex
<br>
system, which could in turn be decomposed into a lower
<br>
level 'Structure' and a lower level 'Content' thusly;
<br>
<p>Structure1  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Structure2, Content2
<br>
<p>The lower level 'Structure' might be a complex system
<br>
too, which could again be composed into an even lower
<br>
level 'Structure' and 'Content' and so on (fractal
<br>
like).
<br>
<p>Structure2 &gt;&gt;&gt; Structure 3, Content3 etc
<br>
<p>Content can be decomposed in the same way.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Now I'm suggesting that the top level 'Structure' of
<br>
the mind can be equated with Morality/Friendliness and
<br>
the top level 'Content' of the mind can be equated
<br>
with 'Rationality'.  I'm proposing that Rationality is
<br>
a top level generalized kind of 'Induction' and
<br>
Morality/Friendliness is a top level generalized kind
<br>
of 'Deduction'.  I also pointed out what I thought the
<br>
big unifying connection between them was:  Top level
<br>
generation of metaphors.
<br>
<p>At the next level down, I split Morality/Friendliness
<br>
into a lower level Structure (which I call Volition)
<br>
and a lower level Content (Eudaimonia).  I proposed
<br>
that Eudaimonia is a lower level kind of 'Induction'
<br>
and Volition is a lower level kind of 'Deduction'. 
<br>
Again, the key to the interaction between the two is
<br>
the generation of a lower level form of metaphors.
<br>
<p>I go on splitting each lower level function down into
<br>
pairs of interacting functions : Structure and Content
<br>
until I reach the 'ground floor' of the mind.  At each
<br>
level, Structure is a function which is 'Deductive' in
<br>
nature, Content is a function which is 'Inductive' in
<br>
nature.  There is an interaction between the two
<br>
between unities them :
<br>
<p>Cognitive System = Structure x Content
<br>
<p>The key to the interaction (represented by the 'x'
<br>
sign) is the generation of metaphors, which the mind
<br>
uses to form the bridge between Structure and Content
<br>
- the mind finds an analogy between aspects of
<br>
Structure and aspects of Content.
<br>
<p>I only need to look at the highest level to spot what
<br>
I believe to be the secret to general intelligence:
<br>
<p>Mind =  Rationality x Morality/Friendliness
<br>
<p>The mind is a complex system with Content
<br>
'Rationality' and Structure 'Morality/Friendliness'. 
<br>
The interaction
<br>
between the two ('x') tells me the real purpose of the
<br>
mind:  It's a system which seeks to find metaphors
<br>
enabling it to describe the workings of it's own
<br>
internal value system in terms of the workings of
<br>
physical objects.  Examples of such metaphors:
<br>
<p>'She is as sweet as a rose'
<br>
<p>'He was able to direct his thoughts to his goal as
<br>
effectively as a master marksman firing an arrow
<br>
towards it's target'
<br>
<p>All make sense?
