<em>&gt;|&gt; It has been interesting to see the chats concerning the

<em>&gt;|&gt; Organization in Michigan).

<em>&gt;| I am surprised that the responses to the original post don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| mention William Hamilton's inclusive fitness or evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why? They are simple ideas and I guess people don't feel the need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reference any particular philosophy of altruism...
</em><br>
<p>It is true that Hamilton's ideas are simple, but it should be noted that 
<br>
altruism baffled the best minds in evolutionary biology for over 100 
<br>
years.  However, I don't see how you justify using the word &quot;philosophy&quot; in 
<br>
this context.  Perhaps you could explain?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;| The root of what looks like altruism is selfish genes, evolved to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| do the best the can with whatever nastiness nature deals out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes. Evolution is true. Gasp!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| Altruism between unrelated people can be considered a misfiring of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| the evolved psychological traits.  We just don't live in related
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| tribes to the extent we did in the stone age so we treat others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| better than their relatedness to us would justify in gene terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Psychological-traits are not goal oriented, they are evolved. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider any evolved system to be &quot;mis-firing&quot; is to misunderstand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature of evolution, which is simply the mechanism by which organisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adapt to circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you mean &quot;species&quot; because evolution is not something that happens 
<br>
to an organism.  (The organism reproduces more or less than the other 
<br>
members of the species changing gene pool frequencies.)
<br>
<p>But let me give you an example of misfiring.  We have chemically mediated 
<br>
reward systems in our brains that for the most part reward us for things 
<br>
like sex, attention, and food.  This reward system is very well adapted to 
<br>
promote reproductive success in hunter gatherer tribes.
<br>
<p>The reward system misfires when it is activated by addictive drugs.  This 
<br>
has been determined in great detail most recently with fMRI studies.  Now 
<br>
the trait to get addicted to drugs is an obvious misfiring of the social 
<br>
reward system evolved for other reasons.  (Otherwise you need to make a 
<br>
case that being nodded out on plant narcotics made you more likely to 
<br>
reproduce (instead of being eaten) in a hunter gatherer world.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Altruism between unrelated people is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another evolved response. There is no need to claim that kin selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the &quot;real&quot; altruism, and unconditional altruism is somehow lesser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They are both merely features. Why do you feel that altruism must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defined in a kinship-selective manner?
</em><br>
<p>Well, how do you account for the evolution of traits where one animal does 
<br>
something for the benefit of another?  Consider bees rather than humans to 
<br>
work it out.  That's how Hamilton first understood the origin of altruism.
