</em><br>
<p>People have only scratched the surface of the &quot;selfish gene&quot;
<br>
idea. Looking only at the first level of implications. Does a &quot;selfish
<br>
gene&quot; work only to copy those which are exact base pair for base
<br>
pair copies of itself? Or does it work to copy those similar to itself?
<br>
For example the four color genes of the human eye (red,green,blue,night
<br>
vision green), they are all very similar. A &quot;selfish gene&quot; might do well
<br>
to support the copying of many variations of itself, as diversity of forms
<br>
will tend to insure its survival, over a single form. Diversity of genetic
<br>
variations is so important that we have sex, instead of cloning for all
<br>
higher life forms, and many lower.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You could argue this isn't &quot;true altruism&quot; because their goal may be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pure altruism&quot; -- but I don't tend to find such arguments very meaningful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, this is an example of genuine altruism, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not explained via the neo-Darwinist orthodoxy very well.  It's explained by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the variant of evolutionary theory that emphasizes self-organization and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamical attractors.
</em><br>
<p>It comes out of Darwinism is you look at it closely. Survival of the
<br>
fittest simply has to look beyond the individual organism, and the
<br>
individual variant of a gene. Its a very very complex equation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Altruism (in the sense I'm using it here) is a psychological attractor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the quasi-altruism that the selfish genome promotes has pushed some human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains toward that attractor.  Guiding AGI's into this psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractor will be an important topic in AGI psychology...
</em><br>
<p>The psychological attractor is there because evolution built it in.
<br>
Altruism is selected for ultimately, and its not always 'nice', it also
<br>
means altruistically fighting off parasites, for example people in games
<br>
will tend to punish cheaters even if its not to there direct benefit to do
<br>
so.
