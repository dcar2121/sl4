<p><em>&gt; &gt; - Human code is highly modular, to the detriment of performance. By this and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the above, humans have a small short-term memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the last item will be available, and it and other structural cues 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are sufficient information (given sufficient computing power) to deduce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that humans are fallible, quite possibly even that humans evolved by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why you believe that there will be that much there to find, or that
<br>
*any* AI would have to have the right kind of background knowledge to make that
<br>
inference. Computing power is not a catch-all; you need facts too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We know a tremendous amount about natural selection on the basis of (a) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at its handiwork (b) thinking about the math of evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology that systematizes the evidence, given the nudge from the evidence.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt, but we wouldn't have anything without (a).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can equally well imagine a Minerva superintelligence (that is, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully functional transhuman AGI created as pure code without any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real-time interaction between the programmer and running AGI code) that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies its own archived original source code.  This is a smaller corpus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than terrestrial biology, but studiable in far greater detail and much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more tractable to its intelligence than is DNA to our own intelligence. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see what your reasons for this are. Why do you think a few megs of
<br>
source code (or machine code, which is what it would probably actually want to
<br>
work with) have enough information for such a powerful inference?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I would not be surprised to see the Minerva SI devise a theory of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human intelligence that was correct on all major points and sufficient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to manipulation.
</em><br>
<p>I would be shocked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point is probably irrelevant.  A Minerva FAI seems to me to be three 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sigma out beyond humanly impossible.  I can just barely conceive of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minerva AGI, but I would still call it humanly impossible.
</em><br>
<p>You are probably far more qualified than me to say whether or not a Minerva AI
<br>
is feasible. But consider that AI in general is very dangerous, and the
<br>
inability to use an AI jail adds to that tremendously. If it were true that a
<br>
Minerva could be safely jailed, then that would be a very good reason to
<br>
carefully evaluate just how impractical it was, and whether there were any good
<br>
ways to make it more practical.
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
Daniel
