<em>&gt; If it is 100% complete, hopefully you won't mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being asked to expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on some parts. I think you have a good basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your theory, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to probe it a little.
</em><br>
<p>No problem.  Let's begin then.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does forming a metaphor help give rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia? This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mis-understanding might be the same one that holds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me up later also.
</em><br>
<p>I would take me a while to explain but just briefly: 
<br>
I said that the main use of metaphors is as ‘bridges’
<br>
between different levels of organization in the mind. 
<br>
But this can only work because there is a general
<br>
self-similarity property running through the levels of
<br>
organization in the mind.  Ultimately this has to
<br>
carry over to the physical universe itself (the
<br>
universe itself is a ‘Complex System’).  So metaphors
<br>
are a powerful kind of ‘self-reflection’ property,
<br>
where basic deep properties of reality are being
<br>
recursed at higher and higher levels.   It seems
<br>
natural to equate the generation of metaphors with
<br>
qualia.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the term morality is not a good one - it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to be saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the formation of metaphors (and thus qualia)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good/evil distinction involved. Is that a proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding? Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not call them Rationality and Intuition for example?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to be very deliberately using the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality - yet surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there we have some metaphorical knowledge that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not morally laden?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as an inductive partial understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, for example. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are you using indiction in a different meaning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me?
</em><br>
<p>We can view the system that is the mind at many
<br>
different levels of ‘course graining’ (an analogy here
<br>
is with a microscope – we have to choose the
<br>
magnification level at which we are viewing
<br>
something).
<br>
<p>At the highest level of course graining I have divided
<br>
the mind in two – into a sub-system dealing with
<br>
morals/values and a sub-system dealing with reasoning
<br>
about inanimate objects.  But of course I can further
<br>
decompose these two big systems into smaller
<br>
sub-systems (turning up the resolution with which I
<br>
describe the mind so to speak), and each of these
<br>
sub-systems would have their own kinds of metaphors.
<br>
I’m proposing a fractal structure to the mind - I
<br>
think that each new level can be decomposed into two
<br>
smaller interacting sub-systems, and each new class of
<br>
interaction will have its own metaphors associated
<br>
with it. So I certainly didn’t mean that all metaphors
<br>
are connected to morals/values.  Only the high level
<br>
ones are.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the thinking behind calling rationality a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;linear&quot; process,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and induction a &quot;non-linear&quot; one? I doubt you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literally mean the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical concept of linear, you must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employing one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphors to which you referred, but unfortunately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not forming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bridge between your metaphor and my rationality!! :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I’m using the words ‘Induction’ and ‘Deduction’ in a
<br>
generalized sense that does not correspond to standard
<br>
definitions.  In point of fact, I think there are many
<br>
different *levels* of induction and deduction. 
<br>
Philosophers already acknowledge this actually – they
<br>
have different terms for different levels of induction
<br>
– one for low-level induction in the sense of simple
<br>
generalization of perceptual observations (concept
<br>
formation), and another for high-level induction in
<br>
the sense of probabilistic confirmation of theories
<br>
generalized from classes of observation (they call
<br>
this ‘abduction’).
<br>
<p>It is in an extremely generalized sense of the term
<br>
that I call ‘Rationality’ inductive and ‘Morality’
<br>
deductive when viewed from the highest level of
<br>
organization of the mind.  Of course, high level
<br>
Rationality can be decomposed into two sub-levels –
<br>
one a lower level kind of ‘Induction’, another a lower
<br>
level kind of ‘Deduction’.  And so too with moral
<br>
reasoning.  I hope this isn’t too confusing.  Just
<br>
remember I’m postulating many different *kinds*
<br>
(levels) of Induction and Deduction.
