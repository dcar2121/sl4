<p>John Conway on &quot;The Free Will Theorem&quot;
<br>
March 18, 2005
<br>
<p>JOHN CONWAY speaks on &quot;The Free Will Theorem&quot;
<br>
<p>FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 2005 at 7:30 to 9 p.m. • FREE ADMISSION
<br>
<p>An MSRI Presentation at the Roda Theatre, Berkeley Repertory Theatre at 
<br>
2015 Addison Street, Berkeley (near the Downtown Berkeley BART station 
<br>
on Shattuck)
<br>
<p>Ever since the early days of quantum mechanics, physicists have debated 
<br>
the foundations of the subject, and in particular, if the standard 
<br>
statistical interpretation is an accurate depiction of the real world, 
<br>
or if there are so called &quot;hidden variables&quot; that lie behind the quantum 
<br>
description of elementary particles such as electrons.
<br>
<p>Recently, John Conway and Simon Kochen proved, on the basis of three 
<br>
little &quot;axioms&quot; from physics, that if there exist experimenters with a 
<br>
limited amount of free will, then elementary particles also have their 
<br>
own small amount of free will, meaning that on occasion their behavior 
<br>
is not determined by the prior history of the entire universe. This is 
<br>
believed to be the strongest &quot;no hidden variable&quot; theorem established so 
<br>
far.
<br>
<p>JOHN HORTON CONWAY is the von Neumann Professor of Mathematics at 
<br>
Princeton University. Educated at the University of Cambridge, Professor 
<br>
Conway is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, and a master of 
<br>
nearly every field of mathematics. Colleagues consider him to be one of 
<br>
the most electrifying and entertaining lecturers in pure mathematics 
<br>
today. Conway has written and co-authored several books, and in 2004, 
<br>
Volume Four of &quot;Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays&quot; by co-authors 
<br>
John Conway, Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard Guy was released.
