<p><p>Marc said what Marc said.  If he wanted to say something else, then he
<br>
should be a little more thoughtful before pressing the &quot;Send&quot; button.
<br>
<p>Even if he had written exactly what you had written above, I would still
<br>
disagree with the reasoning.  Just because some implementations of Bayes
<br>
may be intractable does not mean that it is *necessarily* intractable in
<br>
this domain.  Even you use the &quot;most cases&quot; weasel words, which makes
<br>
the idea that &quot;Bayes theorem is broken&quot; a real stretch even if Marc
<br>
merely meant &quot;infeasible&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>It is not obvious to me that some fairly pervasive application of Bayes
<br>
is always going to be intractable for this application.  It would seem
<br>
to me to be making some implicit assumptions in the design,
<br>
implementation, and problem space that are not warranted.  I'll simply
<br>
make the observation that people don't implement mathematics on
<br>
computers, they implement finite approximations that often have
<br>
different properties than the pure math description would suggest.  As
<br>
an obvious example, useful lossless data compression algorithms do a
<br>
pretty fine job on ordinary computers even though a perfect
<br>
mathematically pure implementation of data compression would be
<br>
generally intractable in this universe.
