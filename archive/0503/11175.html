<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, how do you account for the evolution of traits where one animal does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something for the benefit of another?  Consider bees rather than humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work it out.  That's how Hamilton first understood the origin of altruism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We do have the examples of people choosing instant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impending death or torture, just in order to benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others. We can't---thankfully most people here agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;---torture the language by calling this anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*altruism*.
</em><br>
<p>The existence of behavior fitting the definition of one individual doing 
<br>
something for benefit of another is unquestioned.  The problem is how the 
<br>
psychological mechanisms behind such behavior came to have evolved.
<br>
<p>Now some of them are obvious, such as bears nursing cubs.  Obviously the 
<br>
genes of those who did not feed the cubs become less common over time.  The 
<br>
harder cases to understand are social insects, &quot;helpers at the nest&quot; in 
<br>
birds, and vampire bats.  But all of these are now understood.  (In fact, 
<br>
the reciprocal altruism mechanism involved in vampire bats was figured out 
<br>
*before* the bat behavior was found.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But memes affect people strongly (duh), and can take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over to the point that people do lots of things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are &quot;unnatural&quot;. Yet we have evolved just this ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be controlled by memes, and many people here have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;testified that they'd die for rather abstract reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What about this?
</em><br>
<p>It is a good thing you are asking now instead of a few years ago.
<br>
<p>Hominids lost serious predation a *long* time ago.  Like every other animal 
<br>
lacking predators, the population of our ancestors periodically exceeded 
<br>
the food supply.  When it was possible, our ancestors moved over the 
<br>
horizon--which is why virtually every possible niche on the globe was 
<br>
occupied.
<br>
<p>When the entire ecosystem for social primates was filled up and hard times 
<br>
were looming, a behavioral switch (activated by the perception of a bleak 
<br>
future) turned up the &quot;gain&quot; on the circulation of xenophobic (hating 
<br>
others) memes in the tribe, and eventually the hyped up warriors went out 
<br>
to do or die against neighbors.  Sort of having to be your own predator.
<br>
<p>Repeat this process over a few million years and you get animals who are 
<br>
peaceful most of the time, but sync up using memes (any will do) and kill 
<br>
each other periodically.
<br>
<p>Assuming no logic errors, this is the origin of the power memes have to 
<br>
control people.
<br>
<p>It certainly accounts for suicide bombers.
<br>
<p>This view of humanity is not PC.  Over the years I have taken a lot flack 
<br>
(even from a Federal judge) for bringing up topics that humans are most 
<br>
uncomfortable with.  But you have to understand the most unpleasant facts 
<br>
about our species if you want to do anything about them, or even stay out 
<br>
of the way.
<br>
<p>There is a 20 page paper on this topic that I am trying to have 
<br>
published.  If anyone wants a pre-pub copy they would comment on, ask me in 
<br>
email.
