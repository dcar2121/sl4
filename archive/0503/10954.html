David -
<br>
<p>I think it is straightforward to demonstrate that there is true 
<br>
altruistic behavior, but not, as you're pointing out, true altruistic 
<br>
motivations.
<br>
<p>Examples abound of people giving their time, their wealth, and even 
<br>
their lives for others.  There is clear evidence that this behavior can 
<br>
be consciously motivated, but also exists deep within our evolved 
<br>
programming.   Some forms of altruistic behavior may be better described 
<br>
as &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot; where a person acts in altruistic ways 
<br>
out of a belief that this will help create a better world for all , 
<br>
including the actor, to live in.  Some forms of altruistic behavior 
<br>
arise from a deeper, unthinking emotional level, such as the parent who 
<br>
runs into a burning house in a hopeless attempt to save a child.
<br>
<p>In the long run, altruistic behavior, as a form of cooperation, provides 
<br>
the kind of positive-sum benefits that enhance the survival of the 
<br>
group, and indirectly benefit individuals.
<br>
<p>Yes, the argument can be made that any altruistic behavior is motivated 
<br>
at some level by self-interest.  Does this diminish in any way the value 
<br>
of altruism?
<br>
<p>I would file this one along with the perennial debates on free-will, 
<br>
qualia, and consciousness -- all based on arguments with insufficient 
<br>
context.
<br>

<p><em>&gt;It has been interesting to see the chats concerning the self-proclaimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altruism of Eleizer and the differing view proposed by Robert Ettinger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(originator of the Cryonics Organization in Michigan).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The purpose of this is to either debunk the self-proclaimed view of altruism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or find a view that altruism really exists.  I am clearly leaning to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view of Ettinger and that all claims of altruism relate to self-interest or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-values. If true, the claims of altruism would be stated as personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;His view is basically that people are motivated by self-interest to feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good. He calls this view &quot;me-first, feel-good&quot;.  He basically states that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one does anything, ever, for altruistic purposes. The only sacrifice anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chooses, ever, is that of one value or facet of his psyche in favor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another. Thus, your only motivation is to please yourself or avoid something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worse.  His book, Youniverse, is on the cryonics organization web page.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;following is from page 89 of Youniverse relating to altruism as quoted:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The main point is the primacy of self-interest cannot be denied, claims of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altruism are always language traps. To the extent the behavior is motivated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(rather than accidental or a hard-wired habit pattern), no one &quot;ever&quot; makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a &quot;sacrifice&quot; for someone else or something else.  The only sacrifice anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chooses, ever, is that of one value or one facet of his psyche in favor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another, the momentarily dominate value or personality aspect.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words, your only motivation is to please yourself - the currently dominant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect of your psyche- or to avoid a worse alternative.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exceptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In other words: it is not possible to sacrifice oneself for another person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or for a principle.  It is only possible to set one value, or one presently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perceived good, above another. In the extreme case ( I assume he means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sacrificing your life for someone), you value your prospect of survival less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than your desire for virtue or guilt avoidance.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks for any comments.
