<em>&gt;Some people have said that human thinking is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*precisely* this, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that's false. I think there is indeed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking and speaking. Your description of metaphors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being formed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through some interaction of a normative system (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dislike using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality/value because it doesn't seem to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describing what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are saying) and some kind of laws-of-physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationality seems to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similar to language games and idea-creation. From our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;metaphors (equated henceforth with the language games
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we understand) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and experience, we acquire knowledge of the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding facts in terms of existing metaphors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;building new ones. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm no fan of Wittgenstein and I certainly don't think
<br>
that thinking is all language games and idea creation.
<br>
&nbsp;His ides influenced the logical positivists and were
<br>
apparently the beginning the post-modern disease.  He
<br>
seemed to think that language had no meaning outside
<br>
it's social context (it's only a small step from there
<br>
is the idea that 'everything is a social construct').
<br>
<p>The difference between me and him is probably that I
<br>
think that is an objective reality out there which our
<br>
metaphors can approximate.  We have to start with some
<br>
initial metaphors but these get modified as we acquire
<br>
new knowledge and eventually everyone's metaphors will
<br>
start to converge.  The internal metaphors and
<br>
external knowlegde are not independent of each other. 
<br>
There will have to be a convergence to objective
<br>
reality outside the initial language games.
<br>
<p>Perhaps in place of the word metaphor I should have
<br>
used the more general term 'analogy'.  And I should
<br>
have said that my theory consists of the interactions
<br>
of two systems but both of them are *reasoning*
<br>
systems: one is a system for reasoning about
<br>
morals/values/agents, the other a system for reasoning
<br>
about physics/inanimate things.

THE BRAIN is wider than the sky,

The one the other will include  
  With ease, and you beside.
