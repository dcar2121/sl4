<p><p>| My system of reasoning about morality is not meant to be any less
<br>
| formal than the system reasoning about physics.  I think the
<br>
| non-linear inductive mode is totally formalisable as well.  My
<br>
| values/physics split is NOT a split between intuition and formal
<br>
| reasoning.
<br>
<p>In some sense, this is a controversial claim. Most people, I think,
<br>
would separate conscious and subconscious reasoning. Emotional content
<br>
seems to come from the subconscious, rather than be arrived at through
<br>
reasoning, even though we may have an emotional reaction to a reasoned
<br>
idea.
<br>
<p>As such, people tend to call conscious thought processes
<br>
&quot;rationality&quot;, which is not far away from &quot;logical&quot;. Trusting your
<br>
intuition ahead of your conscious reasoning is often called &quot;irrational&quot;.
<br>
<p>Unconscious thought - where our emotional reactions and the feeling of
<br>
moral imperative come from - is usually regarded as &quot;black box&quot;. Our
<br>
rational systems *do not* properly comprehend the subconscious
<br>
emotional processing. There is no good naive understanding of our
<br>
emotional systems. While I don't claim that those systems in-principle
<br>
can't be captured by a formal system, this is not a claim that
<br>
reflects our common understanding.
<br>
<p>The kinds of beliefs and ideas we get from our subconsious are often
<br>
called our intuition, although in my system I have defined a specific
<br>
mode of thought which is not precisely the common understanding of
<br>
intuition.
<br>
<p>Let's assume that induction means &quot;The process of deriving general
<br>
principles from particular facts or instances&quot;. Deduction is going the
<br>
other way - from principles to facts. Now, if all you are saying is
<br>
that when we are thinking, we do some induction and some deduction,
<br>
that's not terribly interesting. If you say, however, that you can
<br>
split mental processing into two different kinds on the basis of which
<br>
kind of thinking is being done, that's more interesting. If you say
<br>
that morals/values are dominated by induction, with relatively little
<br>
deduction, then I am not sure I can agree. Ditto for the converse.
<br>
<p>I understood you to mean that our morals and values were determined by
<br>
a largely un-refined process of induction, while our rational beliefs
<br>
were more thoroughly refined through testing the validity of our
<br>
deductions on those grounds. As such, I suppose I put the
<br>
morals/values &quot;non-linear inductive&quot; process in the &quot;subconscious /
<br>
irrational&quot; box, and the &quot;linear deductive&quot; mode in the &quot;conscious /
<br>
refined&quot; box.
<br>
<p>I'll move onto the difference between the rationale of physics and the
<br>
rationale of morality/values later.
<br>
<p>|&gt; | The mind as a whole is a complex system which can be |
<br>
|&gt; decomposed into sub-system ?Rationality? (lower | sub-level) and
<br>
|&gt; sub-system ?Morality? (higher | sub-level).  The key is the
<br>
|&gt; interaction between the | two, which is *the ability of the mind
<br>
|&gt; to form | metaphors which enables it to understand models of |
<br>
|&gt; physical processes in terms of models of it?s own | internal
<br>
|&gt; value systems*! (Bridging the physical and | mental worlds
<br>
|&gt; through metaphors ? similarities between | moral laws and
<br>
|&gt; physical laws).
<br>
|&gt;
<br>
|&gt; This seems to me to be very similar to a dialectic process
<br>
|&gt; between the two kinds of thinking in my model.
<br>
|
<br>
|
<br>
| Nope.  See above.  I was NOT suggesting an intuition/formal
<br>
| reasoning split.  Both my system of reasoning about morals/values
<br>
| and my system of reasoning about physics are meant to be totally
<br>
| rational and formalisable.
<br>
|
<br>
| I have pairs of functions which are synergistic, NOT pairs of
<br>
| functions which are opposites (dialectic).
<br>
<p>My use of the term dialectic was meant to express not so much the
<br>
opposition of point of view between the intuitive and the deductive,
<br>
but the opposition in kind. The two may sometimes agree, and but will
<br>
not always. However, when making a decision that is difficult, there
<br>
is a dialectic. When making a decision that is easy, the two system
<br>
happen not to conflict, and thus there is no process of resolution.
<br>
<p>Your comments about the creations of metaphors through the interaction
<br>
of induction and deduction suggested a structural similarity with my
<br>
idea of making decisions through the interaction of intuition / formal
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Additionally, I would not claim absolutely that the intuitive system I
<br>
describe is unable to be described / approximated formally, but that
<br>
it is not itself reasoning formally. In the same way that a neural
<br>
network can be formally described, but the meaning of its output is
<br>
not a formal analysis of its input.
<br>
<p>|&gt; You clearly regard moral laws as the exclusive domain on the
<br>
|&gt; non-linear mode you identify,
<br>
|
<br>
| Not at all!  Don't forget the recursive nature of my idea!  I had
<br>
| meant for there to be many different *kinds* (levels) of inductive.
<br>
| Only from the point of view of the highest level of coarse graining
<br>
| is moral reasoning inductive.  I am talking about many different
<br>
| levels of organization here O.K?  I think only high level reasoning
<br>
| about morality is inductive. Lower levels of reasoning about
<br>
| morality involve linear deduction as well.
<br>
<p>Sorry, I was being imprecise / wrong. You clearly regard moral laws as
<br>
being dominated by the non-linear inductive mode you identify,
<br>
although when taken in detail, elements of both can still be identified.
<br>
<p>|&gt; The same logic that we use in regards to physics (laws of
<br>
|&gt; non-contradiction, implication, transitive and intransitive
<br>
|&gt; relations etc) applies to moral ideas also.
<br>
|
<br>
| Well, kind of.  But be careful!  I think reasoning about morality
<br>
| is a higher level form of reasoning.  I do not believe that the
<br>
| logic used for physics can be directly used for morality as well.
<br>
| That is the mistake being made by the Yudkowksy's and Goertezel's
<br>
| of this world.  They are trying to squeeze all of moral reasoning
<br>
| into the strait jacket of current probability theory.  But I
<br>
| strongly suspect that current probability theory is not up to task!
<br>
|
<br>
|
<br>
| I suspect some kind of major generalization of probability theory
<br>
| will be needed to properly handle moral reasoning.
<br>
<p>I think we often introduce metaphors from physics into our moral
<br>
thinking. I agree with you that the logic used for physics shouldn't
<br>
be applied to morality, but I think that it *is*.
<br>
<p>For example, people will often create an ethical system based on
<br>
logical inference. They will &quot;ground&quot; their ideas using certain
<br>
intuitive axioms - i.e. that personal freedom is valuable, that we
<br>
should respect one another, that pain should be avoided etc etc. They
<br>
will then formalise that in mathematics, respecting such logical
<br>
ideals such as the law of the excluded middle etc.
<br>
<p>A good example of that is when people are sometimes unable to see that
<br>
someone both loves you and dislikes you at the same time - that many
<br>
emotional properties have a dual nature, and are not simply
<br>
summarised. &quot;Joe is a nice person&quot; is another example. Subjectivity
<br>
aside, there is no consistent property &quot;niceness&quot; which can be
<br>
properly ascribed to someone. It is possible to argue this is just
<br>
because of granularity - that if you went into more detail the
<br>
problems might resolve themselves, but it is my belief that in fact
<br>
such dualities are present at every level.
<br>
<p>This is why I liked your recursive definition - it allows you to
<br>
classify something, while at the same time not ascribing it a
<br>
simplistic logical category.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
