Very well. I, the original poster you refer to,
<br>
did not want to get into the mud of political
<br>
dispute in this forum, but I *could* give a
<br>
concrete example of how intellectual property as
<br>
presently employed does enable abuse in
<br>
governance. That is, I could, if I did not
<br>
despair of getting the evidence taken seriously
<br>
among people not already so inclined. Warning:
<br>
big data dump ahead.
<br>
<p>About a third of the votes in the last election
<br>
were tallied by computers at Diebold, ES&amp;S or
<br>
Sequoia, &quot;private corporation(s) founded, in one
<br>
case, by a family that believes the Bible should
<br>
replace the Constitution; in another case run by
<br>
one of Ohio's top Republicans; and in another
<br>
case partly owned by Saudi investors&quot;, running
<br>
'proprietary' software that outsiders are not
<br>
permitted to examine. Bottom line: the computer
<br>
tallies make lots of 'mistakes' that always seem
<br>
to help the Republicans. The Ukraine election was
<br>
overturned over suspicion of fraud because the
<br>
outcome was out of whack with the exit polls.
<br>
November's outcome here, also out of whack with
<br>
exit polls, led to no such outcry. Odd, eh? see
<br>
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/election04/20416/">http://www.alternet.org/election04/20416/</a>
<br>
<p>Some of the irregularities which have been
<br>
associated with this equipment, operated in
<br>
secrecy:
<br>
&quot;&quot;USA Today reported on Nov. 3, 2002, 'In
<br>
Georgia, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll
<br>
shows Democratic Sen. Max Cleland with a 49% to
<br>
44% lead over Republican Rep. Saxby Chambliss.'
<br>
Cox News Service, based in Atlanta, reported just
<br>
after the election (Nov. 7) that, 'Pollsters may
<br>
have goofed' because 'Republican Rep. Saxby
<br>
Chambliss defeated incumbent Democratic Sen. Max
<br>
Cleland by a margin of 53 to 46 percent. The
<br>
Hotline, a political news service, recalled a
<br>
series of polls Wednesday showing that Chambliss
<br>
had been ahead in none of them.'&quot; Nearly every
<br>
vote in the state was on an electronic machine
<br>
with no audit trail.&quot;
<br>
This discrepancy between exit polls and vote
<br>
tally has been termed 'mathematically
<br>
impossible.' A couple points discrepancy, OK; but
<br>
9 points for Chambliss? Balderdash.
<br>
For more of the same, last November: &quot;Dr Stephen
<br>
F. Freeman from the University of Pennsylvania
<br>
calculated that the odds of just three of the
<br>
major swing states, Florida, Ohio and
<br>
Pennsylvania all swinging as far as they did
<br>
against their respective exit polls were 250
<br>
milllion to 1.&quot;

<br>
<p>&quot;    *  In Georgia, which recently purchased
<br>
22,000 Diebold touch screens, some voters touched
<br>
one candidate's name on the screen and saw
<br>
another candidate's name appear
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A former news reporter in Florida
<br>
discovered that votes were being tabulated in 644
<br>
Palm Beach precincts: but Palm Beach only has 643
<br>
precincts. An earlier court case in Florida found
<br>
the same discrepancy. A reporter in New Jersey
<br>
observed 104 precincts with votes in an area that
<br>
has only 102 precincts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Baldwin County results showed that Democrat
<br>
Don Siegelman won the state of Alabama. However,
<br>
the next morning, 6,300 of Siegelman's votes
<br>
disappeared and the election was handed to
<br>
Republican Bob Riley. A recount was requested and
<br>
denied.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In North Carolina, a software programming
<br>
error caused vote-counting machines to skip over
<br>
several thousand votes, both Republican and
<br>
Democratic. Fixing the error turned up 5,500 more
<br>
votes and reversed the election.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In Comal County Texas, an uncanny
<br>
coincidence resulted in three Republican
<br>
candidates winning by exactly 18,181 votes each.
<br>
Two other Republican candidates outside Texas
<br>
also won by exactly 18,181 votes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In October, election officials in Raleigh,
<br>
N.C., discovered that early voters had to make
<br>
several attempts to record their votes on ES&amp;S
<br>
systems. Officials compared the number of voters
<br>
to the number of votes counted and realized that
<br>
294 votes had been lost.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A report from the Caltech-MIT Voting
<br>
Technology Project states that an estimated 1.5
<br>
million presidential votes were not recorded in
<br>
2000 because of difficulties using voting
<br>
equipment and that electronic machines have the
<br>
second highest rate of unmarked, uncounted and
<br>
spoiled ballots in presidential, Senate, and
<br>
governor elections over the last 12 years.
<br>
<p>Federally mandated voting machines, almost
<br>
exclusively manufactured by ES&amp;S, Diebold and
<br>
Sequoia are being constructed and tested under
<br>
obsolete FEC recommendations. The US has
<br>
authorized spending of over four billion dollars
<br>
on new voting equipment, but as Mercuri notes,
<br>
&quot;failed to require or enforce adequate security,
<br>
usability, reliability, and auditability controls
<br>
over the products being purchased.&quot; The numerous
<br>
flaws cited above ably demonstrate Mercuri's
<br>
point.&quot;
<br>
...
<br>
<p>&quot;There is no known way to ensure that this is not
<br>
happening inside of a voting system. Companies
<br>
such as Diebold, ES&amp;S and Sequoia, which
<br>
manufacture the machines and provide the code
<br>
that runs them, simply take a &quot;trust us&quot;
<br>
approach.
<br>
<p>Mercuri also reports that no electronic voting
<br>
system has been certified to even the lowest
<br>
level of the U.S. government or international
<br>
computer security standards such as the ISO
<br>
Common Criteria, nor are they required to comply
<br>
with such standards. Thus, no current electronic
<br>
voting system is secure by the U.S. government's
<br>
own standards.&quot;

<br>
<p>Bear in mind that I am referring you specifically
<br>
to the fact that 'proprietary' status helps
<br>
protect corrupt use of the software/hardware to
<br>
steal elections, by thwarting transparency.
<br>
Sunlight being the best disinfectant, as the
<br>
saying goes. 
<br>
<p>When Phil says &quot;The general flaws in our system
<br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; government are an entirely separate issue from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual property&quot; he founders on the word
</em><br>
'entirely'. It's a variant of 'always', 'never',
<br>
'all', a sweeping generalization that has no leg
<br>
to stand on. If I were foolish enough to say that
<br>
'intellectual property is the whole problem with
<br>
our government' that would be a different matter.
<br>
It is but one of a broad range of problems; but
<br>
it certainly is a problem, in recent years; I
<br>
remain firm in my view that intellectual
<br>
property, which seemed perfectly reasonable to me
<br>
in the past, has grown past its reasonable
<br>
limits, like a kudzu vine that might overrun the
<br>
whole yard if we let it.
<br>
If you do not wish to spend any time looking into
<br>
the links I offer, fine; but I will mentally
<br>
roundfile any views you offer on the matter. As
<br>
for me, I do not expect to see another Democratic
<br>
president in my lifetime (I have even told my
<br>
daughter that I may die a political prisoner).
<br>
With a wee bit of help from intellectual
<br>
property, the Right has methodically knocked out
<br>
all the checks and balances, even the
<br>
vote-counting, and engineered itself a de facto
<br>
one-party state, and in the fullness of time you
<br>
will see that I am not exaggerating.
