Facebook, PayPal tycoon embraces sci-fi future
<br>
<p>By MARCUS WOHLSEN
<br>
The Associated Press
<br>
Saturday, December 25, 2010; 12:30 PM
<br>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO -- In the movie The Social Network, the character of Peter
<br>
Thiel is played as a slick Master of the Universe, a tech industry king and
<br>
kingmaker with the savvy to see that a $500,000 investment in Facebook could
<br>
mint millions later.
<br>
<p>Reality is a little more rumpled.
<br>
<p>On a recent December night, Thiel walked, slightly stooped, across a San
<br>
Francisco stage to make a pitch to an invitation-only audience of Silicon
<br>
Valley luminaries - investors and innovators who had scored sometimes huge
<br>
fortunes through a mix of skill, vision and risk-taking.
<br>
<p>The billionaire PayPal co-founder didn't tell them about the next big
<br>
startup. He wanted them to buy into a bigger idea: the future.
<br>
<p>A future when computers will communicate directly with the human brain.
<br>
Seafaring pioneers will found new floating nations in the middle of the
<br>
ocean. Science will conquer aging, and death will become a curable disease.
<br>
<p>If anything can transform these wild dreams into plausible realities, he
<br>
believes it is the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley - the minds and money
<br>
that have conjured the technological marvels that have already altered
<br>
everyday life.
<br>
<p>&quot;Do we try to pursue ideas that are weird and have optimism about the
<br>
future, or do we give up on all new things and compromise?&quot;
<br>
<p>Sitting before him in the audience, among others: Facebook co-founder Dustin
<br>
Moskovitz, Yelp co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and technology
<br>
publishing guru Tim O'Reilly.
<br>
<p>As venture capital in Silicon Valley chases the next big mobile app or group
<br>
discount service, Thiel was asking for them to fund technological
<br>
breakthroughs that some believe in fervently and others see as sheer
<br>
fantasy.
<br>
<p>He even has a name for it: Breakthrough philanthropy.
<br>
<p>Instead of just giving to help the less fortunate here and now, Thiel
<br>
encouraged his fellow moguls to put their money toward seemingly far-fetched
<br>
ventures that he believes could improve the lives of everyone for good.
<br>
<p>Gathered on the stage were eight groups that Thiel thinks are on the right
<br>
path.
<br>
<p>One was the Singularity Institute, whose members believe in the
<br>
near-inevitability of the arrival within the next century of computers
<br>
smarter than the humans who created them.
<br>
<p>The institute works to ensure that self-programming machines will create a
<br>
world that looks more like Star Trek, less like the Terminator.
<br>
<p>Another was the SENS Foundation, a group of biomedical researchers seeking a
<br>
path to radical life extension based on the controversial aging theories of
<br>
computer scientist-turned-gerontologist Aubrey de Grey.
<br>
<p>And the Seasteading Institute, led by Patri Friedman, the grandson of famed
<br>
economist Milton Friedman. It looks to establish distant ocean colonies to
<br>
serve as laboratories for experimenting with new forms of government or
<br>
&quot;startup countries.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;As innovators, you are the best at finding and nurturing the right big
<br>
ideas that can change the world,&quot; Friedman told the audience.
<br>
<p>The history of Silicon Valley is filled with such ideas. The smartphone, the
<br>
Web, the search engine, the personal computer itself - these all seemed
<br>
far-fetched until they became commonplace.
<br>

<br>
<p>To raise money from the wealthy, it's a time-honored strategy to flatter.
<br>
Witness the names emblazoned across hospital wings and university buildings.
<br>
But building important buildings has never seemed to especially interest
<br>
Silicon Valley's elite.
<br>
<p>They have &quot;the right kind of cultural DNA to at the very least pay
<br>
attention,&quot; said Greg Biggers, a longtime software executive who recently
<br>
founded a startup, Genomera, that lets members conduct health studies using
<br>
their own genetic data.
<br>
<p>Biggers said Silicon Valley entrepreneurs would likely be receptive to
<br>
Thiel's unconventional message because they succeeded by not conforming to
<br>
others' expectations of what was possible.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is a roomful of people who bucked the system,&quot; he said as he mingled,
<br>
glass of wine in hand.
<br>
<p>Charles Rubin, a Duquesne University political science professor and blogger
<br>
who has written critically about some of the movements endorsed by Thiel,
<br>
said these visions of the future align closely with the Silicon Valley
<br>
outlook.
<br>
<p>All share the view that &quot;scientific knowledge and technical capacity will
<br>
continue to increase at an accelerating rate,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;This is a core
<br>
idea that practically defines what Silicon Valley is all about: ceaseless
<br>
innovation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thiel himself seems to thrive on flouting convention, sometimes in ways that
<br>
have led to harsh criticism.
<br>
<p>In September, he announced a program designed to discover the next Mark
<br>
Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, by paying $100,000 each to 20 young people
<br>
under 20 years old to skip college for two years to learn about
<br>
entrepreneurship.
<br>
<p>Jacob Weisberg, editor of the online magazine Slate, excoriated Thiel for
<br>
the program and what he sees as its underlying impetus.
<br>
<p>&quot;Thiel's philosophy demands attention not because it is original or
<br>
interesting in any way - it's puerile libertarianism, infused with futurist
<br>
fantasy - but because it epitomizes an ugly side of Silicon Valley's
<br>
politics,&quot; Weisberg wrote.
<br>
<p>Thiel is not a traditional conservative - he has donated to Republican
<br>
candidates but also to California's marijuana legalization ballot measure.
<br>
But he does seem to believe in a trickle-down theory of technology.
<br>
<p>Unlike the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has poured billions into
<br>
providing basic health care for some of the world's most impoverished
<br>
people, Thiel said he wants to prioritize major scientific advances he
<br>
thinks will spread to benefit humanity as a whole.
<br>

<br>
<p>His faith appears grounded in a pervasive Silicon Valley belief that
<br>
motivates gifted individuals to achieve on a grand scale, no matter the
<br>
apparent hurdles - death included.
<br>
<p>But even Thiel admitted he has no idea how long that last obstacle will take
<br>
to overcome.
<br>
<p>&quot;I would like to say that I would still be doing this even if I thought
<br>
there was no chance I would benefit from this in any way,&quot; he said in an
<br>
interview. &quot;I think we have to work on these things even if they take
<br>
centuries.&quot;
