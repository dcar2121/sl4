</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hello,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today I have sent the following idea to LindenLab (SecondLife creators).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea is to have an array of computers to simulate the worlds/wonderlands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our preference, which would eventually be taken care of by robots of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own design, as we travel across the universe. Would you have any ideas about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, that would be interesting to know your comments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------- LETTER -------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, when there exists many political and ideological differences across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different nations, the world needs a common goal. However, due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistence of various national and religious institutions, their wishes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals are contradictory, and are unlikely to change as long as the ideology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these conflicting institutions will not change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we, as mankind, need a common goal as never before. I think, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtual worlds, and the technology behind them, is what could bring about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution, and a long-term goal, which could be pursued immediately. So, here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it goes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine the world, which consists of a potentially infinite array of very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful computers, each of which is separate, and dedicated to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique virtual realities for each of us individuals, in accordance to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type of life we wish to have. The computes would be connected to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, and the human bodies maintained by other individuals (this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially could be especially attractive for those who have a wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retirement plans, and difficulties to move one's own body). However, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long run, the target would be to have robots to maintain the computers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human bodies. The robots would repair, replace and improve these computers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as take care of their safety, and supply of resources, as we (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth) would all travel across the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming that we create robots could ensure our existence with very high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty, our action or inaction would have no significant effect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensuring our survival, and we would have the freedom to live lives in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds that we prefer, which would be limited only by he computational power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of each computer simulating an individualâ€™s world. The goal that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conglomerate of computers, robots and people would pursue, is to convert the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe into a structure that allows existence of every conceivable entity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the full expression of its dreams, and with or without the awareness that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there exists an outside world that ensures the stability and quality of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner (simulated)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully, this would allow mankind to cooperate on a completely new level,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of what individual values they have, because this would be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure that preserves the values, dream-worlds of us all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, we have movies (and some interactive movies) that already allow us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to experience a glimpse of the beauty of various dream-worlds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the realisation of many-worlds idea would allow us, is to preserve our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient, modern and our newly created worlds, cultures, with their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beauty,  in the array of wonderlands, which we could live in, without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear of extinction of us, or any of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think, you have the resources and technology to start experimenting with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this today.
