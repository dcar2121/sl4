<p>
I will list some observations then some theories which try to explain them,
<br>
including my Gravity For Patterns theory which explains the Copenhagen
<br>
Interpretation of quantum physics as an approximation of the most infinite
<br>
version of Manyworlds.
<br>
<p>DEFINITION: Laws-of-physics is the statistical behavior of a subset of the
<br>
universe, usually the subset closest to Earth.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: The only known laws-of-physics is very accurately approximated by
<br>
small math equations.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: The only known laws-of-physics has arbitrary-appearing (not like pi
<br>
or e or integers) constants in its equations.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: The only known laws-of-physics has never been observed changing
<br>
(same equations), or only a small amount.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: When in superposition, 1 particle/wave can be in thousands of
<br>
places at once without being between those places, and when 1 of those thousands
<br>
of places is touched, 1 gets more dense and the others get less dense.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: Quantum wavefunctions can be split by a half-mirror and reassembled
<br>
by the same process in reverse at a different half-mirror. Its branches can
<br>
cancel each other out or strengthen each other, depending on the angles and
<br>
number of bounces etc.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: More often than would happen randomly or through normal
<br>
communication or observing the environment etc, there are small statistical
<br>
dependencies between the brains of people and/or quantum physics devices. See
<br>
the &quot;main results&quot; list at <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu">http://noosphere.princeton.edu</a> for the results of
<br>
those experiments.
<br>
<p>OBSERVATION: The E8 math structure very accurately approximates the only known
<br>
laws-of-physics. It is many rotations of a 57-dimensional shape in
<br>
248-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a quantum particle/wave
<br>
type. There are levels of organization built on top of levels between 248
<br>
particle types (including some not observed) and the small number of types at
<br>
the top of the Standard Model.
<br>
<p>THEORY (by Max Tegmark): &quot;All structures that exist mathematically exist also
<br>
physically.&quot;
<br>
<p>LOGIC: If Tegmark is right then: For any subset of the universe, there are an
<br>
infinite number of unique ways to simulate that subset and recursively
<br>
simulations of simulations to infinite depth, all averaging to nothing because
<br>
of the symmetry of math.
<br>
<p>DEFINITION: Pattern is any subset of math. A wavefunction or any subset of it is
<br>
a pattern. A statistical similarity between 2 patterns or subsets of them is a
<br>
pattern.
<br>
<p><p><p>THEORY &quot;Gravity For Patterns&quot;: The universe is the set of all possible
<br>
wavefunctions of patterns instead of simply wavefunctions of particles/waves,
<br>
and patterns attract patterns more when they are more similar.
<br>
<p><p><p>LOGIC: If Gravity For Patterns is right then: Collapsing a wavefunction is the
<br>
superpositioned parts falling toward each other, pulled by the mostly-collapsed
<br>
parts (the parts of reality they agree on) being similar patterns. The E8 shape
<br>
is 1 of many possible shapes, and (possibly, but not necessarily practical) new
<br>
shapes can be rotated in while E8 is gradually rotated out, to locally change
<br>
the laws-of-physics to any arbitrary pattern you can amplify through
<br>
chaos-theory.
<br>
<p>THEORY: The &quot;statistical dependencies between the brains of people and/or
<br>
quantum physics devices&quot; are caused by such a rotation between E8 and whatever
<br>
pattern fits the combination of brainwaves/devices which become statistically
<br>
dependent, and that is probable to happen because infinite recursions of
<br>
&quot;Gravity For Patterns&quot; (patterns about patterns attracting) will pattern-match
<br>
any 2 patterns in 2 brains and ***exponentially*** increase the chance such
<br>
patterns will connect through the multiverse. Its exponential because the
<br>
recursion of patterns always finds an effective path between the 2 patterns. It
<br>
finds an infinite number of other things, but the gravity part gradually changes
<br>
that, and a small change goes exponential because of the recursion.
<br>
<p>Gravity For Patterns is a theory of everything, including how the
<br>
laws-of-physics form and how to locally change them using small amounts of
<br>
energy and large amounts of intelligence.
