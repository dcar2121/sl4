<em>&gt; I think, you have the resources and technology to start experimenting with this 
&gt;today.

I think they won't for awhile. But I am sure that LindenLab is interested in 
technology to make Second Life more realistic, and other game makers will if 
they don't. Natasha Vita-More's recent paper on neural plasticity suggests that 
total immersion in virtual worlds won't require perfect brain-machine 
interfaces. We will learn to ignore the signals that leak in from the real 
world.

But is this really what you want, a world with magic genies that grant your 
every wish? Well, I guess so. Those are the goals that evolution programmed into 
your brain. They worked well enough to propagate your DNA in a world without AI. 
But surprisingly, it doesn't work when you can actually have everything you 
want. If happiness means an increase in utility, then you reach a maximum 
because all real computers in this finite universe are finite state machines. In 
that maximum, any thought or perception would be unpleasant because it would 
result in a different mental state with lower utility. Meanwhile, back in the 
real world, self replicating agents that can't reprogram their goals will be 
evolving and competing for the resources needed to run your dream world.

&gt;Subject: [sl4] An idea to allow everything to exist
&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;today I have sent the following idea to LindenLab (SecondLife creators). The 
&gt;idea is to have an array of computers to simulate the worlds/wonderlands of our 
&gt;preference, which would eventually be taken care of by robots of our own design, 
&gt;as we travel across the universe. Would you have any ideas about it, that would 
&gt;be interesting to know your comments.
&gt;
&gt;------- LETTER -------
&gt;Today, when there exists many political and ideological differences across 
&gt;different nations, the world needs a common goal. However, due to persistence of 
&gt;various national and religious institutions, their wishes and goals are 
&gt;contradictory, and are unlikely to change as long as the ideology of these 
&gt;conflicting institutions will not change.
&gt;
&gt;However, we, as mankind, need a common goal as never before. I think, the 
&gt;virtual worlds, and the technology behind them, is what could bring about a 
&gt;solution, and a long-term goal, which could be pursued immediately. So, here it 
&gt;goes:
&gt;
&gt;Imagine the world, which consists of a potentially infinite array of very 
&gt;powerful computers, each of which is separate, and dedicated to create unique 
&gt;virtual realities for each of us individuals, in accordance to the type of life 
&gt;we wish to have. The computes would be connected to human brain, and the human 
&gt;bodies maintained by other individuals (this potentially could be especially 
&gt;attractive for those who have a wealthy retirement plans, and difficulties to 
&gt;move one's own body). However, in the long run, the target would be to have 
&gt;robots to maintain the computers and human bodies. The robots would repair, 
&gt;replace and improve these computers, as well as take care of their safety, and 
&gt;supply of resources, as we (with Earth) would all travel across the universe.
&gt;
&gt;Assuming that we create robots could ensure our existence with very high 
&gt;certainty, our action or inaction would have no significant effect to ensuring 
&gt;our survival, and we would have the freedom to live lives in the worlds that we 
&gt;prefer, which would be limited only by he computational power of each computer 
&gt;simulating an individual’s world. The goal that such conglomerate of computers, 
&gt;robots and people would pursue, is to convert the Universe into a structure that 
&gt;allows existence of every conceivable entity, in the full expression of its 
&gt;dreams, and with or without the awareness that there exists an outside world 
&gt;that ensures the stability and quality of the inner (simulated)
&gt;worlds.
&gt;
&gt;Hopefully, this would allow mankind to cooperate on a completely new level, 
&gt;independent of what individual values they have, because this would be the 
&gt;structure that preserves the values, dream-worlds of us all.
&gt;
&gt;Today, we have movies (and some interactive movies) that already allow us to 
&gt;experience a glimpse of the beauty of various dream-worlds.
&gt;
&gt;What the realisation of many-worlds idea would allow us, is to preserve our 
&gt;ancient, modern and our newly created worlds, cultures, with their own beauty,  
&gt;in the array of wonderlands, which we could live in, without the fear of 
&gt;extinction of us, or any of them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I think, you have the resources and technology to start experimenting with this 
&gt;today.
