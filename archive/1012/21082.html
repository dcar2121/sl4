Hello,
<br>
<p>today I have sent the following idea to LindenLab (SecondLife creators). The
<br>
idea is to have an array of computers to simulate the worlds/wonderlands of
<br>
our preference, which would eventually be taken care of by robots of our own
<br>
design, as we travel across the universe. Would you have any ideas about it,
<br>
that would be interesting to know your comments.
<br>
<p>------- LETTER -------
<br>
Today, when there exists many political and ideological differences across
<br>
different nations, the world needs a common goal. However, due to
<br>
persistence of various national and religious institutions, their wishes and
<br>
goals are contradictory, and are unlikely to change as long as the ideology
<br>
of these conflicting institutions will not change.
<br>
<p>However, we, as mankind, need a common goal as never before. I think, the
<br>
virtual worlds, and the technology behind them, is what could bring about a
<br>
solution, and a long-term goal, which could be pursued immediately. So, here
<br>
it goes:
<br>
<p>Imagine the world, which consists of a potentially infinite array of very
<br>
powerful computers, each of which is separate, and dedicated to create
<br>
unique virtual realities for each of us individuals, in accordance to the
<br>
type of life we wish to have. The computes would be connected to human
<br>
brain, and the human bodies maintained by other individuals (this
<br>
potentially could be especially attractive for those who have a wealthy
<br>
retirement plans, and difficulties to move one's own body). However, in the
<br>
long run, the target would be to have robots to maintain the computers and
<br>
human bodies. The robots would repair, replace and improve these computers,
<br>
as well as take care of their safety, and supply of resources, as we (with
<br>
Earth) would all travel across the universe.
<br>
<p>Assuming that we create robots could ensure our existence with very high
<br>
certainty, our action or inaction would have no significant effect to
<br>
ensuring our survival, and we would have the freedom to live lives in the
<br>
worlds that we prefer, which would be limited only by he computational power
<br>
of each computer simulating an individual’s world. The goal that such
<br>
conglomerate of computers, robots and people would pursue, is to convert the
<br>
Universe into a structure that allows existence of every conceivable entity,
<br>
in the full expression of its dreams, and with or without the awareness that
<br>
there exists an outside world that ensures the stability and quality of the
<br>
inner (simulated)
<br>
worlds.
<br>
<p>Hopefully, this would allow mankind to cooperate on a completely new level,
<br>
independent of what individual values they have, because this would be the
<br>
structure that preserves the values, dream-worlds of us all.
<br>
<p>Today, we have movies (and some interactive movies) that already allow us to
<br>
experience a glimpse of the beauty of various dream-worlds.
<br>
<p>What the realisation of many-worlds idea would allow us, is to preserve our
<br>
ancient, modern and our newly created worlds, cultures, with their own
<br>
beauty,  in the array of wonderlands, which we could live in, without the
<br>
fear of extinction of us, or any of them.
<br>
<p><p>I think, you have the resources and technology to start experimenting with
<br>
this today.
<br>
