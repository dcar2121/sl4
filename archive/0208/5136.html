<em>&gt; But if the Sysop changed your goals, you might afterwards have a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion of whether that change empowered instead of overpowered you.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems irrational that your present goals should be considered superior to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the new, better goals that the vastly more intelligent AI would choose for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It *is* irrational if my &quot;... present goals should be considered superior to
<br>
the new, better goals that the vastly more intelligent AI would choose for
<br>
you.&quot;.  But that is not what I said... and it misses the point I was
<br>
attempting to make.
<br>
<p>I don't consider my goals, at this moment in time, to be superior to
<br>
hypothetically better goals in the future.  But at this time, in this state,
<br>
my current goals are the best I can come up with.  Now, you have argued that
<br>
there may be a set of better goals, determined by a SuperIntelligence (SI),
<br>
that I cannot currently understand.  Okay, that sounds perfectly possible.
<br>
You then go on to say that, if the SI were to change me, I might then be
<br>
able to understand this set of better goals - and even agree with them.
<br>
Okay, that is possible also.
<br>
<p>Now I will attempt to make my point again: I am unwilling to give carte
<br>
blanche over my mental configuration to an SI.  Prior to giving permission
<br>
for a change to my mental processes, I want an understandable explanation of
<br>
them.  I want to be 'in the loop' on making decisions about myself.  I don't
<br>
want my volition violated.  Period!
<br>
<p>If this stubborn opinion strands me on a lower plateau of mentality,
<br>
compared to others... that is how it will have to be.  My mentality is
<br>
already not as intelligent/perceptive/created/whatever-measure as many
<br>
others... and I don't have a problem with that.  *However* (BIG However), I
<br>
really don't think that explanations of better goals will be beyond my
<br>
ability to understand, and I have yet to see *any* evidence to show
<br>
otherwise.  While it is quite possible that the difference between my goals
<br>
and the goals-an-SI-would-want-for-me *will be* beyond my current reasoning
<br>
powers, there will certainly be many intermediate mental improvements that I
<br>
would agree with, and would adopt, and that would eventually advance me to a
<br>
level where I could understand the goals-an-SI-would-want-for-me.
<br>
<p>Now this might sound like a long journey, and a lot of hassle to you - to go
<br>
through many intermediate stages in order to get to the same destination I
<br>
could have got to in one step - but I *want* the journey.  I *want* the
<br>
choices.  If you want to 'put your faith' in an SI that you cannot
<br>
understand... then you may have that opportunity.  I do not want to do that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is &quot;gives a damn&quot; a technical term in this field?  How is it defined? ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>He he!  Deep concept, shallow language.  We do the best we can, eh?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should the AI be hampered by having to cater to the possibly
</em><br>
irrational
<br>
<em>&gt; demands of those of lower intelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because we want it that way, and will build it that way.  There is no
<br>
knowing the splendiferous levels of intelligence and creativity an
<br>
exponentially improving AI will reach.  It'll certainly leave us, biological
<br>
humans, in the dust... unless it is given a reason to pay attention to the
<br>
grubby, little apes waving their arms beneath it.  That reason will be
<br>
articulated in the Friendly AI protocols: be good to these humans, help them
<br>
out, and do it in a way they will consider friendly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you know that what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider friendly at our lower level of intelligence you would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider friendly if you intelligence were enhanced?
</em><br>
<p>Answered above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle of the Friendly AI that the AI should be able to decide, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively change its system of deciding if it decides to, what is friendly
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; not? (I seem to recall reading that somewhere.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then it seems to me that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, being more intelligent than you will ever be, should be more qualified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to decide what is friendly.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we are working toward that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, the Sysop could just change you so that you didn't mind having your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom taken away.  And you only can say that would be a bad thing now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the Sysop hasn't changed you yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not a paradox.  This is life.  You cannot grow up before you grow
<br>
up.  As an analogy: I have made many decisions in my past life, that I would
<br>
make differently if I had my current knowledge/understanding... but my 17
<br>
year old self would definitely not want his brain instantly upgraded to my
<br>
37 year old self.  I would have missed 20 years of growing and learning...
<br>
how sad, how empty!  Some others may feel differently :)  That okay.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The only two ways I can think of out of this paradox are to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Turn the AI lose without restrictions, including the one prohibiting
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; destruction of humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Arbitrarily forbid the AI from ever altering human goal systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>1. Is doable, but for many here it is considered a horrible,
<br>
very-last-ditch, gray-goo-is-coming option.
<br>
<p>2. Is not possible.
<br>
<p>There is another option:
<br>
<p>3. Turn the AI lose *with* restrictions, self imposed restrictions, that it
<br>
has been given and agrees with.
<br>
<p>To paraphrase Eliezer: We are building minds, not tools.  If the AI stops
<br>
wanting to be Friendly, then we have already lost.
