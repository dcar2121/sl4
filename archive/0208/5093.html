<p>No... my problem has not been that I believe nothing is meaningful, but
<br>
rather that I have not felt that I could competently explain why anything
<br>
should be reasonable.  In other words, my stubbornly clinging to support of
<br>
things like Friendly AI -- or anything at all -- has seemed, to me, a bit
<br>
irrational.  But I suppose I have to anchor myself to something, somewhere,
<br>
for the reasons you so directly describe:  it IS a rot on the mind to do
<br>
otherwise.  So if only for pragmatic reasons, I will continue to value those
<br>
things that I see as the highest voluntary manifestations of *human* virtue,
<br>
and extend my lines of rational reasoning from these.  I am currently
<br>
incapable of thought processes outside of my human brain's design
<br>
limitations anyway.
<br>
<p>But it does beg the interesting, if frightening question of what happens
<br>
when a Friendly SI from human space runs into the Friendly SI for Kzin
<br>
space.  Friendliness as referenced to human moral perspective may look very
<br>
different from Friendliness referenced to Kzin morality.
