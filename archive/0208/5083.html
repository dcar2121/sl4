<p>I think this is a false distinction.  I think that rationality means
<br>
rational behavior.
<br>
<p>There may be many different psychological processes, in different minds,
<br>
resulting in similar rational behaviors.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't see *eliminating* my own irrationality as a viable prospect,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course you cannot eliminate it from you completely without cutting

<em>&gt; notice; your mind doesn't know the difference between ignoring and not

</em><br>
<p>I think that if you simply *consciously ignore* the large irrational
<br>
components of your mind, they are going to end up strongly influencing you
<br>
unconsciously.  I think it's better to explicitly come to grips with them.
<br>
Ignoring them, in my view, is likely to lead to what Freud called
<br>
&quot;sublimation&quot; of them.   [And no, I don't believe most of Freudian
<br>
psychology.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only difference between the `conscious'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and `unconscious' parts of your brain are that the former allow for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback on the process of thought, whereas the latter only allow for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback on the results.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a very naive psychological statement.
<br>
<p>In fact, I think it's an *irrational* statement ;)
<br>
<p>It is a statement that constradicts many known facts of cognitive
<br>
psychology.
<br>
<p>I feel you are making this statement with such confidence because you would
<br>
*like* it to be true.
<br>
<p>Is it rational to hold such a strong belief based on such little evidence,
<br>
when you're educated enough to realize there is empirical evidence on such
<br>
topics, right there in the library for your reading pleasure?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I've seen you each make many judgments that seemed to me purely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotional...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which decisions were those?
</em><br>
<p>One example is your habit of making strong statements about human
<br>
psychology, which also happen to contradict known psychological facts.
<br>
<p>Now, I'm not saying that you make these statements explicitly KNOWING that
<br>
they contradict known psychological facts.
<br>
<p>But I can't understand why you would think it was rational to hold and
<br>
assert such strong beliefs based purely on your anecdotal experience and
<br>
intuition, when you know full well there is a whole field of scientific
<br>
psychology out there, that might well contradict your anecdotal experience
<br>
and intuition (and has done so before, for instance refuting your asserted
<br>
intuition that passivity and rationality are correlated).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Interestingly, though, I have not yet met anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) seemed to me to be more rational than myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) also seemed to me to be roughly as creative as myself -- or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *almost*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as creative as myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My use of the correspondence theory of truth indicates otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand what you're saying here.
<br>
<p>Rationality does not generate ideas all that effectively, though it can test
<br>
and analyze ideas what they exist very effectively; and it can incrementally
<br>
extend existing ideas.
<br>
<p>Some forms of irrationality are good at creating new ideas, but bad at
<br>
testing, analyzing and refining them.
<br>
<p>Thus rationality works well in conjunction with some irrational thought
<br>
processes, which involve various types of quasirandom concept creation.
<br>
<p>The most brilliant scientists have generally combined intensely effective
<br>
rationality with quirky but effective nonrational thought processes...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I believe that high levels of creativity often go along with willful or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; automatic suspensions of rationality.  (Of course, this may be rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meta level: one may find that it is rational to sometimes let yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrational!)  But when a mind spends a lot of  &quot;creative time&quot; pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unlikely, irrational trains of thought, it often has difficulty shifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; back into a less creative but more rational mode.  I have seen this in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many others, as well as myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Irrational thinking can generate ideas that are later useful in rational
<br>
thinking.  This is a subjective impression held by many many people and
<br>
quite thoroughly researched.
