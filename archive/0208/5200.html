Michael Roy Ames wrote regarding the path to transhumanity:
<br>
<p><p>Now this might sound like a long journey, and a lot of hassle to you - to go
<br>
through many intermediate stages in order to get to the same destination I
<br>
could have got to in one step - but I *want* the journey.  I *want* the
<br>
choices.  If you want to 'put your faith' in an SI that you cannot
<br>
understand... then you may have that opportunity.  I do not want to do that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not a paradox.  This is life.  You cannot grow up before you grow
<br>
up.  As an analogy: I have made many decisions in my past life, that I would
<br>
make differently if I had my current knowledge/understanding... but my 17
<br>
year old self would definitely not want his brain instantly upgraded to my
<br>
37 year old self.  I would have missed 20 years of growing and learning...
<br>
how sad, how empty!  Some others may feel differently :)  That okay.
<br>
<p>### I see some interesting analogies between the ideas you use here and the
<br>
perennial copy/identity debate. As you surely know, there are two main camps
<br>
in that tussle - the continuists and the structuralists. The former perceive
<br>
only objects spatiotemporally continuous with their present physical
<br>
manifestation to be &quot;self&quot;. A perfect copy produced tomorrow from a snapshot
<br>
of their cognition is not self. They don't want to be instantaneously copied
<br>
and transmitted (as a stream of bits) to a new planet and faraway future
<br>
even if the Sun was going red dwarf on them right now, because there is no
<br>
&quot;continuity&quot;. The structuralists (like me) perceive any objects
<br>
substantially identical to my present abode (a-body :-)) to be parts of
<br>
self, even if there is no bodily continuity.
<br>
<p>To demand to have all intermediate steps explained and to accept/physically
<br>
experience them your on your way to transcension is a continuist position.
<br>
You reject a transhuman progeny if you know ve is the product of the FAI
<br>
directly molding your neural pathways, even if the outcome is the same as
<br>
what you might have reached the hard way, all the way down to implanted
<br>
memories.
<br>
<p>The structuralist position would be to define allowable neural
<br>
transformations and accept the FAI's judgment in their implementation. Of
<br>
course, not all such transformations are compatible with our goal systems -
<br>
e.g. ripping out all your memories and substituting something else would be
<br>
rejected by almost all humans, since this would be a direct contradiction of
<br>
the prime directives of our inborn self definition /self preservation
<br>
circuitry. In fact, most of us would feel justified in seeing it as proof of
<br>
massive FoF. Also, we tend to take a very dim view of mind control - in the
<br>
ancestral environment those who let themselves be too easily controlled
<br>
didn't make it to maturity.
<br>
<p>I must say my own position is somewhat ambivalent - although I can conceive
<br>
of the FAI as bereft of any of the nasty tendencies that could make psychic
<br>
engineering done by humans a likely nightmare, I still would prefer
<br>
conscious continuity over instantaneous transition. Yet, if we were under
<br>
dire attack by some evil and powerful entities and the only option of
<br>
preserving my (however tenuously the word &quot;my&quot; were to apply here) upload's
<br>
existence was the Big Jump, I'd ask the FAI to help me take it.
