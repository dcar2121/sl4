<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything that works is a form of rationality; works because it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational; and is rational because it works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be precise, everything that works noncoincidentally, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater than sheer random chance would predict, is a form of rationality;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works because it is rational; and is rational because it works.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that is one definition of the term &quot;rationality.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, it's a very general definition....  It certainly does not match the
<br>
standard dictionary definition, and I think it doesn't match the
<br>
common-language definition.
<br>
<p>If we accept your definition, we then need another word for the process of
<br>
&quot;conscious rational thought&quot;, which is only one kind of &quot;rationality&quot;
<br>
according to your definition.
<br>
<p>Anyway, it seems to me the really deep question is: **In what circumstances
<br>
do processes that in themselves appear to have nothing to do with reasoning,
<br>
serve as a valuable or even critical part of &quot;rationality&quot; in the overall
<br>
context of an intelligent system?**
<br>
<p>My conjectural answer is:
<br>
<p>-- Definitely, in circumstances involving badly limited computational
<br>
resources (e.g. the human brain)
<br>
-- Maybe, in all circumstances
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The visual cortex is a form of rationality.
</em><br>
<p>If so, it's a badly flawed form, due to errors like I mentioned
<br>
(misestimating the distance to faraway objects in the desert...).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what the Bayesian Probability Theorem *is* - a *universal*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the way in which things can be evidence about other things.
</em><br>
<p>This seems to me to be a large overstatement.
<br>
<p>Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool (and one of the central parts of the
<br>
Novamente reasoning module).
<br>
<p>However, like the rest of elementary probability theory, it pertains to a
<br>
set of probabilities defined over a fixed &quot;universal set.&quot;
<br>
<p>Defining the universal set is a serious issue in any practical situation.
<br>
You can say &quot;define it as the set of all entities ever observed by the mind
<br>
doing the reasoning&quot;.  But this doesn't really work, because we *hear* about
<br>
entities via linguistic communication, including many entities we haven't
<br>
seen.  I may want to include Beijing in my universal set for my internal
<br>
probabilistic inference, even though I have never been there or seen it.
<br>
<p>So then you can't rationally posit a mind that operates only using
<br>
elementary probability theory.  You must have two processes in a mind, at
<br>
least:
<br>
<p>-- probabilistic inference (implemented in one of a huge number of possible
<br>
ways)
<br>
-- a process for defining the universal set (either once and for all, or
<br>
contextually)
<br>
<p>But then how does this second process take place?  If you say it takes place
<br>
by prob. inference you get a regress.  But if not, you must posit some other
<br>
process, and you must admit that the conclusions of the prob. inference
<br>
(logical reasoning) will be relative to the operation of this other process,
<br>
rather than &quot;objectively rational&quot; (if rationality, to you, is defined by
<br>
the laws of probability theory).
<br>
<p>Probability theory is a tool minds use.  If a mind is inept at using
<br>
*noninferential* methods to appropriately define the universal set for
<br>
itself (and in reality, the appropriate universal set is often
<br>
*context-dependent*), it may use this tool accurately but uselessly (i.e.
<br>
unintelligently).
<br>
<p>Probability theory is an important component of intelligence, but not the
<br>
be-all and end-all of intelligence.  Whether it's viewed as the &quot;core&quot; of
<br>
intelligence or not is largely a matter of taste... mind seems in a way to
<br>
be &quot;multi-cored&quot; ;)
