<p><em>&gt; Firstly, Gordon, I would like to invite you to define or describe what

<p>Okay, I'm going to try to do this.  This is a bit like asking a Buddha 
<br>
to define enlightenment, though.  :-P
<br>
<p>Rationality is a qualitative change in thinking.  It is characterized by 
<br>
the consistent use of logical thought and Bayesian reasoning and the 
<br>
disuse of evolved thinking (in all it's forms:  intuition as it is 
<br>
commonly understood, rationalization, pseudo logic, etc.).  You 
<br>
eliminate all irrational thought, and what is left is pure rationality.
<br>
<p>Maybe now you see why any use of irrational thinking bothers me.  Sure, 
<br>
you can keep using irrational thought processes, but you will only ever 
<br>
gain so much rationality, and it will be tenuous since you are 
<br>
maintaining a tie to irrational thoughts when you know that you should 
<br>
be trying to eliminate them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Secondly, I think everyone understands that rationality is a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I sometimes see comments that suggest otherwise, so I want to be 
<br>
sure that it's clear.  Even if you're clear on it, someone else on the 
<br>
list might not be (I think that we're probably talking above the heads 
<br>
of most of the list, but I could be wrong).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What Samantha and I seem to both be arguing, is that there are large and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful portions of the brain which this particular way of thinking does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage.  And there are other, complementary, nonrational ways of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are also highly worthwhile.
</em><br>
<p>They produce usable results sometimes.  This does not mean this is the 
<br>
most efficient use of your brain.
