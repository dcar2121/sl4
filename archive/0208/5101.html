A good deal of this was already covered in my replay to Ben.  This is 
<br>
the stuff that I think is substantially different, but if there was 
<br>
anything I did not discuss fully in that reply, e-mail me privately and 
<br>
I'll respond to the sections that you think need more emphasis on list.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In many aspects of our lives, including mundante things like safely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crossing the street, it is crucial that a great deal of processing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens quickly and unconsciously and that it is not second-guessed - 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, IIRC, already discussed this somewhere, probably in CFAI.  In 
<br>
short, an AI does not need quick response heuristics like humans do 
<br>
because it can think through each situation when it occurs because it 
<br>
can think much faster than a human assuming it has adequate hardware.  
<br>
For example, I have to have rules to act on quickly when I'm crossing 
<br>
the street.  An AI would have enough time to think through crossing the 
<br>
street without resorting to canned responses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that high levels of creativity often go along with willful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; automatic suspensions of rationality.  (Of course, this may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; rational on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; meta level: one may find that it is rational to sometimes let 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; irrational!)  But when a mind spends a lot of  &quot;creative time&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; unlikely, irrational trains of thought, it often has difficulty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; shifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; back into a less creative but more rational mode.  I have seen this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; in very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; many others, as well as myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thinking.  In fact, I've taken this to the extreme and, in cases of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anxiety attacks, have shut down thought since I can't think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rationally.  This is different than pursuing merely interesting trains 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of thought, though.  I will spend time considering interesting ideas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with no goal of how to use them because it's fun and interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds more similar to the results certain meditation techniques 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of always keeping a &quot;witness&quot; or simply always paying attention to what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going on in the mind without being dragged away by its contents.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This I agree is valuable although I would not go so far as to imply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daydreams are all of no use.  There are many types of things called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;daydreams&quot;.  Some mediate between the conscious mind and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconscious processing. Some of those are quite valuable.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'm very bad a meditation.  I'm getting better, but I have a 
<br>
hard time quieting my mind but it's getting easier; my trick is to find 
<br>
some way to blow my thoughts up.
<br>
<p>Anyway, feedback-less thoughts are important and I use them all of the 
<br>
time to solve hard problems (it just takes a couple of days).  I would 
<br>
not say, though, that I day dream in any sense of the word that I know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Of course, my REM dreams are quite different.  There's a special 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dream `logic' that is at play there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you aware within your dreams?  I notice that when I meditate  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly steadily for a while that most of my dreams are lucid and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is more of a quality of watching them unfold.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I always know that I'm dreaming, but they are very lucid.  They 
<br>
are also worth watching.  I think this is credited to my practicing 
<br>
Falun Gong.
