</em><br>
<p>It will take a while to untangle exactly how, but I think 
<br>
Eliezer is guilty of Bayesian abuse.

<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; For instance, a bird, acting purely on instinct, is acting rationally

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it mates with another bird, because it's acting in a way that &quot;works&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terms of achieving its goal of reproducing itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what way does this have nothing to do with reasoning?  It is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product of evolution's version of induction.  Furthermore, the fact that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting in this way will increase the probability of reproduction is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite knowable to a Bayesian reasoner.  A perfect Bayesian reasoner 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might use a more optimal method of reproduction, but an imperfect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian reasoner might end up employing exactly this method.  Because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution *is* that kind of imperfect reasoner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Heh, it doesn't have anything to do with reasoning.  It was you 
<br>
who earlier claimed that everything that works is &quot;rational&quot;. 
<br>
It is you who claimed that evolutionary products are by 
<br>
definition rational.
<br>
<p>Can you directly support the implied claim that all real 
<br>
reasoning (substitute your doubtless better phraises here) is 
<br>
bayesian or covered by BPT?  I see you asserting this but it 
<br>
does not strike me as obviously true or yet directly argued for 
<br>
much less proved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I generally have been using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; narrower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Basically, to mean &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot;, meaning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; process inside some mind in which premises are represented, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conclusions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; represented, and processes for getting from the premises to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conclusions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are carried out.  Note that this sense of &quot;following a process of logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inference&quot; is implementation-independent; it applies to neural nets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; forth as easily as to minds embodying some sort of explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; symbol-manipulation component.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  And because you use &quot;rational&quot; to denote only this kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, you can get away with telling yourself that &quot;both 'rationality' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 'irrationality' are necessary to thought&quot;, thereby avoiding the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessity of getting rid of comforting irrational thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This talk of &quot;getting away with&quot; and avoiding getting rid of 
<br>
&quot;conforting&quot; irrational thoughts is an invention out of whole 
<br>
cloth.  It begs the question of whether some of the definitions 
<br>
of &quot;rational&quot; used or implied are in fact rational and whether 
<br>
some things some speakers claim are irrational or at least 
<br>
arational are not essential aspects of 
<br>
thinking/learning/knowing. It may be your opinion but you have 
<br>
not justified it nor justified that persons arguing these claims 
<br>
are doing it because they find them &quot;comforting&quot;.  I find this 
<br>
line distasteful as it seems to border on ad-hominem or some 
<br>
kind of more rational than thou thrust.
