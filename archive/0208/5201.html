<p><p>Well, my subjective impression is that Dick's hallucinations of a

super-rational AI feeding information into his brain, were pretty damn

irrational.  I feel the same way about his conviction that we actually live
<br>
in the time of 100AD or so, but are deluded into thinking we live around
<br>
2000 AD instead.  I think the guy was half-nuts, to use a technical term...
<br>
<p>Personally, I will call this stuff irrational, not just non-rational ;)
<br>
<p>### I agree with you. He was nuts but it didn't prevent him from writing
<br>
entertaining prose. The delusions were irrational, since, as far as I can
<br>
tell, they would lead him to make decisions which would not allow him to
<br>
achieve his goals (e.g. might induce him to start a special diet, needed to
<br>
maintain communion with his imaginary friend, and this might be in conflict
<br>
with his goal of staying alive). In fact, if you consider a larger number of
<br>
persons with similar beliefs, their ability to achieve their goals is
<br>
severely limited. He was just likely there was enough rationality left in
<br>
his mind to prevent a bad outcome. The reliable goal-failure of the patterns
<br>
of thought that Dick exhibited is why we call them irrational (an occasional
<br>
mad genius notwithstanding).
<br>
<p>It is the preponderance of cases (psychiatric ones included) that shapes our
<br>
perception of rationality.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>I suppose that, as part of our ability to learn regularities in reality, we
<br>
have emerged a strong capability to create complex hypothetical concepts --
<br>
which may then be tested to see if they reflect regularities in reality.
<br>
<p>### You expressed one of the ideas  which is applied to explain
<br>
schizophrenia - a failure of reality testing (implemented in the damaged
<br>
prefrontal cortex) with intact generative functions of other parts of the
<br>
brain.
