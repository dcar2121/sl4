<p>Well, learning to see the BPT beneath the surface of all nonaccidental
<br>
successes is a skill that takes some work.  Generally, you look for the
<br>
reason why something works, say &quot;X is evidence about Y for reason Z&quot;, or
<br>
&quot;X correlates to Y for reason Z&quot;, and then, poof, it's governed by the
<br>
BPT.  In that sense you might call it a tautology... but it's a very
<br>
powerful, very useful tautology, especially if you've previously been
<br>
thinking of all the surface manifestations of the BPT as different things.
<br>
<p>If you like, consider it a challenge:  Name a nonaccidental success, and
<br>
I'll show you how it's rational or why rationality lies beneath its surface.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Yes.  And because you use &quot;rational&quot; to denote only this kind of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This talk of &quot;getting away with&quot; and avoiding getting rid of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;conforting&quot; irrational thoughts is an invention out of whole cloth.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It begs the question of whether some of the definitions of &quot;rational&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; used or implied are in fact rational and whether some things some
</em><br>
<em> &gt; speakers claim are irrational or at least arational are not essential
</em><br>
<em> &gt; aspects of thinking/learning/knowing.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  Maybe the question ought to be asked, and answered?  Do you think
<br>
the definition I'm using of &quot;rational&quot; is irrational, and if so, why?  Do
<br>
you think that something I've called &quot;arational&quot; is an essential aspect of
<br>
thinking, and if so, why?  (Note that if it is, then the BPT is underneath
<br>
it somewhere, and I was wrong to call it &quot;arational&quot;...  If you have a
<br>
nonaccidental success that you think is *not* governed by the BPT, drag it
<br>
out and let my BPT-detectors give it a sniff.)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; It may be your opinion but you have not justified it nor justified that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; persons arguing these claims are doing it because they find them
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;comforting&quot;.  I find this line distasteful as it seems to border on
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ad-hominem or some kind of more rational than thou thrust.
</em><br>
<p>The social reaction to all this is straightforward, and predictable... but
<br>
all people are *not* equally rational.  There's nothing implausible about 
<br>
the thought that some people might be more rational than other people. 
<br>
Choosing to speak those thoughts openly is a choice that I've made under 
<br>
my own goals, of course, but part of those goals is learning to treat 
<br>
thoughts as representative of truth, and not just means for manipulating 
<br>
other people... so if thoughts are just representative of truth, why would 
<br>
truths about which people are more rational than other people be special? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's obvious that they have a special status in social interactions. 
<br>
But since I know about that, to care about it would require a special 
<br>
decision.  Maybe it makes more sense to just pursue the truth as far as it 
<br>
goes.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, if Ben succeeds in building an AI and I do not, it would not 
<br>
be the least bit unusual to suggest that Ben was enormously more rational 
<br>
than I, as an enabling factor in his being able to do that.  The converse 
<br>
is also true.  Among those who dare attempt to meddle in the Singularity 
<br>
it is neither unlikely nor unexpected that enormous differentials in 
<br>
rationality might exist.  I think that a sufficiently rational mind, even 
<br>
a human mind, should be able to reason about this as an ordinary fact. 
<br>
Perhaps I am mistaken.
