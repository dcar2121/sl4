</em><br>

<em>&gt;I don't consider the goal of continuous improving life to be in the least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;petty&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot;.  Do you?
</em><br>
<p>But your idea of what is &quot;improving&quot; or not, is determined by your current 
<br>
goal system.  If they were changed by the Sysop, you might think 
<br>
differently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you believe it is the right of any brighter being that comes along to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rewrite all &quot;lesser&quot; beings in whatever matter it chooses or to destroy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them?  Do you believe it should be?
</em><br>
<p>I can only determine if it would be a right now according to my current 
<br>
goals.  I might think differently if I had different goals.  And there is no 
<br>
reason to believe that my current goals are the best possible goals - the 
<br>
superior intelligence of the AI would likely be able to think up better ones 
<br>
for me to have.  It doesn't seem rational to impose a limitation on the AI 
<br>
of it not being able to alter us in certain ways just because we are too 
<br>
primitive to realize we are being helped and not harmed, until after we are 
<br>
altered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you are helping to design such a being (or that which becomes such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being) would you consider it just &quot;petty&quot; to look for a way to encourage it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be a help to human beings rather their doom?
</em><br>
<p>The concept of what are &quot;help&quot; and &quot;doom&quot; are determined by your current 
<br>
goals, which you have no reason other than the influence of those same goals 
<br>
to believe they are superior or even preferable to other goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you believe it shows superior intellect to consider the well being of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humanity as mere petty pre-programmed meaninglessness?

<p>I don't think I'm qualified to answer that question until after I sublime
