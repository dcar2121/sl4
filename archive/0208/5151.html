<p>
I'd like to enlarge a little on a point I made earlier.
<br>
<p>At the end of this e-mail is an example of a mathematical theorem from
<br>
probabilistic inference.  This is one of my own, which I've proved myself,
<br>
which will appear in a technical appendix of our forthcoming book on
<br>
Novamente.  It expresses to a rule for doing probabilistic deduction, using
<br>
Bayes' Theorem among other probability-theoretic rules.   The key thing I
<br>
want to point out about this theorem is that it assumes one starts out with
<br>
a set of probabilistic estimates that are relative to a given universal set
<br>
U.  U is basically a set containing &quot;everything that is.&quot;  All other
<br>
theorems in probability theory and probabilistic inference share this
<br>
property.  [It's for this reason that my colleague Pei Wang believes
<br>
probability theory is an unsound foundation for modeling human or
<br>
computational inference.  He has proposed a different kind of uncertain
<br>
reasoning, which does not require the positing of a universal set U;
<br>
unfortunately, I think his inference rules are not correct ;) ]
<br>
<p>The point I tried to make to Eli is that when a mind wants to apply
<br>
probabilistic reasoning, nothing tells it a priori how to set this
<br>
particular parameter (U), which makes a big difference in the  results that
<br>
reasoning gives.
<br>
<p>Using probabilistic reasoning to set the parameter simply leads to a
<br>
regress..
<br>
<p>It could be that there is some basic heuristic for setting U, wired into a
<br>
mind biologically.  But I don't think so, I think a mind actually adapts its
<br>
U as time goes on.  It basically has to, because it has to add new things it
<br>
discovers in to U.  I think that processes that are not &quot;rational&quot; in any
<br>
typical sense are involved in setting the contexts used in probabilistic
<br>
reasoning.
<br>
<p>The tricky issue is that a mind has to add, not only things it directly
<br>
experiences, but also things it *just hears about*, to U.  For instance, if
<br>
it hears about Beijing it has to add Beijing to U even though it never
<br>
experienced Beijing.  Eli suggested that probabilistic inference is used to
<br>
mediate the process of adding Beijing to U.  But *that very probabilistic
<br>
inference*  must also take place within some universal set U, so this kind
<br>
of regress does not solve the problem.
<br>
<p>All this is about probabilistic inference within a given mind, however
<br>
(carried out explicitly or implicitly).
<br>
<p>Stepping outside the mind, and taking an objectivist perspective, one can
<br>
ask whether a mind acts approximately rationally relative to the universal
<br>
set U of the actual universe.  This is a different question.  What you'll
<br>
find is that minds act *more* approximately rationally relative to the U's
<br>
that it constructs based on its experience, than based on the universe's U.
<br>
Because our knowledge is finite, and this finitude affects our probabilistic
<br>
inferences in concrete &amp; quantitative ways...

<br>
<p>Theorem (Probabilistic Term Logic Deduction Formula)
<br>
<p>Let U denote a set with |U| elements.  Let Sub(m) denote the set of subsets
<br>
of U containing exactly m elements.
<br>
<p>Let sA, sB, sC, sAB and sBC be numbers in [0,1], all of which divide evenly
<br>
into |U|.
<br>
<p>Let f(x) = P( P(C|A) = x | A in Sub(|U| sA), B in Sub(|U| sB), C in Sub(|U|
<br>
sC), P(B|A)= sAB, P(C|B)=sBC )
<br>
<p>Then, where E() denotes the expected value (mean),
<br>
<p>E( f(x) ) = sAC   sAB sBC  + (1-sAB) ( sC - sB sBC ) / (1- sB )
