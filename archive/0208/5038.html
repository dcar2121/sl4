hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm have some unanswered questions about the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente and Cyc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand Cyc to be primarily a KB, but with some reasoning abilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added on. Is this a correct assessment?
</em><br>
<p>In  my opinion, it's *almost* correct, though the Cyc team might disagree ;)
<br>
<p>They have definitely put a lot of man-hours into their reasoning system as
<br>
well as their knowledge base, and they are recently extending their work
<br>
into other areas of AI such as language processing.  Stephen Reed, who works
<br>
there, recently gave a talk there about how to extend it into the domain of
<br>
perception and action based on James Albus's Reference Model work.
<br>
<p>So they are slowly moving in the direction of trying to make an AGI centered
<br>
around their knowledge DB, but the knowledge DB remains the center of their
<br>
work, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that Cyc currently has a very well populated KB, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rudimentary tools to allow that population to increase at a growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate.
</em><br>
<p>It depends what you mean by &quot;well-populated.&quot;
<br>
<p>Compared to other common-sense DB's it is well-populated.  (Though
<br>
Teknowledge's SUMO DB, which is smaller, is the biggest one available for
<br>
free online... most of Cyc's DB is still proprietary.)
<br>
<p>Compared to the total sum of important common sense knowledge, in my view,
<br>
Cyc is still pretty bloody small, but the Cyc-ers might disagree.  Really
<br>
this is a matter of conjecture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;IIRC, Cyc is reading on its own now, although it still asks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers many questions about what it reads, the time to answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions being the primary governor on it's self-learning speed. Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this a correct assessment?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think Cyc is &quot;reading&quot; in any ordinary sense of the word at this
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>They *might* have some human-guided NLP information extraction tools set up,
<br>
but I actually doubt it.
<br>
<p>The problem is that existing NLP information extraction tools are only able
<br>
to extract very simple information from text (with mediocre reliability),
<br>
not complex nested quantifier relationships such as are typical in the CycL
<br>
language,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The combination of Cyc's formidable KB with Novamente's strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, modelling and goal seeking abilities seems a good match. Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there any chance of a pairing of the two, or is much duplicated effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable?
</em><br>
<p>There will be no duplicated effort in any narrow sense, because
<br>
<p>a) Novamente will not make a knowledge base
<br>
<p>b) Novamente will not make a predicate-logic-based reasoning engine
<br>
<p>c) All tools Cyc will build will be centered around their knowledge base and
<br>
predicate-logic-based reasoning engine
<br>
<p>Novamente is based on a philosophy of AI in which knowledge is learned
<br>
through interaction with the environment and with other minds in the context
<br>
of the environment.  Very different from Cyc's philosophy, which is based on
<br>
knowledge encoding.
<br>
<p>Conceivably, a Novamente mind could benefit from Cyc's database, as a kind
<br>
of &quot;childhood dictionary infusion into the brain&quot;, but not as a primary
<br>
means of gains of knowledge.
<br>
<p>I have more faith in the Novamente approach, but I also consider it possible
<br>
that both of these very different approaches to AGI could ultimately
<br>
succeed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In an unrelated vein, what clustering/grid/process-distribution software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will Novamente use? Have you seen OpenMosix?
</em><br>
<p>At the moment our plan is to do what we did with Webmind AI Engine, our last
<br>
AI system -- i.e., cook our own.
<br>
<p>The requirements for Novamente process distribution are very specialized.
<br>
It's not very much code (or headache) to write our own mechanisms for
<br>
messaging, load balancing, etc. among the different Novamente instances in a
<br>
cluster.
<br>
<p>We haven't done this for Novamente yet, but since we did it for Webmind AI
<br>
Engine, we know how to do it pretty well....  The current system is written
<br>
so as to be &quot;distributed processing ready&quot; tho it's not yet
<br>
distributed-processing-enabled.
