<em>&gt;  &gt; It evolved from and arises from a complex of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other processes.  These other processes are arational or non-rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (language consistently used by Goertzel and others here), not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; _irrational_ (language incorrectly implicitly attributed to them).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are neither arational nor nonrational; they are *rational*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or rather they are arational processes which, insofar as they work, work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they sometimes happen to implement something which roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resembles rationality - we *are* thinly modded chimps hacked to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general intelligence, after all.  But the point is that, insofar as these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes work, they work because they are rational and are rational

<p><p>Eliezer, you're using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean &quot;anything that works&quot;.
<br>
<p>So if you have an organism with a goal, then any process that it uses that
<br>
significantly helps it to achieve that goal is &quot;rational&quot; by your
<br>
definition.  (Correct me if I've paraphrased your idea incorrectly, please.)
<br>
<p>This is a meaningful sense of the word &quot;rational&quot;, but it's a very broad
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>In this broad sense, it's true, even processes that have nothing to do with
<br>
*reasoning* as commonly conceived may be viewed as &quot;rational.&quot;
<br>
<p>For instance, a bird, acting purely on instinct, is acting rationally when
<br>
it mates with another bird, because it's acting in a way that &quot;works&quot; in
<br>
terms of achieving its goal of reproducing itself.
<br>
<p>I generally have been using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean something narrower.
<br>
Basically, to mean &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot;, meaning a
<br>
process inside some mind in which premises are represented, conclusions are
<br>
represented, and processes for getting from the premises to the conclusions
<br>
are carried out.  Note that this sense of &quot;following a process of logical
<br>
inference&quot; is implementation-independent; it applies to neural nets and so
<br>
forth as easily as to minds embodying some sort of explicit
<br>
symbol-manipulation component.
<br>
<p>I guess that your broad definition, and my narrow definition, both capture
<br>
different aspects of the ambiguous natural language term &quot;rationality.&quot;
<br>
<p>In my sense, there are nonrational cognitive processes, because there are
<br>
processes that don't proceed step by step but LEAP to conclusions based on
<br>
nonlinear-dynamical integration of a vast amount of weak pieces of evidence,
<br>
sometimes using emotion as a guide.  In your sense, if these processes
<br>
&quot;work&quot; in terms of achieving system goals, then they're rational.
<br>
<p>Not all of our disagreement is wiped away by clarifying our different uses
<br>
of the term, but I have a feeling about 75% of it is.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that, in other forums, if you wish to make sweeping
<br>
statements about rationality, you clarify first your extremely broad
<br>
definition of the term.  Certainly, in future, before talking about
<br>
rationality I will take care to clarify my own meaning of the term, so as to
<br>
avoid confusion....
<br>
