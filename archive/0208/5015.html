ER&gt; What I don't understand is how the AI will be able to learn much of anything
<br>
ER&gt; while being jailed.  I know of no examples of intelligence emerging without
<br>
ER&gt; interaction with its external environment; but for fears of what might
<br>
ER&gt; result from an unfriendly AI, it seems that it will be forced to begin its
<br>
ER&gt; development in isolation.
<br>
<p>ER&gt; Clearly, some here have given this question more thought than I have - I
<br>
ER&gt; would imagine - so how will this education be carried out while keeping the
<br>
ER&gt; AI in jail?
<br>
<p>I'm not much of an &quot;AI jail&quot; advocate, but my thoughts have been along
<br>
the line of simulated environments offering some sort of pressures, in
<br>
which an AI can learn and/or evolve.  I agree that in order for us to
<br>
find an AI /useful/ it would need a lot of practical knowledge about
<br>
our environment/culture/language or what have you, in which case jail
<br>
isn't practical.  But if intelligence can be abstracted from any
<br>
specific domain, the AI may well be able to develop / be evolved
<br>
in an artificial domain.
<br>
<p>As an aside, most of my thinking on AI and how to get there has been
<br>
heavily influenced by (in approximate order of significance) Douglas
<br>
Hofstadter, Gregory Bateson, chaos theory, and (more as background
<br>
'flavor') things like On Growth and Form.  I was wondering if others
<br>
have further sources in that vein/those veins, or know of others
<br>
working towards AI on such principles.
