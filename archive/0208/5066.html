<em>&gt; First of all, is this group still active?  I just joined a few of days ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I haven't yet received a single message (perhaps my spam filter is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictive?).
</em><br>
<p>The group is active, but it's experiencing an atypical lull.
<br>
<p>Over the last few months there has been quite a lot of activity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've just started to read some of the documents on AI on intelligence.org, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the archives for this group as well.  I have a few questions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments already, but since I haven't thoroughly researched all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; background material yet, if I am covering old ground just let me know.
</em><br>
<p>I encourage you to check out my own AI project, Novamente, at www.realai.net
<br>
;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By trade, I am a computer programmer - mostly plain old business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apps though, not AI (although I have always been interested in AI, I never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really found a way to get into the field).
</em><br>
<p>Jobs in AI are hard to come by these days.  However, if you are interested
<br>
to contribute some unpaid &quot;spare time&quot; to an AI project, let me know;
<br>
ben@goertzel.org.  There are certainly ways an experienced, non-AI-expert
<br>
programmer can contribute to our AI project (and perhaps to other AI
<br>
projects as well, though I can only speak for myself).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while I was interested in the transhumanist movement, but lately I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grown to disliked their irrational emphasis on anthropocentrism, utopia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eudaemonia, and especially their pet political movement of libertarianism.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think the difference in attitude between the prototypical
<br>
transhumanists and the typical member of this list, is fairly interesting.
<br>
<p>For instance, Max More, whom I greatly respect, simply doesn't believe we're
<br>
going to see human-level AI for a long long time.  He believes that enhanced
<br>
humans will come first, and will exist for a long time before the terribly
<br>
tough problem of human-level AI is solved.
<br>
<p>I am tempted to attribute this to a psychological weakness on his part -- in
<br>
other words, I'm tempted to posit that Max emotionally prefers the idea of
<br>
enhanced humans to that of superintelligent machines, and hence assesses the
<br>
odds of real AI lower than he would otherwise, given his general futurist
<br>
outlook.
<br>
<p>But yet how can I know this?  How can I know how rational is MY OWN belief
<br>
that real AI is essentially just around the corner (i.e., perhaps 5-10 years
<br>
away to a baby AI with its own general intelligence, making its own meanings
<br>
&amp; learning about the world).
<br>
<p>Because of this kind of doubt, although I do hold my own beliefs strongly, I
<br>
try to be tolerant of Max and others who have the incomprehensible gall to
<br>
disagree with me ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>-- Ben
