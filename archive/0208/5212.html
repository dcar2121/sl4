</em><br>
<p>BG&gt; Hallucinogens don't MAKE anyone creative, but they have definitely,
<br>
BG&gt; in some cases, helped people to break through psychological barriers
<br>
BG&gt; and manifest more of the creativity they already had inside them.
<br>
<p>That function would be akin to Dali's Critical Paranoia method --
<br>
unlocking the barriers to expressing the unconscious.  Or at least in
<br>
part -- it could also remove blockages (a la Reich) preventing people
<br>
from confidently/full-bodily expressing themselves.
<br>
<p>BG&gt; Stanislaw Grof's work on psychedelic psychotherapy, though full
<br>
BG&gt; of some theoretical BS I don't agree with, is pretty powerfully
<br>
BG&gt; informative in this regard...
<br>
<p>I recently picked up The Holotropic Mind and have skimmed through
<br>
bits.  I came away feeling he was more than a little gullible wrt
<br>
certain New Age tropes, but making a valiant effort to integrate those
<br>
parts of experience so far left in the dark by Science.
<br>
<p>If you're familiar with this work: any concepts there of potential AI
<br>
interest?
<br>
<p>BG&gt; The best results are obtained if one can integrate the psychedelic
<br>
BG&gt; insights and experiences into one's everyday life  and ordinary
<br>
BG&gt; states of consciousness (hence making one's ordinary state of
<br>
BG&gt; consciousness less ordinary!).  But this is a hard task, much
<br>
BG&gt; harder than taking a drug and having a temporary insightful experience...
<br>
<p>I've seen hallucinogens described as offering a sneak preview of what
<br>
is possible with longer-term, harder work in disciplines such as Yoga
<br>
and meditation.
<br>
<p>I think the striving towards Rationality described by some could be
<br>
conceived as such a discipline, as could hardcore use of e-prime, etc.
<br>
cf. &quot;Humility is endless&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If we build a human-level AI, could we design some set of inputs such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the AI would &quot;trip&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>BG&gt; I don't think that would be very hard, actually.  It wouldn't be a set
<br>
BG&gt; of inputs, just an aberrant set of parameter values...
<br>
<p>Interesting.
