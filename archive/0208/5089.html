<em>&gt; The problem I continue to have with this recurring debate is that ultimately

</em><br>
<p>Well, the problem with what you said is the presumption that 
<br>
there is any such thing as &quot;cosmic significance&quot;.  The problem 
<br>
of choosing between alternatives only becomes tractable when we 
<br>
start from the position of signficance only being definable 
<br>
relative to ourselves (for some size of sentient grouping), not 
<br>
to the cosmos.
<br>
<p>People
<br>
<em>&gt; who are doing things for this second cause will rarely give you a sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument that identifies this motive, which merely indicates the unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hotwiring of internal reasoning that we call rationalization... But if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did, would you be impressed?  Is reading a book on cognitive science really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more rational than shooting up on heroin if the drug user impeccably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explains his reasoning?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Rational, like &quot;significant&quot; is only meaningful in context.  It 
<br>
is not meaningful to use it as a free-floating abstraction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, it's not the unwillingness of some to use logic as a metric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that scares me, but rather the possibility that no supergoals are inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than any others.  
</em><br>
<p>Again, there is no such thing as inherent or cosmic &quot;better&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;more significant&quot; or &quot;more rational&quot;.  All of these are 
<br>
contextually meaningful only.  It is one of the worse legacies 
<br>
of religion dominated philosophy that many are infected with the 
<br>
meme of only Absolutes really being real or of value or of 
<br>
significance.  From this it follows that many believe that if 
<br>
there is no Absolute Value or Absolute Valuer then there is no 
<br>
value.  Which of course does not follow at all.
<br>
<p><p>After all, even the most noble altruistic urge, no
<br>
<p>Who said altruism was the measure of nobility?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; matter how stripped away from the ancestral instinct that originally gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to that pattern of behavior, is still the result of a process native to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the particular hardware design of the person harboring it.  &quot;Because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes the world a better place.&quot; is really just a variation of &quot;because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes me feel good,&quot; even if it has a deeper, less obvious path leading to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Hence, it's the psychological egoism pit that I fall into, not the fog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-mistrust.
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not just a variant of &quot;it makes me feel good&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I have trouble seeing why an SI seeking the True Meaning of Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't reach the same conclusion, as much as I hope otherwise.  I tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (with equal incomprehensibility) to describe this dilemma in the closing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours of this month's SL4 chat.  I just have this sad image of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence looking over the hopeful, expectant masses of humanity: a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind alone with the awful and certain knowledge that Friendliness is a red
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herring -- that the perception of goal A's inherent superiority over goal B
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is really just a product of cerebral process X... no more remarkable than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes A through W, and, in a cosmic context, really very silly.  In such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a future, I have difficulty seeing why I should care if the SI somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulates my process X directly rather than bringing about an environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where &quot;natural&quot; triggerings of process X are maximized.  After all, says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this vision, its really just a neurotransmitter thing anyway.  The universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't care about my human sense of good and evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So you believe that nothing at all is meaningful in the least 
<br>
and you might as well be a cow turd in the street as a human 
<br>
being heh?  You might as well be dying form starvation as 
<br>
uploaded and on your way to Alpha Centauri.  Or your preferences 
<br>
don't &quot;mean&quot; anything.  But why should they?  Isn't that it is 
<br>
your preference and that of many sufficient reason to judge it 
<br>
as better when your preferences are workable and acheived and 
<br>
worse when they are not?  All that is necessary to give 
<br>
direction to a line of valuation is a set of things that are 
<br>
valued.  They don't have to be valued by the entire Universe and 
<br>
all imaginable creatures forever and ever in order to be values. 
<br>
What need is there to make faint-headed diagnosis of whether 
<br>
your noblest ideals are the product of your current mix of 
<br>
stomach acids as long as they do in fact lead to a better, in 
<br>
the strictly contextual terms where &quot;better&quot; has any meaning? 
<br>
It is part of post-modern funk to assume that because everything 
<br>
is contextual that it is thus all arbitrary and there are no 
<br>
ways of measuring one thing against another.  It is a rot upon 
<br>
our minds.
<br>
<p>The universe has no ability to &quot;care&quot;.  We do.
