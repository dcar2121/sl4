<em>&gt; &gt; So, when I sit down to improvise at the piano, as a rationalist would I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to reason about which note to play next?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Playing the next note is a fulfillment of playing the song which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a fulfillment of whatever reason you were playing the piano in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place.
</em><br>
<p>But there is no time to consciously reason about what note to play next.
<br>
<p>So I need to choose the next note unconsciously, through an unholy mix of
<br>
cognitive and emotional processes...
<br>
<p>Musical improvisation is intrinsically nonrational.  You're appealing to
<br>
reason and emotions at once in music, and reasoning about which note to play
<br>
based on a rational analysis of what emotions and thoughts it can be
<br>
expected to evoke, is just not workable.  Music theorists have been
<br>
straining in this direction for years with quite limited success.
<br>
<p>There's more of an argument for classical composition to be rational than
<br>
jazz improv.  But even so, there ain't no way Beethoven was carrying out
<br>
rational analysis when he created the Ode to Joy!  A mix of unconscious
<br>
reason and diverse concept creation processes guided by irrational human &amp;
<br>
spiritual feelings....  And far more beautiful than any melody that was ever
<br>
logically derived!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; What about &quot;going with the flow&quot;?  This seems to me to be a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; algorithm for producing good stuff.  Reason seems to enter into such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processes mainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; * to judge things afterwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *when a particularly tricky spot comes up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea what &quot;going with the flow&quot; is even supposed to mean, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have any way of responding.  Plenty of people talk about it, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that doesn't mean I'm any closer to knowing just what this thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process is.  It's likely a thought process I've engaged in, but calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it &quot;going with the flow&quot; does not make me think of anything in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular other than write stream of consciousness style.
</em><br>
<p>Check out &quot;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience&quot; by Mihalyi
<br>
Czikszentmihalyi
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.butler-bowdon.com/flow.htm">http://www.butler-bowdon.com/flow.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Although this book sold in pop psych circles, he's actually a very serious
<br>
research psychologist, who pioneered some new experimental methods...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I had to consciously, logically reason about every note I played on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; piano, or every sentence I wrote, then I would not get to do much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything with my time...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your brain does it for you.  All you have to do is teach it not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influenced by irrational thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>In the context of musical improvisation, this strikes me as particularly
<br>
absurd...
<br>
<p>I relate to your approach much more in the context of my AI work.  In my AI
<br>
work I make an effort to separate the process of combinatorial, emotional,
<br>
free-ranging, not-consciously-rational concept-generation, from the
<br>
consciously-rational, hard-nosed process of concept refinement and
<br>
assessment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think that nonrational thinking is highly adaptive for me and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organisms.  It needs to be kept in balance with rational thought, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different aspects of both rational &amp; nonrational thought need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kept in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; balance with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like an escape mechanism your brain would use to make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't stop trying to reproduce.
</em><br>
<p>??
<br>
<p>Well, I've already reproduced quite a bit.  However, I don't think that my
<br>
views on the psychology and philosophy of mind have had much to do with my
<br>
reproductive behavior.
<br>
<p>Are you trying to say that reproducing is somehow irrational??
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gordon will get back to you once he is an AI researcher.  I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer is creating his AI design to encourage rational thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully he is not creating his AI design purely by conscious rational
<br>
thought processes, or he will never get there ;)
