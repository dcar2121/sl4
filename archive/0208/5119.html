<em>&gt;  &gt; Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool (and one of the central parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Novamente reasoning module).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Explicit, abstract use of Bayes' Theorem, seen deliberatively as Bayes'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theorem, is a tiny subset of the universal domain governed by the BPT.
</em><br>
<p>This is true.
<br>
<p>In fact, however, the Novamente design explicitly uses bayesian inference
<br>
not only for some deliberative thought, but also for some nondeliberative
<br>
thought...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; However, like the rest of elementary probability theory, it pertains to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; a set of probabilities defined over a fixed &quot;universal set.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Defining the universal set is a serious issue in any practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; situation. You can say &quot;define it as the set of all entities ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; observed by the mind doing the reasoning&quot;.  But this doesn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; work, because we *hear* about entities via linguistic communication,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; including many entities we haven't seen.  I may want to include Beijing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; in my universal set for my internal probabilistic inference, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; though I have never been there or seen it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must learn to see the BPT flowing underneath the surface of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition, like blood beneath skin.
</em><br>
<p>I made a very practical mathematical point, and you responded with poetry,
<br>
which doesn't seem to resolve the issue I raised at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case, you have encountered a set of sensory experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to believe that Beijing exists - other people producing reports about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beijing.  Since you expect that people will report that Beijing exists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases where Beijing exists, and that they will not report that Beijing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists if it does not exist, this is, under the BPT, evidence; it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case of a thing being evidence about another thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In terms of the BPT, this is no different from seeing photons reflecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Beijing in person, or from accessing the deposited memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterward.  These forms of evidence differ in strength and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail, but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all equally governed by the BPT.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to ask you to carry out this particular discussion in more
<br>
concrete, mathematical terms.  Bayes Theorem is a mathematical theorem, not
<br>
a philosophical or scientific theory.  If you mean something different by
<br>
BPT, than the branch of math I am familiar with, please articulate what you
<br>
mean.
<br>
<p>Bayes' Theorem is a result in elementary probability theory.
<br>
<p>We are concerned here with discrete probability theory.
<br>
<p>All theorems from discrete elementary prob. theory, take place within an
<br>
assumed finite universal set U.
<br>
<p>Now, suppose we have an intelligent system that is *explicitly or
<br>
implicitly* making use of elementary probability theory to reason about the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>I am making the following argument:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;*For each step of probabilistic inference the system does*, it must assume
<br>
some specific universal set U.
<br>
<p>Therefore:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;*The system must use some process besides prob. inference to decide on the
<br>
universal set U to use, in at least some cases.*
<br>
<p>This statement is not refuted by arguing that the system can, in some cases,
<br>
(explicitly or implicitly) use prob. inference to derive a universal set U
<br>
to use in some contexts.  Because one then asks: what is the universal set U
<br>
for the prob. inference used in that derivation?
<br>
<p>If the universal set U cannot always be provided by prob. inference, how
<br>
else can it be provided?
<br>
<p>a) By biological wiring
<br>
b) By some nonprobabilistic-inference-based cognitive process
<br>
<p>I suggest b).  Perhaps you believe a).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not at all.  You must learn to see the BPT flowing underneath the surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all reality.
</em><br>
<p><p>If we take an abstract perspective, and consider a universal set consisting
<br>
of the entire physical universe, then we can do probabilistic inference over
<br>
the whole cosmos in an &quot;objective&quot; way.
<br>
<p>But, this is not a perspective that any mind can take in practice, because
<br>
no finite mind is complete; its subjective universe is continually changing
<br>
and expanding.
<br>
<p>And in fact, modern physics theories do not support the notion of the
<br>
universe as a fixed &quot;universal set&quot; either.
<br>
<p>So, I think that YOU must learn to see probability theory as a tool for
<br>
doing inference *in a fixed, defined context*.
<br>
<p>It can be used recursively, so that one prob. inference defines the context
<br>
for another prob. inference, etc.
<br>
<p>But it is not objective -- it is subjective, dependent upon the context.
<br>
<p>This is not a philosophical point, it's a mathematical point -- the actual
<br>
probabilistic inferential conclusions you get depend upon what universal set
<br>
you assume.
<br>
<p>The universal fixed universe you seem to assume is a mathematical
<br>
abstraction, convenient for proving theorems in probability theory, but not
<br>
really universal and fixed in any real situation.
