<em>&gt; In what way does this have nothing to do with reasoning?  It is a product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evolution's version of induction.  Furthermore, the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this way will increase the probability of reproduction is quite knowable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a Bayesian reasoner.  A perfect Bayesian reasoner might use a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal method of reproduction, but an imperfect Bayesian reasoner might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up employing exactly this method.  Because evolution *is*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperfect reasoner.
</em><br>
<p>It is true, any process of learning or adaptation can be viewed as
<br>
&quot;imperfect probabilistic reasoning.&quot;
<br>
<p>The question is, in what cases is this view a useful one...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I generally have been using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something narrower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Basically, to mean &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot;, meaning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process inside some mind in which premises are represented,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; represented, and processes for getting from the premises to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are carried out.  Note that this sense of &quot;following a process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inference&quot; is implementation-independent; it applies to neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nets and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forth as easily as to minds embodying some sort of explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; symbol-manipulation component.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  And because you use &quot;rational&quot; to denote only this kind of thought,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can get away with telling yourself that &quot;both 'rationality' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'irrationality' are necessary to thought&quot;, thereby avoiding the necessity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of getting rid of comforting irrational thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's kind of absurd for you to assume so much about my personal
<br>
psychology.  The &quot;more rational than thou&quot; attitude that you and Gordon
<br>
display sometimes is really getting tiring.  So I'll move on to other
<br>
issues...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Which it is why it's so important to realize that verbal thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is verbal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, intuition is intuition, and that both can be either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rational&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irrational&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>What you're saying is that it's important for everyone to define terms
<br>
exactly the way YOU do, instead of the way the dictionary does.
<br>
<p>I think you really push the envelope of the definition of &quot;rational&quot; by
<br>
saying that a bird acting on instinct is acting &quot;rationally&quot;....
<br>
<p>I don't dispute your right to use the word that way, but I do maintain my
<br>
right NOT to use the word that way...
<br>
<p>I can see that the bird acts somewhat as it would if it were a reasoning
<br>
being, calculating its actions... but the fact is, the bird is acting on
<br>
instinct, not based on any of its own reasoning...
<br>
<p>I'd be more OK to say that evolution was &quot;rational&quot; to &quot;design&quot; the bird
<br>
that way, because evolution is what contributed the intelligence to the
<br>
bird's behavior, not the bird itself...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's very easy to find a good name, other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rationality&quot;, for verbal reasoning or deliberative reasoning or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning... in fact, I tossed out three right there.
</em><br>
<p>I talk about &quot;explicit probabilistic logical reasoning&quot; and &quot;conscious
<br>
reasoning&quot; sometimes.  These are different things, as some conscious
<br>
reasoning may not be explicitly prob-logic based, and some explicitly
<br>
prob-logic based reasoning may be unconscious.
<br>
<p>I agree that rationality extends beyond explicit prob. logical reasoning.
<br>
But I don't agree that it extends to a bird or a human acting on instinct.
<br>
<p>And I think there's a key point of difference between our views, which I've
<br>
been struggling to express in a way you'll understand.
<br>
<p>Maybe a good phrasing is this: &quot;Within systems or process that are OVERALL
<br>
rational (in your sense of being decent approximations to prob. inference),
<br>
there are subcomponents and subprocesses with the property that, if you just
<br>
look at them in isolation, they don't look rational at all.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is these subcomponents and subprocesses that I refer to as nonrational
<br>
components of the mind.
<br>
<p>You may say that these nonrational subcomponents and subprocesses don't need
<br>
to be there.
<br>
<p>I believe that they need to be there to SOME extent.
<br>
<p>For instance, as I've argued, there needs to be, in any finite system within
<br>
the universe, some non-prob-inference process for adapting the universal set
<br>
U used in the system's prob-inference processes.
<br>
<p>How large a percentage of a rational mind, is optimally composed of these
<br>
&quot;locally nonrational&quot; subprocesses, I'm not sure.
<br>
<p>In the human mind it seems to be a LARGE percentage, but for future AI minds
<br>
it may be less...
