<p>Days?  I would estimate that the window of difference allowed for two 
<br>
transhumans newly initiating a cycle of strong self-improvement to 
<br>
maintain game-theoretic equivalency would be somewhere in the 
<br>
nanosecond or microsecond range.  In addition, I would find it highly 
<br>
likely that posthuman SIs would choose to reconcile their differences 
<br>
(likely to be minor, in terms of goals) rather than burning resources 
<br>
in a mutually wasteful physical conflict.  Looking at your rhetoric, 
<br>
you seem to be thinking in terms of &quot;all sentients will necessarily 
<br>
have strong observer bias&quot;, which, of course, is dangerous when 
<br>
seriously considering the motivations of entities outside of the 
<br>
familiar phase space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That said, I do believe there will be multiple SIs.  I just don't 
</em><br>
think 
<br>
<em>&gt;they will be terran.  Other civilizations out there *must* be getting

to 
<br>

but 
<br>
<em>&gt;that won't have anywhere near the effect on SIs that it does on us.  
</em><br>
So, 
<br>

be 
<br>

if 
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;behind.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, you've got a powerful Us/Them complex going on when you talk about 
<br>
SIs.  You talk as if all humans upgrading to Powerhood isn't the only 
<br>
long-term inevitability, as if an indifferent SI could come into 
<br>
existence but not see mankind as building blocks, and as if the first 
<br>
benevolent transhuman won't create a moral singleton to protect 
<br>
individual rights (in the case of a malevolent or indifferent 
<br>
transhuman, everything goes black immediately).  Out of curiosity, may 
<br>
I ask you if you've mulled over any of these concepts before?  Also, 
<br>
even if Earth-originating SIs ran into extraterrestrial SIs, wouldn't 
<br>
that potential occurence be so insanely far into the subjective future 
<br>
as to render it irrelevant to us today?
