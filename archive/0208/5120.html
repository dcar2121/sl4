</em><br>
<p><p>Ok.  The issue, as I see it, is this.  Since it seems unlikely that there is
<br>
any sort of cosmic Truth that human minds are tuned to when deciding what
<br>
constitutes a morally &quot;good&quot; goal, human minds must be making these
<br>
judgments as a consequence of their particular design.
<br>
<p>Without some universally objective meaning of Friendliness etched into the
<br>
fabric of the universe, we can not expect that an SI would ever find such a
<br>
thing.  A Friendly SI would thus have to find Friendliness in the minds of
<br>
its beholders.  I think this is why Eliezer has repeatedly emphasized that a
<br>
Friendly SI would be Friendly for the same reasons an altruistic human is
<br>
friendly.  A Friendly AI is morally comparable to the uploaded version of a
<br>
*human* of unsurpassed Friendliness.  We would not expect or even want a
<br>
Friendly AI to be merely a human brain manifested in silicon, but at the
<br>
very least it would have to have a thorough understanding of whatever it is
<br>
in the human wiring concept that makes conclusions about what is and is not
<br>
Friendly.  It would have to have some sort of &quot;process X&quot; module, as it
<br>
were.
<br>
<p>But this &quot;process X&quot; remains a human modus operandi, and should not be
<br>
mistaken for an immutable law of the cosmos.  So Friendliness of the kind we
<br>
are pursuing is really Human Friendliness.  If the generalized template of a
<br>
Friendly AI were set loose on an alien world among species who had no
<br>
process X, but rather some totally unrelated process Z, it is a process Z
<br>
module that this alien Friendly AI would develop to compute Friendliness.
<br>
Therefore, the mature Friendly AI from human space might disagree violently
<br>
with the Friendly AI from Kzin space -- on account of the very differnt
<br>
modules they use to calculate what Friendliness is.
<br>
<p>I don't see that we have any choice but to reference an AI's Friendliness to
<br>
our own perceptions of it.  There is no cosmic handbook of ethics or
<br>
extraterrestrial species handy to consult.  And I doubt we could bring
<br>
ourselves to sign on with any of these other references anyway if these
<br>
suggested that humans were a smelly blight on the universe.
<br>
<p>One could argue that any intelligent species would roughly share our process
<br>
X, making this issue irrelevant.  I don't think this is completely wishful
<br>
thinking since I suspect that any species intelligent enough to worry about
<br>
would at least have to share the most fundamental heuristics; after all,
<br>
what we recognize as logic seems to govern the natural universe, and it
<br>
should be difficult to evolve very far in the natural universe using
<br>
heuristics that totally ignore this logic.
<br>
<p>But on the other hand, many concepts that we esteem as admirable human
<br>
virtues have obvious foundations in our ancestral environment -- foundations
<br>
that other intelligences might not share.  For example, an intelligence that
<br>
evolved from the beginning as a singleton planetary hive-mind would have
<br>
little need to develop concepts of &quot;personal freedom&quot; or &quot;altruism&quot;, since
<br>
these are social concepts that require multiple minds to have any meaning.
