First of all, is this group still active?  I just joined a few of days ago
<br>
and I haven't yet received a single message (perhaps my spam filter is to
<br>
restrictive?).
<br>
<p>Anyway...
<br>
<p>I am an sort of an amateur philosopher (I would like to go back to school
<br>
and study it formally, if I ever can save up enough money), mostly
<br>
interested in far distant future visions of technology, life, society, and
<br>
science.  By trade, I am a computer programmer - mostly plain old business
<br>
apps though, not AI (although I have always been interested in AI, I never
<br>
really found a way to get into the field).
<br>
<p>In the past couple of years, as I have refined my personal philosophies, I
<br>
have tried to seek those with similar thoughts to my own out there.  For I
<br>
while I was interested in the transhumanist movement, but lately I have
<br>
grown to disliked their irrational emphasis on anthropocentrism, utopia,
<br>
eudaemonia, and especially their pet political movement of libertarianism.
<br>
<p>So I have decided to focus more on the singularity, as it seems to be more
<br>
independent of these primitive trappings.
<br>
<p>I've just started to read some of the documents on AI on intelligence.org, and
<br>
some of the archives for this group as well.  I have a few questions and
<br>
comments already, but since I haven't thoroughly researched all of the
<br>
background material yet, if I am covering old ground just let me know.
<br>
<p>Looking forward to the discussion!
