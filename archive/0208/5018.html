</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, I don't have a bunch of time and/or money to call your 
<br>
wager right now. But, I would be very surprised if the future 5 
<br>
years out doesn't include a lot more single and wearable devices 
<br>
that are functionally small computers with full wireless 
<br>
Internet access.  Cellphone stuff will be subsumed into them. 
<br>
On volume across the world you may well be right.  But I expect 
<br>
the geeks and white-collar crowd will have moved on by then.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The argument goes something like this: most subscribers in these markets can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford/will buy a $20-50 device charging base GSM rates for text messages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 95%+ of subscribers in these markets can't afford/won't buy $100 or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; device at GPRS or greater costs. Network operators are not willing to
</em><br>
<p><p>So. Why not provide for the low and high-end customers?  Why 
<br>
only do one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; subsidise handset costs or airtime costs or roll out more advanced networks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in these regions in any more than a very limited way -- and the underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financial crunch the operators face isn't going away in the next couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years. Network operators also can't afford to wire these regions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently. They've got the GSM coverage out there, but they can barely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify putting GPRS or other next generation networks in major cities, let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone putting it out there for the other 50% of the population in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countryside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I believe we need an Internet Superhighway project in the US to 
<br>
finish the last mile stuff, probably with high-speed wireless on 
<br>
an advanced cell platform.  I think other developed countries 
<br>
will come to the same conclusion.  So I suspect a large part of 
<br>
setting up such a beast will be paid with tax-dollars. 
<br>
Otherwise, I think the business as usual model will hold back 
<br>
the kind of progress I would like to see for far too long.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's a very interesting time in wireless right now. The industry is trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a bunch of diverse things in minor rollouts to see what sticks. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistically, you're not going to see high speed wireless networks offered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by commercial network operators outside major cities anytime soon. And those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks are going to suck in terms of bandwidth. All the major operators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have their GPRS networks up and live in a number of cities across the US at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment; you won't be able to buy for a little while yet in most markets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the phones are horridly costly, the bandwidth is horridly costly, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content is nonexistant, no-one has a clue on business models, and you'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lucky to get 56k dialup equivelant speed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not going much better in Europe, either. So get used to those cellphones...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>No.  There has to be a better way.
