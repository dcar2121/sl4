CS&gt;I think this is the concept behind Star Trek's Prime Directive
<br>
CS&gt;( <a href="http://sol.brunel.ac.uk/~jarvis/bola/ethics/starfleet.html">http://sol.brunel.ac.uk/~jarvis/bola/ethics/starfleet.html</a> ):
<br>
CS&gt;
<br>
CS&gt;   As the right of each sentient species to live in accordance with
<br>
CS&gt;   its normal cultural evolution is considered sacred, no Starfleet
<br>
CS&gt;   personnel may interfere with the healthy development of alien
<br>
CS&gt;   life and culture. Such interference includes the introduction of
<br>
CS&gt;   superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a world who society
<br>
CS&gt;   is incapable of handling such advantages wisely. Starfleet personnel
<br>
CS&gt;   may not violate this Prime Directive, even to save their lives
<br>
CS&gt;   and/or their ship, unless they are acting to right an earlier
<br>
CS&gt;   violation or an accidental contamination of said culture. This
<br>
CS&gt;   directive takes precedence over any and all other considerations,
<br>
CS&gt;   and carries with it the highest moral obligation.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>AS&gt; But also notice that almost all of the alien species that the
<br>
AS&gt; humans run into in the Star Trek universe are just other humans
<br>
AS&gt; with funny foreheads. This is probably based more upon the
<br>
AS&gt; limitations of special effects and makeup budgets, and the fact
<br>
AS&gt; that people want to watch stories about things they can relate to
<br>
AS&gt; instead of bizarre aliens with completely incomprehensible
<br>
AS&gt; cultures and motivations, rather than any actual scientific
<br>
AS&gt; knowledge about aliens.  So it is small wonder that the Prime
<br>
AS&gt; Directive seems to be almost universally accepted by all the Star
<br>
AS&gt; Trek aliens, because they are not really aliens.  Therefore this
<br>
AS&gt; not really a valid example.      
<br>
<p>I don't watch Star Trek -- I've seen it a few times and that's it.
<br>
I was commenting, really, on the Prime Directive (and others in the
<br>
link) as written.  In that context, I think it offers a perspective
<br>
close to that of some here on the list on how we would like an SAI to
<br>
behave (or at least some aspects of desired behaviour).
<br>
<p>Also, Gene Roddenberry was hanging out with people who claimed actual
<br>
contact with ETs (Geller, Puharich) at the time this was conceived,
<br>
which I found interesting.  IIRC some of these contacts were
<br>
purportedly with a Universal Benelovent Intelligence from the Sirius
<br>
area -- which could be the same one beaming that pink light into
<br>
Philip K. Dick's forehead.  See Robert K. Temple's _The Sirius
<br>
Mystery_ and Robert Anton Wilson's _Cosmic Trigger_ for further weird
<br>
allegations and tales about the Sirius connection.
