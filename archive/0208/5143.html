<em>&gt; Eliezer, you're using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean &quot;anything that works&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if you have an organism with a goal, then any process that it uses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly helps it to achieve that goal is &quot;rational&quot; by your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition.  (Correct me if I've paraphrased your idea incorrectly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please.)
</em><br>
<p>If this is what Eliezer means I think he is wrong.  I don't think that's 
<br>
quite what he meant, though it does read that way.
<br>
<p>For something to be considered rational, it must not just be workable, 
<br>
but also right and efficient.  This is probably what I should have told 
<br>
you when you asked for a definition of rationality earlier (this idea of 
<br>
rightness is so obvious to me I forget to mention it sometimes).  What 
<br>
Eliezer described so well is that everything is capable of rationality 
<br>
if all irrationality is removed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I generally have been using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, to mean &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot;, meaning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process inside some mind in which premises are represented, conclusions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented, and processes for getting from the premises to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are carried out.  Note that this sense of &quot;following a process of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference&quot; is implementation-independent; it applies to neural nets and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth as easily as to minds embodying some sort of explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbol-manipulation component.
</em><br>
<p>I think that this is too narrow of a way to look at rationality, since 
<br>
&quot;following a process of logical inference&quot; does not allow for the 
<br>
statistical nature of decision making.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess that your broad definition, and my narrow definition, both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different aspects of the ambiguous natural language term &quot;rationality.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my sense, there are nonrational cognitive processes, because there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes that don't proceed step by step but LEAP to conclusions based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonlinear-dynamical integration of a vast amount of weak pieces of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes using emotion as a guide.  In your sense, if these processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;work&quot; in terms of achieving system goals, then they're rational.
</em><br>
<p>You need to expand your notion of rationality.  It is any process that 
<br>
produces the right answer.  Not by accident or only in some cases, but 
<br>
consistently produces the most right answer possible.  Rationality is 
<br>
not too narrow or two broad of a word, IMO, but is just right.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I think we're spending way too much time arguing over what the 
<br>
word rationality should mean.  It's just a word I keep using because, to 
<br>
me, it does the best job of all words that I know of evoking the proper 
<br>
ideas in a persons head.
