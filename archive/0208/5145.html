<p>But your unconscious thought processes are precisely those processes that

<br>
<p>&quot;You&quot; being the conscious, reflective aspect of your mind-brain-process
<br>
<p>You cannot watch your unconscious processes and correct them if they go
<br>
astray.  That is not how your brain is built.  You can see the output of
<br>
your unconscious processes, only.  I can accept that in some non-normal
<br>
states of consciousness you can go further than we usually do in terms of
<br>
observing unconscious processes -- but I'm skeptical about the extent to
<br>
which this is really possible...
<br>
<p>And actually, trying to moderate my irrational thoughts (e.g. overoptimistic
<br>
time estimates, incorrect distance estimates that my visual cortex feeds me)
<br>
DOES work pretty well...

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Musical improvisation is intrinsically nonrational.  You're appealing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason and emotions at once in music, and reasoning about which note to

<em>&gt; &gt; play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; based on a rational analysis of what emotions and thoughts it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expected to evoke, is just not workable.  Music theorists have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; straining in this direction for years with quite limited success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it's not possible, I don't know.  I can only reproduce music I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard; I'm not very good at producing new music.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, I'm just the opposite.  I am poor at reproducing music I've
<br>
heard, but quite good at creating new melodies, rhythms and song structures,
<br>
and improvising within/around them....  One of these years I'll translate a
<br>
few of my 100's of 4-track tapes to computer files and give you some smaples
<br>
;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At any rate, it may be that musical improvisation requires that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think faster than rational thought allows.  If that's the case, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of the music will suffer compared to well thought out pieces.
</em><br>
<p>This paragraph gave me a really good laugh!
<br>
<p>I really don't think that the greatest works of music in history are the
<br>
ones that have been the most carefully and rationally thought out!!
<br>
<p>Although I can imagine you and I may have different musical tastes; perhaps
<br>
it is the case that you prefer music with a more transparent rational
<br>
structure (say, within the universe of Bach, perhaps you prefer the
<br>
Brandenburg Concertos to the more improvisational Chromatic Fantasy and
<br>
Fugue, which I really love).
<br>
<p>Yes, I agree, in theory a superintelligent super-rational being could
<br>
calculate, based on data about human psychology, a piece of music precisely
<br>
configured to affect human emotions in a certain way.  This being could
<br>
create a piece of music that I'd love better than Voodoo Child, the
<br>
Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue, the Jupiter Symphony, Straight No Chaser, Take
<br>
Five and California Uber Alles all rolled up into one.
<br>
<p>But this being would not be operating within the limitations of a human
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>Within the limitations of a human brain, explicitly rational thought (as
<br>
opposed to &quot;rationality&quot; in the broad sense of &quot;whatever works&quot;) is just NOT
<br>
a reasonable way to improvise music OR to compose music.
<br>
<p>Forget music, it is not a reasonable way to go about constructing a
<br>
mathematical proof.
<br>
<p>Each step of a proof is logical, but the choice of which step to take is
<br>
intuitive, based on the unconscious integration of a vast amount of
<br>
information learned from reading other proofs, and reasoning in other
<br>
contexts.  Furthermore, this intuitive judgment is inevitably
<br>
emotion-polluted, guided partly by the mathematician's nonrational (and
<br>
occasionally antirational) liking for one strategy of proof over another,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Again I'll say: we humans inevitably rely on our unconscious, which is
<br>
imperfectly &quot;rational&quot; in Eli's sense of &quot;rationality as whatever works&quot;,
<br>
and which embodies a complex mixture of processes that are rational in the
<br>
narrow sense (of carrying out incremental inferences going from premises to
<br>
conclusions), and processes that are nonrational in the narrow sense.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your thought process in the original comment we're discussing may be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of rationalization to prevent you from giving up the irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that makes you continue to try to reproduce assuming you are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sense aware that if you stopped trying to reproduce you'd be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get more work done towards creating the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Well I got another good laugh out of this one ;)
<br>
<p>Rest assured that I have no immediate plans to reproduce any further!
<br>
<p>Three offspring is quite enough for my wife and myself...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is my own AI speculation, but:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that in an AI thought that ve is getting feedback on will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause a penalty in speed of thought like it does in humans.  I can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct my attention at one thought process at a time.  If I try to focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on more than one thing at a time, it all falls apart and I get very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confused.  A good AI design would allow for parallel analysis of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes rather than preemptive.  (Note:  Gordon can converse with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and walk at the same time, since walking doesn't require much if any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to do.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree with you there.  Perhaps we agree more about AI's than about
<br>
humans ;)
