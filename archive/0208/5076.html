<p>Sanity is a discipline.  It is partially, even mostly composed of 
<br>
nonverbal skills and perceptions; but there's also a background of 
<br>
verbalizable, explainable knowledge which stands behind it.  I happen to 
<br>
think that this knowledge - call it &quot;meta-rationality&quot;, meaning rational 
<br>
thinking about rationality -  is one of the many things that are 
<br>
necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding AI.  Of course you are 
<br>
free to disagree about this.  (You'll be wrong, of course, but you're free 
<br>
to disagree.  I respect your right to make your own mistakes but this 
<br>
should not be confused with respecting the mistakes themselves.)
<br>
<p>Naturally it rubs me the wrong way when I see someone say something like 
<br>
&quot;How can I know how rational is my own belief that XYZ?&quot;  This is a 
<br>
perfectly reasonable question.  At this point in your professional career 
<br>
and personal development, you should be able to readily answer it if 
<br>
someone else asks it of you; you certainly shouldn't be asking it of the 
<br>
audience as a rhetorical question...
<br>
<p>If you have any specific reason to think that your own belief is 
<br>
irrational, you can cite it without further apology.  Asking the question 
<br>
as rhetorical makes it sound like deciding whether something is 
<br>
&quot;rational&quot;, is a matter of blind faith - and hence nobody can call your 
<br>
own rationality into question, since presumably your blind faith is as 
<br>
good as anyone else's.  By asking the question as rhetorical, you create 
<br>
the appearance of being open to the idea that you are in error, while 
<br>
actually closing off the possibility of any *specific* criticism being 
<br>
leveled at your rationality.  After all, you already acknowledged that you 
<br>
might be irrational, right?  What more could anyone possibly want of you?
<br>
<p>Now of course you may have meant something entirely different by all this. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps this explains what it is about this particular sentence rubs 
<br>
people like me (and perhaps Gordon) the wrong way.
