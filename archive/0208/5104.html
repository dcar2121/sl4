</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only behaving in a way that looks rational is macho rationalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Behaving rationally on accident is simply not good enough to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational *thinker*.
</em><br>
<p><p>Behaving rationally *by accident* was not what I was talking about.
<br>
<p>I was saying that there are no perfectly rational minds, and many different
<br>
approximately rational minds, which use different methods to approximate
<br>
rationality.
<br>
<p>Similarly, there are no infinitely intelligent minds, just various more or
<br>
less intelligent minds, and these use different methods to achieve their
<br>
finite intelligence.
<br>
<p>Whether a system that achieves intelligence or rationality purely at random
<br>
is &quot;really&quot; intelligent or rational, is one of those slippery philosophical
<br>
questions that doesn't interest me much....  Such questions seem to be more
<br>
about word meanings than about experienced reality.
<br>
<p>What I was talking about was observing biases in my own unconscious thought
<br>
process, and consciously compensating for them on the conscious-reason
<br>
level -- but NOT being able to fully repair the biases, because of not
<br>
having full control over my own unconscious (a problem that AI's may have
<br>
much less severely).
<br>
<p>Consider heuristics like
<br>
<p>&quot;To predict how long a software project will take, take your first estimate,
<br>
double it, then double it again.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;When you're hiking in the desert, things are a lot further than they
<br>
appear.&quot;
<br>
<p>These are conscious, rational heuristics for postprocessing the results of
<br>
unconscious processing.  We can employ these heuristics in order to improve
<br>
the rationality of our judgments.  We can do this WITHOUT being able to
<br>
improve the rationality of the unconscious processes that create the first
<br>
estimates of project duration, or the first impression of the distance to an
<br>
oasis.
<br>
<p>Are you saying that in a higher state of &quot;truly rational&quot; consciousness, one
<br>
doesn't see the oasis as being closer than it really is?  One's perceptual
<br>
cortex is rewired to avoid this kind of incorrect, &quot;irrational&quot; judgment?
<br>
<p>Even if this is true to an extent, I don't believe it can be completely
<br>
true.  I think that nonrational thought processes are a necessary
<br>
consequence of the severe finitude of our brains, combined with the severe
<br>
demands we place upon them.  I think that pure rationality would not be an
<br>
efficient strategy given the limitations of our wetware.
<br>
<p>Making a similar statement about post-Singularity beings would be tough, of
<br>
course...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not drawing the distinction along traditional psychological lines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that's probable the problem.  Maybe I shouldn't use the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `conscious' and `unconscious' and just stick with something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `feedback-able thought' and `feedback-less though'.  To be fair I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know a lot about psychology, but from what I know about neuropsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get the impression that all thought is the same qualitatively and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only difference is that some thought is feedback-able and some thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not.
</em><br>
<p>That is just not the case.  At least, it's not believed to be the case by
<br>
the vast majority of cognitive psychologists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Some forms of irrationality are good at creating new ideas, but bad at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; testing, analyzing and refining them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just because the ideas are `new' (and most are just new to you) does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that they are good or usable.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not.  Rationality is great at testing newly created ideas, at
<br>
least in some contexts (including  math, science, philosophy), and it will
<br>
often throw them out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thus rationality works well in conjunction with some irrational thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processes, which involve various types of quasirandom concept creation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The most brilliant scientists have generally combined intensely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationality with quirky but effective nonrational thought processes...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you really call this process random and irrational?  New ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from following paths that connect ideas (using an appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory model, of course) to reach new ideas.  Some of these links are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaker than others, but connections none the less.  You first explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong connections for new ideas, and if they fail, you try weaker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections.  Eventually, you hope to reach some new connection that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one realized before.
</em><br>
<p>Following pathways is one heuristic, but another is assembling compounds out
<br>
of existing conceptual components.  This assembly process has a large random
<br>
aspect, in my opinion (this is based on introspective experience and AI
<br>
experimentation, not cognitive psychology; cog psych really hasn't gotten
<br>
there yet).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Irrational thinking can generate ideas that are later useful in rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking.  This is a subjective impression held by many many people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quite thoroughly researched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  And if I play roulette long enough, I'll probably win (of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no statistical guarantee that this will eventually happen).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Through directed thinking you can increase your ability to find usable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas.  I'm not saying that random thought doesn't work, but that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient and there are better ways.
</em><br>
<p>Nonrational/quasirational intuition is much more than &quot;random thought&quot;.
<br>
<p>It is a specific assemblage of cognitive processes and structures, which has
<br>
some random components, and many other components as well.
<br>
<p>It appears to be better at generating new ideas than the cognitive processes
<br>
and structures associated with conscious logical reasoning.
