<p>SA&gt; However, I think a lot better mileage can be had by showing
<br>
SA&gt; religious persons that all the things that the religions promise 
<br>
SA&gt; can be acheived (where not total nonsense) ***only*** by science,
<br>
SA&gt; technology and sufficient human will and vision.  If this was
<br>
SA&gt; shown a visceral enough level the old dogma and promise after 
<br>
SA&gt; you die competitors should lose adherents by the church-full.
<br>
<p>[I'll leave aside the question of why you consider it important to 'win
<br>
over' the religious except to question whether by now, most adherents
<br>
to western religions don't already consider &quot;good&quot; inventions divinely
<br>
inspired.] 
<br>
<p>I've highlighted the word &quot;only&quot; in the above to point out that I
<br>
disagree.  To show that something is possible /only/ by method X
<br>
requires showing it is impossible by any other method, which cannot be
<br>
done.
<br>
<p>Some theories and philosophies are immune to all attack: you cannot
<br>
disprove solipsism, nor can you disprove that the universe and all
<br>
our memories were created by a giant invisible green turtle three
<br>
seconds ago.
<br>
<p>However, if you omit &quot;only&quot; in the above, i.e. if you can demonstrate
<br>
positive results, those religious folks who would be inclined against
<br>
any effort towards SI may be otherwise persuaded.  Whether they
<br>
reconcile that with their beliefs is a separate issue.
<br>
<p>The whole Science vs. Religion Deathmatch thing applies pretty
<br>
narrowly these days, and AFAICT mainly within the big monotheistic
<br>
ones.
