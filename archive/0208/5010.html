</em><br>
<p>I'm willing to wager a bunch of time and money (and I am wagering a bunch of
<br>
time and money) that in five years time most handheld devices in the world
<br>
will be phase 2+ GSM cellphones, just like they are today. I doubt this will
<br>
be true in the US or Europe at that time, but definately in Asia, South
<br>
America, Africa and probably large portions of Russia.
<br>
<p>The argument goes something like this: most subscribers in these markets can
<br>
afford/will buy a $20-50 device charging base GSM rates for text messages.
<br>
95%+ of subscribers in these markets can't afford/won't buy $100 or more
<br>
device at GPRS or greater costs. Network operators are not willing to
<br>
subsidise handset costs or airtime costs or roll out more advanced networks
<br>
in these regions in any more than a very limited way -- and the underlying
<br>
financial crunch the operators face isn't going away in the next couple of
<br>
years. Network operators also can't afford to wire these regions
<br>
efficiently. They've got the GSM coverage out there, but they can barely
<br>
justify putting GPRS or other next generation networks in major cities, let
<br>
alone putting it out there for the other 50% of the population in the
<br>
countryside.
<br>
<p>It's a very interesting time in wireless right now. The industry is trying
<br>
out a bunch of diverse things in minor rollouts to see what sticks. But
<br>
realistically, you're not going to see high speed wireless networks offered
<br>
by commercial network operators outside major cities anytime soon. And those
<br>
networks are going to suck in terms of bandwidth. All the major operators
<br>
have their GPRS networks up and live in a number of cities across the US at
<br>
the moment; you won't be able to buy for a little while yet in most markets,
<br>
but the phones are horridly costly, the bandwidth is horridly costly, the
<br>
content is nonexistant, no-one has a clue on business models, and you'll be
<br>
lucky to get 56k dialup equivelant speed.
<br>
<p>Not going much better in Europe, either. So get used to those cellphones...
