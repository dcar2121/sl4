</em><br>
<p>I understand the problem you're pointing out here, but I don't believe I
<br>
have fallen into this trap.
<br>
<p>I trust rationality more than anything else, but I don't trust it as much as
<br>
you and Gordon seem to.
<br>
<p>In general, in ordinary life, irrationality really pisses me off, and I've
<br>
had to learn to mute my instinctive emotional reaction against it, and
<br>
become more accepting of the fact that humans are largely irrational
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p>It is very rare in ordinary life for me to find people who exalt rationality
<br>
more than I do -- but this list has a different makeup than the people I
<br>
encounter in &quot;ordinary life&quot; ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>I champion conscious reason, but also intuition.  I see intuition as
<br>
unconscious reason, adept at piecing together a huge number of pieces of
<br>
weak evidence in statistical and creative ways.  Intuition can do some
<br>
things that conscious reason cannot, because of conscious reason's limited
<br>
channel capacity.  However, human intuition is also inextricably bound up
<br>
with human emotion, which is also irrational.
<br>
<p>In future AI minds, there will be intuition (in the sense of inference
<br>
combining huge numbers of pieces of weak evidence) that is NOT as tangled up
<br>
with emotion as human intuition is.  So there will be a much grander sort of
<br>
rationality than we can experience.  Because for us, the only type of
<br>
thought that we can effectively free of strong emotional influences is
<br>
conscious reason, which has very limited capacity.
<br>
<p>Most humans couldn't care less for conscious logical reason, and trust
<br>
intuition vastly more.  Comparatively, I am a huge advocate of conscious
<br>
logical reason.  But compared to you and Gordon, I am a big advocate of
<br>
intuition even with its inevitable emotional tangledness.
<br>
<p>You may tell me that you guys are SO rational you have freed even your
<br>
unconscious intuitions from significant emotional influence.  However, based
<br>
on my interactions with you, I don't get that feeling ;)
