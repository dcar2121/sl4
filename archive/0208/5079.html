<p>They know more about logic and, therefore, are able to manage to see

get lucky and have good heuristics for limiting bias.

<p>This is not rationality!
<br>
<p>What you are doing, Ben, is trying to moderate your irrationality.  This 
<br>
is no different than what those `rational' scientists do.  All this 
<br>
allows you to do is stumble onto rational conclusions more often than 
<br>
other people.
<br>
<p>Consider my earlier example with the Randians.  If I were thinking like 
<br>
you, I'd have a heuristic that would tell me to avoid getting into 
<br>
arguments with them.  Consequently, I wouldn't ever discuss my thoughts 
<br>
on Randianism with them.  This is just as irrational as arguing with 
<br>
every last one of them!  What is rational is to determine *why* you want 
<br>
to argue them and if it is a valid reason or just a rationalized reason 
<br>
generated by your brain.  This is what is essential to rationality:  you 
<br>
don't have a heuristic to make you more rational in a given situation, 
<br>
you think the situation through rationally (using such tools as logic 
<br>
and Bayesian statistics) and arrive at the most rational conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do think I'm significantly more rational than most people, and I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is largely because of conscious efforts I've made to correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; errors in my thinking, of which the bias toward overoptimism described 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the previous paragraph is just one (relatively simple) example.  My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from birth, was endowed with an unusual capability for complex rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought; but adjusting my personality and habits of thought to *utilize*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this capability in a thoroughgoing way rather than just in isolated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual contexts, has been a bit of an effort!!
</em><br>
<p>I sometimes question whether you have made the fundamental shift to 
<br>
rationality and if you are just a very logical thinker.  At any rate, 
<br>
even if you have, you have a *long* way to go to reach a reasonable 
<br>
degree of rationality.  Or, a better way of putting it is that you 
<br>
haven't come very far.  I and Eliezer have come a long way, but there is 
<br>
still a long way to go, some of it very difficult because it's attacking 
<br>
very fundamental ways of human thought.  I hope that my book, when done, 
<br>
will serve to bring people along to greater degrees of rationality.
