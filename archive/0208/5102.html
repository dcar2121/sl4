</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get the impression that all thought is the same qualitatively and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only difference is that some thought is feedback-able and some thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not.  The problem is that your brain is good at tricking you into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking feedback-less thought is feedback-able thought and that's where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to watch for rationalization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are feedback lines between conscious and unconscious 
<br>
mental processes.  The difference between the former and the 
<br>
latter is the presence or absence of your attention and ability 
<br>
to &quot;drive&quot;.  Perhaps it might also be fair to say that the 
<br>
conscious mind is the one we think of most often as &quot;self&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;under my control&quot;.  But it is built from and is utterly 
<br>
dependent on the parts of the mind that are not &quot;under my 
<br>
control&quot; or in my awareness.  So to disown these parts is 
<br>
suicidal.  Of course they are not to be worshipped or given 
<br>
carte blanche authority.  But neither are they rationally to be 
<br>
disowned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying that you make these statements explicitly KNOWING 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they contradict known psychological facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh oh, seems I have Eliezer-itus.  :-P
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, though, to be honest I don't use a lot of qualifiers about my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current knowledge because I don't think it's particularly relevant.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either I'm right or not.  If I make errors, point them out.  Maybe you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just think they're errors and maybe I am just more naive than I thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What a boring world where one is either wholly &quot;right&quot; or not!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Some forms of irrationality are good at creating new ideas, but bad at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; testing, analyzing and refining them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just because the ideas are `new' (and most are just new to you) does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that they are good or usable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well no and that is why you test them.  But you miss speaking to 
<br>
the point that these processes are good at generating new ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Thus rationality works well in conjunction with some irrational thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; processes, which involve various types of quasirandom concept creation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The most brilliant scientists have generally combined intensely effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rationality with quirky but effective nonrational thought processes...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you really call this process random and irrational?  New ideas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from following paths that connect ideas (using an appropriate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory model, of course) to reach new ideas.  Some of these links are 
</em><br>
<p>Wrong if you are talking about new ideas only coming from such a 
<br>
conscious and deliberate approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; weaker than others, but connections none the less.  You first explore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong connections for new ideas, and if they fail, you try weaker 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections.  Eventually, you hope to reach some new connection that no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one realized before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And where does one understanding of or finding or appreciating 
<br>
the connections come from?  Where do flashes of association 
<br>
between things you have never conciously connected at all come 
<br>
from?  &lt;blank out&gt; Do you consciously leap across an unknown 
<br>
connection to an unknown destination?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This requires that you already have some knowledge.  I'm not going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get into the discussion of how to gather this knowledge, since it's not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to humans trying to become rational; the AI researchers can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worry about that stuff.  ;-)  (This is not to say that how to gather new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge is not important to rationality, but how to gain the initial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge is a bit different than subsequent knowledge as I understand it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not really as I understand it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Irrational thinking can generate ideas that are later useful in rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thinking.  This is a subjective impression held by many many people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; quite thoroughly researched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  And if I play roulette long enough, I'll probably win (of course, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no statistical guarantee that this will eventually happen).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Through directed thinking you can increase your ability to find usable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas.  I'm not saying that random thought doesn't work, but that it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient and there are better ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not the same thing at all. I am very surprised by a 
<br>
self-proclaimed rational thinker apparently not dealing with the 
<br>
point at hand except to throw up defenses, bald assertions and 
<br>
very weak obfuscating analogies.  You write much better at other 
<br>
times so I am confused by this difference.
