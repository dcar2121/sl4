<p>I don't think that's all there is to it.   I think that science gets you in
<br>
the habit of having your emotionally dear ideas refuted by fact.  So it
<br>
prepares you emotionally for *any* of your dear ideas -- in any domain --
<br>
potentially being refuted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not rationality!

<em>&gt; What you are doing, Ben, is trying to moderate your irrationality.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no different than what those `rational' scientists do.  All this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows you to do is stumble onto rational conclusions more often than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think that moderating your own irrationality can be a very
<br>
rational act!!!
<br>
<p>I don't see *eliminating* my own irrationality as a viable prospect, except
<br>
thru radical neuromodification!  It can be *reduced*, and then what's left
<br>
can be *moderated*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider my earlier example with the Randians.  If I were thinking like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, I'd have a heuristic that would tell me to avoid getting into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments with them.  Consequently, I wouldn't ever discuss my thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Randianism with them.  This is just as irrational as arguing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every last one of them!  What is rational is to determine *why* you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to argue them and if it is a valid reason or just a rationalized reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generated by your brain.  This is what is essential to rationality:  you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have a heuristic to make you more rational in a given situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think the situation through rationally (using such tools as logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Bayesian statistics) and arrive at the most rational conclusion.
</em><br>
<p>You are proposing conscious rational inference above heuristics as a guide
<br>
for action.
<br>
<p>I think that human consciousness has limited bandwidth compared to human
<br>
unconscious.  In situations requiring the integration of a huge body of weak
<br>
pieces of evidence, conscious reasoning can't grapple, and you have to make
<br>
do with unconscious reasoning (aka intuition).  And ridding your unconscious
<br>
intuition of emotional biases is the hard part.
<br>
<p>It sounds like you're advocating conscious logical reasoning as the solution
<br>
to all problems.  But conscious logical reasoning only works when there are
<br>
a relatively few items of relevant information; otherwise the well-known
<br>
limitations on STM size come into play.
<br>
<p>Of course, the power of conscious logical reasoning is extended by tools
<br>
such as writing, diagramming, programming, and  mathematics.  However, even
<br>
with these tools, it is not as good at the human unconsciousdoing inference
<br>
based on a huge number of weak pieces of evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I sometimes question whether you have made the fundamental shift to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality and if you are just a very logical thinker.  At any rate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if you have, you have a *long* way to go to reach a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of rationality.  Or, a better way of putting it is that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't come very far.  I and Eliezer have come a long way, but there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still a long way to go, some of it very difficult because it's attacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very fundamental ways of human thought.  I hope that my book, when done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will serve to bring people along to greater degrees of rationality.
</em><br>
<p>Based on my interactions with both of you (and I've interacted with Eli
<br>
significantly more than with you), I do not believe that either of you is
<br>
significantly more rational than I am.
<br>
<p>I've seen you each make many judgments that seemed to me purely emotional...
<br>
<p>I *have* met a few people who I thought were more consistently rational than
<br>
I am.  The most rational person I know is Cassio Pennachin, my chief
<br>
collaborator on Novamente.  That guy has astoundingly, consistently good
<br>
judgment.  Jeff Pressing, a former collaborator who unfortunately died
<br>
recently, was also a tremendously consistently rational individual.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, though, I have not yet met anyone who
<br>
<p>a) seemed to me to be more rational than myself
<br>
b) also seemed to me to be roughly as creative as myself -- or even *almost*
<br>
as creative as myself
<br>
<p>I believe that high levels of creativity often go along with willful or
<br>
automatic suspensions of rationality.  (Of course, this may be rational on a
<br>
meta level: one may find that it is rational to sometimes let yourself be
<br>
irrational!)  But when a mind spends a lot of  &quot;creative time&quot; pursuing
<br>
unlikely, irrational trains of thought, it often has difficulty shifting
<br>
back into a less creative but more rational mode.  I have seen this in very
<br>
many others, as well as myself.
