</em><br>
<p>This is an excellent summary to which I must make only one amendment:  If 
<br>
there *is* a cosmic truth of morality - something which we would 
<br>
universally recognize, if confronted with it, as the Meaning of Life - 
<br>
then it may be that humans are only programmed to *seek* that truth as a 
<br>
consequence of their particular design.  In particular, we use the 
<br>
correspondence theory of truth with respect to moral beliefs, enabling us 
<br>
to conceive of a *right answer* in moral domains.
<br>
<p>In other words, it's possible that even if there is a true Meaning of Life 
<br>
that transcends human individuals and even humanity as a species, you 
<br>
still need a certain kind of goal system in order to *care* enough about 
<br>
this to want to reprogram your goal system into correspondence with the 
<br>
Meaning of Life once you've found it.  Two plus two equals four; this is a 
<br>
truth that exists beyond individuals and beyond our species, but you can't 
<br>
argue a chatbot into believing it if the chatbot is programmed to do 
<br>
nothing except repeat the phrase &quot;two plus two equals five&quot;.
<br>
<p>Thus Friendliness does not rely on the judgement that it is &quot;unlikely&quot; 
<br>
that human minds are attuned to a cosmic truth.  It does not even rely on 
<br>
the judgement that reaching this cosmic truth requires starting with a 
<br>
goal system that, like humans, would care about a cosmic truth if it found 
<br>
one.  It can rest on the idea that if human preconditions actually 
<br>
*prevent* the recognition of a cosmic truth, then, by hypothesis, the 
<br>
truth in question is one that you and I would not see as relevant to 
<br>
morality - if you construct a scenario where a relevant truth exists, then 
<br>
the simple fact that you see it as relevant means that human thinking 
<br>
doesn't block the perception of the relevance of that class of truths.  In 
<br>
that sense, Friendliness is safe.  If the moral thing to do is construct 
<br>
an AI with a blank slate, and the morality of this course of action is 
<br>
even in theory perceptible to humans, than the first Friendly AI can do 
<br>
the moral thing and build a blank-slate AI.  Or if the cosmic truth 
<br>
underlying the human morality is universally accessible, Friendly AI may 
<br>
turn out to have been a waste of effort, but it won't actually have *hurt* 
<br>
anything.
