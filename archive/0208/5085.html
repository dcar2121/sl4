Personally, I have problems with the implied premise that 
<br>
rationality is the end and be all of human consciousness.  I 
<br>
believe it is very important and foundational but I do not 
<br>
believe it is penultimate. I usually find the way people speak 
<br>
of it and defend it and especially defend against any notion 
<br>
that it might not be the hightest end-good of sentience, 
<br>
decidely circular.  It looks a bit like another memeset defended 
<br>
vigourously against all others.  It cannot integrate with other 
<br>
memes easily unless it can dominate or consume them into itself.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>In point of fact many of the most stringent holders of the 
<br>
rational-is-triumphant meme are socially coercive and 
<br>
dismissive. This does not in any way downplay the tremendous 
<br>
importance of rationality.  But there is a difference in fully 
<br>
employing rationality as a tool and believing it is the greatest 
<br>
and hightest good besides which all other aspects of 
<br>
consciousness and ways of being and knowing are pitifully 
<br>
second-rate if they are not contemptible.  Note the stridency 
<br>
that often ensues.  It is very reminiscent of the stridency of 
<br>
most any true believer that they and they alone have &quot;the Way&quot;. 
<br>
I think some of the Spiral Dynamics folks may be on to 
<br>
something. The rational &quot;Orange&quot; level is essential to human 
<br>
consciousness development and our current (at least western 
<br>
society is dominated by it).  However, it is still within the 
<br>
pattern of denigrating almost all else but itself and thinking 
<br>
that it is the &quot;final&quot; stage.  I think rationality plus a lot of 
<br>
self honesty and examination flowers into more than rationality 
<br>
alone.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Now how the heck do you dig someone out of *that* hole?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know.  I don't even have any evidence that it's possible.  Not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only have I never personally succeeded in doing it, I've never seen it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's perfectly okay if someone wants to explain what, specifically, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong with my rationality, but this thing of distrusting rationality in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general... it gives me the cold chills.  (I have the following specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to suspect I may be irrational in this instance: my negative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction is created by the instinctive relation of negative reactions to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past aversive reinforcement, and I am expressing this negative reaction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in speech that seems instinctively appropriate.  This may be the wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation to the actions that would be rationally appropriate, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't think of any specific correction to make.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't distrust rationality. I distrust the near-worship of 
<br>
rationality as if it were more than it is.
