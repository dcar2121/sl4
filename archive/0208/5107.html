<em>&gt; &gt; Firstly, Gordon, I would like to invite you to define or describe what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean by &quot;rationality&quot; as clearly as you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I'm going to try to do this.  This is a bit like asking a Buddha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to define enlightenment, though.  :-P
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationality is a qualitative change in thinking.  It is characterized by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the consistent use of logical thought and Bayesian reasoning and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disuse of evolved thinking (in all it's forms:  intuition as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonly understood, rationalization, pseudo logic, etc.).  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate all irrational thought, and what is left is pure rationality.
</em><br>
<p>I think of rational inference as a kind of &quot;evolved thought&quot;....  Where else
<br>
do you think it came from?
<br>
<p>I don't believe it's possible to eliminate all irrational thought from a
<br>
human brain.  I am willing to be proved wrong, but I can't think of exactly
<br>
how such a proof would be executed prior to having a full understanding of
<br>
brain function and highly accurate brain scanners.  I guess I'd be almost
<br>
convinced if I met someone who qualitatively seemed to demonstrate pure and
<br>
perfect rationality, but I have never met that person.
<br>
<p>Of course, I've never met you ;-)
<br>
<p>So, when I sit down to improvise at the piano, as a rationalist would I have
<br>
to reason about which note to play next?
<br>
<p>When writing an article, should I reason consciously &amp; logically about which
<br>
sentence to type next?
<br>
<p>What about &quot;going with the flow&quot;?  This seems to me to be a very efficient
<br>
algorithm for producing good stuff.  Reason seems to enter into such
<br>
processes mainly
<br>
<p>* to judge things afterwards
<br>
*when a particularly tricky spot comes up
<br>
<p>If I had to consciously, logically reason about every note I played on the
<br>
piano, or every sentence I wrote, then I would not get to do much of
<br>
anything with my time...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe now you see why any use of irrational thinking bothers me.  Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can keep using irrational thought processes, but you will only ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain so much rationality, and it will be tenuous since you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintaining a tie to irrational thoughts when you know that you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be trying to eliminate them.
</em><br>
<p>I don't &quot;know&quot; or even believe that I should be trying to eliminate them.
<br>
<p>I think that nonrational thinking is highly adaptive for me and other human
<br>
organisms.  It needs to be kept in balance with rational thought, and the
<br>
different aspects of both rational &amp; nonrational thought need to be kept in
<br>
balance with each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Secondly, I think everyone understands that rationality is a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I sometimes see comments that suggest otherwise, so I want to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that it's clear.  Even if you're clear on it, someone else on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list might not be (I think that we're probably talking above the heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of most of the list, but I could be wrong).
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that.  Actually, compared to many topics on this list, this topic is
<br>
not very obscure at all.  It pertains to &quot;folk psychology&quot; and cognitive
<br>
psychology -- to the experience of having and using a mind, which is
<br>
something we all share.  Unlike some of the more techie topics we've pursued
<br>
on the list, such as the inner workings of various AI systems ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What Samantha and I seem to both be arguing, is that there are large and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful portions of the brain which this particular way of thinking does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engage.  And there are other, complementary, nonrational ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that are also highly worthwhile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They produce usable results sometimes.  This does not mean this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most efficient use of your brain.
</em><br>
<p>It is true, the pragmatic usefulness of nonrational thoughts does not PROVE
<br>
that a thought process incorporating nonrationality is maximally efficient
<br>
for the human brain.
<br>
<p>However, I nevertheless believe that a thought process incorporating *some
<br>
nonzero degree* of nonrationality is maximally efficient for the human
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>How large this nonzero degree is, I don't know.  It's context-dependent for
<br>
sure.
<br>
<p>And whether this holds for nonhumanlike AI systems, I also don't know.
<br>
<p>I do know that in the Novamente design, we've had to make some compromises
<br>
that effectively make Novamente irrational in some cases and contexts.
<br>
Because to preserve pure rationality in all contexts is not computationally
<br>
plausible.
<br>
<p>Now, you may say this proves Novamente is an inadequate or suboptimal AI
<br>
design.  I am sure it is suboptimal, but I hope it is not inadequate!  And I
<br>
encourage you or Eliezer or anyone else to propose a detailed design for an
<br>
AI mind that is thoroughly rational, designed to achieve high levels of
<br>
creativity without any significant nonrational elements ;)
