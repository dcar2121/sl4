<em>&gt; It probably is indeed inefficient to apply visual programming to heavily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic environments, but it might be vastly better suited to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming paradigms. Can this idea be dismissed so quickly?
</em><br>
<p>People have been trying to make CASE tools and such work for a long time.
<br>
<p>The visual-arrangement metaphor is just not as well-suited as language for
<br>
presenting extremely complex combinations of concepts.  I think this is
<br>
shown by experience as well as by common sense.
<br>
<p>Visual programming is one of those ideas that sounds better than it works.
<br>
<p>Sorta like the idea of recording music by humming the notes instead of using
<br>
your fingers on an instrument.  Sure, it seems easier at first, if you have
<br>
the proper tech.  But ultimately, humming isn't going to give you the
<br>
ability to play Shostakovich or Yngwie Malmsteen within a reasonable amount
<br>
of effort...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I again urge readers to ignore the emotive statements and arguments on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the website and focus on the idea of a temporal-signal-based approach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software and the technical merits of the proposed implementation (COSA).
</em><br>
<p>I tried to do that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that pure signal-based systems would not be the best tools for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most software tasks. I think the challenge comes in figuring out where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could best be applied (which may not always be obvious) and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring out how to integrate them with existing algorithmic systems.
</em><br>
<p>I think that signal-based systems are more naturally *evolved* than
<br>
programmed.
<br>
<p>I think the best use for such systems is in carrying out real-world
<br>
categorizations and actions, as in the &quot;training neural nets&quot; paradigm.
<br>
<p>However, the theme of the website is that signal-driven systems are more
<br>
reliable, and that, I just don't believe holds up except in very narrow and
<br>
simple domains, and even there only against straw-man algorithmic systems.
<br>
(I.e., simple signal-driven systems may seem robust compared to C programs,
<br>
but not against mathematically rigorously developed algorithmic systems.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A new question for thought: It seems that a complex signal-based system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would be difficult for humans to conceive could be conceived by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently specialised AI software (e.g. a codic cortex).
</em><br>
<p>Since humans have a hard time understanding each others' code anyway, I
<br>
think that ANY complex code written by an intelligent nonhuman is going to
<br>
be essentially impossible for us to understand.
