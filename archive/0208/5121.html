</em><br>
<p>Just because some part of your brain is not readily aware to you does 
<br>
not mean that it is necessarily irrational.  When I'm talking about 
<br>
irrational parts of the brain, I'm referring to the deep parts of your 
<br>
brain that are responsible for such things as pushing you towards better 
<br>
reproductive action through the generation of emotions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; weaker than others, but connections none the less.  You first explore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strong connections for new ideas, and if they fail, you try weaker 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; connections.  Eventually, you hope to reach some new connection that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; no one realized before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And where does one understanding of or finding or appreciating the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections come from?  Where do flashes of association between things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have never conciously connected at all come from?  &lt;blank out&gt; Do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you consciously leap across an unknown connection to an unknown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destination?
</em><br>
<p>This is just the way the brain works.  Sometimes it makes very weak 
<br>
connections that look random (I doubt the randomness of the brain).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Irrational thinking can generate ideas that are later useful in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking.  This is a subjective impression held by many many people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; quite thoroughly researched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sure.  And if I play roulette long enough, I'll probably win (of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; course, there is no statistical guarantee that this will eventually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happen).  Through directed thinking you can increase your ability to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; find usable ideas.  I'm not saying that random thought doesn't work, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but that it's inefficient and there are better ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not the same thing at all. I am very surprised by a self-proclaimed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational thinker apparently not dealing with the point at hand except 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to throw up defenses, bald assertions and very weak obfuscating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogies.  You write much better at other times so I am confused by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this difference.
</em><br>
<p>See Eliezer's recent e-mails.  He explains much better than I have been 
<br>
why this insistence on random thought is getting the reaction from me 
<br>
that it is.  It is like you are saying that Bayesian reasoning is 
<br>
useless and just picking anything at random.  If you did that, you'd 
<br>
think slower than I do!  ;-)
