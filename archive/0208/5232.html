<p>I don't know.  But if you were in the midst of one of these 
<br>
experiences I think you would laugh yourself silly attempting to 
<br>
see it as somehow &quot;Bayesian&quot;. :-)

</em><br>
<p>OK. That is better. Yes, sometimes some of it can be 
<br>
&quot;stepped-down&quot; to the level of a Bayesian observer.  But I don't 
<br>
think all of it can and I do not believe the parts that can't 
<br>
are thereby without value.
