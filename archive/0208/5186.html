<em>&gt; My working assumption has been that, to pursue rationality, I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifice my individual right to have wrong opinions and regard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as being either &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; according to how well they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspond to reality.  The mere fact that a belief is &quot;mine&quot;, apart from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its causal history, is not evidence about its truth or falsity; therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this naked fact is not relevant to rational reasoning.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it plays a large role in various arational/irrational social cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And to anticipate your obvious response to this, you are free to assume,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you like, that I have not succeeded in counteracting these social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms.  But it is nonetheless what someone pursuing the truth would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to do.  No?
</em><br>
<p>Probably 90% of us on this list consistently make the same effort to seek
<br>
the &quot;truth&quot; and overcome this biological and cultural predispositions that
<br>
hamper us in our higher goals
<br>
<p>In order to do this, one does not have to agree with YOU on the handiest
<br>
definitions of all terms, nor on anything else ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; For instance, as I've argued, there needs to be, in any finite system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; within the universe, some non-prob-inference process for adapting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; universal set U used in the system's prob-inference processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does it work nonaccidentally?  Or is it entirely random?  If it works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonaccidentally, some form of rationality is behind it
</em><br>
<p>As I clarified in another e-mail, the crux of the matter seems to be that,
<br>
in order to be effective overall (what you'd call Rational overall), a
<br>
system may need to have some subcomponent that does not, viewed in
<br>
isolation, appear to be operating rationally at all...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you like it or not.
</em><br>
<p>In this little phraselet, you are suggesting that the reason I don't agree
<br>
with you about the nature of the mind is that I emotionally don't &quot;like&quot;
<br>
rationality.
<br>
<p>It feels to me, rather, like YOU are the one who is emotionally
<br>
(irrationally?) attached to your idea of rationality.
<br>
<p>But I suggest that it's better to stick to the issues rather than to attempt
<br>
to probe into each others' minds.  At this primitive moment in history, we
<br>
lack the instrumentation to do such a thing properly!!!
