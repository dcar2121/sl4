At 08:39 AM 8/3/02 +0000, Mitchell Porter  wrote interestingly on my
<br>
suggestion:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[i.e. could the migration of superintelligences into baby universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somehow quantum-mechanically suppress the probability of future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularities?]
</em><br>
<p>I appreciate your comments. This gets off topic, perhaps, but for the fun
<br>
of it all, I'll follow up your closing aside:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you had a quantum computer buried in a meteorite, i.e. (in many-worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms) suppose you had a coherent multiversal ensemble of them. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppose that in some fraction of those worlds, the meteorite ends up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;falling into a baby universe just as it becomes causally separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the parent universe. There's no real reason to think that that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of the ensemble would suddenly decohere from the rest. Instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'd expect a gradual differentiation of the two sub-ensembles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meteorites, due to the different average environmental conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they faced, leading to eventual decoherence.
</em><br>
<p>In an attempt to clarify my original post, I thought of this gedanken,
<br>
which differs from the vanished meteorite but has some vague similarities:
<br>
<p>Suppose a micro black hole could pass your two-slit apparatus as an
<br>
experiment is being conducted. Now this black hole had 1 chance in 2 (or in
<br>
5, or whatever) of doing so, because in our world it came past Jupiter, and
<br>
we know planetary orbits are chaotic, so in some contiguous MW universes
<br>
Jupiter is also where we see it but in many others it's not. Say in your
<br>
cosmos the hole misses you, having been flung out of the solar system, but
<br>
in half the other superposed universes that are otherwise identical (or
<br>
even in most of them) it whizzed in and gobbled up the test photons (and
<br>
perhaps the lab as well). Now what happens to the diffraction pattern? If
<br>
Deutsch's `QT-as-literal-truth' model is right, I think it looks rather
<br>
odd, but I'm not sure how exactly. Thinned out? Entirely suppressed? Or
<br>
exactly as usual, because the `black holes passes' strands decohered days
<br>
ago, at Jupiter?
