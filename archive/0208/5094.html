</em><br>
<em>&gt; inextricably bound up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with human emotion, which is also irrational.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think you are using &quot;intuition&quot; the same way as the pedestrian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vernacular.  There is both rational and irrational intuition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specify a definition, you are not being clear.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that the common vernacular use of &quot;intuition&quot; mixes up the two.
<br>
<p>My sense is very close to the first dictionary.com senses:
<br>
<p>**
<br>
-- The act or faculty of knowing or sensing without the use of rational
<br>
processes; immediate cognition.
<br>
-- A sense of something not evident or deducible; an impression.
<br>
**
<br>
<p>Except I would modify the definition to
<br>
<p>&quot;The act or faculty of knowing or sensing without the use of *conscious*
<br>
rational processes.&quot;
<br>
<p>because I believe that much (but not all) of unconscious intuitive
<br>
processing is actually rational/inferential in nature.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; An irrational intuition/belief is one where the premise(s) have a null
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior.  A rational intuition/belief is one where the premise(s) have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-null prior.  While you may not be able to &quot;prove&quot; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief/intuition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this framework, you can reasonably assert the rationality IF you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate valid priors for the premises regardless of a lack of evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the specific position.
</em><br>
<p>There are two problems with this analysis
<br>
<p>1) There are really almost NO intuitions in the human mind that have &quot;null
<br>
priors&quot; in the sense of not being based on any evidence at all.  If there
<br>
were, we'd have no way to identify them, to distinguish them from intuitions
<br>
based on unconscious evidence.
<br>
<p>2) Most of the irrationality in intuition comes in the form of emotional
<br>
bias driving thousands to millions of unconscious speculative inference
<br>
steps, whose answers are then compiled into a single intuitive impression
<br>
presenting itself to the conscious mind
<br>
<p>So I don't think that an analysis in terms of prior information really cuts
<br>
to the heart of the matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you've actually evaluated the priors in any type of rigorous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes &quot;reasoning&quot; and &quot;rational&quot; no matter how weak the association.
</em><br>
<p>What if the priors are numerous but weak so that to really grasp them you'd
<br>
need to be able to simultaneously process a million items?
<br>
<p>Then your consciousness can't handle the priors, only your unconscious
<br>
can....  So the only reasoning your mind can do is the &quot;intuitive&quot; kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essence, &quot;intuition&quot; is short for &quot;talking out your ass&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typically used.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps among the people you associate with, this is the sense of the word
<br>
&quot;intuition.&quot;
<br>
<p>But it is not the dictionary sense and nor it is the sense used by people I
<br>
know (which is a broad group: AI theorists, artists, musicians, writers,
<br>
deodorant company executives, biologists, and so forth...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For all intents and purposes, &quot;intuition&quot; in an AI would be more correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;low probability reasoning&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It's not low probability reasoning that I'm talking about -- you can have
<br>
conscious, deliberate low probability reasoning.
<br>
<p>It's reasoning based on the integration of a huge number of weak pieces of
<br>
evidence.  This is the kind of reasoning that consciousness cannot handle.
<br>
In humans.  Whether consciousness will be able to handle it in AI's is an
<br>
interesting question.  I think the answer will be no, for a while.  But
<br>
post-Singularity I'm not going to venture a guess....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think most reasoning in humans from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; null priors is caused by biological biases in the wetware, not as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrinsic function of computing machinery.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with your analysis of intuitive reasoning in terms of &quot;null
<br>
priors.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that human intuition is partly directed by emotional and biological
<br>
biases, and partly by inferential processes tuned to handle large amounts of
<br>
weak evidence in an efficient and pragmatic, parallel-processing sort of
<br>
way.
