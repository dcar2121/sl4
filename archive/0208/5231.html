</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;name any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;specific one, I will undertake to show how rationality underlies it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it's not a matter of &quot;tweaking&quot;... it's a matter of an overwhelming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of creative inspiration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many creative people have experienced forms and ideas pouring out as if from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some unknown inner source. Forms streaming, emanating, exploding -- so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster and more elegantly fit together than if they were consciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoned out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I started with Beethoven, but I don't know that much about his creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, so I'll shift to someone I'm more familiar with...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most striking description of the creative experience I have seen was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his autobiography, Ecce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Homo:
</em><br>
<p><p>I do not get what Nietzche or Phillip K. Dick speaks of as 
<br>
often, but I have had similar experiences a few times in my 
<br>
life.  They are monstrously overpowering.  Much of my own 
<br>
technical creativity, why not of that kind, seems often to come 
<br>
from a similar no-thought sort of place and come in a much more 
<br>
rarified form that then has to be &quot;stepped-down&quot; to the level of 
<br>
concepts, logic, engineering.  It is exceedingly difficult to 
<br>
describe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;March 20, 1974: It seized me entirely, lifting me from the limitations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the space-time matrix; it mastered me as, at the same instant, I knew that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world around me was cardboard, a fake. Through its power I saw suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe as it was; through its power and perception I saw what really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existed, and through its power of no- thought decision, I acted to free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself....&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I know what that is like.  During the one such I felt as 
<br>
if so much information was instantaneously pumped into me that 
<br>
it would take several lifetimes to downstep a small part of it 
<br>
to human communicable form.  It left me trembling in a deep 
<br>
state of awe.  It is very, very hard to not be somewhat mystical 
<br>
when things like this occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In no way is this sort of shit &quot;tweaking&quot;, and in no way is it *consciously*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced as any kind of rational calculation about how to create a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it rooted in unconscious inference operations?  Partly, but also in a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other unconscious noninferential operations, including some damn mixed-up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational emotional ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I will not even begin to attempt to &quot;explain&quot; some of the more 
<br>
intense states I have experienced or have heard of in others.  I 
<br>
have made the attempt many, many times and none of my or other's 
<br>
*explanations* seem remotely adequate.  Some things I have to 
<br>
grant that neither I nor anyone I know of is currently capable 
<br>
of explaining.  That is not an *happy* conclusion - not what I 
<br>
would *prefer*.  But there it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does this kind unconscious irrationality contribute to the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectiveness (what you call Rationality) of the person embodying it?  Sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche wouldn't have created his philosophy, Dick wouldn't have created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his novels, without these unconscious, wildly irrational processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure it makes sense to even measure such on the same 
<br>
rationality scale at all?  I'm not.  Parts of them seem quite 
<br>
orthogonal to a rational-irrational dimension.  The Real flows 
<br>
freely through the bars of our word category cages.
