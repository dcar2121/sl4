</em><br>
<p><p>Sure.  Actually many have argued that there are at least two 
<br>
major currents in all religions as they are practiced.  One 
<br>
current is toward transcendence while the other current is much 
<br>
as you say.  Sometimes I think that the &quot;accept everything 
<br>
because it isn't important&quot; current is a perversion of the other 
<br>
current - a wishing so hard that transcendence is that it is 
<br>
assumed to be automatic and to make much else irrelevant.  This 
<br>
twist is even visible in some people's relationship to the 
<br>
concept of Singularity.  But this last may have been colored by 
<br>
existing religious cultural viewpoints.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; Show them how to do that and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; how to help themselves to social benefits and worldview cohesion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; type things they also get from religion without the relgious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SA&gt; artifacts and I think you will get more than a few &quot;converts&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I follow what you mean by &quot;worldview cohesion type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things&quot; -- that the idea of Singularity creates a more cohesive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worldview, and so can fulfill some of religion's function?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I was being too terse and not very expressive at that.  One of 
<br>
the things people get from religion is a cohesive world view 
<br>
that ties together sense of value, sense of well-being, 
<br>
belonging, meaning, ethics, and is the organizing core for all 
<br>
else.  It is not automatic that all of these things that are 
<br>
widely prized can be gotten from the idea of Singularity.  I 
<br>
believe it is doable to erect a rational framework that includes 
<br>
Singularity that does address many of these apparent needs.  But 
<br>
this framework is not as automatically comforting, and imo 
<br>
shouldn't be, as what most religions serve up.
