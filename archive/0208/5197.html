<em>&gt; What, specifically, is happening here that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside the domain of evolved intuitions and trained intuitions?  What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening here that is outside the domain of genetic learning and neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning of regularities in reality?  Where does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationality come in?
</em><br>
<p>Well, my subjective impression is that Dick's hallucinations of a
<br>
super-rational AI feeding information into his brain, were pretty damn
<br>
irrational.  I feel the same way about his conviction that we actually live
<br>
in the time of 100AD or so, but are deluded into thinking we live around
<br>
2000 AD instead.  I think the guy was half-nuts, to use a technical term...
<br>
<p>Personally, I will call this stuff irrational, not just non-rational ;)
<br>
<p>Even though these delusions were part of an overall mind that was very
<br>
effective, and were closely connected to important aspects of that mind's
<br>
effectiveness -- I will STILL call them irrational.  Considered in
<br>
themselves, they are really terribly irrational, according to all standard
<br>
uses of that word.
<br>
<p>And I think this stuff lies WAY outside the domain of &quot;neural learning of
<br>
regularities in reality&quot;.
<br>
<p>I suppose that, as part of our ability to learn regularities in reality, we
<br>
have emerged a strong capability to create complex hypothetical concepts --
<br>
which may then be tested to see if they reflect regularities in reality.
<br>
<p>What seems to have happened in Dick's mind is that the
<br>
complex-hypothetical-concept-generator ran amok, generating a huge variety
<br>
of funky stuff that would never stand up to empirical testing (and that
<br>
didn't really make him very happy either).
<br>
<p>It happens that, due to other properties of his brain, he was able to use
<br>
this concept-generation-run-amok to create great art.  This is not the case
<br>
with most people who conceive really nutty ideas; what we see in Dick (and
<br>
many others) is partly a chance confluence of artistic ability with
<br>
nuttiness, and then the synthesis of the two in a single mind...
<br>
<p>One might claim that the capability for concept-generation-running-amok has
<br>
arisen as a part of evolutionary learning, and that evolution was being
<br>
rational in giving us minds that are sometimes capable of incredibly
<br>
irrationality. [Because in doing so, it also gave us the capability for very
<br>
productive creativity.]  Actually I attribute the creation of the modern
<br>
mind more to a combination of genetic drift and cultural self-organization,
<br>
than to evolutionary selection per se, but that's a side point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Would they have created better philosophy and fiction without these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrational processes, following a purely rational (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrower sense)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; internal methodology?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, *no human ever has*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what?  As I keep trying to say, rationality has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberation.  I am not talking about rationality in the narrow sense.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that's a wholly useless and in fact actively harmful sense.
</em><br>
<p>So you reject the sense of the term &quot;rational&quot; in which Dick's
<br>
hallucinations of a superintelligent AI orbiting the Earth beaming
<br>
information into his apartment, are &quot;irrational&quot;.   That's your right, but
<br>
it forbids the common use of the term &quot;irrational.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even after he became wealthy from royalties from Blade Runner, he refused to
<br>
move from his ratty apartment because it was where the AI satellite from
<br>
afar was allegedly beaming the information...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In the human brain, some sorts of creative achievement seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rampant internal irrationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, some sorts of creative achievement seem to go along with rampant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal nondeliberation, perhaps even nondeliberative activities that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create warped deliberative thought processes as side effects.  It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that the nonaccidental successes are rationally incomprehensible -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is not possible for a Bayesian observer to understand how they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, and why they work, and conceivably employ a process of that type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberately in order to arrive at the same answer.
</em><br>
<p>It's been tried....  Rimbaud is one poet who tried to drive himself nuts --
<br>
partly by taking drugs, but also by other means -- in an attempt to put
<br>
himself in a state of artistic information.  He sought &quot;the systematic
<br>
disorganization of all the senses.&quot;  I guess he succeeded, though he fucked
<br>
himself up personally in the process...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But as said before, I am quite uninterested in the narrow sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality.  I've known since the age of eleven that that's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality is about.  If it were, I would be forced to ignore all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoming information from my visual cortex because the process happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nondeliberatively.  In fact, I would be forced to ignore my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberative thoughts because they are made up of nondeliberative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components.  Calling deliberation by the *normative* name, &quot;rationality&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means losing track of which deliberations are rational and which rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes are nondeliberative.  Using the word &quot;rationality&quot; to refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberation carves up reality at the wrong joints, like the phlogiston
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of combustion.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I can see that using &quot;rationality&quot; to refer purely to deliberative
<br>
logical thought, as I have sometimes done, is overly narrow.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I feel that defining &quot;rationality&quot; in a way that
<br>
encompasses Phil Dick's whacked hallucinatory delusions, is overly broad...
<br>
