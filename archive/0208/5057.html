<em>&gt;Suppose a micro black hole could pass your two-slit apparatus as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiment is being conducted. Now this black hole had 1 chance in 2 (or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;5, or whatever) of doing so, because in our world it came past Jupiter, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we know planetary orbits are chaotic, so in some contiguous MW universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jupiter is also where we see it but in many others it's not. Say in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cosmos the hole misses you, having been flung out of the solar system, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in half the other superposed universes that are otherwise identical (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even in most of them) it whizzed in and gobbled up the test photons (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps the lab as well). Now what happens to the diffraction pattern? If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Deutsch's `QT-as-literal-truth' model is right, I think it looks rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;odd, but I'm not sure how exactly. Thinned out? Entirely suppressed? Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly as usual, because the `black holes passes' strands decohered days
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago, at Jupiter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<p>First I should explain how I conceive of the many worlds interacting.
<br>
For several years I've criticized Deutsch for his 'interactionist'
<br>
statements about many worlds (i.e. that things happen a certain way
<br>
here because of the way they are over there), on the grounds that there
<br>
is no exact formulation of QM in those terms. I was all set to write
<br>
another such missive here, but I did in fact think of a way that it
<br>
*might* be done, so I decided to go with that.
<br>
<p>Start with the Bohmian perspective. There you have a 'pilot wave'
<br>
(which is just the QM wavefunction), and a pseudoclassical state
<br>
trajectory that is wholly determined by the wave. For example, you
<br>
might have a 3D wavefunction, and a point particle moving in 3
<br>
dimensions. Or, you might have a 'wavefunction of the universe',
<br>
stretching over all possible combinations of spacetime geometry
<br>
and field state, and a 'classical' space-time history in which
<br>
geometry and fields always take specific values, and their evolution
<br>
is determined by the universal wavefunction.
<br>
<p>In Bohmian mechanics, specifying the wavefunction only tells half
<br>
the story, you also have to specify the state in which the guided
<br>
system begins (e.g., for a particle, that means location). A given
<br>
pilot wave corresponds to a *family* of histories. In an appendix
<br>
to his PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY, Tipler takes this to show that the
<br>
Everett interpretation is hiding even inside the Bohm interpretation.
<br>
I think they're still worlds apart, but however that may be, there
<br>
would still remain a problem for someone trying to derive an
<br>
*interactionist* many worlds theory, because according to the
<br>
equations of motion, each of the Bohmian worlds takes its cue
<br>
solely from the shared pilot wave; the other worlds have no influence
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p>So my answer is to suppose that the ensemble of Bohmian worlds alone
<br>
can substitute for the pilot wave, i.e. that it always contains enough
<br>
information to determine the pilot wave. If you can do that, then you
<br>
can rewrite the Bohmian equations of motion so that, where they refer
<br>
to the pilot wave, instead they refer to some aggregated property of
<br>
the ensemble of pseudoclassical worlds. If you can do that, then you
<br>
really can have a many-worlds theory in which the worlds are directly
<br>
influencing each other. On top of the usual Bohmian problem of finding
<br>
a relativistic formulation, there is now the added problem or novelty
<br>
of 'trans-world simultaneity', but at least we (or I) would be able
<br>
to say exactly what &quot;inter-world interaction&quot; refers to.
<br>
<p>Now, back to the scenario of 'rogue black hole eats double-slit
<br>
apparatus in half the worlds, what happens to the interference
<br>
pattern in yours'. In this Bohm-derived framework, what happens
<br>
in your world depends only on your 'neighborhood in configuration
<br>
space', i.e. only on what happens in worlds that differ minutely
<br>
from yours. And another important feature is that 'the neighborhood
<br>
is always full'. As some worlds diverge from you, others will flow
<br>
in. (This all derives straightforwardly from the properties of
<br>
Bohmian trajectories and how they relate to the pilot wave.)
<br>
<p>The worlds where the black hole ate the experiment have diverged
<br>
from your multiversal neighborhood (where the experiment still
<br>
gets to happen) and are no longer relevant, I'm confident of that
<br>
much... But as for what happens to the interference pattern, I'm
<br>
really not sure. 'Thinned out' seems plausible. I might get back
<br>
to you on this ... offlist.
