<p>You can know that your own thoughts are rational up to a point.  Most 
<br>
FoRs (failure of rationality, with apologies to Eliezer) can be detected 
<br>
if you watch what your thinking.
<br>
<p>For example, today I was tempted to argue with some Randians who had a 
<br>
little table with information set up.  Then, however, I considered why I 
<br>
would do this.  The first answer produced was &quot;to inform them that they 
<br>
are wrong and point them in the right direction&quot;.  Looking a little 
<br>
deeper, though, I could see that this wasn't actually my reason.  My 
<br>
reason was that they are `them', I'm `us', and it's time to kick the 
<br>
other tribe's ass.  Giving the Randians some more information was my 
<br>
rationalized goal to convince me that I would still be doing something 
<br>
moral.  I overcame my brain and didn't bother with them.
<br>
<p>[Hey, I just noticed that if you drop the `n' from `Randians', I like 
<br>
them a lot more.  ;-)]
<br>
<p>In other words, you should look at why it is you think AI is so close.  
<br>
Is it because you see it as the best way of extending your life?
<br>
<p>To be fair, though, you aren't likely to catch every FoR.  Some of them 
<br>
are very deeply rooted and take a lot of training to recognize and root 
<br>
out.  I know I don't catch them all (some I recognize but am not yet 
<br>
able to prevent without massive effort).
<br>
<p>On the actual topic of this message, real AI does seem to be near.  
<br>
There are several very smart people working very hardly on it and even 
<br>
more helping to generate funding.  Furthermore, I and others estimate 
<br>
that if GIAI is possible, we'll be able to brute force it within 20 
<br>
years or so.  There is only a problem if you think AI is coming not 
<br>
because it will be technologically possible but because it will save 
<br>
humanity or some other such thing (I hope that we will be able to use AI 
<br>
to save humanity and that's a good reason to work on it, but that's not 
<br>
a reason why it will happen).
