<p>BG&gt; &quot;One Novamente can't simply &quot;transfer a thought&quot; to another Novamente.  The
<br>
BG&gt; problem is that the meaning of an atom consists largely of its relationships
<br>
BG&gt; with other atoms, and so to pass a node to another Novamente, it also has to
<br>
BG&gt; pass the atoms that it is related to, and so on, and so on.  Atomspaces tend
<br>
BG&gt; to be densely interconnected, and so to transmit one thought accurately, a
<br>
BG&gt; Novamente system is going to end up having to transmit a copy of its entire
<br>
BG&gt; Atomspace!  Even if privacy were not an issue, this form of communication
<br>
BG&gt; (each utterance coming packaged with a whole mind-copy) would present rather
<br>
BG&gt; severe processing load on the communicators involved.
<br>
<p>BG&gt; &quot;The idea of Psynese is to work around this interconnectedness problem by
<br>
BG&gt; defining a Psynese vocabulary: a collection of atoms, associated with a
<br>
BG&gt; community of Novamentes, approximating the most important atoms inside that
<br>
BG&gt; community.  The combinatorial explosion of direct-Atomspace communication is
<br>
BG&gt; then halted by an appeal to standardized Psynese atoms.  Pragmatically, a
<br>
BG&gt; PsyneseVocabulary is contained in a PsyneseVocabulary server, a special
<br>
BG&gt; Novamente that exists to mediate communications between other Novamentes,
<br>
BG&gt; and provide Novamentes with information.&quot;
<br>
<p>This sounds not all that different from human language to me.  In
<br>
order for the above to be useful, there needs (it seems to me) to be a
<br>
set of &quot;common&quot; atoms -- i.e., a more or less similar set of
<br>
structures in each Novamente brain.  But it is in that &quot;more or less&quot;
<br>
qualifier that we find the similarity to the vagueness of human
<br>
language -- that is to say, I expect when I say &quot;language&quot; that some
<br>
&quot;more or less&quot; similar neural structures get activated in your brain
<br>
as do in mine.
<br>
<p>I can see where it's arguable that some future AI will be able to
<br>
introspect /better/ or /more honestly/ than humans can, but not where
<br>
such introspection can be perfect (any consciousness cannot contain
<br>
a full representation of its own inner workings simply because those
<br>
are by necessity more detailed).  Similarly, I cannot see where any
<br>
sort of language can be &quot;fully&quot; representational or accurate.  I'll
<br>
buy that an inter-AI language could be &quot;more accurate&quot;, at
<br>
least to some extent.  How non-linear that needs to or can be is IMO
<br>
still open to question.
