<em>&gt;&gt; Yes.  Playing the next note is a fulfillment of playing the song which

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is no time to consciously reason about what note to play next.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I need to choose the next note unconsciously, through an unholy mix 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive and emotional processes...
</em><br>
<p>Rationality is not limited to conscious thought.  Thinking rationally in 
<br>
your unconscious thought is just more difficult because you have to 
<br>
actual think rationally, rather than watch your thought processes and 
<br>
correct them if they go astray.  This is why further reason why trying 
<br>
to moderate your irrational thoughts does not work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Musical improvisation is intrinsically nonrational.  You're appealing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason and emotions at once in music, and reasoning about which note to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on a rational analysis of what emotions and thoughts it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected to evoke, is just not workable.  Music theorists have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straining in this direction for years with quite limited success.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe it's not possible, I don't know.  I can only reproduce music I've 
<br>
heard; I'm not very good at producing new music.  Then again, I haven't 
<br>
spent much time trying to make new music, so this is about like a kid in 
<br>
elementary school only loosely rephrasing sentences from his research to 
<br>
produce a paper because he just doesn't know how to write new sentences 
<br>
very well, so he gets into the habit of weakly modifying sentences that 
<br>
he has already read.  Same thing when people start programming:  they do 
<br>
cut-and-paste programming for a long time before they can just sit down 
<br>
at the computer and whip up code to match the algorithm they have 
<br>
developed (but then most new programmers don't know how to design 
<br>
algorithms).
<br>
<p>At any rate, it may be that musical improvisation requires that you 
<br>
think faster than rational thought allows.  If that's the case, the 
<br>
quality of the music will suffer compared to well thought out pieces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that nonrational thinking is highly adaptive for me and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; organisms.  It needs to be kept in balance with rational thought, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; different aspects of both rational &amp; nonrational thought need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; kept in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; balance with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This sounds like an escape mechanism your brain would use to make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you don't stop trying to reproduce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ??
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I've already reproduced quite a bit.  However, I don't think that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views on the psychology and philosophy of mind have had much to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproductive behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Your thought process in the original comment we're discussing may be the 
<br>
result of rationalization to prevent you from giving up the irrational 
<br>
thinking that makes you continue to try to reproduce assuming you are in 
<br>
some sense aware that if you stopped trying to reproduce you'd be able 
<br>
to get more work done towards creating the Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you trying to say that reproducing is somehow irrational??
</em><br>
<p>It depends on your goals.  If reproduction would stop or hinder you from 
<br>
doing whatever is most right goal to work towards (if your on this list, 
<br>
that could likely be creating the Singularity), then yes.  If the most 
<br>
right thing for you to do is to pass your genes on (not that improbable 
<br>
just a few generations ago), then you should take the time to maximize 
<br>
your ability to reproduce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Gordon will get back to you once he is an AI researcher.  I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Eliezer is creating his AI design to encourage rational thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully he is not creating his AI design purely by conscious rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought processes, or he will never get there ;)
</em><br>
<p>This is my own AI speculation, but:
<br>
<p>I think that in an AI thought that ve is getting feedback on will not 
<br>
cause a penalty in speed of thought like it does in humans.  I can only 
<br>
direct my attention at one thought process at a time.  If I try to focus 
<br>
on more than one thing at a time, it all falls apart and I get very 
<br>
confused.  A good AI design would allow for parallel analysis of thought 
<br>
processes rather than preemptive.  (Note:  Gordon can converse with you 
<br>
and walk at the same time, since walking doesn't require much if any 
<br>
attention to do.)
