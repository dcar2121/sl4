<p><p>&lt;shrug&gt;You are projecting your own limitations on me.  I do this type of
<br>
thing all the time as a matter of course for algorithm design, deciphering
<br>
human reflex and intuition into atomic, generalized computational steps.
<br>
The hard part is that nobody thinks they are doing what they are actually
<br>
doing when their mind is at work, at least not at first glance.  There is a
<br>
level of abstraction that seems to escape many people.
<br>
<p>Quite frankly, this has nothing to do with the problem of creating AI.  It
<br>
is relevant, but not particularly important.  The problem of AI rests in the
<br>
architecture of the computing machinery (in an abstract theoretical sense),
<br>
not the arbitrary algorithm that runs on it.  Algorithms are expressible on
<br>
any old piece of computing machinery, but many problems may be intractable
<br>
depending on the specific computing machine used to run a given algorithm.
<br>
Hence why figuring out the computing architecture is arguably more important
<br>
than reverse-engineering a specific algorithm (which a lot of AI research is
<br>
actually spent on).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For a nice example of an intuitive process that /was/ eventually broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down through introspection and thought, see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_08_05_a_face.htm">http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_08_05_a_face.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note the incredible amount of work involved with such analysis.
</em><br>
<p><p>The point being that it was deconstructed into an algorithm that anyone
<br>
could have uncovered if they had spent the time analyzing it.  Some systems
<br>
are inherently more difficult to analyze than others (e.g. interactions
<br>
between humans being a moderately complex problem), but they are all
<br>
solvable.  In the case above, the man with the ability apparently had a good
<br>
implementation of an algorithm running in his brain that he utilized without
<br>
understanding it.  But then most people drive cars without knowing how the
<br>
engines actually work; not caring doesn't mean that the average person
<br>
couldn't figure it out if they expended a little effort.
<br>
<p>I actually have a similar type of &quot;autistic&quot; type of intuition that is quite
<br>
unusual.  When there is a subtle bug in a system that the programmers can't
<br>
locate, they will give it to me to scan over because even if I have never
<br>
seen the code before I can intuit the flaw down to a code block of a dozen
<br>
or two lines merely by glancing over the reams of code.  Its weird because
<br>
it may take me another fifteen minutes to locate the actual bug in that
<br>
dozen or two lines; I can only intuit that the flaw is there, not the
<br>
specifics of it.  It is an anomaly that people find useful.  Over the years,
<br>
I've observed myself as I scan a couple thousands of lines of foreign code
<br>
in a minute and figured out what I'm actually doing.  My mental process may
<br>
be unusual, but I didn't have much of a problem figuring out what my mental
<br>
process was either with careful analysis.
<br>
<p>I self-observe (and analyze) my thought processes almost constantly; it
<br>
happens naturally.  It makes even my most obscure intuitions fairly
<br>
transparent, later if not right away.  I assume that most other people are
<br>
doing something analogous, or at least have the ability to.
