</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Rationality is just one step up from being a human thinker.  I think 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Ah, good!  This is more congruent with my own understanding also.  When 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have the time, I would very much enjoy knowing more about what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see as the nature of this stage of consciosness you call rationality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the manner of its attainment.
</em><br>
<p>This is what the core part of the book I'm writing is about (the first 
<br>
three parts of the book are about the brain, the mind, and human 
<br>
thought, all of which are discussed elsewhere and I just have to 
<br>
summarize).  If you (or anyone) is ever physically near me, you are free 
<br>
to read my notes for the book; just ask.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; But there is a difference in fully employing rationality as a tool 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and believing it is the greatest and hightest good besides which all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; other aspects of consciousness and ways of being and knowing are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; pitifully second-rate if they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is where I think the confusion is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Rationality is not a tool.  Logical thinking is a tool.  Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reasoning is a tool.  Rationality is a qualitative change in the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you think.  It causes a disruption of your sense of self (you feel as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if you are a completely different person than you used to be).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Becoming rational produces a sense of waking up to realize that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; had been a moron your entire life and no one noticed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it is a state of consciousness. Many shifts of consciousness one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habitually lives in give very much this sense of being a different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, albeit sometimes with a little more compassion toward one's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former state and those still predominantly in it.
</em><br>
<p>I would not call it a shift of consciousness.  Yes, there is that, but 
<br>
rationality is much more.  It is an entire change in your way of 
<br>
thinking.  Everything about the way you think changes.  You seem to 
<br>
understand this, but I want to make sure our readers have this clear in 
<br>
their minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't distrust rationality. I distrust the near-worship of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; rationality as if it were more than it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think you view rationality very differently from the way I or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Eliezer do.  As I stated, rationality is not just a tool for thinking, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but a way of thinking.  This may be the hardest thing to accept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without becoming rational yourself, since there is nothing in human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thought to suggest that there is a higher level system.  For the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; computer scientists, this is similar to the problem of having someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who only knows about Regular Languages and trying to convince them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that Context Free languages exist.  If they have only seen Regular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Languages their entire life, you're going to have to show them a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Context Free Language before they'll believe you.  The same thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happened to the protagonist in /Flatland/.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will look forward to when you have more time to go into this.    In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, there is much in human thought recognizing higher level systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of consciousness than the one one happens to be in. All of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems of meditation and contemplation would not exist otherwise.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted a lot of junk coats many of them. But &quot;human thought&quot; is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant of this basic idea. Perhaps you meant that most human beings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend much of their lives not being cognizant of such possibilities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except as some airy abstraction.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that someone has to tell you that there is something else 
<br>
out there.  Only rarely in history is there a lone genius who figures 
<br>
this stuff out on this own and tries to tell other people (Guatama 
<br>
Siddhartha, Jesus); most people (me and Eliezer included) figured out 
<br>
that there was something more than human thought from other people 
<br>
giving us ideas that there was.  Even when you tell most people, they 
<br>
don't believe you.  You have to show them rationality, give them a taste 
<br>
of it.  Once they see it, they'll accept it and work towards it (unless 
<br>
they are silly and just reject it anyway).
