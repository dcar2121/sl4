<p>Well, to be honest I'm not completely sure what's beyond rationality.  I 
<br>
suspect that enlightenment is, since you must become rational before you 
<br>
can hope to make much advancement (maybe it is possible without being 
<br>
made rational first, but that would be a very rare case I expect).  
<br>
Right now I'm exploring enlightenment to see what it's like.  If I reach 
<br>
it and it turns out it's not really the right way to go, I can always go 
<br>
back (there are plenty of stories about cultivators reaching 
<br>
enlightenment and then screwing up and returning to be regular people).

</em><br>
<p>This is OT, but fun.
<br>
<p>I find that Sinatra stuff not to be super technically difficult to sing 
<br>
(there is much harder stuff out there).  The difference between Frank 
<br>
Sinatra, you, and me is that his voice is more appealing to people.  
<br>
Just because I can sing well does not mean that most people would like 
<br>
to hear my voice doing the singing except mixed in with a chorus.
