<em>&gt;&gt; This

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is a form of macho rationalism.  Rather than developing rational 
<br>
content, you're developing rationalish behavior.  You are only being 
<br>
rational by consequence of the fact that your behavior coincides with 
<br>
the rational choice most of the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see *eliminating* my own irrationality as a viable prospect,

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Of course you cannot eliminate it from you completely without cutting 
<br>
out parts of your brain.  What you can do rather than reduce and 
<br>
moderate is ignore.  And I don't mean ignore like you ignore a small 
<br>
child begging you for a frozen treat.  Ignore as in completely not 
<br>
notice; your mind doesn't know the difference between ignoring and not 
<br>
having.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Consider my earlier example with the Randians.  If I were thinking like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you, I'd have a heuristic that would tell me to avoid getting into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; arguments with them.  Consequently, I wouldn't ever discuss my thoughts
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every last one of them!  What is rational is to determine *why* you 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to argue them and if it is a valid reason or just a rationalized reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; generated by your brain.  This is what is essential to rationality:  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't have a heuristic to make you more rational in a given situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you think the situation through rationally (using such tools as logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and Bayesian statistics) and arrive at the most rational conclusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are proposing conscious rational inference above heuristics as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that human consciousness has limited bandwidth compared to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious.  In situations requiring the integration of a huge body of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces of evidence, conscious reasoning can't grapple, and you have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with unconscious reasoning (aka intuition).  And ridding your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuition of emotional biases is the hard part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sounds like you're advocating conscious logical reasoning as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to all problems.  But conscious logical reasoning only works when there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a relatively few items of relevant information; otherwise the well-known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitations on STM size come into play.
</em><br>
<p>The whole idea that your `unconscious' is some mystical part of your 
<br>
mind is, IMO, nonsense.  The only difference between the `conscious' 
<br>
and `unconscious' parts of your brain are that the former allow for 
<br>
feedback on the process of thought, whereas the latter only allow for 
<br>
feedback on the results.  It's a consequence of the way feedback works 
<br>
in the brain and evolutions need to mask thought processes to make 
<br>
rationalization easier.  You can think rationally when it comes to the 
<br>
`unconscious'; it's only the inner parts of your brain that cannot be 
<br>
tamed and must be ignored.
<br>
<p>Also, there is no reason that you must think quickly.  Persons who know 
<br>
me in real life or have chatted with me online have seen my odd speech 
<br>
style in action.  Someone will say something to me and after a pause 
<br>
(usually after the conversation has already drifted some) I will respond 
<br>
(that is respond properly, since I'm in the habit of saying things that 
<br>
sound like a response that come out of a collection of canned responses).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I sometimes question whether you have made the fundamental shift to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rationality and if you are just a very logical thinker.  At any rate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even if you have, you have a *long* way to go to reach a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; degree of rationality.  Or, a better way of putting it is that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; haven't come very far.  I and Eliezer have come a long way, but there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; still a long way to go, some of it very difficult because it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very fundamental ways of human thought.  I hope that my book, when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will serve to bring people along to greater degrees of rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Based on my interactions with both of you (and I've interacted with Eli
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly more than with you), I do not believe that either of you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly more rational than I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've seen you each make many judgments that seemed to me purely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional...
</em><br>
<p>Which decisions were those?
<br>
<p>Also, I point out that I've only been serious about this for about 1.5 
<br>
years; before then I was as irrational as anyone.  The shortness of time 
<br>
is not an excuse for any existing irrationality, but to show that even 
<br>
recent actions and thoughts of mine are often less rational than my 
<br>
current actions and thoughts.  Not that this isn't always the case, but 
<br>
it's more noticeable because of the rapid changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Interestingly, though, I have not yet met anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) seemed to me to be more rational than myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) also seemed to me to be roughly as creative as myself -- or even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *almost*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as creative as myself
</em><br>
<p>My use of the correspondence theory of truth indicates otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that high levels of creativity often go along with willful or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatic suspensions of rationality.  (Of course, this may be rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta level: one may find that it is rational to sometimes let yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational!)  But when a mind spends a lot of  &quot;creative time&quot; pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely, irrational trains of thought, it often has difficulty shifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back into a less creative but more rational mode.  I have seen this in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many others, as well as myself.
</em><br>
<p>I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has 
<br>
stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth thinking.  
<br>
In fact, I've taken this to the extreme and, in cases of anxiety 
<br>
attacks, have shut down thought since I can't think rationally.  This is 
<br>
different than pursuing merely interesting trains of thought, though.  I 
<br>
will spend time considering interesting ideas with no goal of how to use 
<br>
them because it's fun and interesting.
<br>
<p>Of course, my REM dreams are quite different.  There's a special dream 
<br>
`logic' that is at play there.
