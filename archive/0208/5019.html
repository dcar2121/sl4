the model of transcending current limitations through

brains, hands and dollars at work creating this future and less

chance of irrational obstruction of same.

<p><p>I don't need to, do I?  All I need to do is to show those who

invisible green turtle and friends can be theirs in real-time 
<br>
without waiting for a mystic blow-out with said IGT.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; However, if you omit &quot;only&quot; in the above, i.e. if you can demonstrate

</em><br>
<p><p>I suspect their relgions are driven in part by the desires to 
<br>
transcend the relatively dismal human lot that have been present 
<br>
in the species from the beginning.  Show them how to do that and 
<br>
how to help themselves to social benefits and worldview cohesion 
<br>
type things they also get from religion without the relgious 
<br>
artifacts and I think you will get more than a few &quot;converts&quot;.
