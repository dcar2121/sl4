<p>Ah, good!  This is more congruent with my own understanding 
<br>
also.  When you have the time, I would very much enjoy knowing 
<br>
more about what you see as the nature of this stage of 
<br>
consciosness you call rationality and the manner of its attainment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; believe it is very important and foundational but I do not believe it

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it and especially defend against any notion that it might not be the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consume them into itself.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure when such arguments were made, so I can't respond.  Please 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point them out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What I was attempting to get at there is that many persons seem 
<br>
to hold rationality as another warring memeset as against all 
<br>
memesets of states of consciousness.  I was not sure at the time 
<br>
I wrote the above whether or not you held it that way to some 
<br>
degree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; But there is a difference in fully employing rationality as a tool and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; believing it is the greatest and hightest good besides which all other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; aspects of consciousness and ways of being and knowing are pitifully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; second-rate if they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where I think the confusion is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationality is not a tool.  Logical thinking is a tool.  Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning is a tool.  Rationality is a qualitative change in the way you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think.  It causes a disruption of your sense of self (you feel as if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a completely different person than you used to be).  Becoming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational produces a sense of waking up to realize that you had been a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moron your entire life and no one noticed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So it is a state of consciousness. Many shifts of consciousness 
<br>
one habitually lives in give very much this sense of being a 
<br>
different person, albeit sometimes with a little more compassion 
<br>
toward one's former state and those still predominantly in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You cannot be very rational without being honest at least with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.  At best you'll have the capacity for rationality but will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to see your own errs to be able to correct them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good.  This does remind me of certain forms of Buddhist workings 
<br>
or of jnana yoga.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't distrust rationality. I distrust the near-worship of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rationality as if it were more than it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you view rationality very differently from the way I or Eliezer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.  As I stated, rationality is not just a tool for thinking, but a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thinking.  This may be the hardest thing to accept without becoming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational yourself, since there is nothing in human thought to suggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is a higher level system.  For the computer scientists, this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is similar to the problem of having someone who only knows about Regular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Languages and trying to convince them that Context Free languages 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.  If they have only seen Regular Languages their entire life, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're going to have to show them a Context Free Language before they'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe you.  The same thing happened to the protagonist in /Flatland/.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I will look forward to when you have more time to go into this. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is much in human thought recognizing higher 
<br>
level systems of consciousness than the one one happens to be 
<br>
in. All of those systems of meditation and contemplation would 
<br>
not exist otherwise.  Granted a lot of junk coats many of them. 
<br>
But &quot;human thought&quot; is not ignorant of this basic idea. Perhaps 
<br>
you meant that most human beings spend much of their lives not 
<br>
being cognizant of such possibilities except as some airy 
<br>
abstraction.
