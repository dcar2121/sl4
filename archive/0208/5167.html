<em>&gt; Eliezer, you're using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean &quot;anything that works&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'm using it to mean &quot;Anything knowable to a Bayesian reasoner&quot; 
<br>
and am then making the nontautological statement that &quot;everything that 
<br>
works noncoincidentally&quot; is equivalent to &quot;everything knowable to a 
<br>
Bayesian reasoner&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if you have an organism with a goal, then any process that it uses that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly helps it to achieve that goal is &quot;rational&quot; by your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition.  (Correct me if I've paraphrased your idea incorrectly, please.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a meaningful sense of the word &quot;rational&quot;, but it's a very broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this broad sense, it's true, even processes that have nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *reasoning* as commonly conceived may be viewed as &quot;rational.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance, a bird, acting purely on instinct, is acting rationally when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it mates with another bird, because it's acting in a way that &quot;works&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of achieving its goal of reproducing itself.
</em><br>
<p>In what way does this have nothing to do with reasoning?  It is a product 
<br>
of evolution's version of induction.  Furthermore, the fact that acting in 
<br>
this way will increase the probability of reproduction is quite knowable 
<br>
to a Bayesian reasoner.  A perfect Bayesian reasoner might use a more 
<br>
optimal method of reproduction, but an imperfect Bayesian reasoner might 
<br>
end up employing exactly this method.  Because evolution *is* that kind of 
<br>
imperfect reasoner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I generally have been using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean something narrower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, to mean &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot;, meaning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process inside some mind in which premises are represented, conclusions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented, and processes for getting from the premises to the conclusions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are carried out.  Note that this sense of &quot;following a process of logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference&quot; is implementation-independent; it applies to neural nets and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth as easily as to minds embodying some sort of explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbol-manipulation component.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  And because you use &quot;rational&quot; to denote only this kind of thought, 
<br>
you can get away with telling yourself that &quot;both 'rationality' and 
<br>
'irrationality' are necessary to thought&quot;, thereby avoiding the necessity 
<br>
of getting rid of comforting irrational thoughts.
<br>
<p>Which it is why it's so important to realize that verbal thought is verbal 
<br>
thought, intuition is intuition, and that both can be either &quot;rational&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot;.  It's very easy to find a good name, other than 
<br>
&quot;rationality&quot;, for verbal reasoning or deliberative reasoning or conscious 
<br>
reasoning... in fact, I tossed out three right there.  But I don't know 
<br>
another good name, besides &quot;rationality&quot;, for the quality which correct 
<br>
intuitions and correct declarative thought share with each other, and do 
<br>
*not* share with arational sources of perceived support such as &quot;that's a 
<br>
comforting thought&quot;.
