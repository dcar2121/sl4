<em>&gt; ### I see some interesting analogies between the ideas you use here and
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; perennial copy/identity debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; To demand to have all intermediate steps explained and to

accept/physically
<br>
<em>&gt; experience them your on your way to transcension is a continuist position.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree: that is a continuist position.  I do not hold that position.
<br>
In my reply to Cliff Stabbert I was commenting on goals, both current and
<br>
future, and whether I would be in the decision-making loop when it comes to
<br>
choosing/defining those goals.  In order to have (at least) some control
<br>
over my own transcension, I expect to *have to* go through several
<br>
intermediate steps, growing and learning along the way.  If I can understand
<br>
(and agree with) an SI's proposed goal-change in one go, then: Change me,
<br>
Baby!  Bring it on!  I couldn't give a hoot about the copy/identity issue...
<br>
I am far more concerned about who will be deciding my goals for me.  Who
<br>
will be in charge of my life?  Will it be me, an SI, or a mixture?  I
<br>
currently believe it will have to be mixture, in order to ensure some
<br>
modicum of protection against the nasties... both external Dick-Dastardlies,
<br>
and those within my own animal brain.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You reject a transhuman progeny if you know ve is the product of the FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly molding your neural pathways, even if the outcome is the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you might have reached the hard way, all the way down to implanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories.
</em><br>
<p>No.  If I could understand all that in advance, I would be the first in
<br>
line... and make a backup copy please :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I must say my own position is somewhat ambivalent - although I can
</em><br>
conceive
<br>
<em>&gt; of the FAI as bereft of any of the nasty tendencies that could make
</em><br>
psychic
<br>
<em>&gt; engineering done by humans a likely nightmare, I still would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious continuity over instantaneous transition.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, me too.  But not for the _experience_ necessarily.  I want to be 'in
<br>
on' the changes as much as possible.  I want to know what is being done to
<br>
my mentality, and how, and why - for interest's sake alone!  Not to mention
<br>
the fact that I would want to continue the process of improvement myself, on
<br>
my own mentality.  What better way to learn about my own head-space than to
<br>
watch an SI reprogramming it... or, if this is not possible, then to view an
<br>
annotated recording of the process at a later time.
<br>
<p>If it isn't already obvious, I'm really looking forward to it :D
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
