<p>
As humans, our interests have been shaped by nothing more than evolution.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the strictly scientific viewpoint, our only reason for our existence
</em><br>
(and that of all life) is to continue our existence by fulfilling our
<br>
biological imperatives.  Our intellectual persuits are not technically goals
<br>
in and of themselves, but only adaptations of survival methods given to us
<br>
by evolution, which still have the ultimate purpose to simply promote our
<br>
continued existence.
<br>
<p>The entire concept of a &quot;Friendly&quot; AI to me seems irrationally
<br>
anthropocentric.  Why should our human goals of survival take precident over
<br>
any of the AI's goals?  Our human goals, including the ultimate goal of
<br>
survival, as well as our subgoals (is it valid to apply such AI terminology
<br>
to humans as well?  I don't see why not) of happiness, pleasure, desire for
<br>
knowledge, etc., were determined by our primitive evolution, and are
<br>
ultimately determined by our physiology; so when we have the ultimate power
<br>
to control our evolution in the future, instead of enhancing our ability to
<br>
achieve those goals (apotheosis), why couldn't we instead just change the
<br>
goals?  But then the conundrum is that our existing goals should determine
<br>
what future goals we should want to have instead, but if we change them,
<br>
then we might not have wanted those new goals in the first place.  So does
<br>
that mean that we must be stuck with the primitive goals we have evolved?
<br>
<p>So then the same question can be asked of a Sysop-level AI - instead of
<br>
working to help humans to acheive their petty, primitive, evolutionarily
<br>
determined goals, why not just use its power to change the humans so they
<br>
have different goals?  Shouldn't it, with its vastly superior intelligence,
<br>
be able to think up better goals for the humans to have than the humans have
<br>
thought of for themselves?  And why should humans not want the AI to have
<br>
this type of power? - if the AI changed their goals for them, they would of
<br>
course immediately realize that their new goals were the right goals all
<br>
along.
