</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, learning to see the BPT beneath the surface of all nonaccidental

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason why something works, say &quot;X is evidence about Y for reason Z&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;X correlates to Y for reason Z&quot;, and then, poof, it's governed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BPT.  In that sense you might call it a tautology... but it's a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful, very useful tautology, especially if you've previously been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking of all the surface manifestations of the BPT as different things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>I get the above.  What I don't get is why &quot;success&quot; covers 
<br>
everything of any real importance about reality, precisely what 
<br>
you mean by &quot;success&quot; and precisely why only the things you 
<br>
subsume under this and that are congruent with the extended BPT 
<br>
are to you the end and be all of rationality and by implication, 
<br>
the end and be-all of worthwhile mind-stuff/intellect/awareness. 
<br>
Or have I misunderstood you (possibly in multiple ways)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; Yes.  And because you use &quot;rational&quot; to denote only this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; thought, you can get away with telling yourself that &quot;both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; 'rationality' and 'irrationality' are necessary to thought&quot;, thereby
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  avoiding the necessity of getting rid of comforting irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; This talk of &quot;getting away with&quot; and avoiding getting rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;conforting&quot; irrational thoughts is an invention out of whole cloth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; It begs the question of whether some of the definitions of &quot;rational&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; used or implied are in fact rational and whether some things some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; speakers claim are irrational or at least arational are not essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; aspects of thinking/learning/knowing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  Maybe the question ought to be asked, and answered?  Do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the definition I'm using of &quot;rational&quot; is irrational, and if so, why?  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think that something I've called &quot;arational&quot; is an essential aspect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, and if so, why?  (Note that if it is, then the BPT is underneath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it somewhere, and I was wrong to call it &quot;arational&quot;...  If you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonaccidental success that you think is *not* governed by the BPT, drag it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out and let my BPT-detectors give it a sniff.)
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the definition per se is &quot;irrational&quot;  and 
<br>
claiming it is at this point would beg the question of what the 
<br>
&quot;rational&quot; is and is not which hasn't, in my opinion, been fully 
<br>
addressed here.  It would also leave the question unaddressed 
<br>
regarding the place and possible importance of parts of our 
<br>
mental functioning that are not subsumed under what we may 
<br>
define as &quot;rational&quot;.  That question was what kicked us into 
<br>
this topic in the first place. I also find arguments stating 
<br>
that if a mental process &quot;works&quot;, then it is &quot;rational&quot; not at 
<br>
all satisfying. What we consider &quot;thinking&quot; to actually consist 
<br>
of and its own relationship to the totality of our mind-stuff 
<br>
and whether important things lie outside of &quot;thinking&quot;, much 
<br>
less rationality are also interesting areas worthy of exploration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; It may be your opinion but you have not justified it nor justified that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; persons arguing these claims are doing it because they find them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;comforting&quot;.  I find this line distasteful as it seems to border on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; ad-hominem or some kind of more rational than thou thrust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The social reaction to all this is straightforward, and predictable... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all people are *not* equally rational.  
</em><br>
<p>That was not in question.  I was questioning whether it is 
<br>
appropriate to imply that someone questioning your understanding 
<br>
or use of rationality is reacting because what you are saying is 
<br>
against what they would prefer.  To say so is to accuse the 
<br>
other person of being guilty of reacting instead of reasonably 
<br>
questioning what they don't understand.  I find this objectionable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's nothing implausible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the thought that some people might be more rational than other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. Choosing to speak those thoughts openly is a choice that I've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made under my own goals, of course, but part of those goals is learning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to treat thoughts as representative of truth, and not just means for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulating other people... so if thoughts are just representative of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth, why would truths about which people are more rational than other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people be special?  It's obvious that they have a special status in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social interactions. But since I know about that, to care about it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require a special decision.  Maybe it makes more sense to just pursue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth as far as it goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Accusing other people of being irrational (effectively) when 
<br>
they question your notions about rationality and living 
<br>
rationally is not, imo, at all indicative of rationality.  It is 
<br>
smacks more of rude presumption.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Incidentally, if Ben succeeds in building an AI and I do not, it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be the least bit unusual to suggest that Ben was enormously more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational than I, as an enabling factor in his being able to do that.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The converse is also true.  Among those who dare attempt to meddle in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity it is neither unlikely nor unexpected that enormous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differentials in rationality might exist.  I think that a sufficiently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational mind, even a human mind, should be able to reason about this as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ordinary fact. Perhaps I am mistaken.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Certainly this can be reasoned about given some reasonable level 
<br>
of understanding of people and rationality and so on.  But 
<br>
actual claims that someone is arguing from their preferences 
<br>
instead of from reason need the backing of evidence rather than 
<br>
just assertion and implication.
