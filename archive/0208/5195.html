<p>They are unconscious, perhaps.  But here I think you are using 
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot; simply to mean &quot;nondeliberative&quot;, when there is not 
<br>
necessarily anything about it that is incomprehensible to a Bayesian 
<br>
reasoner.  As I said before, if you lump all nondeliberative processes 
<br>
together with warped deliberative processes as &quot;irrationality&quot;, then you 
<br>
lose your ability to distinguish the true path in deliberation and 
<br>
intuition.  Philip K. Dick's thought processes are unconscious and they 
<br>
may, perhaps, involve the creation of deliberative thoughts that would, 
<br>
interpreted purely as deliberative thoughts, be irrational.  But if the 
<br>
system as a whole works to produce nonaccidental successes, there is a 
<br>
rational reason behind it.  What, specifically, is happening here that is 
<br>
outside the domain of evolved intuitions and trained intuitions?  What is 
<br>
happening here that is outside the domain of genetic learning and neural 
<br>
learning of regularities in reality?  Where does the irrationality come in?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would they have created better philosophy and fiction without these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational processes, following a purely rational (in the narrower sense)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal methodology?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, *no human ever has*.
</em><br>
<p>So what?  As I keep trying to say, rationality has nothing to do with 
<br>
deliberation.  I am not talking about rationality in the narrow sense.  I 
<br>
think that's a wholly useless and in fact actively harmful sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the human brain, some sorts of creative achievement seem to go along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rampant internal irrationality.
</em><br>
<p>No, some sorts of creative achievement seem to go along with rampant 
<br>
internal nondeliberation, perhaps even nondeliberative activities that 
<br>
create warped deliberative thought processes as side effects.  It doesn't 
<br>
mean that the nonaccidental successes are rationally incomprehensible - 
<br>
that it is not possible for a Bayesian observer to understand how they 
<br>
work, and why they work, and conceivably employ a process of that type 
<br>
deliberately in order to arrive at the same answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could Van Gogh have painted better sunflowers if he'd been internally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proceeding in a less whacky, more explicitly rational (in the narrow sense)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way?  Well, no great artist has ever proceeded in an explicitly rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way...
</em><br>
<p>But as said before, I am quite uninterested in the narrow sense of 
<br>
rationality.  I've known since the age of eleven that that's not what real 
<br>
rationality is about.  If it were, I would be forced to ignore all 
<br>
incoming information from my visual cortex because the process happens 
<br>
nondeliberatively.  In fact, I would be forced to ignore my own 
<br>
deliberative thoughts because they are made up of nondeliberative 
<br>
components.  Calling deliberation by the *normative* name, &quot;rationality&quot;, 
<br>
means losing track of which deliberations are rational and which rational 
<br>
processes are nondeliberative.  Using the word &quot;rationality&quot; to refer to 
<br>
deliberation carves up reality at the wrong joints, like the phlogiston 
<br>
theory of combustion.
