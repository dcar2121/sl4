<em>&gt; Now of course you may have meant something entirely different by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   But perhaps this explains what it is about this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence rubs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people like me (and perhaps Gordon) the wrong way.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Perhaps &quot;people like you (and perhaps Gordon)&quot; have an irrational attachment
<br>
to the idea of your own rationality?  ;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think that most scientists and engineers like to delude themselves that
<br>
they are more rational than they really are.  People in this category
<br>
probably *are* generally more rational than most people, but this doesn't
<br>
mean they're as rational as they think they are...
<br>
<p>I think I have fewer delusions regarding my own rationality than most others
<br>
who consider themselves &quot;highly rational.&quot;  My rationality recognizes its
<br>
own limitations, it recognizes that it is just one participant among a large
<br>
number of valuable and powerful cognitive processes in my mind.
<br>
<p>However, my own rationality has definitely gotten stronger over the years,
<br>
due to my conscious efforts to strengthen it...
<br>
<p>As to my own rationality or otherwise as regards AI, I have in the past made
<br>
overoptimistic estimates about when various software projects will be
<br>
completed, including AI projects.  I have an emotional bias toward
<br>
impatience and overoptimism, and I have learned to correct it to a large
<br>
extent, via &quot;meta-rationality&quot; (conscious control of my own thinking
<br>
processes specifically oriented toward dampening my natural optimism).  I
<br>
have not fully internalized this dampening, in the sense that my FIRST
<br>
reaction is always still overoptimism, and the more realistic reaction only
<br>
comes thru further conscious thought.   The trick, for me, is how to
<br>
maintain my enthusiastic optimistic *attitude* without the irrationally
<br>
overoptimistic time estimates that sometimes come along with it.  I'm
<br>
learning, and some parts of my brain resist!!
<br>
<p>I do think I'm significantly more rational than most people, and I think
<br>
this is largely because of conscious efforts I've made to correct emotional
<br>
errors in my thinking, of which the bias toward overoptimism described in
<br>
the previous paragraph is just one (relatively simple) example.  My brain,
<br>
from birth, was endowed with an unusual capability for complex rational
<br>
thought; but adjusting my personality and habits of thought to *utilize*
<br>
this capability in a thoroughgoing way rather than just in isolated
<br>
intellectual contexts, has been a bit of an effort!!
