<p>Heh.  Well, I am not alone in holding the BPT in very high esteem.  There
<br>
is a small but growing movement in science to replace the Popperian view
<br>
of proof with a Bayesian view, and you will often find &quot;Bayesian
<br>
rationalist&quot; used as a more precise synonym for &quot;rationalist&quot;, so it's not
<br>
just me.

<p><em> &gt; ** In a land there lives two kinds of people: X and Y. Among the X:s,

</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; A tourist randomly meets a person, who happens to be tall. Use Bayes'

</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Can you (Eli) solve it? It ought not be a problem for someone who can
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;see the BPT flowing underneath the surface of all cognition, like
</em><br>
<em> &gt; blood beneath skin.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The answer is obviously 80/89.  100 Xs live in the country and 80 are
<br>
tall, 900 Ys live in the country and 9 are tall.  I don't know what you
<br>
intended to prove by asking me that.  There's a similar piece of math
<br>
under the definition of BPT in the glossary of GISAI:
<br>
<p><a href="http://intelligence.org/GISAI/meta/glossary.html#gloss_bayesian_probability_theorem">http://intelligence.org/GISAI/meta/glossary.html#gloss_bayesian_probability_theorem</a>
<br>
<p>Here's also a little excerpt from a work in progress (don't know if it'll
<br>
ever be finished, so don't hold your breath):
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Suppose you know the following:  1% of the North American population
</em><br>
<em> &gt; has cancer.  The probability of a false negative, on a cancer test, is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 2%.  The probability of a false positive, on a cancer test, is 10%.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; You take a cancer test and it comes up positive.  What is the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probability that you have cancer?
</em><br>
<p>[some discussion omitted]
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The way the human mind works instinctively is something like this:  In
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the beginning, you're told that around 1 in 100 people has cancer.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Then, the doctor shows you a cancer test and says that if you take the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; test and you don't have cancer, the probability of the test coming up
</em><br>
<em> &gt; positive is only 10%.  You take the test and it comes up positive.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Inside your mind, the evidence of the test results replaces the prior
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probability of 1% and substitutes the new probability of 90% that you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; have cancer.  Initially the Bayesian Probability Theorem, even if it
</em><br>
<em> &gt; works, seems like a very alien way of looking at the world - you take a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  test that has a 90% chance of working, it comes up positive, and the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; statistician says that your actual probability of having cancer is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 49/544, roughly 9% or around one-tenth of what the intuitive
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probability is.  Since the Bayesian Probability Theorem is often
</em><br>
<em> &gt; explained by teachers who don't realize how insanely powerful the BPT
</em><br>
<em> &gt; really is, the picture that forms in many students' minds is probably
</em><br>
<em> &gt; something like this:  &quot;My prior probability of having cancer is 1 in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 100.  I take a test which is 90% accurate and it comes up positive; in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; any sane world, my probability of having cancer would be 9 out of 10.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; But this strange thing called the Bayesian Probability Theorem says
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that the obvious answer of 9/10 is replaced with the bizarre answer of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 49/544.  I accept it, but I don't understand it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; However, there exists a way in which we can integrate the Bayesian
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Probability Theorem into our intuitive understanding of probabilities.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Instead of imagining the prior probability of 1% being replaced with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 90% after the test results arrive, imagine the test results as sliding
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the probability from its starting point.  A test that's 90% accurate
</em><br>
<em> &gt; has a lot of weight, but it doesn't have quite as much weight as the 1%
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  prior probability.  A positive result on the test slides the 1%
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probability up to 9.007%, but not all the way to 90%.  The chance of a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; false negative is 2%, so a negative result slides the initial 1%
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probability down to .0224% - getting a negative result on your test
</em><br>
<em> &gt; doesn't replace the initial 1% probability with a higher 2%
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probability!  It's important, though, to remember that it isn't just
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the 10% chance of a false positive that matters, but also the 98%
</em><br>
<em> &gt; chance of a true positive if you do have cancer.  If there was a 60%
</em><br>
<em> &gt; chance of a true positive (and hence a 40% chance of a false negative),
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  then getting a positive result on your test would divide the groups
</em><br>
<em> &gt; into 8,910, 990, 40, and 60; thus, getting a positive result would make
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  the calculation (60) / (990 + 60), 2/35 or 5.714%.  The intuitive
</em><br>
<em> &gt; translation:  The degree to which a result is evidence for X depends,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; not only on the strength of the statement &quot;we'd expect to see this
</em><br>
<em> &gt; result if X were true&quot;, but also, vitally, on the strength of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; statement &quot;we wouldn't expect to see this result if X weren't true.&quot;
