<p>Here is an excerpt from the in-preparation Novamente book.  It is the intro
<br>
to the chapter on Psynese, the mechanism we have devised (but not yet
<br>
implemented; many things come ahead of it in the queue) for inter-Novamente
<br>
communication...
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Obviously, different Novamente systems will need to communicate with one
<br>
another.  But how?
<br>
<p>&quot;It doesn't take a very detailed analysis to arrive at the conclusion that
<br>
human-style language is not an ideal mechanism for inter-Novamente
<br>
communication.  Human language is a complex mechanism, riddled with
<br>
problems.  We humans sometimes struggle to communicate simple things to each
<br>
other clearly, and some of our deeper, more radical or more personal
<br>
thoughts remain forever unshared, not because of a lack of desire to
<br>
communicate them, but because of the difficulty of mapping mind-stuff into
<br>
series of written or spoken words.  Music, art, mathematics and other human
<br>
endeavors seek to work around the limitations of written and spoken
<br>
language, giving voice to aspects of the human experience that map poorly
<br>
into word sequences.  Poetry tries to bend language into the shape of
<br>
thought and feeling, but frequently at the cost of comprehensibility.
<br>
Scientific and legal language attempt to be precise like mathematics yet at
<br>
the same time descriptive of real world situations - and they do succeed to
<br>
an extent, but learning them takes many years beyond the years spent on
<br>
ordinary language learning, and even so they &quot;falsify&quot; the ideas they
<br>
represent to a certain extent.  Anyone who has read a lot of scientific
<br>
papers knows the process of &quot;working backwards to the actual idea&quot; from the
<br>
formalized discourse encountered in a research article.
<br>
<p>&quot;Of course, we humans are accustomed to the limitations of written and
<br>
spoken language; our cultural institutions and our minds themselves are
<br>
largely shaped by these limitations.  However, there is no reason that
<br>
inter-Novamente communication needs to be governed by these same
<br>
limitations.   Novamente does need to learn human language, so that it can
<br>
communicate with human beings effectively, and absorb the vast amount of
<br>
knowledge available in human-written texts.  But for communicating with
<br>
other Novamentes, a Novamente system can do far better than human language
<br>
or any close approximation thereof.  And even after its mastery of human
<br>
language is substantial, it may be that, for communicating some of its more
<br>
complex thoughts to humans, Novamente winds up using its own language rather
<br>
than any human tongue.
<br>
<p>&quot;In this chapter we will describe a Novamente-only language known as Psynese
<br>
, which is radically different from any human language in some interesting
<br>
ways.  &quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;Psynese bears scant resemblance to any human language.  However, it is of
<br>
course a language in the formal sense; and unlike a programming language, it
<br>
serves largely the same function as human language: the exchange of
<br>
statements, questions, orders and so forth between different intelligent
<br>
systems.&quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;One might wonder why a community of Novamentes would need a language at
<br>
all.  After all, unlike humans, Novamente systems can simply exchange &quot;brain
<br>
fragments&quot; - subspaces of their Atomspaces [Atoms are what we call the basic
<br>
units of information in Novamente].  One Novamente can just send relevant
<br>
nodes and links to another Novamente (in binary form, an XML representation,
<br>
etc.), bypassing the linear syntax of language.  This is in fact the basis
<br>
of Psynese: why transmit linear strings of characters when one can directly
<br>
transit Atoms?  But the details are subtler than it might at first seem.
<br>
<p>&quot;One Novamente can't simply &quot;transfer a thought&quot; to another Novamente.  The
<br>
problem is that the meaning of an atom consists largely of its relationships
<br>
with other atoms, and so to pass a node to another Novamente, it also has to
<br>
pass the atoms that it is related to, and so on, and so on.  Atomspaces tend
<br>
to be densely interconnected, and so to transmit one thought accurately, a
<br>
Novamente system is going to end up having to transmit a copy of its entire
<br>
Atomspace!  Even if privacy were not an issue, this form of communication
<br>
(each utterance coming packaged with a whole mind-copy) would present rather
<br>
severe processing load on the communicators involved.
<br>
<p>&quot;The idea of Psynese is to work around this interconnectedness problem by
<br>
defining a Psynese vocabulary: a collection of atoms, associated with a
<br>
community of Novamentes, approximating the most important atoms inside that
<br>
community.  The combinatorial explosion of direct-Atomspace communication is
<br>
then halted by an appeal to standardized Psynese atoms.  Pragmatically, a
<br>
PsyneseVocabulary is contained in a PsyneseVocabulary server, a special
<br>
Novamente that exists to mediate communications between other Novamentes,
<br>
and provide Novamentes with information.&quot;
