<em>&gt; So then the same question can be asked of a Sysop-level AI - instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working to help humans to acheive their petty, primitive, evolutionarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined goals, why not just use its power to change the humans so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have different goals?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  Well, I for one, want to be empowered... not overpowered.  I would
<br>
certainly listen to advice from a Super Intelligence (SI), and would
<br>
probably decide to take it ;) but I would definitely not want to be cut out
<br>
of the decision loop.  So, *that's* why not.
<br>
<p>Also, commenting on the &quot;petty, primitive, evolutionarily determined goals&quot;
<br>
phrase... for any given being, except one, there will always be some other
<br>
beings more advanced and more intelligent than ver.  This applies to SI's
<br>
too.  Therefore, the question boils down to: who decides what levels of
<br>
intelligence gets to decide?  Answer: the highest intelligence on the ladder
<br>
who gives a damn about those beneath ver.  Friendly AI is about making sure
<br>
the AI 'gives a damn' and, to the maximum possible extent, assists us in a
<br>
manner we would consider friendly - even at our lower level of intelligence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shouldn't it, with its vastly superior intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to think up better goals for the humans to have than the humans
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; thought of for themselves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But every intelligent being is going to define 'better' a different
<br>
way... and there's the rub.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And why should humans not want the AI to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this type of power? - if the AI changed their goals for them, they would
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; course immediately realize that their new goals were the right goals all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In a word: autonomy.  Another word: freedom.  Most humans don't want these
<br>
things _taken_ from them, even if the Being taking them is much greater than
<br>
they are.  However, it is also true that most humans would willingly
<br>
_give_up_ some of these very same treasures, if convinced they will benefit
<br>
in other ways.  Way: Security.  Way: Community.  Way: Power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if I am covering old ground just let me know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You are definitely covering old ground, this reply has barely scratched the
<br>
surface...  :)
<br>
Suggestion: Read through the archives.  They contain many excellent
<br>
discussions, and you will understand why I put the smiley face on the end of
<br>
the last sentence.  Afterwards, blow holes in the Friendly AI idea... if you
<br>
can... no, really - please try.
