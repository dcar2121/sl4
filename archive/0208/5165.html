<p>But is that at all relevant?  Of course they are judging as a

consequence of their particular design but this is not at all 
<br>
the same as the implied claim that their particular design is

determining their specific judgment.  Nor does it necessarily 
<br>
follow that their judgment is incorrect or would not be arrived 
<br>
at by minds of a different particular design and/or greater

ability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without some universally objective meaning of Friendliness etched into the

</em><br>
<p>I don't know what you mean by &quot;etched into the fabric of the 
<br>
universe&quot;.  A not bad argument can be made that interacting 
<br>
sentients will eventually come to value some type of 
<br>
Friendliness as it generally may be found to maximize how many 
<br>
of their goals can be satisfied with minimal risks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Friendly SI would thus have to find Friendliness in the minds of
<br>
<em>&gt; its beholders.  I think this is why Eliezer has repeatedly emphasized that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly SI would be Friendly for the same reasons an altruistic human is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly. 
</em><br>
<p>But you seem to be assuming that the reasons are limited to 
<br>
humans.  I don't believe they are.  I believe they generalize 
<br>
(roughly) to all  sentients.  If they do not our goose is 
<br>
probably cooked.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A Friendly AI is morally comparable to the uploaded version of a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't parse the meaning of this statement.  I don't know what 
<br>
&quot;morally comparable&quot; consists of.  If you are implying it has 
<br>
copied human morals then I disagree.  If you are implying it 
<br>
happens to agree with some human morals we consider important 
<br>
then I agree with that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Friendly AI to be merely a human brain manifested in silicon, but at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very least it would have to have a thorough understanding of whatever it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the human wiring concept that makes conclusions about what is and is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly.  It would have to have some sort of &quot;process X&quot; module, as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can tentatively agree that to be Friendly to a creature of 
<br>
type A I need to understand the needs and nature of such a 
<br>
creature.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But this &quot;process X&quot; remains a human modus operandi, and should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistaken for an immutable law of the cosmos.  So Friendliness of the kind we
</em><br>
<p>This is your asumption, which I disagree with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; are pursuing is really Human Friendliness.  If the generalized template of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI were set loose on an alien world among species who had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process X, but rather some totally unrelated process Z, it is a process Z
</em><br>
<em>&gt; module that this alien Friendly AI would develop to compute Friendliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, the mature Friendly AI from human space might disagree violently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the Friendly AI from Kzin space -- on account of the very differnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modules they use to calculate what Friendliness is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This does not necesarily follow either.  Sentient beings may 
<br>
always disagree even with (using your limited model) the same X 
<br>
process running in both.  After all, humans do it all the time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't see that we have any choice but to reference an AI's Friendliness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own perceptions of it.  There is no cosmic handbook of ethics or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraterrestrial species handy to consult.  And I doubt we could bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves to sign on with any of these other references anyway if these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested that humans were a smelly blight on the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree that from our perspective the AI will only be Friendly 
<br>
if it acts in accord with our ideas of Friendliness at least 
<br>
regarding not wiping humans out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One could argue that any intelligent species would roughly share our process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X, making this issue irrelevant.  I don't think this is completely wishful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking since I suspect that any species intelligent enough to worry about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would at least have to share the most fundamental heuristics; after all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we recognize as logic seems to govern the natural universe, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be difficult to evolve very far in the natural universe using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristics that totally ignore this logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Here we come closer together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But on the other hand, many concepts that we esteem as admirable human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtues have obvious foundations in our ancestral environment -- foundations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that other intelligences might not share.  For example, an intelligence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved from the beginning as a singleton planetary hive-mind would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little need to develop concepts of &quot;personal freedom&quot; or &quot;altruism&quot;, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are social concepts that require multiple minds to have any meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But, for us here and now, pre-Singularity, the primary concern 
<br>
with Friendliness *is* and must be from our perspective.  That 
<br>
however does not mean that our perspective is the same as that 
<br>
of the SI.  Its understanding of Friendliness might be a lot 
<br>
deeper.  But I doubt its understanding would include our doom. I 
<br>
have more sympathy for the view that the SI might consider us 
<br>
all quite mad and in need of radical and immediate 
<br>
psycho-therapeutic reconstruction.  But if it understands enough 
<br>
of human psychology to actually judge this I doubt very much 
<br>
that it would fail to understand how grossly unfriendly such an 
<br>
act is.
