<p><em>&gt;&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt; I don't consider the goal of continuous improving life to be in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; least &quot;petty&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot;.  Do you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But your idea of what is &quot;improving&quot; or not, is determined by your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current goal system.  If they were changed by the Sysop, you might think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently.
</em><br>
<p>Any change to them without my consent would appear to be an act 
<br>
of agression.  Rewiring my brain involuntarily so &quot;I don't mind&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adds to the agressive violation rather than dissipating it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do you believe it is the right of any brighter being that comes along 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to rewrite all &quot;lesser&quot; beings in whatever matter it chooses or to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; destroy them?  Do you believe it should be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can only determine if it would be a right now according to my current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals.  I might think differently if I had different goals.  And there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no reason to believe that my current goals are the best possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals - the superior intelligence of the AI would likely be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think up better ones for me to have.  It doesn't seem rational to impose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a limitation on the AI of it not being able to alter us in certain ways 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just because we are too primitive to realize we are being helped and not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmed, until after we are altered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am asking what you believe.  It is irrelevant what you might 
<br>
someday hypothetically believe. I am not asking you to stand in 
<br>
the middle of nowhere - without any goals or in the universe of 
<br>
all possible goals - to ask the question of what is the best 
<br>
goal system and thus be able to answer any other question of 
<br>
rights or &quot;should&quot;.  None of us can or ever will stand there so 
<br>
why pretend that it is important to answer from such an 
<br>
unreachable place of no relevance to us here?  I cannot for a 
<br>
moment consider it &quot;rational&quot; to avoid considering what is 
<br>
important to you in order to determine how you proceed - 
<br>
including what sort of AI or AI development you support. 
<br>
Whining about how &quot;primitive&quot; we are is a gross shirking of 
<br>
self-responsibility imho.
<br>
<p>If we are going to just effectively shrug and say &quot;let the SI 
<br>
figure it out&quot; then I would agree we don't have any particular 
<br>
place in the future, or in the present either.  Because if we do 
<br>
that we haven't even really bothered to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you are helping to design such a being (or that which becomes such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a being) would you consider it just &quot;petty&quot; to look for a way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; encourage it to be a help to human beings rather their doom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The concept of what are &quot;help&quot; and &quot;doom&quot; are determined by your current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals, which you have no reason other than the influence of those same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals to believe they are superior or even preferable to other goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am getting bored.
