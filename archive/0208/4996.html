<p>
The Fermi Paradox as an exponentiating trap:
<br>
<p>Posit that at the Singularity humankind and/or our AIs will transcend to a
<br>
posthuman state, and perhaps these superintelligences will find some way to
<br>
tunnel entirely out of our spacetime into one that's more convenient,
<br>
commodious and safer (an idea used in my latest novel, TRANSCENSION, and
<br>
independently in John Smart's analysis and other places earlier).
<br>
<p>Now: if that's what happens to most civilizations throughout Many Worlds
<br>
variants of the cosmos--if they somehow remove themselves entirely, via the
<br>
equivalent of a black hole--might it be that the remnant superpositions
<br>
become increasingly reduced to a kind of shadow of the former potential
<br>
evolutions of the universal Schrödinger state equation? 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, if there can be some kind of ghostly but real interference
<br>
*across* superpositions (as David Deutsch posits to explain double slit
<br>
experiments, and JohnJoe McFadden claims helps explain aspects of
<br>
biological evolution [
<br>
<a href="http://www.geneticengineering.org/evolution/mcfadden.html">http://www.geneticengineering.org/evolution/mcfadden.html</a> ] , a notion
<br>
similar to Egan's in TERANESIA), might the original multiverse tend to grow
<br>
more restricted with the passage of time? It's as if every time beautiful
<br>
or brilliant children are born in a slum, they move at the age of 17 to
<br>
Hollywood or Harvard, and so their neighborhood allele pool for those
<br>
phenotypes is incrementally degraded. That might mean that the probability
<br>
of a Singularity happening in *your* universe grows ever smaller over time.
<br>
<p>The Fermi Paradox implies that the sky *should* be filled with Spiked
<br>
cultures and their cosmic engineering (assuming such engineering is
<br>
conspicuous enough to be noticed, not cloaked, etc). There would seem to
<br>
have been time for many millions or billions of species to have gone
<br>
Singular and vanished, taking their potential quantal reinforcement with them.
<br>
<p>At the moment, I'm treating this as a fictional narrative device in a
<br>
novel, although I suppose some sophisticated version might even be true.
<br>
<p>Any quantum mechanics on the list who might comment?
<br>
