FYI, I'm going to be out most of the day, so I only have a little time 
<br>
for e-mail this morning.  I'll finish making replies tonight.

<br>
<p>Rationality is just one step up from being a human thinker.  I think 
<br>
that there are at least two more qualitative changes in thought:  
<br>
enlightenment and, for lack of a better term, Buddha thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; believe it is very important and foundational but I do not believe it

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure when such arguments were made, so I can't respond.  Please 
<br>
point them out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there is a difference in fully employing rationality as a tool and

</em><br>

<p>This is where I think the confusion is.
<br>
<p>Rationality is not a tool.  Logical thinking is a tool.  Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning is a tool.  Rationality is a qualitative change in the way you 
<br>
think.  It causes a disruption of your sense of self (you feel as if you 
<br>
are a completely different person than you used to be).  Becoming 
<br>
rational produces a sense of waking up to realize that you had been a 
<br>
moron your entire life and no one noticed.
<br>
<p>Ben, you might associate it with taking the first step in Buddhist 
<br>
cultivation when you go from being a regular person to being a 
<br>
cultivator, but then I don't think most people are aware of this 
<br>
difference because they get there gradually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; contemptible.  Note the stridency that often ensues.  It is very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reminiscent of the stridency of most any true believer that they and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they alone have &quot;the Way&quot;. I think some of the Spiral Dynamics folks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be on to something. The rational &quot;Orange&quot; level is essential to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human consciousness development and our current (at least western 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society is dominated by it).  However, it is still within the pattern 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of denigrating almost all else but itself and thinking that it is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;final&quot; stage.  I think rationality plus a lot of self honesty and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examination flowers into more than rationality alone.
</em><br>
<p>You cannot be very rational without being honest at least with 
<br>
yourself.  At best you'll have the capacity for rationality but will be 
<br>
unable to see your own errs to be able to correct them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't distrust rationality. I distrust the near-worship of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality as if it were more than it is.
</em><br>
<p>I think you view rationality very differently from the way I or Eliezer 
<br>
do.  As I stated, rationality is not just a tool for thinking, but a way 
<br>
of thinking.  This may be the hardest thing to accept without becoming 
<br>
rational yourself, since there is nothing in human thought to suggest 
<br>
that there is a higher level system.  For the computer scientists, this 
<br>
is similar to the problem of having someone who only knows about Regular 
<br>
Languages and trying to convince them that Context Free languages 
<br>
exist.  If they have only seen Regular Languages their entire life, 
<br>
you're going to have to show them a Context Free Language before they'll 
<br>
believe you.  The same thing happened to the protagonist in /Flatland/.
