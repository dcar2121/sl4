You can use it as a crutch if you want to, but you don't have to use it.

<p>Of course, hypothesis testing should not be necessary.  In theory, you

can think everything through in your mind and arrive at the correct

answer, but due to the reality of a particular rational thinkers

imperfect rationality, in some cases hypothesis testing becomes

necessary.

</em><br>
<p>Sure, normally.  It does not have to stay that way.
<br>
<p>Also, some thought is arational.  For example, vision is an arational 
<br>
process.  What you do with that information can be either rational or 
<br>
irrational.

<p>I agree.  The results of this `introspection' are going to be 
<br>
rationalized reasons (re Randian example).  For some thought processes, 
<br>
the brain is simply not wired for you to get feedback on how you thought 
<br>
the idea up.
