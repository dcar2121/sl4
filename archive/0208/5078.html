<p>I've run into this before.  I'm starting to think of it as a large, black 
<br>
cancer that swallows people's minds and sucks them into a terrible and 
<br>
inescapable corner of memespace.  Why?  Isn't it a perfectly reasonable 
<br>
possibility that Gordon and I do in fact have an irrational attachment to 
<br>
the idea of our own rationality?  Yes.  However, the way I've observed 
<br>
these conversations to run in practice is that *any* attempt to employ 
<br>
deliberative thinking about rationality gets written off, without further 
<br>
explanation or attempted debugging, as a speaker rationalization.  The 
<br>
swallowed person just basically doesn't *trust* rationality - they've 
<br>
found that it doesn't work them, they're not willing to believe that it 
<br>
could work for anyone else, and they think it's basically a social 
<br>
persuasive device (maybe because in the past they lost a lot of arguments 
<br>
to empty rationalizations and learned to associate *all* verbal reasoning 
<br>
with coercive social force; I don't know).
<br>
<p>Now how the heck do you dig someone out of *that* hole?
<br>
<p>I don't know.  I don't even have any evidence that it's possible.  Not 
<br>
only have I never personally succeeded in doing it, I've never seen it done.
<br>
<p>It's perfectly okay if someone wants to explain what, specifically, is 
<br>
wrong with my rationality, but this thing of distrusting rationality in 
<br>
general... it gives me the cold chills.  (I have the following specific 
<br>
reason to suspect I may be irrational in this instance: my negative 
<br>
reaction is created by the instinctive relation of negative reactions to 
<br>
past aversive reinforcement, and I am expressing this negative reaction in 
<br>
speech that seems instinctively appropriate.  This may be the wrong 
<br>
approximation to the actions that would be rationally appropriate, but I 
<br>
can't think of any specific correction to make.)
