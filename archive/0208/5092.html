</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think you are using &quot;intuition&quot; the same way as the pedestrian
<br>
vernacular.  There is both rational and irrational intuition, and unless you
<br>
specify a definition, you are not being clear.
<br>
<p>An irrational intuition/belief is one where the premise(s) have a null
<br>
prior.  A rational intuition/belief is one where the premise(s) have a
<br>
non-null prior.  While you may not be able to &quot;prove&quot; your belief/intuition
<br>
in this framework, you can reasonably assert the rationality IF you can
<br>
demonstrate valid priors for the premises regardless of a lack of evidence
<br>
for the specific position.
<br>
<p>As commonly used, &quot;intuition&quot; pretty much means that you haven't even
<br>
evaluated the priors of the premise.  For most people, intuition encompasses
<br>
a wide range of beliefs, and for some of these even casual analysis would
<br>
demonstrate the irrationality/incorrectness of them.  It is like so-called
<br>
&quot;common sense&quot;, which frequently encompasses beliefs that can be trivially
<br>
demonstrated to be false but which remain common beliefs nonetheless;
<br>
&quot;intuition&quot; is typically used as a logical fallacy of the same construction.
<br>
If you've actually evaluated the priors in any type of rigorous fashion, it
<br>
becomes &quot;reasoning&quot; and &quot;rational&quot; no matter how weak the association.  In
<br>
essence, &quot;intuition&quot; is short for &quot;talking out your ass&quot; as typically used.
<br>
If you had a valid construction for your intuition you wouldn't call it
<br>
&quot;intuition&quot;, you'd call it &quot;reason&quot;.  I think this is what people are
<br>
objecting to.
<br>
<p>Of course, some intuition is just lazy thinking i.e. partial evaluation of
<br>
the priors and fudging the rest for any number of reasons.  Which is
<br>
probably what we are actually talking about here.  I guess you could call
<br>
this &quot;expert intuition&quot; (which makes it no more correct, but perhaps gives
<br>
it a higher probability of being correct).
<br>
<p>Creativity in thinking may stem from the mind picking up patterns as you
<br>
brute force the prior evaluation when evaluating something.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In future AI minds, there will be intuition (in the sense of inference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combining huge numbers of pieces of weak evidence) that is NOT as tangled up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with emotion as human intuition is.
</em><br>
<p><p>For all intents and purposes, &quot;intuition&quot; in an AI would be more correctly
<br>
called &quot;low probability reasoning&quot;.  I think most reasoning in humans from
<br>
null priors is caused by biological biases in the wetware, not as an
<br>
intrinsic function of computing machinery.
