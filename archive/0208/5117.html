<em> &gt; Well, that is one definition of the term &quot;rationality.&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Categories are a form of intelligence; they are a way of slicing up the 
<br>
universe such that things which can be perceptually placed in a category 
<br>
can be assumed to have other properties which are not perceptually 
<br>
apparent.  Categories can be useful or nonuseful according to whether they 
<br>
slice up the universe along the right joints.
<br>
<p>Common-language categories related to cognition and intelligence are often 
<br>
almost completely unusable.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; If we accept your definition, we then need another word for the process
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of &quot;conscious rational thought&quot;, which is only one kind of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;rationality&quot; according to your definition.
</em><br>
<p>The word I use for this is &quot;deliberation&quot;.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; The visual cortex is a form of rationality.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; If so, it's a badly flawed form, due to errors like I mentioned

</em><br>
<p>Yes, everything can be seen as a flawed or limited form of rationality.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; That's what the Bayesian Probability Theorem *is* - a *universal*
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; description of the way in which things can be evidence about other
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; things.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This seems to me to be a large overstatement.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool (and one of the central parts of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Novamente reasoning module).
</em><br>
<p>Explicit, abstract use of Bayes' Theorem, seen deliberatively as Bayes' 
<br>
Theorem, is a tiny subset of the universal domain governed by the BPT.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; However, like the rest of elementary probability theory, it pertains to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a set of probabilities defined over a fixed &quot;universal set.&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Defining the universal set is a serious issue in any practical
</em><br>
<em> &gt; situation. You can say &quot;define it as the set of all entities ever
</em><br>
<em> &gt; observed by the mind doing the reasoning&quot;.  But this doesn't really
</em><br>
<em> &gt; work, because we *hear* about entities via linguistic communication,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; including many entities we haven't seen.  I may want to include Beijing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in my universal set for my internal probabilistic inference, even
</em><br>
<em> &gt; though I have never been there or seen it.
</em><br>
<p>You must learn to see the BPT flowing underneath the surface of all 
<br>
cognition, like blood beneath skin.
<br>
<p>In this case, you have encountered a set of sensory experiences which lead 
<br>
you to believe that Beijing exists - other people producing reports about 
<br>
Beijing.  Since you expect that people will report that Beijing exists in 
<br>
cases where Beijing exists, and that they will not report that Beijing 
<br>
exists if it does not exist, this is, under the BPT, evidence; it is a 
<br>
case of a thing being evidence about another thing.
<br>
<p>In terms of the BPT, this is no different from seeing photons reflecting 
<br>
from Beijing in person, or from accessing the deposited memories 
<br>
afterward.  These forms of evidence differ in strength and detail, but are 
<br>
all equally governed by the BPT.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; So then you can't rationally posit a mind that operates only using
</em><br>
<em> &gt; elementary probability theory.  You must have two processes in a mind,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; at least:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- probabilistic inference (implemented in one of a huge number of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; possible ways) -- a process for defining the universal set (either once
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and for all, or contextually)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; But then how does this second process take place?  If you say it takes
</em><br>
<em> &gt; place by prob. inference you get a regress.  But if not, you must posit
</em><br>
<em> &gt; some other process, and you must admit that the conclusions of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; prob. inference (logical reasoning) will be relative to the operation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of this other process, rather than &quot;objectively rational&quot; (if
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rationality, to you, is defined by the laws of probability theory).
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  You must learn to see the BPT flowing underneath the surface 
<br>
of all reality.
<br>
<p>Reasoning using sensory information takes place against the universal 
<br>
priors of the brain (the regularities that will form given an exposure to 
<br>
a given set of experiences).  The brain is constructed by evolution, which 
<br>
can be seen as a form of induction on the universal prior of the set of 
<br>
possible DNA strings.  DNA was arrived at from the original 
<br>
self-replicating molecule, which was selected from the universal priors 
<br>
defined by the set of possible molecules.  This set of universal priors in 
<br>
turn arises from the laws of physics.  If you ask me which set of priors 
<br>
our laws of physics were selected from, I don't know.  But if you're 
<br>
trying to be intelligent in our particular universe you might as well 
<br>
start with the physical &quot;priors&quot; defined by our laws of physics, and in 
<br>
fact, you will.
