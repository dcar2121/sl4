<br>
<p>BG&gt; It seems the human brain is only capable of creating some kinds of great

<br>
<p>BG&gt; Phil Dick was being &quot;rational&quot; in the sense that he was proceeding toward
<br>
BG&gt; his goal of creating great sci-fi works, pretty effectively.  But some
<br>
BG&gt; subprocesses that his brain used toward that goal were pretty damn
<br>
BG&gt; irrational...
<br>
<p>Thank you for your lyrical *and* reasoned (take that, you partisans of
<br>
Reason!) defense of creativity and its arational genesis.
<br>
<p>Although I'm straying somewhat off-topic here, I'd again like to
<br>
relate this to some concepts you touched on in your description of
<br>
Psynese.  Namely, works of art can evoke complexes of emotion and
<br>
thought in others that are orders of magnitude beyond what words can
<br>
convey.  And I am convinced, although I have no evidence, that in some
<br>
cases &quot;the same nodes&quot; are being activated in numerous human minds
<br>
when experiencing a particular work of art.  In this sense, art can be
<br>
far more efficient than language, although it loses in the surface
<br>
&quot;accuracy&quot; written and spoken language conveys (which accuracy,
<br>
outside of limited formal domains like mathematics, is itself
<br>
debatable).
<br>
<p>In part this can be explained (more or less handwavingly) with
<br>
concepts like Jung's Collective Unconscious, in part by the fact that
<br>
our minds share similar structures, and in part by the fact that
<br>
a shared cultural background informs both viewer and artist.  These
<br>
all shade over into each other, and can also form an alternate
<br>
description of the process of inspiration: namely, one is channeling
<br>
millions of years of evolution of mind (via the CU) and thousands of
<br>
years of evolution of society (via cultural background), as well as
<br>
one's personal unconscious contents.  I am hugely oversimplifying of
<br>
course, and the subjective power of the channeling experience is not
<br>
diminished by such a description.
