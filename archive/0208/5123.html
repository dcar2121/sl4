</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Rationality is a qualitative change in thinking.  It is characterized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the consistent use of logical thought and Bayesian reasoning and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disuse of evolved thinking (in all it's forms:  intuition as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; commonly understood, rationalization, pseudo logic, etc.).  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; eliminate all irrational thought, and what is left is pure rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think of rational inference as a kind of &quot;evolved thought&quot;....  Where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you think it came from?
</em><br>
<p>There is surely overlap between good ways of thinking and evolved 
<br>
thought processes.  After all, evolution wouldn't work if it didn't 
<br>
occasionally find the right answers.  Still, removing bias from this 
<br>
thought process is difficult enough that I consider the end result 
<br>
different from the thought process you started out with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe it's possible to eliminate all irrational thought from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain.  I am willing to be proved wrong, but I can't think of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how such a proof would be executed prior to having a full understanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain function and highly accurate brain scanners.  I guess I'd be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced if I met someone who qualitatively seemed to demonstrate pure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect rationality, but I have never met that person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, I've never met you ;-)
</em><br>
<p>I'm not proof that it's possible.  I think, though, that it is possible, 
<br>
and if it is I might just get there.  It may turn out uploading is 
<br>
necessary, but right now I'm working on the assumption that it's not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, when I sit down to improvise at the piano, as a rationalist would I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reason about which note to play next?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Playing the next note is a fulfillment of playing the song which 
<br>
is a fulfillment of whatever reason you were playing the piano in the 
<br>
first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When writing an article, should I reason consciously &amp; logically about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence to type next?
</em><br>
<p>When writing, I find that I can't spend all of my time watching how I 
<br>
come up with the words to write.  As you train yourself, you don't think 
<br>
irrationally in the unobserved parts of your brain.  Until such time, 
<br>
though, you have to proof read to see if what you wrote is logical.
<br>
<p>Of course, I write quite slowly and in a nonlinear fashion because it 
<br>
takes me a while to think up each sentence.  If I am able to hammer out 
<br>
something quickly, it is because I have already had time to think about 
<br>
it.  I suspect that this capacity for deep, slow thought (in humans they 
<br>
are related, in AI I hope that this is not still the case) is one brain 
<br>
feature that gives some people greater disposition to rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about &quot;going with the flow&quot;?  This seems to me to be a very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm for producing good stuff.  Reason seems to enter into such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes mainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * to judge things afterwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *when a particularly tricky spot comes up
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea what &quot;going with the flow&quot; is even supposed to mean, so I 
<br>
don't have any way of responding.  Plenty of people talk about it, but 
<br>
that doesn't mean I'm any closer to knowing just what this thought 
<br>
process is.  It's likely a thought process I've engaged in, but calling 
<br>
it &quot;going with the flow&quot; does not make me think of anything in 
<br>
particular other than write stream of consciousness style.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I had to consciously, logically reason about every note I played on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piano, or every sentence I wrote, then I would not get to do much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything with my time...
</em><br>
<p>Your brain does it for you.  All you have to do is teach it not to be 
<br>
influenced by irrational thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Maybe now you see why any use of irrational thinking bothers me.  Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you can keep using irrational thought processes, but you will only ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gain so much rationality, and it will be tenuous since you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; maintaining a tie to irrational thoughts when you know that you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be trying to eliminate them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't &quot;know&quot; or even believe that I should be trying to eliminate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that nonrational thinking is highly adaptive for me and other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms.  It needs to be kept in balance with rational thought, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different aspects of both rational &amp; nonrational thought need to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kept in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance with each other.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds like an escape mechanism your brain would use to make sure 
<br>
you don't stop trying to reproduce.  Hard to do, but if you can there's 
<br>
a good chance you are already rational.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I nevertheless believe that a thought process incorporating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonzero degree* of nonrationality is maximally efficient for the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.
</em><br>
<p>Nonrationality is relying on making decisions via evolutionary biases 
<br>
or `at random', as much as that might be possible.  I don't think any 
<br>
such thing helps thought at all.  At worst you might have to make weak 
<br>
guesses rather than strong ones, but no need to resort to pseudo random 
<br>
choices and evolutionary bias.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And whether this holds for nonhumanlike AI systems, I also don't know.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think a nonhuman AI could think this way, unless you 
<br>
deliberately programmed it to make decisions based on pulling random 
<br>
numbers out of /dev/random.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do know that in the Novamente design, we've had to make some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that effectively make Novamente irrational in some cases and contexts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because to preserve pure rationality in all contexts is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, you may say this proves Novamente is an inadequate or suboptimal AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design.  I am sure it is suboptimal, but I hope it is not inadequate!  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage you or Eliezer or anyone else to propose a detailed design 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI mind that is thoroughly rational, designed to achieve high levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity without any significant nonrational elements ;)
</em><br>
<p>Gordon will get back to you once he is an AI researcher.  I expect 
<br>
Eliezer is creating his AI design to encourage rational thought.
