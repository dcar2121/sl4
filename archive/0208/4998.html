<p>I don't agree.  The first AI to reach SI capability could easily remove, 
<br>
or at least halt, all others which are behind.  In other words, unless

two AIs end up reaching the Singularity at nearly the same time (within 
<br>
days I'd guess) then there will only be one.  Assuming that 1st decides

that it doesn't want competition, at least (which we can't know).  Thus,

I find it very unlikely that we will have multiple SIs, unless the 1st

SI wants it that way.

<p>That said, I do believe there will be multiple SIs.  I just don't think 
<br>
they will be terran.  Other civilizations out there *must* be getting to 
<br>
this point as well.  They may be on the other side of the universe, but 
<br>
that won't have anywhere near the effect on SIs that it does on us.  So, 
<br>
eventually, I believe multiple SIs will encounter one another.  Might be 
<br>
many (real time) years, or only days.  May not even be relevant to us if 
<br>
the SI just pops out of our universe for something better, leaving us 
<br>
behind.
<br>
<p>Just my 2 cents worth...
