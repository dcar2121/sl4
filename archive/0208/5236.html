I've been discussing rationality more with Eliezer the past few days.  
<br>
He's not off his rocker, as I first though, just looking deeper than I 
<br>
had been.  Eliezer wants me to point out that I don't fully understand 
<br>
and that anything I write on the topic of rationality does not 
<br>
necessarily reflect his understanding, but I'm far enough along the path 
<br>
that I can at least try to explain some things.

<p>`Stepped-down' is not really the right term.  `Reduction' is more 
<br>
appropriate.
<br>
<p>All work is BPT-reducible (I'd say that it's all Tao-reducible, but I'll 
<br>
avoid adding confusion for now).  This does not mean, of course, that 
<br>
every aspect of all work is BPT-reducible, only that all work depends on 
<br>
the BPT.  This is like the halting problem is computer science.  Many 
<br>
problems look solvable, until you discover that they reduce to the 
<br>
halting problem (i.e. your problem would solve the halting problem if it 
<br>
weren't impossible).  In the same way, work may look accidental, but if 
<br>
it can be reduced to the BPT (i.e. accomplishing the work at some point 
<br>
required BPT modelable events), it is nonaccidental.
<br>
<p>Irrational aspects of cognition are important to the way humans think.  
<br>
Despite what some of you might think, neither Eliezer nor I nor anyone 
<br>
else we know is fully rationally intelligent.  Yet, human thought can be 
<br>
reduced to the BPT.  If you don't believe me, we can always go down to 
<br>
the physical brain and look at neurons.  Neurons function by a simple, 
<br>
rational process to accomplish work.  They receive electrical signals 
<br>
and when the neuron has a specific charge, it fires.  You don't even 
<br>
need something as fancy as the BPT to understand the process that is 
<br>
going on, though you can still use it.  The charge level at which to 
<br>
fire may be set by an irrational process as may be the reason a 
<br>
particular neuron received signals, but as you can see rationality is 
<br>
involved in all human cognition.  It also exists at higher levels, but 
<br>
this example illustrates how rational processes are fundamental to any 
<br>
nonaccidental success.
<br>
<p>It is acknowledged that irrationality plays a role in human cognition 
<br>
and is very important for many discoveries.  Yet without some degree of 
<br>
rational intelligence, your mind would not be able to get anywhere on 
<br>
purpose and no one would find your randomly firing mind very interesting 
<br>
except maybe as a pretty house ornament.
