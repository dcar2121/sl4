</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am willing to go to Worldcon to do this for SIAI.  I live near Monterey,
<br>
about an hour from the convention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; really like to see it happen.  If your printer can't handle a few hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double-sided flyers I'd be willing to pay printing costs at the local
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'll cover the cost. I've been looking for more ways to help out. :)
<br>
<p>Months ago I saw that the admission was absurdly expensive, and being not
<br>
all that clear what to expect from the show I wrote it off.  But, what the
<br>
heck.  This will give me a good excuse to go.  I'll try for Saturday.
<br>
<p>I am an SF fan of course, but I wonder what the real appeal of the
<br>
convention is, and for you especially? Could you give me some tips to
<br>
maximize my experience?
<br>
<p>Also, would anyone else like to help hand out flyers?  I'll bring 'em. :)
