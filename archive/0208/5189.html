<em>&gt;&gt;I'll show you how it's rational or why rationality lies beneath

<em>&gt;&gt;its surface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is a nonaccidental success:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The composition of the particular melody characterizing the final chorus of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; by Beethoven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why was it rational to choose this series of notes rather than another one?
</em><br>
<p>Your asking &quot;Why was it rational... to choose&quot; implies that all of the 
<br>
rationality of this process is attributable to specific thoughts of 
<br>
Beethoven, which may or may not be the case; &quot;rationality&quot; should be 
<br>
attributed to an entire physical process and its complete causal history, 
<br>
including all of Beethoven's evolved adaptations for the auditory sensory 
<br>
modality.
<br>
<p>In this case, while not myself a musician, I would tend to suggest that 
<br>
the following processes that partially reflect or instantiate 
<br>
&quot;rationality&quot; are sufficient to explain Beethoven's composition:
<br>
<p>1)  The evolution of Beethoven's auditory cortex, a process of 
<br>
evolutionary pseudo-induction (not really Solomonoff induction, since 
<br>
Solomonoff induction applies equally to an entire dataset, while evolution 
<br>
weights recent data more heavily).
<br>
<p>2)  The ability of given melodic sequences to produce given emotional 
<br>
states as a result of cognitive processes within the auditory system and 
<br>
emotional system; these processes may have started as &quot;accidental&quot; results 
<br>
of something else, probably speech prosody, but given the universality of 
<br>
rhythm in human culture there would tend to be a selection pressure behind 
<br>
the *universality* of melody, even if the specific melodic correspondences 
<br>
are essentially arbitrary.  This is the reason - which may be viewed as 
<br>
accidental or nonaccidental, it doesn't really matter - that Beethoven, 
<br>
imagining a melody that produces a specific emotion locally, thereby 
<br>
imagined a melody that would be effective in other humans as well.
<br>
<p>3)  Beethoven's internal processes for tweaking the melody to find one 
<br>
that achieved the effect he wanted are not all known.  But if you name any 
<br>
specific one, I will undertake to show how rationality underlies it.  For 
<br>
example, if Beethoven consciously tweaks the melody and chooses the one 
<br>
that &quot;sounds better&quot; under (2), that's obviously a case of rationality. 
<br>
If Beethoven uses intuitions that have been honed by previous positive and 
<br>
negative feedback about which melodies tend to work, then the neural 
<br>
potentiation procedures would implement rationality (or if you claim they 
<br>
don't, I'd like a specific counterexample).  In particular, the 
<br>
&quot;rationality&quot; they implement is the exploitation of a regularity in 
<br>
reality whereby what worked on one occasion is likely to work again; this 
<br>
potentiation procedure is in turn the result of evolution exploiting a 
<br>
regularity in what kinds of learning procedures are likely to work.
<br>
<p>4)  The fact that you selected Beethoven, in particular, is because 
<br>
Beethoven composed a very good melody; Beethoven may have succeeded 
<br>
&quot;accidentally&quot; in some ways, i.e., due to the random selection of a 
<br>
variable whose particular value happened to have a large payoff, but the 
<br>
fact that Beethoven's work is currently better-known is nonaccidental; it 
<br>
is the result of the selection process for fame, which is nonaccidentally 
<br>
correlated (though not perfectly correlated) with the strength of 
<br>
emotional impact repeatably produced by Beethoven's music.
<br>
<p>5)  Beethoven may have been influenced by other musicians, selected by 
<br>
(4), employing (1) (2) (3) and their own versions of (5).  Again, 
<br>
rationality is a property of a process's complete causal history.
<br>
<p>Those are all the factors that spring to mind offhand.  I may have left 
<br>
some out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if I succeeded, and you did not, largely because I were more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistent?  [Please note: this is just a hypothetical example, I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to say that you lack persistence in reality.]  In your sense, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistence (a personality trait) would be an aspect of my rationality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it led me to overall effectiveness?
</em><br>
<p>Your persistence would be an aspect of your rationality if:
<br>
<p>1)  You consciously chose persistence because you had a correct 
<br>
expectation for correct reasons that this persistence would pay off, i.e., 
<br>
you noticed that persistence had tended to pay off in the past, and 
<br>
hypothesized that it would pay off in the future.  (This is a kind of 
<br>
hypothesis that humans tend to make because, evolutionarily, tending to 
<br>
make this class of hypotheses pays off often enough for it to be an 
<br>
evolutionary advantage.  Or you might consciously reason about the 
<br>
similarity of {the past cases of persistence paying off} to the problem at 
<br>
hand.)
<br>
<p>2)  Evolution tended to select for persistence - because of an exploitable 
<br>
regularity in reality, governing both the past cases of persistence being 
<br>
adaptive, and the present case of persistence being useful to create AI.
