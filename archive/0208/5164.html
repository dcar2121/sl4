<em>&gt; Minds are physical systems.
</em><br>
<p>No, they are most certainly not!
<br>
<p>A mind is a fuzzy set of patterns that are
<br>
<p>-- emergent in a certain system
<br>
-- emergent between a certain system and its environment
<br>
<p>The system in question need not be physical, it could be virtual (e.g. a set
<br>
of particle-like entities in a computer simulated reality running on your
<br>
future PC).
<br>
<p>Human minds are currently closely associated with physical systems (human
<br>
bodies), and they mostly consist of patterns emergent from and between human
<br>
brains.  But this does not mean minds are physical systems -- not even human
<br>
minds, let alone virtual minds....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a mind has a particular U, that U
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must have come from *somewhere*.  That particular U has a physical cause;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something shaped it.  Those shapers will be either rational or irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on what kind of reliable correspondence they bear to reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Bayesian Probability Theorem is inescapable - it can be applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *every* causal system that exists in our universe to determine whether a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given pattern is likely to correlate to any other causes or effects that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in outside reality.  *Any* causal system, *any* physical process,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not just the ones that we usually consider as &quot;rational&quot; or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mindful&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Bayes' Theorem can be applied in any circumstance, just as can, for
<br>
instance the theorem that &quot;1+1=2&quot;.
<br>
<p>But the theoreom &quot;1+1=2&quot; does not tell us how to identify whole entities (to
<br>
count as &quot;1&quot; ... is a person a single entity or a conglomerate, etc.), nor
<br>
how to map a complex entity like a planet into a numerical vector or tensor.
<br>
<p>Similarly, Bayes' Theorem and associated probabilistic results do not tell
<br>
us how to construct the universal set U they need in order to be applied.
<br>
<p>Mathematical theorems are all universally applicable and inescapable
<br>
(assuming one accepts the axiom systems from which they're derived!).  This
<br>
is just as true of Bayes' Theorem as of any other mathematical theorem.
<br>
<p>I don't disagree on this, but I don't see how it implies all that you say it
<br>
does.
<br>
<p>The real question is whether a given math theorem's application in practice
<br>
tells us anything interesting.
<br>
<p>I am not seeing how the observation that Bayes' Theorem applies to the
<br>
universe tells us anything interesting.
<br>
<p>I think that Bayes' Theorem applies to the mind as a whole tells us
<br>
something sort of interesting.  For instance, Solomonoff Induction, one of
<br>
my favorite abstract approaches to intelligence, is closely tied to Bayesian
<br>
learning, with a special prior distribution based on algorithmic
<br>
information.  Great stuff!  However, it doesn't do you much good in terms of
<br>
practical AI design, nor in terms of the analysis of human psychology.  In
<br>
these cases it seems to me more useful to think of explicit Bayesian
<br>
probabilistic inference as one aspect of intelligence among many -- and to
<br>
effectively ignore the fact that, yes, it is possible to model other aspects
<br>
of the mind using Bayes' Theorem as well, in various senses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If your U is a physical thing, it exists for physical reasons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the BPT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will govern whether those reasons are such that U is likely to bear any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given kind of correlation to external reality.
</em><br>
<p>A mathematical set like the universal set U in probability theory is NOT a
<br>
physical thing, any more than a mind is.
<br>
<p>A set like U may be a pattern in a certain mind, that this mind &quot;acts as if&quot;
<br>
it were carrying out probabilistic inference with respect to a certain
<br>
universal set U.
<br>
<p>In this case, the set U is a part of the pattern-set that is the system's
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You cannot flee from the Tao; you cannot run from the laws of physics;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they govern the very process of your flight...
</em><br>
<p>heh...
<br>
<p>Baby, I can flee from the Tao if I want to!
<br>
<p>I just don't feel like it tonight...
<br>
<p>I feel like slinking upstairs, resting my head on my wife's lap, and
<br>
watching the Amazing Wildlife of the Serengeti on the Discovery Channel...
<br>
<p>See ya later!!
<br>
