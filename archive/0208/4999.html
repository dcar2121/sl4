<p>Well, obviously.  But if you go with the exponential model then in 10 
<br>
years the world will be very different than it is today, yet I doubt 
<br>
that will be considered &quot;transcendant&quot; (unless, of course, we manage to 
<br>
either create a trans-human AI or upload in that time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Certainly nowhere near comparable to, say, the transition from primate mind

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as big as the shift from primate to human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed.  But arguing that *another* transcension is imminent in no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detracts from the position that we, as a species, have already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcended our historical notion of humanity at least once.  Moving
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that is relevant.  No one human remembers beyond about a 
<br>
hundred years ago.  So, from any human alive today, no transcendance has 
<br>
occured.  If you want to go beyond individual human lifespans than I 
<br>
think you would have to count the number of transcentions in the 
<br>
hundreds.  Which I, personally, think is unhelpful and a waste of 
<br>
time/effort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; from nomadic groups of 30-50 individuals to a globally networked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization with members who regularly interact with thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others is a change of such magnitude that it is hard to appreciate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially from our privileged perch within the process, the true scope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the alterations.
</em><br>
<p>Besides, very little (if anything) has changed in the human species 
<br>
since human &quot;civilization&quot; began.  We are still the same animals that we 
<br>
were 10,000 years ago.  We just have a bunch of facts written down and a 
<br>
process in place to educate our young with the basis for those facts. 
<br>
Nifty trick, but hardly transcendant.
