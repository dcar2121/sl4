</em><br>
<p>Of course, you are correct here, Eliezer.  &quot;Bayesianism&quot; is a philosophy of
<br>
applied modeling which has quite a few true believers.  I'm surprised that
<br>
Christian has not encountered it before...
<br>
<p>Bayesian analysis doesn't simply refer to the use of Bayes Theorem, it is a
<br>
particular style of statistical modeling, involving a host of theorems and
<br>
algorithms building on Bayes rule in a practical data analysis context.
<br>
<p>Anyone may check out this website if they're curious for pointers into the
<br>
literature
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.bayesian.org/">http://www.bayesian.org/</a>
<br>
<p>There is no general consensus about the value of &quot;Bayesian statistical
<br>
analysis&quot;, and many probabilists who are not among the &quot;true believers&quot;,
<br>
agree with Christian's skeptical attitude.
<br>
<p>Personally, I used to be more or less an adherent to one of the sects of the
<br>
Bayesian religions -- the Maximum Entropy Principle, which states that, in
<br>
many circumstances, the principle of entropy maximization should be used to
<br>
set Bayesian priors.
<br>
<p><a href="http://omega.albany.edu:8008/maxent.html">http://omega.albany.edu:8008/maxent.html</a>
<br>
<p>I still like Bayesian probability theory and I still like Maxent, but I
<br>
don't see them as quite the cure-all that their strongest adherents do.
<br>
<p>While Eliezer's statements about BPT are strong, they are no stronger than
<br>
the ones made by some of the the MaxEnt advocates, who include plenty of
<br>
well-known scientists at prestigious institutions doing valuable practical
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>What is good about the Bayesian approach to modeling is that it generally
<br>
requires fewer ad hoc up-front assumptions than the main alternative, which
<br>
is parametric statistics.
<br>
<p>What is bad about it, is that it involves assuming priors, and while MaxEnt
<br>
is a good heuristic for setting priors, it's not perfect.
<br>
<p>Autoclass is a great machine learning system based on Bayesian methods.
<br>
<p><a href="http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/autoclass/">http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/autoclass/</a>
<br>
<p>In a lot of cases, it outperforms other unsupervised learning methods such
<br>
as clustering.  Of course, every machine learning method has its adherents
<br>
and its detractors.
<br>
<p>I think that elementary probability theory, including Bayes' Theorem, is one
<br>
of the most powerful tools for understanding the world that we have created.
<br>
Bayes Theorem itself is just part of the probability theory framework, of
<br>
course.  It is true that almost any phenomenon can be modeled in
<br>
probability-theoretic terms.
<br>
<p>However, although prob. theory has nearly universal applicability, I think
<br>
there are some aspects of the world that are not *conveniently* or
<br>
*usefully* modeled in terms of it.  I think that many aspects of the mind
<br>
fall into this category.
