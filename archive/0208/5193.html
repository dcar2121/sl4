<em>&gt; 3)  Beethoven's internal processes for tweaking the melody to find one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that achieved the effect he wanted are not all known.  But if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific one, I will undertake to show how rationality underlies it.
</em><br>
<p>But it's not a matter of &quot;tweaking&quot;... it's a matter of an overwhelming
<br>
experience of creative inspiration.
<br>
<p>Many creative people have experienced forms and ideas pouring out as if from
<br>
some unknown inner source. Forms streaming, emanating, exploding -- so much
<br>
faster and more elegantly fit together than if they were consciously
<br>
reasoned out.
<br>
<p>I started with Beethoven, but I don't know that much about his creative
<br>
process, so I'll shift to someone I'm more familiar with...
<br>
<p>The most striking description of the creative experience I have seen was
<br>
given by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his autobiography, Ecce
<br>
Homo:
<br>
<p>&quot;Has anyone at the end of the eighteenth century a clear idea of what poets
<br>
of strong ages have called inspiration? If not, I will describe it. -- If
<br>
one has the slightest residue of superstition left in one's system, one
<br>
could hardly resist altogether the idea that one is merely incarnation,
<br>
merely mouthpiece, merely a medium of overpowering forces. The concept of
<br>
revelation -- in the sense that suddenly, with indescribable certainty and
<br>
subtlety, something becomes visible, audible, something that shakes one to
<br>
the last depths and throws one down -- that merely describes the facts. One
<br>
hears, one does not seek; one accepts, one does not ask who gives; like
<br>
lightning, a thought flashes up, with necessity, without hesitation
<br>
regarding its form -- I never had any choice.
<br>
<p>&quot;A rapture whose tremendous tension occasionally discharges itself in a
<br>
flood of tears -- now the pace quickens involuntarily, now it becomes slow;
<br>
one is altogether beside onself, with the distinct consciousness of subtle
<br>
shudders and one's skin creeping down to one's toes; a depth of happiness in
<br>
which evern what is painful and gloomy does not seem something opposite but
<br>
rather conditioned, provoked, a necessary color in such a superabundance of
<br>
light....
<br>
<p>&quot;Everything happens involuntarily in the highest degree but as in a gale a
<br>
feeling of freedom, of absoluteness, of power, of divinity. -- The
<br>
involuntariness of image and metaphor is strangest of all; one no longer has
<br>
any notion of what is an image or metaphor: everything offers itself as the
<br>
nearest, most obvious, simplest expression.... &quot;
<br>
<p>OK -- so Nietzsche's experience of inspiration was particularly
<br>
overpowering. But it differs in intensity, rather than in kind, from the
<br>
&quot;everyday&quot; inspiration experienced by ordinary creative people.
<br>
<p>Sometimes this &quot;overpowering force&quot; of which one is merely a &quot;medium&quot; is
<br>
experienced as an actual alien entity. In these relatively rare cases,
<br>
creative inspiration blurs into paranoid hallucination, or religious
<br>
inspiration. The great science- fiction writer Philip K. Dick was an example
<br>
of this. He felt himself being contacted by an artificial intelligence from
<br>
another star system. This AI being fed ideas into his mind, giving him the
<br>
plots for his last few novels, especially The Divine Invasion and Valis.
<br>
Dick's vision is too complex to discuss here in detail; I will merely quote
<br>
one entry from his journal:
<br>
<p>&quot;March 20, 1974: It seized me entirely, lifting me from the limitations of
<br>
the space-time matrix; it mastered me as, at the same instant, I knew that
<br>
the world around me was cardboard, a fake. Through its power I saw suddenly
<br>
the universe as it was; through its power and perception I saw what really
<br>
existed, and through its power of no- thought decision, I acted to free
<br>
myself....&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>In no way is this sort of shit &quot;tweaking&quot;, and in no way is it *consciously*
<br>
experienced as any kind of rational calculation about how to create a great
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>Is it rooted in unconscious inference operations?  Partly, but also in a lot
<br>
of other unconscious noninferential operations, including some damn mixed-up
<br>
irrational emotional ones.
<br>
<p>Does this kind unconscious irrationality contribute to the overall
<br>
effectiveness (what you call Rationality) of the person embodying it?  Sure.
<br>
Nietzsche wouldn't have created his philosophy, Dick wouldn't have created
<br>
his novels, without these unconscious, wildly irrational processes.
<br>
<p>Would they have created better philosophy and fiction without these
<br>
irrational processes, following a purely rational (in the narrower sense)
<br>
internal methodology?
<br>
<p>Well, *no human ever has*.
<br>
<p>In the human brain, some sorts of creative achievement seem to go along with
<br>
rampant internal irrationality.
<br>
<p>Could Van Gogh have painted better sunflowers if he'd been internally
<br>
proceeding in a less whacky, more explicitly rational (in the narrow sense)
<br>
way?  Well, no great artist has ever proceeded in an explicitly rational
<br>
way...
<br>
<p>It seems the human brain is only capable of creating some kinds of great
<br>
works, if it uses tremendous amounts of irrationality in the process...
<br>
<p>Phil Dick was being &quot;rational&quot; in the sense that he was proceeding toward
<br>
his goal of creating great sci-fi works, pretty effectively.  But some
<br>
subprocesses that his brain used toward that goal were pretty damn
<br>
irrational...
<br>
