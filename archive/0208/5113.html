Everything that works is a form of rationality; works because it is
<br>
rational; and is rational because it works.
<br>
<p>To be precise, everything that works noncoincidentally, with a probability 
<br>
greater than sheer random chance would predict, is a form of rationality; 
<br>
works because it is rational; and is rational because it works.
<br>
<p>That's what the Bayesian Probability Theorem *is* - a *universal* 
<br>
description of the way in which things can be evidence about other things.
<br>
<p>It is not limited to any one domain.  It is not limited to deliberative or 
<br>
verbalizable thought.
<br>
<p>Intuitions are a form of rationality.
<br>
<p>The visual cortex is a form of rationality.
<br>
<p>Logic - real logic, the kind that works - is a form of rationality.
<br>
<p>Verbally clever rationalization, e.g. Plato, is not a form of rationality 
<br>
because it is not bound (does not correlate under the BPT) to the external 
<br>
variables about which it purports to provide information.
<br>
<p>Evolution, and everything created by evolution, is a form of rationality 
<br>
(DNA carrying on a limited kind of induction on past observations).
<br>
<p>A flower is a frozen truth - the expression of DNA's induction on a 
<br>
history of past successes.  So is a smallpox virus.  So is a human baby. 
<br>
Evolution's induction is an imperfect form of rationality - but to 
<br>
whatever degree it works, it works because it is a form of rationality.
<br>
<p>One of the oldest human stories is the universal, omnipresent force that 
<br>
confers power on those who wield it, serve it, and move with its flow; the 
<br>
Tao, the Force, the breath of God.  The closest thing to that archetype 
<br>
that actually exists in our universe is rationality.  Every nonaccidental 
<br>
correlation that exists is grist for the Bayesian Probability Theorem; it 
<br>
works because it is rational, and is rational because it works. 
<br>
Rationality is the universal of which evolution and brains are partial 
<br>
implementations, and the truth that confers upon them their powers.  It 
<br>
underlies the inductive reasoning that gave birth to flowers, and the 
<br>
deliberative reasoning that put footprints on the moon.  If you look past 
<br>
surface similarities and differences you can see the rationality burning 
<br>
underneath like blood flowing under skin.
