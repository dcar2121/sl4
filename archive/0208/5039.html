I think an eventual fusion of the two is inevitable, as interaction with 
<br>
virtual or augmented environments *is* programming. I might give a 
<br>
complex Flare object to your agent with a combination of verbal, written 
<br>
and visual (possibly embedded in the surface of the object) arguments. 
<br>
I'd be programming (with your permission and in a sandbox) your agent. I 
<br>
certainly don't want to see a bazillion XML strings fly by -- I want to 
<br>
see some physical representation of my choosing.

<p>I think that Savain's point about robustness is intimately tied to the 
<br>
complexity of a system. It seems to require exponentially more 
<br>
programming effort to retain robustness in a system of bolted together 
<br>
software with linearly growing complexity (like military, aerospace or 
<br>
AI tech). Is there any way to test Savain's claim other than to build 
<br>
equivalent signal-based systems? If signal-based programming had the 
<br>
same amount of human experience behind it as traditional programming 
<br>
does today, would Savain's claim of 10-fold robustness and ease of 
<br>
programming seem less ludicrous?
<br>

<br>
<p>We humans might find the notion of programming signal-based software 
<br>
unappealing, but what about an SI? Signal-based systems have the benefit 
<br>
that the same system could easily have both hardware and software 
<br>
implementations, and it can be made to easily integrate with wetware. In 
<br>
our limited experience, we've seen them only from evolved origins, but 
<br>
that doesn't mean they might not be vastly more powerful when engineered 
<br>
in the hands of an SI.
<br>
<p>Who knows, an SI might discard our semantic-language way of programming, 
<br>
using it only when necessary to interface with 'legacy' human systems. 
<br>
Can we predict even possible programming paradigms of an SI?
