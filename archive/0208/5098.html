<p>
Jumping into this thread late, I strongly agree with most of the
<br>
points Ben Goertzel has been making in this thread.  A few notes of my
<br>
own:
<br>
<p>&quot;Rationality&quot; cannot, of itself, supply
<br>
<p>1) motives and goals
<br>
2) creative ideas and original hypotheses
<br>
3) low- to medium-level cognition
<br>
<p>re 1) Given motives and goals, the rational process is invaluable in
<br>
achieving them.  Note that it is still not /sufficient/ -- one still
<br>
needs to create and test hypotheses:
<br>
<p>2) Given a hypothesis, testing it is a rational process.  At least,
<br>
once you've abstracted your perceptions into some sort of language
<br>
(i.e., one amenable to symbolic logic operations):
<br>
<p>3) Perception/cognition is itself a non-/sub-rational and at times
<br>
creative process.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are all greater artists than we realize&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Nietzshe
<br>
<p>So &quot;where&quot; do 1, 2 and 3 originate?  The question only makes sense, or
<br>
seems to, if the way you split the mind is into &quot;rationality&quot; and
<br>
&quot;that other stuff.&quot;  But isn't such a notion, to put it mildly,
<br>
somewhat...outdated?
<br>
<p>I am surprised that this view would even be a subject of discussion
<br>
here on SL4.

JR&gt; My objection to this is primarily that most intuition

JR&gt; that is worth anything CAN be resolved through
<br>
JR&gt; introspection and thought.  People can usually piece

JR&gt; together the reasons for their intuition if they think
<br>
JR&gt; about it hard enough.
<br>
<p>Nonsense.  If this were even close to the truth, creating AI would be
<br>
dead simple.
<br>
<p>For a nice example of an intuitive process that /was/ eventually broken
<br>
down through introspection and thought, see

<br>
<p>Note the incredible amount of work involved with such analysis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
A few final notes: 2) is discussed at length and with great clarity in
<br>
_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ by Robert M. Pirsig. 3) is
<br>
addressed throughout Douglas R. Hofstadter's work, but especially
<br>
_Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies_.
