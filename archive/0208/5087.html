<em>&gt; This is a form of macho rationalism.  Rather than developing rational

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That is one of the most irrational accusations I have every 
<br>
encountered.  What is rationality *for* if it is not for 
<br>
directing the facts and conditons of our own existence 
<br>
intelligently toward the fulfillment of yoru goals?  As we have 
<br>
parts of ourselves that do not work on rational/logical (yet are 
<br>
not random) grounds as we understand them and that are not 
<br>
conscious, these parts must be acknowledged, understood and 
<br>
brought under the guidance of our rationality sufficiently at 
<br>
least not to lead us astray.  Ignoring them just sets us up to 
<br>
be blind-sided by that which we are not and have refused to be 
<br>
conscious of. I don't see how doing otherwise than acknowledging 
<br>
and moderating all parts of our reality could be remotely 
<br>
rational. But perhaps you are operating under some notion of 
<br>
*rational* that I am unaware of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't see *eliminating* my own irrationality as a viable prospect, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thru radical neuromodification!  It can be *reduced*, and then what's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; left
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can be *moderated*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course you cannot eliminate it from you completely without cutting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out parts of your brain.  What you can do rather than reduce and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderate is ignore.  And I don't mean ignore like you ignore a small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child begging you for a frozen treat.  Ignore as in completely not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice; your mind doesn't know the difference between ignoring and not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ignoring your massively parallel unconscious processing would be 
<br>
lobotomizing.  This is not exactly what I would call &quot;rational&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt; It sounds like you're advocating conscious logical reasoning as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to all problems.  But conscious logical reasoning only works when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a relatively few items of relevant information; otherwise the well-known
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; limitations on STM size come into play.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole idea that your `unconscious' is some mystical part of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind is, IMO, nonsense.  The only difference between the `conscious' and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `unconscious' parts of your brain are that the former allow for feedback 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the process of thought, whereas the latter only allow for feedback on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the results.  It's a consequence of the way feedback works in the brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and evolutions need to mask thought processes to make rationalization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier.  You can think rationally when it comes to the `unconscious'; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's only the inner parts of your brain that cannot be tamed and must be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did not see anyone claim it is &quot;mystical&quot;.  But it is 
<br>
certainly present and it is utterly crucial to your well-being 
<br>
and intelligence.  Are you denying that a great deal of 
<br>
important processing in the human brain occurs at an unconscious 
<br>
level?  Are you making a claim that evolution designed things 
<br>
that way to aid rationalization?  Please explain.  On the face 
<br>
of it that seems absurd.
<br>
<p>Rather than ignore, wouldn't it be more rational to take the 
<br>
&quot;inner parts of your brain&quot; as a very fuzzy logic massively 
<br>
parallel processing system whose results are often of some value 
<br>
but the amount of value must be determined by the less fuzzy 
<br>
rational consciousness?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, there is no reason that you must think quickly.  Persons who know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me in real life or have chatted with me online have seen my odd speech 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; style in action.  Someone will say something to me and after a pause 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (usually after the conversation has already drifted some) I will respond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (that is respond properly, since I'm in the habit of saying things that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound like a response that come out of a collection of canned responses).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In many aspects of our lives, including mundante things like 
<br>
safely crossing the street, it is crucial that a great deal of 
<br>
processing happens quickly and unconsciously and that it is not 
<br>
second-guessed - much less ignored.  If you design an AI without 
<br>
any such levels of processing you will have a most impressive 
<br>
artificial nitwit that cannot survive or function outside a very 
<br>
controlled environment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I've seen you each make many judgments that seemed to me purely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; emotional...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which decisions were those?
</em><br>
<p>This is really getting tiremsome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I believe that high levels of creativity often go along with willful or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; automatic suspensions of rationality.  (Of course, this may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rational on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; meta level: one may find that it is rational to sometimes let yourself be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; irrational!)  But when a mind spends a lot of  &quot;creative time&quot; pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unlikely, irrational trains of thought, it often has difficulty shifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; back into a less creative but more rational mode.  I have seen this in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many others, as well as myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth thinking.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I've taken this to the extreme and, in cases of anxiety 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks, have shut down thought since I can't think rationally.  This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different than pursuing merely interesting trains of thought, though.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will spend time considering interesting ideas with no goal of how to use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them because it's fun and interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This sounds more similar to the results certain meditation 
<br>
techniques of always keeping a &quot;witness&quot; or simply always paying 
<br>
attention to what is going on in the mind without being dragged 
<br>
away by its contents.  This I agree is valuable although I would 
<br>
not go so far as to imply daydreams are all of no use.  There 
<br>
are many types of things called &quot;daydreams&quot;.  Some mediate 
<br>
between the conscious mind and the subconscious processing. 
<br>
Some of those are quite valuable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, my REM dreams are quite different.  There's a special dream 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `logic' that is at play there.
</em><br>
<p>Are you aware within your dreams?  I notice that when I meditate 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fairly steadily for a while that most of my dreams are lucid 
<br>
and that there is more of a quality of watching them unfold.
