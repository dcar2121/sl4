<em>&gt;The Fermi Paradox as an exponentiating trap:
</em><br>
<p>[i.e. could the migration of superintelligences into baby universes
<br>
somehow quantum-mechanically suppress the probability of future
<br>
Singularities?]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Any quantum mechanics on the list who might comment?
</em><br>
<p>This is a pretty interesting question, because of the number of
<br>
things it brings together, but I think the answer is No, you would
<br>
not expect it to do so, without special additional assumptions.
<br>
<p>The basic reason is that quantum interference (in a many-worlds
<br>
model) relates events in this universe with events in the universe
<br>
next door, but not with events elsewhere in this universe. When
<br>
you conduct a double-slit experiment, what matters is the ensemble
<br>
of almost-identical experiments being conducted in otherwise-identical
<br>
universes, not the double-slit experiments conducted yesterday or
<br>
tomorrow in this universe. Yesterday's and tomorrow's experiments
<br>
will be correlated with similar ensembles in the immediate multiversal
<br>
neighborhood, but yesterday's, today's and tomorrow's ensembles are
<br>
all distinct and uncorrelated.
<br>
<p>Now, consider a Singularity that happens somewhere. First of all,
<br>
for quantum interference to be in any way relevant to its development,
<br>
it needs to rely on quantum processes. If it just involves classical
<br>
computing and macroscopic warping of space-time, what goes on next door
<br>
in the multiverse will not matter. But let's assume the super-AIs are
<br>
quantum computers, or that they need giant quark nuggets to make their
<br>
baby universes. Okay, now quantum effects matter, but even so, they
<br>
are only correlated with their local ensemble of worlds. Events in the
<br>
next galaxy or the next galactic year should be completely independent
<br>
of how their Singularity turns out, except for matters that are quite
<br>
classical, such as whether they used up all the local eganite.
<br>
<p>So, just to recap, quantum interference (according to many worlds...)
<br>
involves interaction between universes. The Fermi Paradox is an
<br>
apparent improbability that appears in data from just *one* universe.
<br>
It's fair to ask whether that improbability might be due to multiversal
<br>
effects, but the mere Transcendence and Separation of previous
<br>
civilizations within this universe shouldn't have any effect on the
<br>
a-priori chances of success of later civilizations, at least not by
<br>
way of quantum effects. This would be an effect more like Sheldrake's
<br>
morphic resonance. There *are* quantum phenomena in which events in
<br>
the same universe are super-correlated or super-anti-correlated, such
<br>
as bose condensation, but to make Technological Singularities behave
<br>
like bosons you'd have to introduce some of those 'special additional
<br>
assumptions' I mentioned.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I've said nothing about what happens if one member of
<br>
a multiversal quantum ensemble migrates from its home universe into
<br>
a baby universe. I think it would remain correlated with the rest
<br>
of its ensemble until novelty from its new environment caused its
<br>
state to pass beyond the boundaries of its ensemble. Example: suppose
<br>
you had a quantum computer buried in a meteorite, i.e. (in many-worlds
<br>
terms) suppose you had a coherent multiversal ensemble of them. And
<br>
suppose that in some fraction of those worlds, the meteorite ends up
<br>
falling into a baby universe just as it becomes causally separate
<br>
from the parent universe. There's no real reason to think that that
<br>
part of the ensemble would suddenly decohere from the rest. Instead
<br>
you'd expect a gradual differentiation of the two sub-ensembles of
<br>
meteorites, due to the different average environmental conditions
<br>
they faced, leading to eventual decoherence.
