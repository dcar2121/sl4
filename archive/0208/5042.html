NOTE: This post, responding to samantha, is heading off-topic and will be
<br>
the last one I post on this aspect of the thread.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many of the founders were at most Deist, if not atheists.

<p>I was not referring to American developments being influenced by Calvinism
<br>
directly, but rather to the preceding European developments in the 2
<br>
centuries before the founding of the American Republic. We in the USA
<br>
started as a branch of Europe, and even after severing our official ties
<br>
with the Old Countries, we continued to be influenced by the ways of life
<br>
and thought we inherited from there.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you are having difficulty with the doctrine of
<br>
predestination because you find it, shall we say, &quot;dispiriting.&quot; So let me
<br>
ask: Do you believe in causality or in randomness in this universe? (When I
<br>
use the term &quot;causality&quot; I mean conformation to natural laws which make all
<br>
phenomena deterministic but not necessarily predictable.) This issue is at
<br>
the core of the free will vs. determinism debate. In terms of human behavior
<br>
and the supposed Divine predestination thereof, what Calvin claimed was that
<br>
we could only know if we are among the Elect predestined for salvation if
<br>
and only if we lived our lives in accord with the moral dictates of the
<br>
Bible and, furthermore, showed evidence of enjoying Divine favor by our
<br>
apparent material success in the world. Thus, one had to work very hard,
<br>
plan carefully, save, invest and rein in one's appetites in order to meet
<br>
these criteria. The very effort to do these things would often produce the
<br>
desired results.
<br>
<p>Now you may, along with me, disbelieve in the notion of Divine favor, but
<br>
you must admit, I think, that these efforts had a salutary effect on the
<br>
development of Western economic and technological and, yes, even scientific
<br>
endeavors. To be sure, Calvinism also had many negative aspects, such the
<br>
prohibitions on dancing and so forth. (And these continued in many
<br>
fundamentalist sects in America.)
<br>
<p>Finally, to close out this part of the thread, let me say that Calvinism was
<br>
not unique in its encouragement of many useful behaviors that went beyond
<br>
its religious roots. In Judaism, the Talmudic disputation method taught in
<br>
the religious schools would ultimately encourage the kind of critical
<br>
thinking that led many bright Jews, such as Baruch Spinoza and later John
<br>
von Neumann, to look at the whole world of phenomena with a critical eye and
<br>
a discerning mind.
