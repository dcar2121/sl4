<em>&gt; &gt; I generally have been using the word &quot;rational&quot; to mean something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; narrower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Basically, to mean &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot;, meaning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process inside some mind in which premises are represented, conclusions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; represented, and processes for getting from the premises to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conclusions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are carried out.  Note that this sense of &quot;following a process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inference&quot; is implementation-independent; it applies to neural nets and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forth as easily as to minds embodying some sort of explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; symbol-manipulation component.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that this is too narrow of a way to look at rationality, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;following a process of logical inference&quot; does not allow for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical nature of decision making.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, we are now running into the ambiguity of the word &quot;logic&quot;, which I use
<br>
to include probabilistic logic, which includes Bayes' Theorem and the other
<br>
results of elementary probability theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You need to expand your notion of rationality.  It is any process that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces the right answer.  Not by accident or only in some cases, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistently produces the most right answer possible.  Rationality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not too narrow or two broad of a word, IMO, but is just right.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds about the same to me as Eliezer's &quot;whatever works.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, then, given that I have a human brain with its ensuing strengths and
<br>
limitations, if I rely largely on emotion to drive me in producing a piece
<br>
of music or in guiding me through a mathematical proof, according to your
<br>
view what I'm doing is being &quot;rational.&quot;  I'm being &quot;rational&quot; because by
<br>
letting emotion guide me, I am achieving my goal of constructing music or
<br>
mathematics meeting certain criteria.
<br>
<p>And similarly, when my dog chases a female dog in heat, based on his
<br>
attraction to her smell, and then proceeds to hump her vigorously, he is
<br>
behaving rationally, because he is doing something that produces the right
<br>
answer for him, i.e. it achieves his goal of getting nookie.  His heuristic
<br>
&quot;smell it, chase it, hump it&quot; consistently produces the right answer for
<br>
him.  It's not a perfect heuristic -- it would be fooled by an appropriate
<br>
pheromone-generating machine -- but it works pretty well in reality....  Yet
<br>
it just doesn't feel right to me to say the dog is being &quot;rational&quot; in this
<br>
case...
