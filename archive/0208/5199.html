<p>BG&gt; What seems to have happened in Dick's mind is that the
<br>
BG&gt; complex-hypothetical-concept-generator ran amok, generating a huge variety
<br>
BG&gt; of funky stuff that would never stand up to empirical testing (and that
<br>
BG&gt; didn't really make him very happy either).
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>BG&gt; It's been tried....  Rimbaud is one poet who tried to drive himself nuts --
<br>
BG&gt; partly by taking drugs, but also by other means -- in an attempt to put
<br>
BG&gt; himself in a state of artistic information.  He sought &quot;the systematic
<br>
BG&gt; disorganization of all the senses.&quot;  I guess he succeeded, though he fucked
<br>
BG&gt; himself up personally in the process...
<br>
<p>See also Dali on Critical Paranoia:

<p>Tangentially related: hallucinogens are &quot;psychomemetic&quot; drugs, that
<br>
is, they are considered to cause symptoms similar to psychosis.
<br>
<p>Whether hallucinogens actually makes their users more creative, or only
<br>
gives them the illusion of being so, is open to debate; I tend to come
<br>
down on the latter side with filmmaker Stanley Kubrick (who often had
<br>
to deal with questions about 2001's imagery being LSD-inspired):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I believe that drugs are basically of more use to the audience than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the artist.  I think that the illusion of oneness with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;universe and absorption with the significance of every object in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;your environment, and the pervasive aura of peace and contentment is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not the ideal state for an artist.  It tranquilizes the creative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personality, which thrives on conflict and the clash and ferment of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ideas.  The artist's transcendence must be within his own work; he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;should not impose any artificial barriers between himself and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mainspring of his subconscious.  One of the things that's turned me
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;against LSD is that all the people I know who use it have a peculiar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inability to distinguish between things that are really interesting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and stimulating and things that *appear* so in the state of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;universal bliss the drug induces on a 'good' trip.  They seem to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;completely lose their critical faculties and disengage themselves
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from some of the most stimulating areas of life.  Perhaps when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*everything* is beautiful, nothing is beautiful.&quot; 
<br>
<p>If we build a human-level AI, could we design some set of inputs such
<br>
that the AI would &quot;trip&quot;?
