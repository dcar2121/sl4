<p>
The problem I continue to have with this recurring debate is that ultimately
<br>
even the most rational thoughts stem from something that is hardwired.  I
<br>
totally agree that it is better to have positions that are the conclusions
<br>
of clearly describable logical reasoning.  But, in the end, &quot;Because it will
<br>
enhance my overall understanding of the universe&quot; might be of no more cosmic
<br>
significance than, &quot;Because it will stimulate my pleasure centers.&quot;  People
<br>
who are doing things for this second cause will rarely give you a sound
<br>
argument that identifies this motive, which merely indicates the unconscious
<br>
hotwiring of internal reasoning that we call rationalization... But if they
<br>
did, would you be impressed?  Is reading a book on cognitive science really
<br>
any more rational than shooting up on heroin if the drug user impeccably
<br>
explains his reasoning?
<br>
<p>In other words, it's not the unwillingness of some to use logic as a metric
<br>
that scares me, but rather the possibility that no supergoals are inherently
<br>
better than any others.  After all, even the most noble altruistic urge, no
<br>
matter how stripped away from the ancestral instinct that originally gave
<br>
rise to that pattern of behavior, is still the result of a process native to
<br>
the particular hardware design of the person harboring it.  &quot;Because it
<br>
makes the world a better place.&quot; is really just a variation of &quot;because it
<br>
makes me feel good,&quot; even if it has a deeper, less obvious path leading to
<br>
it.  Hence, it's the psychological egoism pit that I fall into, not the fog
<br>
of self-mistrust.
<br>
<p>And I have trouble seeing why an SI seeking the True Meaning of Friendliness
<br>
wouldn't reach the same conclusion, as much as I hope otherwise.  I tried
<br>
(with equal incomprehensibility) to describe this dilemma in the closing
<br>
hours of this month's SL4 chat.  I just have this sad image of a
<br>
superintelligence looking over the hopeful, expectant masses of humanity: a
<br>
mind alone with the awful and certain knowledge that Friendliness is a red
<br>
herring -- that the perception of goal A's inherent superiority over goal B
<br>
is really just a product of cerebral process X... no more remarkable than
<br>
processes A through W, and, in a cosmic context, really very silly.  In such
<br>
a future, I have difficulty seeing why I should care if the SI somehow
<br>
stimulates my process X directly rather than bringing about an environment
<br>
where &quot;natural&quot; triggerings of process X are maximized.  After all, says
<br>
this vision, its really just a neurotransmitter thing anyway.  The universe
<br>
doesn't care about my human sense of good and evil.
<br>
<p>Will someone please help me out of here?  I'm guessing that Eliezer's
<br>
concept of Friendliness is supposed to reassure me through the idea that a
<br>
Friendly AI would possess a &quot;human&quot; sense of good and bad for the same
<br>
reasons I do, which is to say for the same potentially pointless (if not to
<br>
me), idiosyncratic thought patterns that I have.  Is there some major
<br>
philosophical point I'm forgetting?  Am I supposed to be content with this
<br>
solution because a Friendly SI (referenced to human Friendliness) is
<br>
theoretically optimal for human space?
