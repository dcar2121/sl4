<p>Only behaving in a way that looks rational is macho rationalism.

Behaving rationally on accident is simply not good enough to be a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Of course you cannot eliminate it from you completely without cutting

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; notice; your mind doesn't know the difference between ignoring and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; having.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that if you simply *consciously ignore* the large irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components of your mind, they are going to end up strongly influencing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconsciously.  I think it's better to explicitly come to grips with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ignoring them, in my view, is likely to lead to what Freud called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sublimation&quot; of them.   [And no, I don't believe most of Freudian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology.]
</em><br>
<p>Okay, ignore was the wrong term.  I thought that would convey the 
<br>
message, but I guess it didn't.
<br>
<p>I have these emotions turned off if you will.  They are not turned off 
<br>
the way a light is turned off, but the idea is similar.  I am not 
<br>
ignoring them as in pretending that they don't exist when they do.  For 
<br>
me, they don't exist 90% of the time (I'm not so good at it yet that I 
<br>
can promise that emotions *never* seep through that have to be actively 
<br>
blocked).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The only difference between the `conscious'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and `unconscious' parts of your brain are that the former allow for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feedback on the process of thought, whereas the latter only allow for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feedback on the results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is a very naive psychological statement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I think it's an *irrational* statement ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a statement that constradicts many known facts of cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel you are making this statement with such confidence because you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *like* it to be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it rational to hold such a strong belief based on such little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you're educated enough to realize there is empirical evidence on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics, right there in the library for your reading pleasure?
</em><br>
<p>I am not drawing the distinction along traditional psychological lines, 
<br>
so that's probable the problem.  Maybe I shouldn't use the words 
<br>
`conscious' and `unconscious' and just stick with something like 
<br>
`feedback-able thought' and `feedback-less though'.  To be fair I don't 
<br>
know a lot about psychology, but from what I know about neuropsychology 
<br>
I get the impression that all thought is the same qualitatively and the 
<br>
only difference is that some thought is feedback-able and some thought 
<br>
is not.  The problem is that your brain is good at tricking you into 
<br>
thinking feedback-less thought is feedback-able thought and that's where 
<br>
you have to watch for rationalization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen you each make many judgments that seemed to me purely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; emotional...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Which decisions were those?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One example is your habit of making strong statements about human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology, which also happen to contradict known psychological facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I'm not saying that you make these statements explicitly KNOWING 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they contradict known psychological facts.
</em><br>
<p>Uh oh, seems I have Eliezer-itus.  :-P
<br>
<p>Seriously, though, to be honest I don't use a lot of qualifiers about my 
<br>
current knowledge because I don't think it's particularly relevant.  
<br>
Either I'm right or not.  If I make errors, point them out.  Maybe you 
<br>
just think they're errors and maybe I am just more naive than I thought 
<br>
I was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, though, I have not yet met anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; a) seemed to me to be more rational than myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; b) also seemed to me to be roughly as creative as myself -- or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; *almost*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; as creative as myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; My use of the correspondence theory of truth indicates otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand what you're saying here.
</em><br>
<p>A weak(ly) humorous phrasing of:  &quot;I don't think your comment correspond 
<br>
to reality and therefore appear untrue&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some forms of irrationality are good at creating new ideas, but bad at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing, analyzing and refining them.
</em><br>
<p>Just because the ideas are `new' (and most are just new to you) does not 
<br>
mean that they are good or usable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus rationality works well in conjunction with some irrational thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes, which involve various types of quasirandom concept creation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most brilliant scientists have generally combined intensely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality with quirky but effective nonrational thought processes...
</em><br>
<p>Would you really call this process random and irrational?  New ideas 
<br>
come from following paths that connect ideas (using an appropriate 
<br>
memory model, of course) to reach new ideas.  Some of these links are 
<br>
weaker than others, but connections none the less.  You first explore 
<br>
strong connections for new ideas, and if they fail, you try weaker 
<br>
connections.  Eventually, you hope to reach some new connection that no 
<br>
one realized before.
<br>
<p>This requires that you already have some knowledge.  I'm not going to 
<br>
get into the discussion of how to gather this knowledge, since it's not 
<br>
relevant to humans trying to become rational; the AI researchers can 
<br>
worry about that stuff.  ;-)  (This is not to say that how to gather new 
<br>
knowledge is not important to rationality, but how to gain the initial 
<br>
knowledge is a bit different than subsequent knowledge as I understand 
<br>
it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that high levels of creativity often go along with willful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; automatic suspensions of rationality.  (Of course, this may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; meta level: one may find that it is rational to sometimes let yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; irrational!)  But when a mind spends a lot of  &quot;creative time&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; unlikely, irrational trains of thought, it often has difficulty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; shifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; back into a less creative but more rational mode.  I have seen this in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; many others, as well as myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I used to daydream a lot.  Since pursuing rationality, this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stopped.  Time spent thinking irrationally is not time worth thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irrational thinking can generate ideas that are later useful in rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking.  This is a subjective impression held by many many people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite thoroughly researched.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  And if I play roulette long enough, I'll probably win (of course, 
<br>
there is no statistical guarantee that this will eventually happen).  
<br>
Through directed thinking you can increase your ability to find usable 
<br>
ideas.  I'm not saying that random thought doesn't work, but that it's 
<br>
inefficient and there are better ways.
