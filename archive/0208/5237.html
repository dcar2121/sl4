<em>&gt;Of course, you are correct here, Eliezer.  &quot;Bayesianism&quot; is a philosophy of

</em><br>
<p>Yes, it was a curious blind spot on my part. I will check out the links in 
<br>
your mail. I sometimes come across people who have made sweeping 
<br>
generalizations about mathematics without really knowing any math at all, so 
<br>
I guess that Eliezer's poetic tribute triggered some kind of memetic immune 
<br>
response.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian analysis doesn't simply refer to the use of Bayes Theorem, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular style of statistical modeling, involving a host of theorems and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithms building on Bayes rule in a practical data analysis context.
</em><br>
<p>Bayes' Theorem supposes that we have a universal set U which is subdivided 
<br>
into disjunct subsets H_1, ..., H_n. Then, given an event A,
<br>
the probability of H_i when A has happened, P(H_i | A), can be calculated as
<br>
<p>P(H_i | A) = P(H_i)*P(A | H_i) / (\sum_j P(H_j)*P(A | H_j))
<br>
<p>What I have heard, the controversy that sometimes arises out of the use of 
<br>
this theorem is due to the fact that the probabilities P(H_j) are often very 
<br>
difficult to calculate, so you can distort your data by setting the 
<br>
probabilities P(H_j) in a sloppy fashion.
<br>
<p>Am I correct in saying that the different Bayesian philosophies are 
<br>
concerned with methods of setting these probabilities (are these the 
<br>
&quot;priors&quot; you discuss?) in a careful way? Or is this too simplistic?
<br>
Maybe we are getting off topic here...
<br>
