maintaining parity of power, protects those who control the military. 
<br>
Grossly excessive military spending may cause problems in the long run
<br>
as does inadequate military spending, but that is usually a symptom of
<br>
other problems.  Exactly how much military funding is &quot;excessive&quot; is
<br>
hard to determine.  While many people view US military spending as
<br>
excessive, as a percentage of the US GDP it is not dramatically higher
<br>
than most European and other &quot;first-world&quot; nations, and the US military
<br>
is actually deployed all over the world and involved in various
<br>
activities unlike most of the European militaries (excepting perhaps the
<br>
British, who have a similar GDP percentage as the US).
<br>
<p>Almost every country that actually spends more than a few percent of
<br>
their GDP on the military is a second-rate backwater that you wouldn't
<br>
normally think of as a military power.  And not surprisingly, none of
<br>
those countries are garden spots either.
