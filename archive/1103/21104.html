Hi All -
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if this list even exists anymore, but just in case it does... I've
<br>
been thinking about AGI and Friendliness. Yes, I know, a minefield to say
<br>
the least. Specifically, I've been taking this matter and  comparing it to
<br>
early Extropian notions about libertarianism and technological progress, and
<br>
the comparison suggests what might be a new question. (Something that I
<br>
daresay Ben Goertzel has considered, but I don't have him to hand, as it
<br>
were).
<br>
<p>So, I remember a piece of Max's (IIRC), in which he made the case that too
<br>
many governmental controls on technological development would only ensure
<br>
that less-controlled countries would develop key technologies first. Within
<br>
reason, that sounds a plausible claim to me. Universally Friendly AGI, of
<br>
the sort that SIAI contemplates, seems to be a textbook case of constrained
<br>
technological development. i.e. it seems reasonable to expect that
<br>
non-Friendly AGI would be easier to develop than Friendly AGI (even if FAI
<br>
is possible, and there seem to be good reasons to believe that universally
<br>
Friendly superhuman AGI would be impossible for humans to develop).
<br>
<p>Because Friendliness is being worked on for very good (safety) reasons, it
<br>
seems to me that we should be thinking about the possibility of &quot;locally
<br>
Friendly&quot; AGI, just in case Friendliness is in principle possible, but the
<br>
full package SIAI hopes for would just come along too late to be useful.
<br>
<p>By &quot;locally Friendly&quot;, I mean an AGI that respects certain boundaries, is
<br>
Friendly to *certain* people and principles, but not ALL of them. E.g. a
<br>
&quot;patriotic American&quot; AGI. That may sound bad, but if you've got a choice
<br>
between that and a completely unconstrained AGI, at least the former would
<br>
protect the people it was developed by/for.
<br>
<p>Anyway, before I go too far down this road, does anyone have any thoughts on
<br>
this idea? Maybe you know of a relevant article out there, someone who has
<br>
already considered the matter at length?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Amon
