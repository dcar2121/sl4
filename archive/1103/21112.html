<p>
The recent emails reminded me of the existence of SL4; I think it may
<br>
be time to discuss shutting down the list. I'm not the only one
<br>
thinking this, it seems:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, as far as I know the interesting parts of this list have mostly moved to lesswrong.
</em><br>
<p>or
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure if this list even exists anymore, but just in case it does...
</em><br>
<p>In 2010, there were a grand total of 144 emails on SL4, or less than 1
<br>
email every 2 days. Looking through <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/">http://sl4.org/archive/</a> , most of
<br>
those emails seem to be joins, link posting, or announcements. The SL4
<br>
home page claims that 'The SL4 list currently has around 200 members.
<br>
Usual volume is five to ten messages per day, with occasional
<br>
intervals of pleasant silence, and flurries of high activity.' but I
<br>
suspect both sentences are drastic over-estimations now.
<br>
<p>The last really interesting thing I can remember reading on SL4 is
<br>
Clark's review of a biography of Everett
<br>
(<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/1008/21012.html">http://sl4.org/archive/1008/21012.html</a>); conversations over the last
<br>
3 years - since Overcoming Bias started up, in fact - have tended to
<br>
be on a very low level. Perhaps I am simply growing up intellectually
<br>
(I joined SL4 in ~2004 as 'maru') but I think it is simply that people
<br>
are no longer using SL4 and have begun using LessWrong instead.
<br>
<p>LessWrong is very active. SL4 gets 144 emails a year - LessWrong gets
<br>
more like 144 comments a *day* (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/comments">http://lesswrong.com/comments</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/comments">http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/comments</a>). SL4 gets an email every
<br>
few days - LessWrong gets an article every day
<br>
(<a href="http://lesswrong.com/recentposts">http://lesswrong.com/recentposts</a>). Eliezer's fanfiction
<br>
(<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality</a>)
<br>
has 11,729 reviews, and has motivated many people to start reading
<br>
LessWrong and even come to meetups (I met 2 or 3 people who had been
<br>
lured in when I visited a SF Bay meetup). There are a lot of visitors
<br>
to LessWrong and they stay for a very long time reading material
<br>
(<a href="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=s18lesswrong">http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=s18lesswrong</a><br>
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/lesswrong.com">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/lesswrong.com</a>#), while SL4 traffic is so
<br>
low that it cannot be measured
<br>
(<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/http%3A%2F%2Fsl4.org">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/http%3A%2F%2Fsl4.org</a>#)
<br>
<p>(Similar stats are true of Overcoming Bias, which is now just Robin Hanson.)
<br>
<p>It's interesting to note that the SL4 homepage links to 5 or 6 other
<br>
mailing lists - and almost every link is dead. There might be an
<br>
argument that email as a medium has unique advantages, but as time
<br>
passes, this is less true; and for those advantages to be worthwhile,
<br>
the medium needs to actually be used. Demonstrably, email is no longer
<br>
a major medium for transhumanist discussion.
<br>
<p>Forums can die with dignity, at a specific date, with the last one out
<br>
turning off the lights; or they can die bit by bit, messily, like
<br>
someone dying of Alzheimer's or senile dementia - dead long before
<br>
they died. The worth of a forum is not measured by how long it can
<br>
drag out its existence (a decade is not bad), but by what is done or
<br>
written because of it. Many classic LW/OB posts were inspired by
<br>
comments or emails here; that's a fine legacy. There's no shame in
<br>
shutting down the list. Let's provide a tarball of emails for archival
<br>
purposes (the Internet Archive has up to February 2009:
<br>
<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090319140021/http://sl4.org/archive/">http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090319140021/http://sl4.org/archive/</a>),
<br>
and turn off the listserv.
