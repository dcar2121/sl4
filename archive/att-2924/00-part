<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt; Sysop: That would allow anyone to reprogram me and compromise the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;system. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp; This assumes we'll be somehow apart from the Sysop; consider the meaning of Jupiter Brain.&nbsp; Would one modality dock another's "pay"? I'm intimating throughout my posts that we will all likely become a part/become/merge with the Mind, and then we/I will mature and develop as 1.</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, conversely, consider:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the <EM>Parliament of Mind</EM> model, describing the brain and mind as several hundred organs, incidentally housed together,</LI>
<LI>the split-brain (commisurectomy) folks.</LI></OL>
<P>There may be more intracranial infighting now than would ever occur in a noodle so optimized.</P></div><br clear=all><hr>Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a href='http://go.msn.com/bql/hmtag2_etl_EN.asp'>Click Here</a><br></html>
