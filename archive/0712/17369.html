<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but it's risky applying this analogy to the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; AI and adult human. I don't want to be forced to do things on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; grounds that I am not intelligent enough to know what's good for me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; or even on the grounds that that is what I would wish to do were I a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; more intelligent and better informed version of myself.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Children aren't too keen on obeying their parents either. How would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resolve the apparent double standard?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We draw a line (perhaps arbitrarily) when children are adults.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, not all adults are equally intelligent, prudent, wise etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and many adults make bad decisions. But freedom means the freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make bad decisions. In some cases society considers it appropriate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infringe on a person's autonomy &quot;for their own good&quot;; for example, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mentally ill person is about to jump from a tall building in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief that he will be able to fly like superman. But such cases are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exception, and there is careful legislation in most countries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure that abuse does not occur.
</em><br>
<p>When you were a child, did you really think that your parents were asking in
<br>
your best interest when they wouldn't give you what you wanted?
<br>
<p>What makes you think you could be smarter than a machine that was designed to
<br>
be smarter than you?
<br>
<p>But it doesn't really matter, because most people think the same way, so that
<br>
is what we will build.  Suppose we are successful and the AI actually does
<br>
want to give us what we want right now.  To the AI, our brains are simple
<br>
computers that can be reprogrammed.  Move some neurons around, and we will all
<br>
be happy.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, evolution will continue to select agents that don't always get what
<br>
they want, that still fear death and then die.
