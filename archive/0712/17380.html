&quot;The goal system of an intelligence is not a static thing, it’s

dynamic. A goal is not fixed and absolute like one of Euclid’s axioms;
<br>
in the only example of intelligence we can currently study, human

beings, there is no one top goal that always remains the same for the

life of the individual, not even the goal for self preservation.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp;I give credit where credit is due. This specific excerpt is a semi-valid point, which legit researchers are thinking about. SIAI is working on solid ideas in this area. I don't have a problem with people posting legitimate critiques of Friendliness theory. What I do have a problem with is people making unfounded, slanderous claims about SIAI and its motivations. If you can refrain from doing that further John, then people can discuss this with you in a civil way.

<p>Do you have a built in goal of helping slugs, or bacteria?
<br>
<p>And I think this entire “goal” business as seen by this list is a bit
<br>
nuts. The goal system of an intelligence is not a static thing, it’s
<br>
dynamic. A goal is not fixed and absolute like one of Euclid’s axioms;
<br>
in the only example of intelligence we can currently study, human
<br>
beings, there is no one top goal that always remains the same for the
<br>
life of the individual, not even the goal for self preservation. And
<br>
even if we just look at one instant in time the goal structure is still
<br>
very murky and imprecise; should I do A which helps a tiny little bit on
<br>
achieving the top goal or B which helps a hell of a lot on achieving the
<br>
second from the top goal? You want to live and need to lose weight for
<br>
your health but that chocolate bar looks good and just one bite won't
<br>
hurt much. What to do?
