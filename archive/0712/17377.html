<p>The Life of Brian clip cited in Eliezer's essay there is wonderful and
<br>
deserves its own link:

</em><br>
<p>Elizer's point is that it's entirely possible for Joshua to think he
<br>
understands me, and me to listen to Joshua's restatements of what I
<br>
said, and we each misunderstand the other while the misunderstandings
<br>
lead us to think the communication is perfect.
<br>
<p>That's exactly how it happened when I had to explain it personally.
<br>
Based on reading the paper my reviewer thought I was implicitly having
<br>
a training phase and then a performance phase, whereas in fact I
<br>
intended the whole thing to be retrained on the entire memorized past
<br>
for every timestep because I'm hypothesizing unlimited computing
<br>
power.  There were a few other misunderstandings like that too.  It
<br>
left him with a model of what I was trying to say that was quite
<br>
broken and was not much helped by fixing any one misunderstanding.  We
<br>
stumbled around for a while before clearing it up.
