On Fri, 30 Nov 2007 &quot;P K&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kpete1@hotmail.com?Subject=RE:%20How%20to%20make%20a%20slave%20(was:%20Building%20a%20friendly%20AI)">kpete1@hotmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Being smarter doesn't necessarily follow that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI will ignore the dumber humans' instructions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chose to follow some other goals. 
</em><br>
<p>And I would maintain that not following the path that you know to be
<br>
smarter would not be very smart.
<br>
<p>In most of the rest of your post you demonstrate that anthropomorphic
<br>
reasoning can be very imperfect, especially when dealing with a very
<br>
different sort of being, and you are not wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if the 'putting yourself in its shoes' heuristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is so imperfect why keep it? 
</em><br>
<p>Because it’s all we’ve got. You haven’t a hope of understand your fellow
<br>
human beings if you up insist on only studying the pattern of neuron
<br>
firings inside their brain (although that would be child’s play compared
<br>
to an AI); you must look at a much higher and coarser level, the level
<br>
of emotion and goals and personality and intelligence (that last will
<br>
only work if you are smarter than the person under study)   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More importantly, what heuristics or models could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be used instead? Causality!
</em><br>
<p>Your view seems similar to that of Thomas McCabe, he too said it was too
<br>
difficult a task to understand a Jupiter brain at the level of wishes,
<br>
anger or contempt, but instead all we have to do is understand the
<br>
hundred thousand million billion trillion trillion lines of computer
<br>
source code in Mr. Jupiter Brain, and then we will know exactly what
<br>
every nand and nor circuit in that massive intellect will be doing for
<br>
the next billion years. And this in spite of the fact that there are 5
<br>
line computer programs who’s operation is completely inscrutable to
<br>
human beings.
<br>
<p>I don't think so.
