<p><em>&gt; When you were a child, did you really think that your parents were asking in

</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What makes you think you could be smarter than a machine that was designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be smarter than you?
</em><br>
<p>I won't be smarter than the machine, but I will still want to control
<br>
my own destiny as far as possible. That may involve allowing the
<br>
machine to make decisions on my behalf, but being able to change my
<br>
mind about this when I feel like it. This is no different to what
<br>
happens today with human experts: my dentist is a lot smarter than I
<br>
am when it comes to teeth, but ultimately it is up to me whether I
<br>
take his advice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it doesn't really matter, because most people think the same way, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is what we will build.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose we are successful and the AI actually does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to give us what we want right now.  To the AI, our brains are simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers that can be reprogrammed.  Move some neurons around, and we will all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be happy.
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully not if that's not what we we want it to do. Hopefully my
<br>
dentist won't replace all my teeth with dentures unless I want him to,
<br>
either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, evolution will continue to select agents that don't always get what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want, that still fear death and then die.
</em><br>
<p>You can only go so far with evolutionary arguments. A society that
<br>
kills its unproductive members will, all else being equal, prevail
<br>
over a society that does not. What conclusions should we draw from
<br>
this about the nature of successful civilizations in the universe?
<br>
What conclusions should we draw about how we should behave?
