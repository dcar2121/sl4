Yes, but it's risky applying this analogy to the relationship between
<br>
AI and adult human. I don't want to be forced to do things on the
<br>
grounds that I am not intelligent enough to know what's good for me,
<br>
or even on the grounds that that is what I would wish to do were I a
<br>
more intelligent and better informed version of myself.
<br>
<p>I am in total agreement on this.  Most people are willing to tolerate rather extreme levels of risk in exchange for maximum freedom to self-determine (within the confines of physics, of course -- let's not get mired in arguments about &quot;the illusion of free will&quot; or &quot;the illusion of the individual self&quot;!).  
<br>
<p>I keep hoping the whole &quot;let's build a Robot Mommy to take care of us!&quot; framing of FAI is just a caricature.  Shouldn't advanced AI be put toward important things like oh, say, helping humans deal with the possibility of large asteroids destroying the planet, rather than toward enforcing &quot;bedtime&quot; rules?  
<br>
<p>I mean, let's keep some perspective here, people.  Nobody likes a micromanager, and I doubt the intention of all this high-level AI talk is to come up with something that will tell each of us exactly what to do, every moment of our lives, on a personal level.  
<br>
<p>My concept of how humans and AIs might relate in the future is one in which the AI operates alongside us, not &quot;above&quot; us like some kind of pseudo-god figure.  A truly useful AI would have no need for monkey abstractions like &quot;authority&quot; and &quot;hierarchy&quot;.  It would also ideally be impersonal the way that science is impersonal -- e.g., we would not owe fealty to it, nor would it force us to do anything in particular, but it would be there as a resource and would effectively prove itself useful through its tangible effects (in the manner of things like evolutionary theory, physics, and the Internet).  
<br>
<p>Some of the language used on this list really does remind me of theological speculation on the nature of god(s), which I suppose makes sense considering this entire discourse (aside from any actual coding and machine-building) lies in the realm of metaphysics, but it's still a bit bewildering at times to see so many probable atheists engaging in repeated attempts to harmonize incompatible &quot;omni&quot; attributes in a formulation amenable to practical reality.
