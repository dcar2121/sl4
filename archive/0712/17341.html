<p>As a matter of fact, my father shared with me that in almost every
<br>
decision he made regarding my upbringing, he did his best to do those
<br>
things I would have asked him to do, were I looking back upon them as my
<br>
future self.  I believe many parents do this at least from time to time,
<br>
though certainly more implicitly.  And where my mistakes were not so
<br>
serious as to excise huge regions of my future choices (or small but
<br>
critical ones), he let me make them and learn from them.  
<br>
<p>In an important and relevant sense, I believe you could say he did obey
<br>
me without question.  
<br>
<p>Most of us could be accused of allowing children to starve.  It's not
<br>
because we're malevolent and wish them a swift demise; these mostly
<br>
distant youths are, more than anything, just not relevant in our daily
<br>
lives.  However, they starve whether we justify it or not.  If we're
<br>
simply not relevant to an AI with the potential ability to control most
<br>
or all resources, we'll likely &quot;starve&quot;, too.
<br>
<p>The only relevance we're ultimately going to have to an entity we
<br>
construct that is radically more intelligent than us is the relevance we
<br>
embed into the structure and content of the seed we plant (however
<br>
tenuous that embedding ends up being over iterated self improvement will
<br>
surely vary as a function of specific design).  Any game-theoretical
<br>
explanations for emergent long-term cooperation seem to revert when one
<br>
agent can act with literal impunity.  I'd expect any intelligent actor
<br>
seeking any goal to cooperate as long as that was the shortest path to
<br>
goal fulfillment, but at some power ratio/disparity, cooperation can
<br>
start to become just another needless hoop to jump though.  
<br>
<p>When Lord Acton said, &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;, he was
<br>
definitely talking about game theory.  And it is our Friendliness to
<br>
other entities that is corrupted.  At least *we* can often count on the
<br>
end result of our entire evolutionary path and its cultural expression
<br>
to ground us.  But in constructing an intelligence, we have no a priori
<br>
need to maintain that deeply seated continuity.  We can do it in any
<br>
number of ways that actually function.  
<br>
<p>FAI is, in a sense, about maintaining that arc of continuity (of which
<br>
we tend to consider ourselves an important part), if possible, as much
<br>
as possible.  It may not be possible.  But its possibility is the
<br>
difference between facilitating our future en force, or going silently
<br>
into the good night of a strange and final mitochondrial eve.  
<br>
<p>And at least if *that* has to happen, let's push something
<br>
non-degenerate through that bottleneck.  It may turn out that some
<br>
processes that look like reasonable Super-AIs can be shown to (likely)
<br>
halt after making a solar system worth of paperclips.  Let's choose a
<br>
different design than that one, if we can.  And better yet, one that
<br>
doesn't result in an AI posthumously concluding it would have been nice
<br>
to keep us around (we were so close!), once it's *really* done growing
<br>
up.
