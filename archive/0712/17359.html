2007/11/21, Tim Freeman &lt;<a href="mailto:tim@fungible.com?Subject=Re:%20Building%20a%20friendly%20AI%20from%20a%20&quot;just%20do%20what%20I%20tell%20you&quot;%20AI">tim@fungible.com</a> &gt;:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... <a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/index.html">http://www.fungible.com/respect/index.html</a>.  Unfortunately the paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs revision and hasn't yet made sense to someone who I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain it to personally.  Maybe I'll be able to make it readable over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanksgiving.
</em><br>
<p><p>Tim,
<br>
<p>The paper is, in fact, very clearly written. Its style achieves a nice
<br>
balance between the heavy formalism of academic papers and the informal
<br>
exposition in many transhumanist items, even the better ones. Each style has
<br>
its place, but your article's is just right for what it is aiming at.
<br>
<p>Here are my thoughts about it:
<br>
<p>- SIAI is trying to trigger more research into FAI beyond Eliezer's own. It
<br>
is really good to see that this is starting to happen.
<br>
- Your diagrams are great. But they need more step-by-step explanation. This
<br>
is the only less-than-clear part the paper.
<br>
- Thanks for including the Python. Code gives a great tool for verifying the
<br>
claims of your article.
<br>
- A minor point: There are some places where you mix levels of abstraction,
<br>
raising code-level issues ( e.g., using integers as indexes) in an article
<br>
that is otherwise focused on theory.
<br>
- I don't get why compassion and respect have to be separated. Both mean
<br>
that the AI needs a utility function which matches another agent's. In the
<br>
case of compassion, positive utility, and in the case of respect, negative.
<br>
Since the AI can give different weightings to different agent's utility, it
<br>
seems that we can cover &quot;compassion&quot; and &quot;respect&quot; with a single concept.
<br>
- Might issues of horizons, time periods, and transaction demarcation be
<br>
handled by introducing time into the utility function -- e.g., with
<br>
exponential damping/discounting?
<br>
<p>Joshua
