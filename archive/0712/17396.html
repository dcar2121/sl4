Subject: Scenario for early hard takeoff
<br>
<p>I would like to hear your opinions on the threat of early, hard takeoff
<br>
following an evolutionary approach to AGI.  As you know, there are many
<br>
groups
<br>
working independently toward this goal and not everyone is designing for
<br>
friendliness.  In fact, many don't even consider it to be a problem.  They
<br>
are
<br>
just trying to get their systems to work.
<br>
<p>A singularity is launched when computers have better than human level
<br>
intelligence, because if humans can create such machines, then those
<br>
machines
<br>
can do likewise, and faster.  But how do know when a machine is smarter than
<br>
you?  My computer has an IQ of 10^12 in arithmetic and 0.001 in art
<br>
appreciation.
<br>
<p>I argue that the relevant measure of intelligence is the ability to
<br>
recursively improve itself.  We know that an agent cannot predict the output
<br>
of another agent of greater algorithmic complexity.  Therefore recursive
<br>
self
<br>
improvement (RSI) necessarily requires an experimental approach.  The parent
<br>
does not know which mutations will result in a more successful child.
<br>
<p>I think you can see that AGI will likely take an evolutionary approach. 
<br>
Evolution favors intelligences that are the most successful at reproduction.
<br>
<p>There are two ways to accomplish this.
<br>
<p>1. Good heuristics, e.g. ability to guess which modifications are likely to
<br>
be
<br>
beneficial.
<br>
<p>2. Access to resources, e.g. CPU cycles, memory, network bandwidth, which
<br>
limit the rate at which experiments can be performed (i.e. the population
<br>
size).  Brute force makes up for bad heuristics.
<br>
<p>Currently, humans have better heuristics than machines.  Random bit flips to
<br>
a
<br>
program are very unlikely to yield improvements with respect to any
<br>
meaningful
<br>
goal.  Software is on the chaotic side of Kauffman's threshold for
<br>
critically
<br>
balanced systems.  Any small change in the code results in a large change in
<br>
behavior.  Software engineers have many techniques for reducing the
<br>
interdependency of programs to bring them closer to a Lyapunov exponent of
<br>
0:
<br>
local variables, functions, classes, packages, libraries, and standard
<br>
protocols.  In addition, software development, debugging, testing, and
<br>
reverse
<br>
engineering require a lot of human level knowledge: understanding how users
<br>
and programmers think, familiarity with similar software, and the ability to
<br>
read vague and incomplete specifications in natural language and fill in the
<br>
blanks with reasonable assumptions.  A hacker reverse engineering a network
<br>
client can spot an icon image embedded in an executable and guess what
<br>
happens
<br>
when a user clicks on it.  A machine does not have this advantage.
<br>
<p>The second problem is to acquire resources.  This could happen 3 ways.
<br>
<p>1. They could be bought, e.g. Google, Blue Gene/L.
<br>
2. They could be begged, e.g. GIMPS, SETI@Home.
<br>
3. They could be stolen, e.g. the 1988 Morris worm, Code Red, SQL Slammer.
<br>
<p>Worms are primitive organisms.  They reproduce rapidly, taking over a large
<br>
portion of the Internet in minutes or hours, but they can't usefully mutate.
<br>
<p>Once the environment adapts by closing the security holes they exploited,
<br>
they
<br>
become extinct.
<br>
<p>A deeper reason is that the worms ultimately failed because they could only
<br>
acquire a small portion of the available resources.  The Internet is not
<br>
just
<br>
a network of a billion computers.  It is a network of a billion computers
<br>
and
<br>
a billion human brains.  But what will happen when most of the computing
<br>
resources shift to silicon?
<br>
<p>An intelligent worm that understands software is my nightmare.  Every day
<br>
Microsoft issues security patches.  So does just about every major software
<br>
developer.  I know that there are thousands of vulnerabilities on my
<br>
computer
<br>
right now.  Usually it is not a problem because if nobody knows about them,
<br>
then nobody can exploit them, and once they are exploited, they are
<br>
discovered
<br>
and the software is patched.  The window of vulnerability is small.
<br>
<p>But what happens when an AGI can analyze and reverse engineer software, then
<br>
launch an attack that exploits thousands of vulnerabilities at once?
<br>
<p>Here are just a few examples.
<br>
<p>Every few days when I turn off my computer, Windows installs an automatic
<br>
update.  What happens if:
<br>
1. windowsupdate.microsoft.com is hacked, and my PC downloads a trojan.
<br>
2. The DNS server of my ISP was hacked, and returned a bogus IP address for
<br>
windowsupdate.microsoft.com directing me to a lookalike site.
<br>
3. A router between my PC and the server was hacked, and inserts packets
<br>
containing trojan code.
<br>
4. My neighbor's PC was hacked, listens to traffic on the cable modem (which
<br>
is a broadcast medium) and injects packets at just the right time.
<br>
<p>Linux is not immune.  When I boot up Ubuntu I often get a notification that
<br>
updates are available and I happily type in my root password so it can
<br>
install
<br>
a new kernel.  All sorts of programs now have automatic updates.
<br>
<p>I must stress that fixing these vulnerabilities does not solve the problem,
<br>
because there are thousands more, and an intelligent machine is going to
<br>
find
<br>
them first.  It will also be far more clever.  Undoubtedly it has hacked
<br>
into
<br>
Yahoo or a router somewhere and read my email, so it knows that I test data
<br>
compression programs on my PC.  I get an email with a return address from
<br>
someone I know that works in data compression development that a new version
<br>
is available.  My virus detector has never seen the program before.
<br>
<p>Just as the most successful parasites do not kill their hosts, successful
<br>
worms will remain hidden.  Your computer will seem to work normally.  But
<br>
really, what could you do?  You google for a test and download a patch, with
<br>
the worm watching your every move?  Wipe your disk and reinstall the OS from
<br>
CD, and then connect to an Internet where every computer is infected?  Or do
<br>
you just accept that you can't trust your computer, and just live with it?
