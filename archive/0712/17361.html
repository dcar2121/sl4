<p><p>In case you haven't noticed, John does not 'debate' or 'discuss' in
<br>
any of the usual meanings of these words. He has his prejudices and he
<br>
shouts them loudly.  He is not likely to change as he has been doing
<br>
this for many years. His prejudices do sometimes agree with reality,
<br>
in which case he shouts his 'Bullshit!' at astrologers, homoeopaths,
<br>
etc. Where they don't, he still shouts 'Bullshit!' , so it is hard to
<br>
tell the difference.
<br>
<p>If his 'Bullshit!' is aimed at occasional items under discussion, it
<br>
is not too annoying. But if his 'Bullshit!' is aimed at the basic
<br>
premises of a list, then he is acting as a troll.
<br>
<p>In this case John seems to be desperately trying to get himself
<br>
banned, so that he can claim that his vast reasoning powers won every
<br>
argument and SL4 were forced to ban him because they could not defeat
<br>
the mystical power of 'Bullshit!'.
