<p><em>&gt; As we get better at directly manipulating human abilities, we're probably

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider a new intelligence enhancement drug that, in clinical trials, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been shown to reduce IQ by 5 points 90% of the time, and raise it by 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points 10% of the time (and can be repeated indefinitely). For an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual, this is a pretty bad deal -- but get a group of 10,000 devoted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularitarians, have each one take the treatment, and then repeat it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones who get enhanced, and you'll end up with one person with an IQ 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points higher. And one ridiculously smart individual may make enough of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to outweigh making 9,000 willing volunteers marginally dumber.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'd like to think I would volunteer, if it were the most cost-effective way
<br>
to help out. (I can't say whether it's probable that I would actually
<br>
volunteer, since (a) I'm not yet taking time to actually think it over since
<br>
it's hypothetical, and (b) the human brain has an uncanny knack for
<br>
rationalizing its way out of actually following through with making
<br>
sacrifices for strangers.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm curious about any thoughts others might have about this. I've heard a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of rhetoric about sacrificing spare money and spare time for FAI, and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as I know there isn't a major difference between 1) sacrificing a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time advancing something that may not succeed within one's lifetime, if at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, and 2) sacrificing a risk-adjusted 3.5 IQ points in order to ensure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone out there will be really, really intelligent.
</em><br>
<p><p>On a psychological or motivational level (rather than a utilitarian level),
<br>
there's a huge difference (especially for non-transhumanists).
