<p>Why would you like to think that?  On the face of it it is a very poor  
<br>
decision.  The likely outcome is that you lose 3.5 IQ points.    
<br>
Perhaps we get somone  whose IQ is raised 50 points but of what good  
<br>
is that to you?  There are hyper IQ folks out there now who aren't  
<br>
working on anything you think is all that important.  What makes you  
<br>
think that possibly getting one more such person is worth the real  
<br>
damage to yourself and most others who volunteer?   Would you &quot;like to  
<br>
think that&quot; because it makes you a &quot;good Joe&quot; or willing to take one  
<br>
for the group or such?  Why?
<br>
<p>The rest of the &quot;all too human&quot; reasoning above says that you (and I  
<br>
mean all of us) need all our marbles intact.  :-)
