<p>
As we get better at directly manipulating human abilities, we're probably
<br>
going to encounter situations in which a treatment has uncertain effects.
<br>
Consider a new intelligence enhancement drug that, in clinical trials, has
<br>
been shown to reduce IQ by 5 points 90% of the time, and raise it by 10
<br>
points 10% of the time (and can be repeated indefinitely). For an
<br>
individual, this is a pretty bad deal -- but get a group of 10,000 devoted
<br>
singularitarians, have each one take the treatment, and then repeat it for
<br>
the ones who get enhanced, and you'll end up with one person with an IQ 50
<br>
points higher. And one ridiculously smart individual may make enough of a
<br>
contribution to outweigh making 9,000 willing volunteers marginally dumber.
<br>
<p>I'm curious about any thoughts others might have about this. I've heard a
<br>
lot of rhetoric about sacrificing spare money and spare time for FAI, and as
<br>
far as I know there isn't a major difference between 1) sacrificing a lot of
<br>
time advancing something that may not succeed within one's lifetime, if at
<br>
all, and 2) sacrificing a risk-adjusted 3.5 IQ points in order to ensure
<br>
that someone out there will be really, really intelligent.
<br>
<p>Has this kind of concern been addressed before? Is it still a valid plan if
<br>
the equation works out in such a way that there's a high probability that *
<br>
nobody* will be enhanced, even if other people are harmed (e.g. if it was a
<br>
90% chance of a 50 point drop, and a 10% chance of a 100 point boost, and
<br>
you only have four volunteers, do you proceed?).
<br>
<p>My best guess is that the Kelly Criterion will come into play, but IQ isn't
<br>
fungible; the marginal utility seems to increase.
