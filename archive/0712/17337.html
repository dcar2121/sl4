<p><em>&gt; A quick list archive check shows that you haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posted here prior to 2006. Another archive check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows you haven't posted anything to the AGIRI lists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you point out, there aren't very many places where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people discuss this stuff- where have you been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posting your comments? 
</em><br>
<p>I have posted several megabits of text to the Extropian list, and before
<br>
that going back to the early 90’s to Cryonet and the old Transhuman
<br>
list. At the time the term Friendly AI had not been coined but the idea
<br>
was well known; I though it was idiotic then I think its idiotic now.
<br>
<p>I would have posted to this list far more often that I have if it
<br>
weren’t for several rather disgraceful kill threads; however it is to
<br>
the list’s credit that this time they have not muzzled me, at least not
<br>
yet. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for Extropians, I've never been subscribed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I was under the impression that it didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually have discussions of FAI theory.
</em><br>
<p>I haven’t seen anything on this list that hasn’t been discussed on the
<br>
Extropian List a decade ago, well ok…. almost nothing.
