<em>&gt; &gt; Still the third person perspective, which does not create an arrow of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality but only bits floating around in trivially existing space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You still haven't shown that there is anything wrong with this approach.
</em><br>
<p>The knowledge argument: mary is born in a room with no colored objects. She
<br>
studies every physical phenomenon connected with colors and light. Then she
<br>
steps out of the room and sees actual colors. Will she learn something new?
<br>
If so, the third person interpretation of color is not sufficient to cover
<br>
all of the phenomena concerning color.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you can show this to be the case, I will still not understand how
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; arrived at your 5-element list for making estimations on the universal
</em><br>
goodness
<br>
<em>&gt; balance of qualia. There seem to be significant more assumptions than the
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; you stated above contained in those statements, which don't appear correct
</em><br>
to me.
<br>
<p>Since you asked, I made a first attempt at writing down some guidelines; I
<br>
don't expect you to accept those if you don't agree on the basic assertion
<br>
that positive and negative qualia are the most important thing. And I
<br>
haven't thought about those guideline for long either. Though I think they
<br>
are roughly correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think there is anything gained from using a first person
</em><br>
perspective,
<br>
<em>&gt; and I see the danger of jumping to a lot of wrong conclusions.
</em><br>
<p>It's not that there isn't anything to be gained; first person perspective is
<br>
what constitutes your experience; denying it is taking your own self out of
<br>
the equation which makes no sense as far as I am concerned. Subjectivity is
<br>
important. Even though it's a strange animal in an otherwise peaceful and
<br>
pretty 3rd person model of the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's wrong with analyzing anything from the outside? Afaik that's
</em><br>
usually the
<br>
<p>that when you analyze something from outside, the subjective world ceases to
<br>
exist and you lose part of the information available to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To quote an earlier post: &quot;[...]the URGENT need right now is to remove
</em><br>
negative
<br>
<em>&gt; qualia!&quot; - I maintain that the most urgent thing to do right now is to not
</em><br>
make
<br>
<em>&gt; things any worse; and I think that trying to implement qualia-based
</em><br>
morality
<br>
<p>The most urgent thing right now, depends on what you think is important. So
<br>
if we cannot agree on what is important, we won't agree on what's urgent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I just think I'm right that's all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people probably believe that when they argue honestly; or at least
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; believe that they are probably more right than what they are arguing
</em><br>
against.
<br>
<p>Yes I am aware of that ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; models we are defending would have significant effects on both of us if it
</em><br>
were
<br>
<em>&gt; to be implemented in an AI that reaches SI status, agreeing to disagree
</em><br>
doesn't
<br>
<em>&gt; work here unless we both accept that the other person doesn't have any
</em><br>
realistic
<br>
<p>true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; hunger in the past, a million more or so won't make such a big
</em><br>
difference.
<br>
<em>&gt; Not really. According to my world model, there isn't really anything left
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; their mind, so how many have died in the past wouldn't be relevant for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluating how bad X people dieing now is.
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow your reasoning.
<br>
There isn't anything left of yesterday's dinner so how long it took for it
<br>
to cook isn't relevant for evaluating how long it will take today?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For this argument to work, you need something of them persisting in
</em><br>
reality,
<br>
<em>&gt; like the &quot;qualia streams&quot; you suggested. My world model doesn't suggest
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; this is the case.
</em><br>
<p>The negative/positive value of qualia streams doesn't get reset to zero once
<br>
the qualia stream reaches an end. Is someone who lived a miserable life 1000
<br>
years ago any less unfortunate than someone who is living a miserable life
<br>
today?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; other AIs close to takeoff around that have significantly different goal
</em><br>
system,
<br>
<em>&gt; the first SI will likely either destroy them outright, or limit their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development as to prevent them from becoming a serious threat.
</em><br>
<p>For the first SI to destroy others would require a very straightforward
<br>
implementation of 'utility' and a very low level of friendliness. I would
<br>
hope that no matter how primitive the original moral system embedded in
<br>
these AIs, they would still think twice about interfering with other (lower
<br>
but) massive AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any event, it seems likely that the only AI whose morality will have
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; long-term effects is that of the first SI.
</em><br>
<p>If it doesn't have even rudimentary hard-coded limitations yes that is
<br>
likely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it's the one built on earth, we are back to it dominating practically
</em><br>
all of
<br>
<em>&gt; space. If it's the other one, what we do is of very little relevance in
</em><br>
the long
<br>
<em>&gt; term in any event; planning for it is ineffective.
</em><br>
<p>Unless there is some kind of physical limit on the power of transhuman AIs.
<br>
Which could be given by an upper bound on computational speed/power, an
<br>
upper bound on memory density, or an upper bound to the kind of matter
<br>
control that is possible. Think of the tic tac toe game. A game with two
<br>
good players will always end in a draw; because there is a limit to the kind
<br>
of moves that can be made. The set of actions in the 3x3 system is the
<br>
limiting factor not our actual IQ which is good enough to encode a
<br>
never-lose strategy. What if with ultimate control over matter one can build
<br>
an impenetrable shield? Then no AI could take over another AI above a
<br>
certain level, because no amount of added intelligence could penetrate the
<br>
barrier. For instance, think travelling at the speed of light, or creating
<br>
new universes which end up being completely autonomous
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's what Chalmers wants to do. We will find physical differences in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processes that create different qualia, hopefully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd really like to see that kind of results. If qualia can be empirically
</em><br>
shown
<br>
<em>&gt; to be based on anything else than ordinary, known physics, we would have
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; more common ground to discuss your suggestions on morality (never mind
</em><br>
that my
<br>
<em>&gt; world model would require significant modification first).
</em><br>
<p>How are you using the word &quot;based&quot;? Qualia are evidently supplemental to
<br>
ordinary, known physics, since ordinary physics does not predict redness.
<br>
Although there is likely to be a correlation between ordinary, known (or
<br>
soon to be known) physics and the details of qualia. The kind of results
<br>
expected:
<br>
&quot;We found that painful sensations are associated with a cascade reaction
<br>
involving progressive inhibition of useful world-knowledge; whenever
<br>
knowledge previously available to introspection is suddenly put away the
<br>
quality of the subjective experience arising from that process as reported
<br>
from the subject is negative. On the other hand, A cascade reaction
<br>
involving sudden positive reinforcement of very many interconnected ideas is
<br>
perceived as positive&quot;.
<br>
<p>So in this case we'd have a correlation, which will be useful for detecting
<br>
qualia, estimating their quality, etc.
