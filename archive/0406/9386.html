</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;An objectively existing optimization process, evolution, did the job.

<p><em>&gt;&gt;We looked at the objective morality that produced us,

<p><em>&gt;&gt;and said, &quot;Yuck, how immoral.&quot;  Why wouldn't that happen to any other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;objective morality we ran across, if it took no notice of love and life

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Love and life and laughter are currently expressed in matter in

</em><br>
<em>&gt;of that, I'd prefer not to try to defend such a thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In any case, the fact that some or many humans say &quot;Yuck, how
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;consensus would have been a good way to determine the distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the Indies heading west from Spain, or the value of PI.
</em><br>
<p>I the points are not entirely clear.  Perhaps if we state it in smaller 
<br>
chunks . . . .
<br>
<p>1)  Humans have a species-wide sense of &quot;moral&quot; including behavior.
<br>
<p>2)  We got this psychological trait the same way we got everything else, 
<br>
evolution, with all that implies particularly Hamilton's inclusive fitness.
<br>
<p>3)  If you consider particular aspects of this psychological trait, what is 
<br>
considered moral is that which improves genetic survival or did in the EES.
<br>
<p>4)  &quot;Improves genetic survival&quot; has many levels, from an individual to the 
<br>
whole species, with a penumbra that reaches out to the whole biosphere our 
<br>
species is dependant upon.
<br>
<p>5)  Because &quot;moral&quot; depends on the level and the local viewpoint, &quot;moral&quot; 
<br>
behavior includes up to humans killing each other in times of resource crunch.
<br>
<p>How all this maps into an era of AI, nanotech, uploading and the like is a 
<br>
complex set of problems.
