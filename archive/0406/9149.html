<p>
Having followed some of the recent volition discussions I thought it
<br>
might be interesting and appropriate to have codified (specified as a
<br>
supergoal?) into the 
<br>
(yet to be developed) fai's interaction with sentients protocols a
<br>
'right of withdrawal'
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Presumably by the point that this interaction becomes worth discussing
<br>
the (hopefully) fai has access to technologies (probably self developed)
<br>
which allow it to control and manipulate the human environmental space.
<br>
Any sentient capable of expressing the desire to be 'left alone' should
<br>
be provided with sufficient personal space and supportive environmental
<br>
conditions to 'live out their lives' as they wish without the oversight,
<br>
modification or interference by the fai. This could be a separate 'no
<br>
interference zone or enclave' or perhaps a mobile field/area around the
<br>
sentient. It (presumably) goes without saying (although I will say it)
<br>
that although the 'withdrawn' sentient is ensured that it will not be
<br>
affected by the FAI (within its enclave) it should nevertheless be
<br>
prevented from adversely affecting those within the 'consilience' of the
<br>
fai (i.e. those joined to the fai and the collective volition).
<br>
Additionally the sentient at any time should be able to 'emerge' from
<br>
the withdrawn state as should any descendants of the sentient.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I haven't really seen this view directly published (although it follows
<br>
logically and is somewhat akin to the 'last judge' sentiment - however
<br>
directed on an individual ongoing basis instead of at the fai process
<br>
level) although it might be assumed to follow directly from the concept
<br>
of volition.
