<p>::sigh:: That's the problem with Jackson's so-called &quot;knowledge argument&quot;;
<br>
he postulates a being whose power and knowledge vastly exceeds our own, and
<br>
then supposes that he can intuit what that being does or does not know. Well
<br>
how about a new argument (which, as far as I am aware, is original):
<br>
<p>(1) Assume that there is something it is like to see a Tesseract (an object
<br>
analogous to a cube which occupies 4 dimensions rather than 3).
<br>
(2) I already know everything there is to know about a Tesseract, namely
<br>
that it consists of 8 cubes, 24 squares, 32 edges, 16 vertices, and so on
<br>
and so forth. Furthermore, if any question is asked to me regarding the
<br>
properties of a Tesseract, I could, using abstract mathematics, answer the
<br>
question.
<br>
(3) Nonetheless, I have never seen a Tesseract; I cannot imagine one in the
<br>
same sense that I can imagine a cube or a triangle.
<br>
(4) Suppose that my visual-cortex is now suitably modified so that I can
<br>
imagine a Tesseract, or any other such 4-dimensional object.
<br>
(5) By our assumption that there is something it is like to see a Tesseract,
<br>
and by the fact that I have never seen a Tesseract before, we can conclude
<br>
that I now know something genuinely new about Tesseracts; what one looks
<br>
like!
<br>
(6) However, this contradicts the fact that I already know everything there
<br>
is to know about Tesseracts.
<br>
<p>(Note: If one REALLY feels motivated to doubt (1) or the possibility of (4),
<br>
an analogous argument can be made by using an individual who is born without
<br>
a visual cortex, masters geometry, and then is given a new visual cortex.)
<br>
<p>How did we arrive at this contradiction? We have not stated precisely what
<br>
is meant by &quot;know&quot;, and our reliance upon its everyday common meaning leads
<br>
to (6), a contradiction. &quot;Know&quot; seems to be playing double-duty for two
<br>
different concepts in the above. In (2), we are talking about &quot;knowing&quot; in
<br>
terms of abstract, mathematical knowledge, while in (5) we are talking about
<br>
&quot;knowing&quot; in terms of seeing, perceptually. I will leave the former type
<br>
with its usually associated term; knowing or knowledge, whereas I will call
<br>
the latter type of knowing qualia. Thus qualia is not something which we can
<br>
be substituted for with abstract knowledge, nor can we say whether or not an
<br>
agent has a particular quale by relying purely upon the agent's input-output
<br>
behavior, as my current self and my self with 4-dimensional vision would
<br>
give the same answers to all questions asked to us (unless you asked me
<br>
whether or not I could see in 4-dimensions, I being such an honest
<br>
individual ;-p ).
<br>
<p>As an aside, one should be highly skeptical of anyone who uses qualia to
<br>
argue for a new type of physics, or for some sort of dualism; the above
<br>
argument is wholly compatible with modern physics and (certain versions of)
<br>
Functionalism. In fact, the problems of the existence of qualia and the
<br>
detection of the existence / inexistence of a particular quale in a
<br>
particular agent is almost certainly one which can be wholly addressed using
<br>
suitably modified versions of information theory and computer science.
<br>
Furthermore, one should be highly skeptical of anyone claiming qualia can be
<br>
used as a basis for an objective morality; it is difficult to see where the
<br>
&quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; (with a capital G and a capital E) is in visions of
<br>
Tesseracts or the redness of red--this smacks me as
<br>
&quot;religious-meme-leftovers&quot; in a new guise.
