Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p>You are fully aware that if you create a coercive collective 'volition' 
<br>
machine that you have to get it right first up or we're all screwed for 
<br>
eternity.  I agree with you on this.
<br>
<p>But is it possible to get it right first time in practice or in theory?
<br>
<p>I believe that it is not for many reasons. But there is one foundational 
<br>
reason that, as far as I can see, cannot be got around.
<br>
<p>Your whole concept is based on the notion of extrapolating the 
<br>
collective will of *all humans*.  But what if it's meaningless to frame the 
<br>
issue in terms of a single human collectivity?
<br>
<p>Humans certainly exist in collectives - family, organisation, city, nation, 
<br>
etc. etc.  But these collectives are fluid.  People come and go from the 
<br>
collective.  Over time the collectives that people organise themselves 
<br>
into change - get bigger or get smaller, change membership.
<br>
<p>The collective 'human' is in fact not a real thing - it is a very useful 
<br>
scientific abstraction that groups people together based on common 
<br>
evolutionary history and the current fact that they can interbreed.  It is a 
<br>
taxonomic concept not a physical thing.  In the past there several 
<br>
species of humans - Homo Sapiens, Neandethal humans, Cro Magnon 
<br>
etc.  If you were doing the job of creating a coercive collective 'volition' 
<br>
machine when the others were around would you have included all of 
<br>
these human species or just homo sapiens?  And if you were doing the 
<br>
job 1000 years into the future when humans have spread into the solar 
<br>
system and perhaps the galaxy and they had morphed through 
<br>
techological change into a vast variety of types - some up-loaded, 
<br>
some physically manifest, some hybrid, some....(I don't know - fill in 
<br>
your favourite amazing ways that we could be).  Are all these entities 
<br>
humans??  Should they all be governed by the coercive collective 
<br>
'volition' machine?  And what about other AGIs?  And what if we find 
<br>
sentient advanced life somewhere else in the universe? And what 
<br>
about dolphins (if we gave then voice control over robots we might find 
<br>
that they could fast evolve into advanced sentients [as we understand 
<br>
it] too.)
<br>
<p>But you might say that I'm being fanciful and not dealing with the 
<br>
present need.
<br>
<p>However, the very act of trying to create a coercive collective 'volition' 
<br>
machine might cause the taxonimic fiction of humanity to choose to 
<br>
break into two groups (that would then evolve down entirely different 
<br>
paths):
<br>
<p>-   those willing to subject themselves to the coercive collective
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'volition' machine 
<br>
<p>-   and those that do not agree to subject themselves to the coercive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collective 'volition' machine 
<br>
<p>Why does this matter?  Because the output from a coercive collective 
<br>
'volition' machine will vary (even if it can actually do what is claimed for 
<br>
it in terms of objectively reading and extrapolating the collective 
<br>
'volition' of a certain group of humans) according to the specific sample 
<br>
of humanity that it extrapolates.
<br>
<p>And since the choice of which humans to extrapolate is entirely 
<br>
arbitrary (being idiosyncratically chosen by one person, ie. you) the 
<br>
output is entirely arbitrary too.
<br>
<p>Just to make it clear,  I personally don't want to be controlled by your 
<br>
coercive collective 'volition' machine.  If you insist on including all 
<br>
'humans' in the extrapolation and the regime of coercion then I hereby 
<br>
declare that (using your example of changing the use of words) I no 
<br>
longer wish to be identified as a 'human'.  I wish hereafter to be known 
<br>
as a 'person'.  :)
<br>
<p>I and any other 'people' I band together with, I'm sure, will be very 
<br>
happy to cooperate with you and your 'humans' on projects to prevent 
<br>
the world being turned into grey goo or any other such nasties, but any 
<br>
relations that I and other 'people' have with your 'humans' will be have 
<br>
to be based on negotiation and collaboration and not on coercion.  
<br>
Should you try to exercise coercion, I and the other 'people' will resist.
<br>
<p>Can you see what I'm getting at?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
