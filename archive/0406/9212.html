On Sun, 13 Jun 2004 &quot;Randall Randall&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:randall@randallsquared.com?Subject=Re:%20Sentience%20%20[Was%20%20FAI:%20Collective%20Volition]">randall@randallsquared.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The hallmark of a good hypothesis will be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it *is* testable. I don't have one, but I'm not willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to insist that it's logically impossible that one exist. 
</em><br>
<p>It’s logically impossible to test any consciousness theory. Let's say
<br>
you have a super sophisticated brain analyzing machine. One day you feel
<br>
sad and analyze your brain with the machine. You develop a reasonably
<br>
sounding theory to equate the state of the neurons in your head with
<br>
your subjective experience. How do you test your theory? Well, you try
<br>
it on me. You notice that the state of my neurons is similar (but not
<br>
identical) to yours when you felt sad, and from this you use your theory
<br>
to conclude that I am experiencing sadness just like you did. As proof
<br>
that your theory was successful you point to the fact that I have tears
<br>
in my eyes and made a noise with my mouth that sounded like &quot;I feel
<br>
sad&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think this would be good evidence that your theory is probably
<br>
correct, but a skeptic could correctly point out that the state of my
<br>
neurons were not identical to yours, only similar, we are after all
<br>
different people with different brains. The differences could be
<br>
crucial, you really felt sad but it's different with me, I get tear
<br>
production elevated and the nerves in my mouth stimulate my tongue to
<br>
make a noise like &quot; I feel sad&quot; but really I feel nothing. The only way
<br>
to know for sure what it's like to be me is to turn your brain into an
<br>
identical copy of mine, but then you wouldn't be you, you'd be me.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If I was convinced that was true I would have to become a creationist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'd have no alternative because I would have absolutely no way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; explain  how random mutation and natural selection produced at least one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; creature that had personality and consciousness, me.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea why that is your position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is this different from a statement that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;would have absolutely no way to explain how random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutation and natural selection produced at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creature that can metabolize alcohol&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>Because regardless of how important consciousness is to us evolution
<br>
doesn’t give a damn about it, all it’s interested in is behavior. The
<br>
ability to metabolize alcohol could change the probability of an animal
<br>
surviving by a huge amount, but if consciousness and behavior can be
<br>
segregated as you say then there is no way random mutation and natural
<br>
selection could ever have made us conscious, or rather made me
<br>
conscious, I’m not sure about you.
