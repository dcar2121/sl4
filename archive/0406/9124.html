<p>Bullshit.  I have been watching these exchanges for quite some time.  
<br>
Eliezer does devolve in his responses periodically.  Sometimes he does 
<br>
so to the point of being insulting and condescending when his points 
<br>
and arguments are not obviously superior at all.   It is not in the 
<br>
least &quot;amusing&quot; when it gets to such a level.  It is sickening and 
<br>
extremely disappointing.  As there are relatively few AGI folks around 
<br>
it is quite irksome that this level of bitchiness is present.   If FAI 
<br>
is going to succeed it will require many willing minds not all of whom 
<br>
are true-believers in the latest formulations from Eliezer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Do you think it can be saved by insults?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seed AI

</em><br>
<p>You mean the people who think like you and perhaps Eliezer?   Are you 
<br>
sure that those are the only &quot;really good people&quot;?   Is there some 
<br>
reason I need to point out how much of a jerk you are being when you 
<br>
make such a statement?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This takes time, but it's worth responding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they're more likely to be useful. Meanwhile, few of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people wanting answers on SL4 seem to have large pocketbooks waiting
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; but having the SIAI people spend a lot of time here isn't condusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to saving the world. Thus please forgive Eliezer, Tyler etc for not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answering every question.
</em><br>
<p>Not that it is any of your business but I have contributed sufficiently 
<br>
to argue for at least a year by the current arbitrary rules.   If you 
<br>
are going to dismiss the people who are interested and bright but who 
<br>
disagree just because they disagree then there is, of course, little 
<br>
point in bothering to post or to donate either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The SIAI is composed of sane people who understand risk management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sensible precautions have been taken as far as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore as I'm sure you can imagine considerable discussion goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on appart from the SL4 mailing list (which I hesitate to refer to as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the peanut gallery :) ).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So I guess you folks don't want any more peanuts.   Best of luck.  You 
<br>
are going to need it.
