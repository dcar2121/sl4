<p>&nbsp;I agree with your criticisms of these two positions, but I still have doubts.
<br>
You write as if the only differences between current humans and future versions
<br>
of those humans are due to knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp;But it's pretty clear to me that some differences are due to them not being
<br>
exactly the same people (i.e. identity changing over time), so that there are
<br>
real conflicts of interest between current and future instances of a given
<br>
person. The classic case studied by economists is savings rates. I wish that
<br>
the Peter McCluskey of 15 years ago had saved slightly more than he actually
<br>
did, but I can't identify any knowledge that I have today that ought to have
<br>
convinced him to do so.
<br>
&nbsp;It sounds like your optimization process would give more weight to the
<br>
interests of future humans than an unbiased observer would consider optimal.
<br>
This might be unimportant, but I see a small but nonzero risk that it could
<br>
do great harm to humans at one time to produce a smaller benefit to humans
<br>
further in the future.
<br>
&nbsp;It should in theory be possible to write into software an optimal balancing
<br>
of current and future interests that takes into account the improved
<br>
knowledge of future humans, but I don't think I could express the appropriate
<br>
goals clearly enough to write such software.
