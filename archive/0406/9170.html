<em>&gt; A week of calm flowing through me made me think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of 'Bayesian meditation workshops'.  I'm thinking
</em><br>

<p>I would like to see Mindball &lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.i-p.se/index.aspx?page=mindball">http://www.i-p.se/index.aspx?page=mindball</a>&gt;&gt; at the workshops too.
<br>
Video games are not my forte (I kicked my video game
<br>
habit at 12 to spend more time studying science.), but
<br>
it would be progress if we could use advancing biosensor technology to
<br>
change our attitudes and psychology to create and maintain more constructive relations.
<br>
(Maybe Mindball is not a solution, but I do like the fact that it is being researched.)
<br>
<p>'Mindball is an experience product, a game where two players control a ball with their brain waves. The player being most relaxed wins the game. The brain waves are detected by sensors attached to the headbands. The sensors (electrodes) are connected to a biosensor system. The biosensor system, registers the electrical activity in the brain \u2013 so called EGG. The brain waves increasing the chance to win Mindball are called Alpha- and Theta waves. '
