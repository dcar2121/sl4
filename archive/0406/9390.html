<em>&gt;&gt;That statement looks like a very good summary of your

<em>&gt; I have two basic objections here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Using objective reasoning to eliminate subjectivity commits the logical fallacy of begging the question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Subjectivity is important because it can never be fully removed from observations about reality.
</em><br>
Very good points. I agree after having read your explanations that my statement 
<br>
is a fallacy. Subjectivity is definitely important in so far as it allows us to 
<br>
collect data.
<br>
I do maintain my significantly weaker claim that one shouldn't assume that any 
<br>
subjective experience has absolute moral relevance without good reason. Good 
<br>
reason would for me be the ability to make better predictions about the future, 
<br>
be it regarding this experience or any other.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; If our model of the world does not explain, imply, or at least leave room for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; our subjective experience, then the model should be revised.  In short, any
</em><br>
<em> &gt; version of physics that does not explain that which is most obvious (e.g.,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; subjective experience) is obviously incomplete.
</em><br>
I completely agree. I am however still unconvinced that current physics doesn't 
<br>
explain and can't predict qualia.
<br>
<p>[from the following mail replying to the same post:]
<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Assuming that mary is a transhuman and therefore has
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; sufficient abilities to absorb all of current physics,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; including everything we know about light, and all
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; present knowledge about evolution of lifeforms in
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; general and humans in particular, and that she actually
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; does absorb all of this knowledge before she leaves the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; room, then no: she won't really learn anything new.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Are you stating that transhuman Mary, having absorbed all of this knowledge, 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;would experience a red quale before leaving the room?
</em><br>
<p>Well, if she has the ability for safe and complete self-modification, detailed 
<br>
scans of human brains, and an incentive to duplicate the subjective experience 
<br>
that humans have when they perceive light with a certain wavelength.
<br>
She wouldn't need scans of human brains if she herself was programmed to create 
<br>
color-qualia when evaluating visual input; she could get the same result by 
<br>
simulating the results of light with a certain wavelength hitting her optical 
<br>
receptors.
<br>
If mary didn't have color-qualia-programming (before or after self-modification) 
<br>
she wouldn't experience a 'redness' qualia even if she did perceive red light.
<br>
<p>A transhuman not capable of sufficient self-modification but 
<br>
color-qualia-programming may experience 'redness' when, and only when they 
<br>
actually perceive red light. However, if they can at least understand their own 
<br>
programming sufficiently well, they might be able predict the sensation without 
<br>
having perceived it in the past. In this case, I don't think that they actually 
<br>
gain any knowledge by perceiving the qualia.
