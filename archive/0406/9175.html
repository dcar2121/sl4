<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>SIAI needs to have simple and clear explanations of its ideas, especially
<br>
the key ideas such as FAI and CV.  These explanations are very important for
<br>
advocacy, as most potential contributors will not read the long and complex
<br>
details, but still want the &quot;super-brief-executive-summaries&quot;.  Easy
<br>
examples, use-cases, and scenarios and are good way to provide this.
<br>
Bearing that in mind, let me check my current understanding, and ask a
<br>
couple more questions.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This passage has cleared up some of my thinking on CV... I think.  Let me
<br>
run a scenario by you and see:
<br>
<p>The CV would be a *process* within FAI that could field specific questions,
<br>
like &quot;what would the top 3 friendliest decisions (z1, z2, z3) about question
<br>
y1 given (x1, x2, x3)&quot;.  Or perhaps: &quot;Decide on the question (disarm all
<br>
nuclear weapons?) giving measures: distance, muddle, spread and coherence&quot;
<br>
Is this the kind of process you envision CV to be?
<br>
<p>If CV is a 'what would humanity decide' process then, okay, if it works then
<br>
it could answer the above types of questions with appropriate measures.  My
<br>
question/answer would now be: Where would the original list of questions to
<br>
ask the CV come from?
<br>
<p>I am presuming the original questions will be formulated by the Friendly AI
<br>
programmers... right?  I imagine agenda-type questions first, then
<br>
decision-type question later?  For example:
<br>
<p>CV-Q1: &quot;What questions need asking?&quot;...
<br>
CV-Q2: &quot;What problems need solving?&quot;...
<br>
CV-Q24: &quot;What is the #1 problem?&quot;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[problems are formulated into questions]
<br>
CV-Q3093: &quot;Decide on the #1 question&quot;...
<br>
...
<br>
<p>Obviously this is clunky example, but is this the sort of thing you envision
<br>
FAI doing with CV?  If not, could you give us your guess at a 'bulleted'
<br>
sequence of events of how CV will be used?
<br>
