</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic *originally comes from*.
</em><br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And furthermore, changing environmental conditions make last week's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wise decisions&quot; less than wise.  Consider how things would change if we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found we were going to get smacked in a few years by a dinosaur killer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comet.
</em><br>
<p>What you've just decribed is a change in &quot;wisdom&quot; where I know how the 
<br>
change works, and how to describe the change to an FAI.  There's a desired 
<br>
set of outcomes, and changing facts, so the desired actions that lead to 
<br>
the desired outcomes change with the facts.  You've got the utility 
<br>
function over outcomes, and the conditional probabilities from actions to 
<br>
outcomes.  Change the conditional probabilities, and the preferences over 
<br>
actions change, even if the utility function stays constant.
<br>
<p>Remember that this is not about what we know right now, it is what we can 
<br>
tell an FAI to compute in a well-specified way.  Your example is an 
<br>
excellent demonstration of how what seems like inscrutably variable wisdom 
<br>
may change according to an easily defined dynamic.  I might not know the 
<br>
exact wisest action if we found we would be smacked in a few years by a 
<br>
dinosaur killer, but I know how to describe the decision update process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Also, where do I get the information?  Like, the judgment criterion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for &quot;wise decisions&quot; or &quot;good of humanity&quot;.  Please note that I mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that as a serious question, not a rhetorical one.  You're getting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information from somewhere, and it exists in your brain; there must be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a way for me to suck it out of your skull.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not when it isn't there.
</em><br>
<p>If the algorithm isn't there, or the map to an algorithm, then where is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, the question is poorly framed.  &quot;good of humanity&quot; for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.  What is the more important aspect of humanity?  Genes?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Memes?  Individuals built by genes who are running memes?  I have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking around the edges of these problems for close to two decades and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can assure you that I don't have *the* answer, or even *an* answer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that satisfies me.  (Right now, of course, they are all important.)
</em><br>
<p>I see no reason why I should care about genes or memes except insofar as 
<br>
they play a role in individuals built by genes who are running memes.  What 
<br>
exerts the largest causal influence is not necessarily relevant to deciding 
<br>
what is the *important* aspect of humanity; that is a moral decision.  I do 
<br>
not need to make that moral decision directly.  I do not even need to 
<br>
directly specify an algorithm for making moral decisions.  I do need to 
<br>
tell an FAI, in a well-specified way, where to look for an algorithm and 
<br>
how to extract it; and I am saying that the FAI should look inside humans. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much objection to this, for it seems that humans are foolish. 
<br>
Well, hence that whole &quot;knew more, thought faster etc.&quot; business.  Is there 
<br>
somewhere else I should look, or some other transformation I should specify?
