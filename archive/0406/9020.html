<br>
<p>I agree that one would expect that everyone on SL4 is either a
<br>
'whiz-kid' or, if older, an 'ex-whiz-kid'. In their own field of
<br>
expertise, of course, not necessarily in AI.
<br>
(You better get a move on Eli, being a 'whiz-kid' doesn't last) ;)
<br>
<p>But as an ex-whiz-kid myself, my reaction to Elizier is that he should
<br>
get out more.
<br>
<p>No matter how 'smart' you think you are, there is always someone
<br>
smarter. You just haven't met them yet.
<br>
<p>Are you sitting comfortably? Let me tell you a story:
<br>
<p>At one time I worked for a large multi-national and we developed
<br>
software which had to be rolled out around the world. We developed staff
<br>
training courses which usually ran for about 5 days. Foreign branches
<br>
required more detail because they had to customize the software by
<br>
programming in changes for their local laws.
<br>
<p>When my managers first came back from the Far East they were
<br>
shell-shocked. Especially Singapore and Japan. They reported that they
<br>
had never seen anything like the almost feral intelligence of the people
<br>
there. 5 day courses were completed in 1 to 2 days. They just sat like
<br>
sponges soaking up all the information. The programming done was to a
<br>
far higher standard than in the West. Being late on a project meant
<br>
'losing face' and they would live in the office rather than get behind
<br>
schedule. If a bug was found in something they coded, it was a matter of
<br>
'dishonor' and treated really seriously. Culture shock. They had a
<br>
completely different attitude to work and business. And, boy, were they
<br>
intelligent!
<br>
<p><p>The main point is that we in the West are now a small minority of the
<br>
world population. And us 'nice guys' on SL4 a microscopic proportion.
<br>
Our volition will disappear in the sum of the world volition. (Unless
<br>
you assume that all the disagreeing volitions are primitive and if
<br>
educated and advanced would agree with us !?).
<br>
<p>The Third World has a ferocious intelligence which is mostly intent on
<br>
killing their enemies before their enemies kill them. Individuals will
<br>
kill themselves if it kills more of their enemies in the process.
<br>
This militaristic, nationalistic outlook has often been the basis of
<br>
morality. Spartans, Kamikaze, suicide bombers, etc.
<br>
If a summation is taken of world volition, this will be very significant.
<br>
<p>BillK
