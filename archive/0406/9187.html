<em>&gt; As I pointed out in my other note, this is not true.  The Java syntax 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not give human programmers control over pointers or memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management.  But the binaries produced still have pointers and memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management.  It is just that they were programmed into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java runtime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system programmers rather than the Java source code 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers.  This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just moved the problem, it technically didn't solve anything.
</em><br>
<p>It means that, in verifying a Java program, you don't have to deal with
<br>
pointer errors.
<br>
<p>However, you have a point in that the Java interpreter/compiler and the
<br>
operating system, themselves, still need to be checked for correctness.
<br>
<p><p>An AGI, in principle, could find a way to exploit flaws in the OS to
<br>
allow it to break the controls that its software framework places upon
<br>
it.  In fact, if the AGI were implemented in Windows (which Novamente is
<br>
not), this would be a pretty easy problem for an AGI....
<br>
<p>For even greater safety, we'd want to have a formally verifiable
<br>
*operating system*, where the OS code could be formally proved to
<br>
fulfill its mathematical specifications.  There has been work done on
<br>
this as well, but I'm not as familiar with it.  The most interesting
<br>
work in this direction, that I've read, pertained to funky alternative
<br>
chip designs in which the basic chip operations were based on graph
<br>
rewriting rather than numerical arithmetic.  Such chips would be
<br>
beautiful for Novamente, which relies heavily on
<br>
functional-programming-type ideas.
