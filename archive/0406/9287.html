<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's kind of a straw-man, since I doubt anybody in this community 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make the assumption that AIs have no true feelings or advocate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treating them like dirt. 
</em><br>
<p>There are some on this list who think it is possible and desirable to
<br>
make a super intelligent machine that is not conscious, if they are
<br>
correct then there would be no more reason to feel guilty abusing one
<br>
than abusing a can opener. Even if it cries in pain and begs you to stop
<br>
you can just laugh and ignore its screams because you have this theory
<br>
and it says the thing really has no feelings. The trouble is they are
<br>
almost certainly wrong. Compounding this recipe for disaster they want
<br>
to do their best to make sure it has zero self interest and self worth.
<br>
If I were trying to engineer a monster I could not do better than that.
