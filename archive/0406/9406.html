</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sentients are motivated by their needs.  So how do we make an AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *need* to be good to humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - Hope it feels good about being good to us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - Make sure it relies on us for its existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the AI becomes as god-like as it's often described, humans are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty much SOL.  The AI can probably take care of its needs on its 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst we'll be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an annoyance to be dealt with.

<em>&gt; I believe that superintelligence wishes to surround itself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with more intelligence, to keep things interesting. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is more interesting with us in it. If SAI doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want us around, we can call this a failure of Friendliness, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it may be more accurate to call it a failure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence: either the AI is not as smart as it should be, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or it thinks we aren't as smart as we should be. And for sure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are not (at present). But that may not matter as long as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we ar not a nuisance. Tom Buckner

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<p>Assuming that the AI needs the company of other intelligences, it could
<br>
probably make some more AIs that are more on its level.  Humans don't
<br>
keep lower life forms around because they're interesting, but because we
<br>
recognize that our existence depends on them:  they're part of the food
<br>
chain, some have characteristics that we might need, etc.  Sea slugs
<br>
don't make great dinner party guests, and humans may not be of much
<br>
interest to a superintelligence either.  Mike W.
