<em>&gt; Instead (using the principal of no modification to sentients without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express permission) the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tell me &quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you had green hair, we've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done some calculations and if at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20% of the population had green hair then there would be a 15% reduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the general unhappiness quotient...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can I make this modification to you or would you like a deeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of the intents and consequences?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you weren't anorexic and put on a bit of
<br>
weight. Would you like me to make you into a normal person and then get you
<br>
a 4 season pizza?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you didn't blow yourself up anyway you are
<br>
not going to get 47 perpetual virgins after you die you know, can I
<br>
deactivate the explosive now?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you stopped believing in this jesus christ BS
<br>
and took some science classes, can I sign you up right now?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if your higher mental functions were inhibited
<br>
and you were transformed in a positive qualia pumping process. Just say the
<br>
word&quot;
<br>
<p>hmmm.........
