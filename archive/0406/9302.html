</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains?
</em><br>
<p>This question has been asked a couple of times, and I shall now give a 
<br>
strange answer:
<br>
<p>It doesn't matter.
<br>
<p>Which is to say, this is the point where the FAI theorist waves his hands 
<br>
dismissingly and says, &quot;Oh, well, that's a mere *practical* question, of no 
<br>
theoretical interest.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course I then take off my theorist hat, and feed the AI information that 
<br>
starts with games of billiards inputs, and then the AI will interrogate the 
<br>
programmers to improve its models of them in particular and thereby humans 
<br>
in general, and work its way up to an offline static copy of the Internet, 
<br>
and my guess is that when it grows up at least two direct nondestructive 
<br>
brainscans would be a good idea...
<br>
<p>But it doesn't matter.
<br>
<p>Once you define the thing-that-you-want-to-approximate - the collective 
<br>
volition - then you just point the RPOP at the invariant and say, &quot;Guess.&quot;
<br>
<p>Just that one word.  It doesn't really need to be any more complex than 
<br>
that, from a theoretical perspective.  You can calculate the expected 
<br>
information value and expected information cost, and thereby decide whether 
<br>
it's worthwhile to give everyone a 20-page form to fill out, or whether you 
<br>
knew enough to guess the collective volition of humankind just from 
<br>
watching downloaded anime.  But from an FAI theory standpoint, you just 
<br>
point the superintelligent Bayesian Thingy at something that's been defined 
<br>
down to a question of simple fact, and say, &quot;Guess.&quot;
<br>
<p>There's one interesting chicken-and-egg problem where the RPOP needs to 
<br>
know, right away, that it shouldn't destructively scan everyone just to 
<br>
find out what their volitions are.  (Oops!)  But that's a pretty 
<br>
straightforward problem theoretically - it was described in CFAI, in fact - 
<br>
and if the programmers remember to say, &quot;Oh, incidentally, there's a strong 
<br>
probability our collective volition isn't to kill people [to extract their 
<br>
volitions or otherwise]&quot;, that's enough to get the RPOP over the initial 
<br>
hump.  In fact, I should rather hope that long before hard takeoff the RPOP 
<br>
has sufficient knowledge of humans to guess in its own right that their 
<br>
collective volition views certain actions as important, meaning a stably 
<br>
confidently extrapolated collective volition is required to authorize them.
