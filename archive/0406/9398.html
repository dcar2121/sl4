<p>
(Taken from what I posted on wiki)
<br>
<p>I think Eli was right not to make individual volition
<br>
the whole basis of morality. I don't think morality is
<br>
solely based on what a person really wants. After all,
<br>
you could imagine a society of sadomasochists that
<br>
enjoy being raped and sodomized, but this doesn't
<br>
correspond to our intuitive conceptions of morality at
<br>
all. On the other hand morality should help people. So
<br>
morality has to be somehow related to human wants and
<br>
needs. It boils down to the age-old dilemma of
<br>
internal wants and needs versus external dictates and
<br>
constraints. 
<br>
<p>So where are these external factors to come from?
<br>
Eli's decided that they should come from 'the group'
<br>
(humanity) as a whole. But is humanity as a whole
<br>
really where Eli should be looking? I have my doubts.
<br>
There could very well be more to morality than this.
<br>
Simply trying to derive morality from 'the group' only
<br>
pushes the fundamental questions back to another
<br>
level, it doesn't really resolve them. What if the
<br>
'Collective Volition' (i.e. the morality derived from
<br>
the group as a whole) still runs totally contrary to
<br>
reasonable moral intuitions? Eli pulled a clever move
<br>
when he came up with 'extrapolated volition' - what
<br>
people would want if they thought longer, faster, knew
<br>
more , were more wise etc. This pragmatic operational
<br>
definition might well end up corresponding to
<br>
morality, but the trouble is that it's an answer
<br>
suspiously empty of content. Not wrong as far as it
<br>
goes maybe, but not necessarily very useful. My first
<br>
reaction upon seeing the CV 'answer' to the question
<br>
of morality was that it was rather like being given
<br>
the answer: 'Well it's a face' to the question: 'What
<br>
is Mona Lisa?' For instance I could define knowledge
<br>
as the converging probability resulting from factoring
<br>
successive pieces of information into Bayes Theorem,
<br>
but where does that get me? What is the solution to
<br>
the Riemann Hypothesis? Oh it's the result you would
<br>
get if people kept factoring in new pieces of maths
<br>
info into Bayes until there was a convergence
<br>
recognizable as the solution! Sure, but hardly a
<br>
satisfactory answer. Morality is defined as the end
<br>
result of a process, a process so enormously complex
<br>
it's quite likely to be practically impossible to
<br>
calculate. In that case CV might be correct as far it
<br>
goes, but just useless. 
<br>
<p>I wouldn't rule out the possibility of some sort of
<br>
objective morality yet. Sure, you need to look at
<br>
humans for 'calibration' of any reasonable morality
<br>
that would speak to the wants and needs of humans but
<br>
there doesn't mean that there is isn't some sort of
<br>
objective standard for determining the morality of
<br>
various human wants and needs. 
<br>
<p>What Eli seems to be worried about is the possibility
<br>
of A.I programmers 'taking over the world'. But does
<br>
the world really need anyone to 'run' it? Not
<br>
according to the anarcho-capitalists and various other
<br>
political systems that have been floated. Not that I'm
<br>
advocating anarchy, I'm just pointing out that the
<br>
whole idea of a singeton centralized agent might be
<br>
misguided. In any event the way the world seems to
<br>
work in the modern free market democracies is that
<br>
people are assigned status roughly acccording to their
<br>
talent and latent cognitive abilities. For instance
<br>
childen have fewer rights than adults, brilliant
<br>
adults who create good products end up with more
<br>
economic power etc. Since FAI would have cognitive
<br>
abilities far beyond an ordinary human, it's not clear
<br>
why it would be wrong for the FAI to be given the most
<br>
rights. 
<br>
<p>Collective Volition is unlikely to be the last word in
<br>
'Friendliness theory'. Not even close I suspect.
