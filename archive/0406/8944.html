<em>&gt; HYPOTHESIS: COMPUTATIONAL DEPTH OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (CDIS)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not possible to have a system that's capable of a high level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence and creativity, that is entirely predictable in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior
</em><br>
<p>Firstly, we're trying to predict what general class the behaviour will
<br>
stay within, not exactly what it will do. Secondly, you need to pin
<br>
these terms down if you want to use them in formal hypotheses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In computation-theory terms, this hypothesis claims that intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems are programs with a large &quot;computational depth&quot; (a notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduced by Charles Bennett), meaning that there is no way to simulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their results, given their descriptions, without using a large amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run-time (in the sense of a large number of computational steps).
</em><br>
<p>Again we're trying to predict what constraints there will be on the
<br>
output, not what the output will actually be. This is done via
<br>
propagation of constraints through intermediate functions and data
<br>
structures (standard formal methods stuff really). 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course, you are welcome to believe that the CDIS hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is false. It's just a hypothesis, I haven't proved it.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's valid with respect to a detailed prediction of
<br>
behaviour and false for a general one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A relatively &quot;safe&quot; self-modifying AGI design is one that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictable with a relatively high (but not absolute) degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of certainty.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately this is wrong. Self-improving intelligence is a
<br>
nonlinear process. You either constrain it within a desireable
<br>
space, or you don't. Attempting to estimate probabilities for
<br>
staying in desireable space by good luck and poorly understood
<br>
corrective mechanisms is an enterprise doomed to failure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect there is some kind of INTELLIGENCE INDETERMINACY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PRINCIPLE (IIP) of the rough form.
</em><br>
<p>This is a neat summary of the basic pathology behind the
<br>
probabilistic approach to goal system design and
<br>
self-modification. If this principle existed as stated, the
<br>
SIAI project would be in serious trouble. Fortunately
<br>
intelligence is the power to remove uncertainty, not increase
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [FAI] doesn't require that the self-modification of an AI system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be tractably deterministic... it merely requires that certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities about the future evolution of the system be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimable with a high degree of confidence... it argues for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shutting-down of some dead-end paths toward Friendly AI, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the path that seeks an AI whose overall behavior is in some sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictable.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand what you're saying here. Probabilities of the
<br>
system exhibiting given behaviour classes being estimable seems
<br>
like 'overall behaviour that is in some sense predictable' to me.
<br>
Without a resolution of that contradiction I can't dispose of the
<br>
rest of your argument. Clearly the self-modification has to be
<br>
tractable and deterministic for the AI to do it in the first place,
<br>
but we want to know what will happen without running a takeoff.
<br>
There is no way to do this probabilisticaly; fortunately it is
<br>
possible to design architectures and goal contents that will
<br>
provably stay in some useful area of utility-function-space.
