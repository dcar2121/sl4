<p><p>The hardware is generally immaterial next to the specifics of the AGI 
<br>
implementation.  It is one of the reasons one is not likely to 
<br>
accidentally implement an AI of any type, even if one tries really 
<br>
hard.
<br>
<p>10^12 iops may be enough for Human Equivalent Intelligence (HEI) on a 
<br>
nearly ideal implementation -- it is hard to say without doing it 
<br>
first.  The problem is that a slightly less than ideal implementation 
<br>
may require 10^18 iops to be HEI.  And there is a huge range of viable 
<br>
designs that may require 10^40 iops or more to be HEI.  It is an 
<br>
unforgiving space and a lot of people are working on designs that fall 
<br>
in these latter cases.  They may theoretically be genuine functional 
<br>
AGI designs, but not in practice.
<br>
<p>Flogging a pony that is pining for the fjords:  Memory latency is the 
<br>
limitation of modern hardware, not teraflops.  In fact, there is no 
<br>
great necessity for floating point at all; that is primarily of use to 
<br>
the people doing &quot;biologically inspired&quot; AI research.  There is very 
<br>
little &quot;computation&quot; in intelligence when you get right down to it.  
<br>
And nothing about this algorithm space at large suggests that it is 
<br>
well-suited for cluster computing.  Clusters have very limited 
<br>
application to AGI, as AGI looks a lot more like a genuine 
<br>
supercomputing application (there is a reason there is still a strong 
<br>
market for genuine supercomputers rather than just doing everything 
<br>
with clusters).
<br>
<p><p>So don't dwell on how big or fast hardware is becoming, as it doesn't 
<br>
really matter in the big picture.  Excellent design trumps good design 
<br>
and gobs of hardware in this particular case.
