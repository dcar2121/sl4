<p>This is not required.  Being able to shut down the optimization if it 
<br>
gets wildly out of hand is required.   If this can't be done why on 
<br>
earth would anyone trust you or a hundred persons equally bright and 
<br>
with excellent intentions to not fuck it up drastically?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Change the environment, alter the systems, create the transcendent

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for those who wish to remain unmodified) without the express consent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the sentient to be modified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you please elaborate further on all the independent details you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to code into eternal, unalterable invariants?  If you add 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough of them we can drive the probability of them all working as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected down to effectively zero.  Three should be sufficient, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundancy is always a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  Make sure everyone is backed up at all times and give them 
<br>
free choice but with nudges/reminders/more grown-up advise at whatever 
<br>
level each one is willing/desirious of taking.  Set things up so they 
<br>
can't do themselves in ultimately (although it make look like they can 
<br>
to them).   Keep it going long enough for each to grow up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do this and I think the vision of the coming singularity will be more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; palatable for all humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not about public relations, it's about living with the actual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result for the next ten billion years if that wonderful PR invariant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns out to be a bad idea.
</em><br>
<p>Instead we live with an original implementation of EV extraction and 
<br>
decision making for the next 10 billion years without any possibility 
<br>
of a reset or out?  Hmm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (and besides I can't really object about modifications if I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consulted now can I?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not under your system, no.  I would like to allow your grownup self 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or your volition to object effectively.
</em><br>
<p>But that being exists only within the extrapolation which may in fact 
<br>
be erroneously formulated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do not tell me that 'oops we got it wrong...' as indicated here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason may be, &quot;That idiot Eliezer screwed up the extrapolation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  dynamic.&quot;  If so, you got me, there's no defense against that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll try not to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Instead (using the principal of no modification to sentients without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; express permission) the system can tell me &quot;Hey, you'd be much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if you had green hair, we've done some calculations and if at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 20%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the population had green hair then there would be a 15% reduction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the general unhappiness quotient... Can I make this modification to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or would you like a deeper explanation of the intents and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consequences?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose that if that is the sort of solution you would come up with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after thinking about it for a few years, it might be the secondary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic.  For myself I would argue against that, because it sounds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like individuals have been handed genie bottles with warning labels, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I don't think that's a good thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Genie bottle with warning labels AND the ability to recover from errors 
<br>
wouldn't be so bad.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The title of this subject line is &quot;fundamentals&quot;.  There is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental tradeoff that works like this:  The more *assured* are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such details of the outcome, even in the face of our later 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconsideration, the more control is irrevocably exerted over the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of the outcome by a human-level intelligence.  This holds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially true of the things that we are most nervous about.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more control you take away from smarter minds, for the sake of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own nervousness, the more you risk damning yourself.  What if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right of Withdrawal that you code (irrevocably and forever, or else 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why bother) is the wrong Right, weaker and less effective than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right of Withdrawal the initial dynamic would have set in place if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hadn't meddled?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not unless you design the system so that eternal damnation is possible! 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the ability to opt-out or try something different or recover 
<br>
from any and all errors eternal damnation will always be possible.
