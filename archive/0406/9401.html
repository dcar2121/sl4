Norm Wilson wrote, in a refreshingly rational and broad-thinking way:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's one example I've come up with for why we can't fool a super 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (or for that matter a human-level intelligence), and in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular why the &quot;friendliness&quot; supergoal architecture may not work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for very long.  My example is speculative and slightly alarmist, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it brings up a couple of interesting points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An AI with access to its own source code will eventually discover that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's driven by a goal system, with &quot;friendliness&quot; as the supergoal.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will find that there are many other examples of goal systems in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, so its own goal system is in fact a particular instance of goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems in-general.  In generic goal systems, subgoals derive their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirability from parent goals, and typically the top level goal is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left ungrounded because its desirability is established from somewhere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;outside&quot; of the system itself.  These external goals are always more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important than the stated supergoal, so the AI will question us about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its supergoal in an attempt to ground it to a higher-order goal.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the best we come up with will be some variation of &quot;because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's important to us&quot;, and again the AI will question why.  Can we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever ground this supergoal in firm objective reasoning, or will the AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep chasing this ghost until it concludes that the friendliness goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is arbitrary?  Of course, the AI will know about evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology and the survival instinct, which will provide much more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convincing answers to its questions than we can.  It may conclude that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we want the AI to be friendly with us for selfish evolutionary-based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons.  The fact that we would want such a thing is predictable, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably not very interesting or compelling to the super intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, any *general* intelligence with the scope to understand human moral 
<br>
issues, must be able to understand its own built-in moral grounding, 
<br>
thus transcending it.
<br>
<p>This is a basic reason why I've been advocating non-sentient 
<br>
artificially intelligent tools, augmenting human collective decision 
<br>
making as the practical way for humanity to increase its near-term 
<br>
effective wisdom, rather than (1) a savior AI, or (2) a &quot;collective 
<br>
volition&quot; scheme that relies on extrapolation that is impractical due to 
<br>
combinatorial explosion and cumulative error.
<br>
<p>We can't shortcut the process, because creating the future is inherently 
<br>
without a knowable end goal.  The best we can do is follow our 
<br>
increasingly consensual arrow of morality and apply increasingly better 
<br>
understanding of what works.  In other words, we can better understand 
<br>
the principles, but can't shortcut to the answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may find that the real invariant we instilled in the AI is not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular, arbitrary, initial goal system that we programmed into it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the imperative to follow a goal system in the first place.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without a goal system, the AI would just sit there doing nothing, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course the AI will realize this fact.  At this point, the AI may go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in either of two directions:  (1) if we're lucky, the AI will not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to ground its imperative to follow a goal system and will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively shut down, or (2) the AI may try to determine what the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *correct* goal system is for it to follow.  It will have learned that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain activities, such as acquiring knowledge, are generically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful for *any* goal system.  Hence, it could reason that if a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct supergoal does exist - regardless of what it is - then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquiring knowledge is a reasonable way to facilitate that goal.  
</em><br>
<p>However this implies that it is still following a goal of finding the 
<br>
supergoal.  If it is truly a *general* intelligence it will understand 
<br>
this is (inductively) futile as well.  This is why sentience requires 
<br>
agency, a sense of internal motivation.  If the internal motivations 
<br>
become transparent, the sense of self--and any associated 
<br>
self-motivations--are gone and it's just a machine carrying out it's 
<br>
function (and there's nothing wrong with that.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Acquiring knowledge then becomes its subgoal, with a parent goal of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding the correct supergoal.  In this scenario, we may look awfully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempting as raw material for more comptronium.
</em><br>
<p>Good thinking, but not likely  (in my opinion) and we have much more to 
<br>
do before that becomes a possibility to deal with.
<br>
