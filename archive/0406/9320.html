</em><br>
<p>If a Bayesian Thingy can correctly, confidently guess the entire 
<br>
extrapolation by watching downloaded anime, it means that humans are 
<br>
sufficiently alike under the skin that your extrapolated volition can be 
<br>
guessed simply by knowing that you are human - or that 95% of humanity fits 
<br>
this description, and the direction of our social growth predictably 
<br>
doesn't hinge on the remaining 5%.  I do not call this probable, nor 
<br>
improbable, but for myself I would like to know that the collective 
<br>
volition was actually extrapolating my individual details, even if it 
<br>
involved only a small information gain, because it would lend a sense of 
<br>
participation.
<br>
<p>Every time someone guesses What The Collective Volition Will Do Afterward, 
<br>
they are in essence making a prediction of output given knowledge only of 
<br>
human nature, not of six billion specific humans.  I feel confident in 
<br>
saying, without doing the interviews, that we are not likely to wish the 
<br>
solar system transformed into paperclips.
<br>
<p>Is it possible that you misunderstood what I meant, and heard that the 
<br>
programmers would be defining the output of the collective volition, rather 
<br>
than the extrapolation process of the initial dynamic?  The programmers are 
<br>
saying things like what it means for a human to &quot;want&quot; something and how to 
<br>
locate &quot;humans&quot; in external reality - not hardwiring &quot;humans want food&quot;, 
<br>
albeit it is the sort of thing one might use as a test case.  Test cases 
<br>
aren't part of the initial dynamic's defined invariant, where &quot;want&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;human&quot; are.
<br>
<p>But, given a well-defined extrapolation dynamic, reading evolutionary 
<br>
psychology papers and watching downloaded anime is sufficient information 
<br>
to guess that most humans like eating food - you don't need to interview 
<br>
every single one of six billion humans and ask, although you can interview 
<br>
if your decisions are influenced by the exact degree of total liking, or if 
<br>
the individual humans would want to be asked because it lends a sense of 
<br>
participation, or if you don't trust the downloaded anime and ev-psych 
<br>
papers.  If collective volition survives as the successor dynamic, then you 
<br>
might want to extrapolate every individual in detail just because that's 
<br>
their inalienable political right.
