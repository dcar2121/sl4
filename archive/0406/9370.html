Accepting pain, as simply as you put it, would indicate a dysfunctional 
<br>
state.  But there is also the stoic virtue of accepting pain as part of 
<br>
the current human condition and working through it to achieve greater 
<br>
goals.  This is the strength normally referred to.  Please let's not 
<br>
over-simplify here.
<br>
<p>Accepting that pain is part of the current human condition and is useful 
<br>
as an indicator of something needing correction, is wise.  However, pain 
<br>
is not the ideal indicating system.  It can be misconstrued, it can be 
<br>
distracting or disabling, it can be chronic, and it can become 
<br>
demotivating.  Overall, it is part of an evolved system that has worked, 
<br>
but it could certainly be redesigned to work better for our human 
<br>
purposes.  We don't need pain, but I do think we want to keep a gradient 
<br>
of feedback relative to internal goals.  At least as long as we choose 
<br>
to remain sentient.
<br>
<p>Reducing pain is good, (moral value judgment there), because the process 
<br>
of reducing pain drives growth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By Justifying and Rationalizing pain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we manage to reduce the amount of pain we experience by a tiny speck. But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we do have a serious chance of dealing with the existence of Evil squarely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I'm not sure we're going to be able to carry on this discussion if we're 
<br>
back to introducing &quot;the existence of Evil&quot;, but I observe that your 
<br>
statement does fit rather naturally with viewing things in terms of qualia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and with nanotech and AI we do, then it is an act of moral cowardice to pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out on the opportunity. Screw present pain. Yeah, let's face it; shit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happens and there isn't even a reason why! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Can we agree that shit happens and we just don't always *know*  or 
<br>
*understand* a reason why?  Or could your statement be highlighting a 
<br>
belief that there isn't much that can be done to understand and improve 
<br>
the world we live in, therefore why not just go straight to the end 
<br>
result and work on feeling good regardless of external conditions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have a friend who is always happy. Everyone wants him around because he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just fun to be with. He jokes, honestly appreciates people, is empathic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;euphoric. Shit happens to him. He gets well real soon. His basal dopamine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level is very high; he's as happy as supermario in the bonus level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It's significant that his well-being does vary, but &quot;he gets well real 
<br>
soon.&quot;  Sounds healthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sometimes being too euphoric creates problems for him. For example he can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stand still and turns off some more serious people at work. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This may be an indicator of a dysfunction.  You may also learn that 
<br>
you're only exposed to a part of what he's actually feeling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundreds of friends. He is the living proof that we can be happier and enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it, and the lack of great suffering and depression does not diminish the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value of life at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
All of us believe we can be happier and enjoy it.  You certainly won't 
<br>
find anyone on a transhuman list objecting to that.
<br>
<p>Depression is a dysfunctional and dangerous state and I don't think 
<br>
you'll find anyone advocating it other than poets yearning to experience 
<br>
it all.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Great suffering can be associated with great and worthy endeavors, so I 
<br>
would not issue such a blanket statement as you did but certainly very 
<br>
few people would say they are in favor of suffering for it's own sake.  
<br>
There is also a case for &quot;character-building&quot; but let's not diverge 
<br>
further from the central point.
<br>
<p>To me, the central point of this discussion is this: 
<br>
<p>We all wish to improve the quality of our life experience.  [This is not 
<br>
a precise or complete statement, but I think it encompasses more of the 
<br>
issue than &quot;maximize positive qualia&quot;.] Therefore, do we best approach 
<br>
this by (1) directly improving the subjective experience, or (2) working 
<br>
to improve the processes that  leads to the desired experience.
<br>
