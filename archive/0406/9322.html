<em>&gt; If objective morality did not enhance survival (and by corollary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness since organisms want to survive) then it is consistent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I said before and is of no interest to me; if it did enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival then after 3 billion years of evolutionary pressure it is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to understand why immorality still exists at all.
</em><br>
<p>Your point seems to be the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;Since whatever we mean by objective morality is a (by)product of evolution,
<br>
and evolution only cares about survival, then human objective morality is
<br>
all a bunch of crap and we should stop talking about it as if it really
<br>
mattered or as if there was something really moral about it&quot;.
<br>
<p>But consider. The human mind can formulate thoughts and create patterns
<br>
that, although running on evolved wetware, go beyond the original purpose of
<br>
the neural circuitry that supports them. Take condoms for example. Nature
<br>
didn't foresee that long term planning would let us hijack reproductive
<br>
situations and use them for pleasure. We use what we've been given, and go
<br>
beyond.
<br>
<p>In the same way, yes the ability for moral reasoning evolved because we
<br>
needed to correctly simulate other agents' behaviors, figure out whether our
<br>
actions will piss them off, will make them our friend, and so forth. Nothing
<br>
really moral in the mechanism that created the ability to put oneself in
<br>
someone else's shoes. But with this ability _and_ a mind capable of abstract
<br>
thought _and_ enough self reflection to _really_ put ourselves in
<br>
_everyone's_ shoes, here you have humans trying to find a win-win solution
<br>
for every sentient in the universe. I am not saying they will succeed; just
<br>
you can't dismiss the effort as useless.
<br>
<p>Now what the other poster said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if morality is objective it is in some sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fundamental property written into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure ofthe universe.  So it was present
</em><br>
<p>The only way in which I see morality having any connection at all with
<br>
physical law is through negative and positive qualia. That is why I am such
<br>
a qualia freak; they reconnect good and evil to a physical phenomenon which
<br>
although not yet understood is as real as real can get.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A subjective morality says the ultimate end point to a long chain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; questions is &quot;because it will make me and others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy and it's self evident why you don't need to ask more&quot;. Objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality says the ultimate end point is either &quot;because it's just good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and don't dare ask any more&quot; or &quot;because God wants it that way and I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill you if you ask any more&quot;. Very medieval, as I said before.
</em><br>
<p>Everyone on this list has a different objective morality. The one I propose
<br>
does not get to God or to matter-of-fact statements. The ultimate point to a
<br>
long chain of whys is not a sentence in the english language.
<br>
<p>Imagine people discussing inside a closed dark room, they are arguing about
<br>
whether outside it's daytime or nighttime. Every one has a hypothesis but
<br>
nobody can agree so they argue and argue, until someone decides to open the
<br>
door. At that time, the bright sun shines inside the room, and nobody has
<br>
any more doubts. Evidence terminates discussions.
<br>
<p>In the same way we are now discussing the arrow of morality, should freedom
<br>
be the most important thing or should we extrapolate volitions etc. etc.
<br>
My particular theory ends with opening the door. The ultimate point to a
<br>
long chain of whys is OUCH and Aahhhhhhhhhh. You feel it?
