Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Similarly, I think, a FAI should weight &quot;free choice of sentient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings&quot; pretty high among the values it tries to optimize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you'll pick the weighting yourself?  
</em><br>
<p>The weighting should be chosen according to the Golden Section ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And it'll last for the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion years?  
</em><br>
<p>In my view, our engineering plans are only useful for guiding the launch
<br>
from the current realm to the next realm.
<br>
<p>I don't think that specific weighting parameters chosen by us, at the
<br>
launch of the Singularity, are going to persist unto eternity. 
<br>
<p>A lot of stuff that we can't now forecast is going to happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben, I don't think I've ever seen you try to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single thing that could go wrong with *your own* solutions, whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism you apply to mine.
</em><br>
<p>Of course a lot of things could go wrong with a Novamente-based AGI.
<br>
I'm basically deferring the careful analysis of what these are until
<br>
after we have an infrahuman Novamente AGI to play with.  Because I think
<br>
this analysis will be conductable in a much more intelligent and useful
<br>
way at that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll make it a challenge:  Can you show me a single bit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-criticism, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a single extrapolation of error or catastrophe in your own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plans, in any of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your online pages?  (No sudden updates, that's cheating.)
</em><br>
<p>There is plenty of self-criticism in my online writings, for instance
<br>
search
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/WakingUpFromTheEconomyOfDreams.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/WakingUpFromTheEconomyOfDreams.htm</a>
<br>
<p>for the section beginning with
<br>
<p>&quot;So what did we do wrong?  Frankly, all kinds of things.  So many
<br>
things.  It's basically impossible to do anything interesting without
<br>
making a lot of mistakes. ...&quot;
<br>
<p>You're not going to find many extrapolations of AI catastrophe in my
<br>
writings, because as I keep saying, I think it's too early in the
<br>
development of AGI for us to be able to make decent predictions of what
<br>
will or won't lead to a catastrophe. 
<br>
