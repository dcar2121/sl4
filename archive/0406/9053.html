Marc,
<br>
<p>Since you used the gravity example, I'll use a similar example.  I think
<br>
that saying there must be an objective morality is like saying there
<br>
must be an objective time system.  But in the end it's all relative to
<br>
the observer, isn't it?  
<br>
<p>Remove humans from the universe and where is morality?  You can't say
<br>
the same thing about gravity.  Seems to me the concept of morality is a
<br>
human invention.  What morality is there in galaxies colliding, animals
<br>
in the food chain eating each other, etc?
<br>
<p>If you were the last human alive, and the race would die out after you
<br>
were gone, is there anything you could do to be immoral?  
<br>
<p>To answer one of your questions, I think that there is no objective
<br>
standard by which you can say that Ghandi is better than Hitler.  It's
<br>
only your rules of morality that tell you that Hitler is bad (and I
<br>
would personally agree).  But in some societies, the most vicious
<br>
warrior gets the most honor and privilege.  By his society, he's a hero.
<br>
By their morality, he's doing everything right.  And if you ask their
<br>
opinion, they would tell you Ghandi is weak, a coward, and not someone
<br>
to emulate.  One obvious example of this is the Samurai in Japan a few
<br>
hundred years ago.  If they had to guess at the nature of the &quot;objective
<br>
morality&quot;, their guess would look nothing like mine.  How can our
<br>
moralities come from the same source and be so different?  The answer
<br>
comes when I answer your other questions:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by what standard would they define 'best'? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would it be good if people thought 'longer or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster'?  What is 'wisdom'?  It would seem that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective morality is still implied.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't &quot;best&quot; just end up being, in the long run, whatever maximizes
<br>
your potential to survive and reproduce?  The Samurai think best is
<br>
being better with the sword.  We think best is thinking faster.  It all
<br>
depends on where you live.

<em>&gt; 'Debunking Hippy-Dippy moral philosophy'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marc Geddes, 2nd June, 2004
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's fashionable in this post-modern age to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality is just a matter of opinion, just something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'made up'.  People just don't think that morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something with objective answers.  A lot of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably dates back to the philosopher David Hume, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly radical skeptic who seriously questioned the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power of reason.  It was Hume who famously said:  'You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't derive an ought from an is'.  And of course all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the modern pop-philosophers and moral relativists will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trot out Hume's tired old dogma to bolster their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (opinion!) that morality is all just a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But have the moral subjectivists seriously stopped to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider what their philosophy actually implies? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider this question:  Whose morality was better: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mahatma Gandhi's or Adolph Hitler's?   If you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that morality is just personal opinion what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying is that they are objectively both equivalent. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's just a matter of opinion and there is actually no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real objective moral difference between them.  Hitler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no better or worse than Gandhi.  You may object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is a ridiculous caricature.  No it isn't. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is exactly what is implied by the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality is just something made up.  If you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that morality is just something made up, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that there is no objective sense in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hitler was worse than Gandhi.  But who in their right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind seriously believes this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Humean claim that 'You can't derive an ought from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an is', and therefore you can't reason to objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers about morality is a piece of pop-philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has obtained the status of a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superstition.  Hume's claim has about as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credibility as the idea that the Earth is flat.  Hume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had an extremely limited conception of reason.  His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception was strictly axiomatic:  he thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning consisted of deriving conclusions from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms.  Of course modern methods of reasoning (like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Popperian epistemology or Bayesian reasoning) are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confined to axiomatic methods at all.  Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding reasoning as a hierarchy, reasoning can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered to be a network, with competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilistic conjectures which draw on support from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other.  These powerful modern reasoning methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not subject to Hume's critiques of reason, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore his claim: 'You can't derive ought from is'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a non sequitur.  Of course using axiomatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning you can't derive ought from is, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-axiomatic methods of reasoning don't need to rely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on deriving moral ought's from is's.   You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulate conjectures about morality, and then weigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up competing explanations to see which conjectures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best fit with other knowledge about world.  Objective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions can be drawn.  So the Humean pop-philosophers are wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another major objection to the idea that morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be objective is the fact that human morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; varies greatly from culture to culture.  If human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality could be so varied, argue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pop-philosophers, how could it possibly be objective? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mistake here is elementary.  If morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective, then morality and knowledge about morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are two different things.  There is the objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referent 'morality' and then there are the subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human 'theories about morality'.  Take gravity as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy.  Gravity is something which objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists.  Prior to understanding gravity, there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many different competing ideas about it.  Even after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isaac Newton understood it, scientists continued to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refine the theory and argue about different competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas.  Eventually Einstein's General Relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superceded Newton, and to this day competing theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of gravity continue to be formulated and improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon.  Our knowledge of gravity is what is changing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravity itself does not.  And so it can be with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.  There might be wide variation in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions about morality, but the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective referent 'morality' is independent of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our opinions about it may be.  Thus there is no basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the claim that the variation in human morals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproves objective morality.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modern subjectivists have another scheme:  they might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concede that morality is not just a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual opinion, but then they'll say it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Social Construct'.  They rightly repudiate moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativism, but then they try to define the referent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'morality' as a sort of aggregate feature emerging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from all the sentient minds on the planet.  No longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is morality just a matter of personal opinion.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme superficially looks like it gives some measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of objectivity to the 'morality' concept.  They can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now talk about a 'Universal Morality' (the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct of humanity), a referent external to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual minds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it's pseudo-objectivity.  It's the hippy-dippy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake writ large.  If we try to take the opinions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity as a whole as making up some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Universal Morality', morality is still just a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of opinion, only now it's the aggregate or summation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of individual opinions.  If the Nazis had won World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War II and say 80% of the world's population was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually indoctrinated into believing Nazi dogma,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would it be reasonable to regard Nazism as moral? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely not.  It's moral philosophy by opinion poll. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps subjectivists might counter that by morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they mean the best in people, or what people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe if they thought longer or faster, were wiser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  But by what standard would they define 'best'? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would it be good if people thought 'longer or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster'?  What is 'wisdom'?  It would seem that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective morality is still implied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have seen that the hippy-dippy ideas that morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just a matter of opinion or perhaps some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'social construct' are incoherent.  Reasonable people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must conclude that morality is something objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real, something that we can use reason to discover. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first thing we should objectively declare is:  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more hippy-dippy moral philosophy please!
