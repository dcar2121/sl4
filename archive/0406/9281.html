<p><em>&gt;I and any other 'people' I band together with, I'm sure, will be very

happy to cooperate with you and your 'humans' on projects to prevent

the world being turned into grey goo or any other such nasties, but any 
<br>
relations that I and other 'people' have with your 'humans' will be have 
<br>
to be based on negotiation and collaboration and not on coercion. 
<br>
Should you try to exercise coercion, I and the other 'people' will resist.

<p><p>To be fair to Eliezer:
<br>
<p>Most of the world's population is currently being 'coerced' in one way
<br>
or another by war-lords, dictators, big government etc.  You are being
<br>
'coerced' right now by your own government.  I think Eliezer's point
<br>
was that he thinks his system would result in a far higher degree of
<br>
self-determination than currently exists in the world.  But it is of
<br>
course unavoidable that any system involving group decisions has to
<br>
have some degree of coercion.
<br>
<p>You are of course quite right that the moment success for Sing Inst's
<br>
project ever looks even remotely likely the U.S government will come
<br>
down on Sing Inst like a ton of bricks.  To think other wise is to
<br>
display extreme naivety.  Sooner or later the team will either have to
<br>
win over the support of the government or move to a more Libertarian
<br>
environment if they are to have any hope of completing the project
<br>
(New Hampshire?  Outer Mongolia?)
<br>
<p>If you have a look at the web-site of my own A.I Project you'll see I
<br>
don't mention anything about a 'Singularity'.  What I'm claiming I'm
<br>
doing is developing software capable of mathematical reasoning ;)
