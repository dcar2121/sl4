<p><p>O.K, but I should point out here:  To say that 'it's

<p>You may as well have said that 'it's all physics'.

<p><p><p><em>&gt;

<p>Sure, 'it's all evolution', why not just say 'it's all
<br>
physics'.  The point is that we need different levels
<br>
of description for different purposes.  For instance
<br>
The laws of physics won't tell us much about human
<br>
psychology even though in principle human psychology
<br>
could be entirely described in physics terms. 
<br>
Different modes of description are needed at different
<br>
levels.  
<br>
<p>Here's an extract from my favourite book ever - 'The
<br>
Fabric of Reality':
<br>
<p>'There is, for example, evolutionary morality, which
<br>
notes that many forms of behaviour which we  explain
<br>
in moral terms, such as not committing murder, or not
<br>
cheating when we cooperate with other people, have
<br>
analogues in the behaviour of animals.  And there is a
<br>
branch of evolutionary theory, sociology, that has had
<br>
some success in explaining animal behaviour.  Many
<br>
people have been tempted to conclude that moral
<br>
explanations for human choices are just
<br>
window-dressing; that morality has no objective basis
<br>
at all, and that 'right' and 'wrong' are simply tags
<br>
we apply to our inborn urges to behave in one way
<br>
rather than another.  Another version of the same
<br>
explanation replaces genes by memes, and claims that
<br>
moral terminology is just window-dressing for social
<br>
conditioning.  However, none of these explanations
<br>
fits the facts.  On the one hand, we do NOT tend to
<br>
explain inborn behaviour - say, epileptic fits - in
<br>
terms of moral choices; we have a notion of voluntary
<br>
and involuntary actions, and only the voluntary ones
<br>
have moral explanations.  On the other hand, it is
<br>
hard to think of a single inborn behaviour - avoiding
<br>
pain, engaging in sex, eating or whatever - that human
<br>
beings have not under various circumstances chosen to
<br>
override for moral reasons.  The same is true, even
<br>
more commonly, of socially conditioned behaviour. 
<br>
Indeed, overriding both inborn and socially
<br>
conditioned behaviours is itself a characteristic
<br>
human behaviour.  So is explaining such rebellions in
<br>
moral terms.  None of these behaviours has any
<br>
analogue among animals; in none of these cases can
<br>
moral explanations be reinterpreted in genetic or
<br>
memetic terms.  This is a fatal flaw of this entire
<br>
class of theories.  Could there be a gene for
<br>
overriding genes when one feels like it?  Social
<br>
conditioning that promotes rebellion?  Perhaps, but
<br>
that still leaves the problem of HOW WE CHOOSE WHAT TO
<br>
DO INSTEAD, and of what we mean when we explain our
<br>
rebellion by claiming that we were simply right, and
<br>
that the behaviour prescribed by our genes or by our
<br>
society in this situation was simply evil.'
