<em>&gt;Keith,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even those who are most familiar with evolutionary psychology seem reluctant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(perhaps for the reasons you suggest) to apply this form of analysis to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Last year I posted a request to Ian Pitchford's evolutionary-psychology list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at yahoo groups for any information about books or papers containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ev-psych autobiography. No response. (BTW, do you know of any?)
</em><br>
<p>No.  About the closest thing I can think of is the evolutionary psychology 
<br>
based discussion of how Darwin went about raising his social status (with 
<br>
the help of a few friends) in Moral Animal.  (I should post examples.)
<br>
<p>I think everyone realizes that raising your social status is a *good thing* 
<br>
because most of the time it requires dedication, work, and cooperation with 
<br>
others.  If you are doing something that is valuable to the community, you 
<br>
usually get recognition, ranging right up to the Nobel prize.
<br>
<p>Where people get uncomfortable is when you recognize that your deep motives 
<br>
are not pure and nebulous, but based right out of tribal days when bringing 
<br>
back meat got you more nookie.  :-)
<br>
<p>Although I have taken heat for being up front about where I think my 
<br>
motives come from, most of the people I know think it is a useful 
<br>
insight.  We (speaking specifically about transhumanists) might all be 
<br>
better off being aware of the source of our motives and even up front about 
<br>
them.  Perhaps even to the point of meta comments on particular threads.
<br>
<p>It isn't easy, but the rational mind level can learn to be aware of why you 
<br>
are doing things.  And even if you have damn little control over what you 
<br>
do, being aware of the deep levels might help you be more effective at 
<br>
valued accomplishments that raise your status.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would be interested to hear what else you have to say about your first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point above.
</em><br>
<p>Status seeking directly relates to mailing list problems.  Status seeking 
<br>
can be played zero sum or non-zero sum.  Since we are equipped for both, it 
<br>
is likely that both were useful in our tribal past.  Zero sum, where you 
<br>
are trying to tear down a rival in order to raise your relative status 
<br>
might have been fairly effective in a small tribe, but it just isn't a very 
<br>
effective way to make the kind of progress that transhumanists value.
<br>
<p>Non-zero sum cooperation might not get you &quot;three wife&quot; (chief) status but 
<br>
your team is more likely to come out on top.  (On the other hand, there may 
<br>
be a need at times for seriously zero sum or even negative sum activity.)
<br>
<p>Mailing lists are social groups but they lack emotional social feedback of 
<br>
the face to face kind.  It might be essential for people to be aware of 
<br>
status seeking motives and zero/non-zero distinctions if lists are to serve 
<br>
a useful purpose.  I have some other thoughts on ways to make list 
<br>
communication more useful.  One of them is to put a small degree of humor 
<br>
and/or self depreciation into postings.  Emoticons, as long as they not 
<br>
over used, serve a real purpose.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, drive for status might have been more selected in males just 
<br>
as other traits were mostly selected in females.  But the drive is 
<br>
certainly expressed in both sexes.
<br>
<p>I appreciate your comments and questions.  The sl4 list is one of the 
<br>
better ones for reasonable behavior and interesting topics.  Perhaps with 
<br>
this bit of insight and that others can contribute, it could be even more 
<br>
effective at defining upcoming problems and how to avoid them.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
