<p>I agree that your arrogance is not harmful right now.  It's sometimes
<br>
entertaining and sometimes annoying, but not seriously harmful in any
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>However, I worry that, if you and your group actually succeeded in
<br>
creating a powerful AGI system, your overconfidence in your own views
<br>
and opinions could end up being very harmful.

</em><br>
<p>Yes, all AGI projects are scary to some extent.  
<br>
<p>However, an AGI project that is :
<br>
<p>-- conducted and directed by people with extremely arrogant,
<br>
overconfident and immature attitudes
<br>
<p>-- specifically oriented toward depriving people of free choice in favor
<br>
of some other value (in your case, estimated &quot;volition&quot;)
<br>
<p>is significantly more scary than the average AGI project.  That was my
<br>
main point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I regard myself as moving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the beat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a partially formed technical theory that is different in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wild guessing of my earlier days.  For this reason must I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sadly refuse many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the brilliant &quot;intuitive&quot; insights that people seem eager 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to offer me. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have been working on the basis of a partially formed (and
<br>
increasingly better and better formed) technical theory for many years
<br>
now -- not for a long time on the basis of &quot;wild guessing&quot; as you put it
<br>
<p>In my view, the kind of confidence in your views that you display would
<br>
be more sensible if you had a FULLY FORMED technical theory and concrete
<br>
results obtained from it.
<br>
<p>What makes you think your partially formed technical theory will
<br>
eventually be completed in a useful way is precisely your &quot;intuition,&quot;
<br>
according to the common usage of the word.  It's of course your right to
<br>
reject others' intuitions and accept your own -- we all do that -- but
<br>
it's bizarre to me the way you place your own intuition in such a
<br>
*supremely* privileged category over everybody else's.
<br>
<p>Yeah, you're very smart and insightful.  I don't know whether you're
<br>
smarter than I am (nor if such a simple comparison really makes sense)
<br>
-- although I get a strong sense that you think you are!  I do know
<br>
that, at maximum, you're only a LITTLE BIT smarter than I am, because
<br>
I've seen you make plenty of fairly obvious intellectual mistakes over
<br>
the years.  I don't believe you're SO smart as to justify your
<br>
dismissive attitude toward the ideas of others, and your remarkably high
<br>
opinion of the quality of your own intuitive estimates.
