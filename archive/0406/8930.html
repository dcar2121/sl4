<em>&gt; 'Oh I don't know what morality is, I'll just throw the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question entirely back on you humans!  Tell you what,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you humans can vote on it - give me your opinions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's what I'll take to be morality.  Cheers! ' ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems like a terrible waste of super-intelligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.  Perhaps the whole concept of 'Collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Volition' has gone over my head, I don't know.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sticking to my guns and still favoring the 'Objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Morality' approach.  
</em><br>
<p>To me, the concept of Objective Morality is an obvious oxymoron.
<br>
Obviously there is not, and can never be, an &quot;objective morality.&quot;  The
<br>
whole idea of morality is to impose some value system, some criterion
<br>
regarding how things &quot;should be.&quot;  But objectivity is about how things
<br>
ARE not about how they should be.  The very nature of should-ness
<br>
implies diversity, as opposed to singularity (in the sense of
<br>
singular-ness).
<br>
<p>I do think however that some moral systems are more &quot;universe-friendly&quot;
<br>
than others, in the sense that they have some prayer of actually guiding
<br>
the dynamics of real parts of the universe.
<br>
<p>I am not sure whether Eliezer's &quot;collective volition&quot; moral system is
<br>
really workable (i.e. universe-friendly) or not.
<br>
<p>The &quot;joy, growth and choice&quot; moral system that I proposed a while back
<br>
is at least *slightly* universe-friendly.  At least, in the domain of
<br>
humans and slightly-trans-human beings, it can be applied in a useful
<br>
way.  However, I'm not so sure it's universe-friendly in a grander
<br>
sense, because the very concepts of &quot;joy&quot;, &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;choice&quot; are
<br>
part of the human nexus of concepts and feelings, and probably don't
<br>
mean that much to profoundly nonhuman beings (at least, not enough that
<br>
they would want these concepts to guide their lives and actions).  Thus,
<br>
Singularity-wise, I tend to view any moral system as something that's
<br>
going to help launch the Singularity beyond human comprehension -- but
<br>
only a little bit beyond human comprehension ... Once things get too far
<br>
beyond human comprehension, then human-created moral systems probably
<br>
aren't going to be very relevant.
<br>
<p>The closest thing there could be to an objective morality is some set of
<br>
rules or principles regarding which moral systems tend to be more
<br>
universe-friendly than others -- either in our universe in particular,
<br>
or as a function of the universe in question.  This is a very
<br>
interesting area for speculation and investigation.
<br>
