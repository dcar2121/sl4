Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see how &quot;formal verification of Java programs&quot; can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done.  Or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least, I would assume that the specification of what the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to do is  where much of the trick takes place.   If the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specification is detailed enough and is itself provably correct (why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't we get an infinite recurse?) then it might well be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better form 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the program than the Java one was anyway.  
</em><br>
<p>Formal specification may take place in a mathematical specification
<br>
language such as Z.  This is not a good form for a practical software
<br>
program, because it doesn't deal with issues of memory or processing
<br>
efficiency, except at the very abstract level of the order-of-complexity
<br>
of algorithms and the design of data structures.  Currently there is no
<br>
technology for taking a Z specification and turning it into an efficient
<br>
software program.  However, the supercompiler technology may eventually
<br>
lead to such a capability, in which case, indeed, the specification will
<br>
be the program.
<br>
<p>The point is that the specification is much smaller and simpler than a
<br>
program, and hence can be more thoroughly checed my humans.  We don't
<br>
get an infinite recursion because the recursion stops with human
<br>
judgment.  The problem is that software programs that are too big and
<br>
complex are hard for humans to reliably verify as correct by direct
<br>
inspection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java removed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from C++ do not afaik make it any more powerful, certainly not more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succinct, and arguably no easier to prove a program is correct in. 
</em><br>
<p>This is not true.  Java lacks pointers and explicit heap memory
<br>
management, and this is what makes it orders of magnitude more feasible
<br>
to analyze Java programs mathematically, than C++ programs.  C# programs
<br>
are tractable in the sense that Java programs are, if one doesn't use
<br>
unsafe blocks of code and the pointer-manipulation that they permit.  
<br>
<p>The existing, partially functional Java supercompiler -- and the
<br>
existing C# partial-evaluator made by the same team under a research
<br>
grant from Microsoft -- could not have feasibly been made for C#.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe you can do this type of formalism for fairly small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it works for larger software systems then your friends should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practically own the server software space.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we have big ambitions for supercompilers.com, which will more
<br>
likely be carried out via partnership with major software firms than by
<br>
competing directly with them.  However, the technology is still in
<br>
development, and right now it works for SOME large software systems and
<br>
not others.
<br>
<p>Specifically, if you design a software program with knowledge of the
<br>
supercompilation process in mind, then the program can be large and
<br>
complex and the supercompiler can still grok it.  But if it's not
<br>
designed with supercompilation in mind, then the supercompiler may not
<br>
be able to do anything useful with it right now.
<br>
<p>Hopefully, this limitation will be overcome.  Even if not, however, it's
<br>
not such an obstacle for Novamente, because if we recode the Novamente
<br>
core in Java in future with supercompilation in mind, we can make sure
<br>
to structure the design in a supercompiler-friendly way.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So how does this work?  Is the core succinct enough to be formalized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a proof engine?  Or have the folks at supercompilers.com done 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that seems to me roughly equivalent to solving the halting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem?
</em><br>
<p>You don't need to solve the halting problem to prove that a program
<br>
successfully fulfills its specification, in most realistic cases.  Yeah,
<br>
you can come up with cases where a program verifier will choke.  But in
<br>
reality you can design a software system so that the program verifier
<br>
doesn't choke.
<br>
<p>There is a LOT of knowledge in the area of formal program verification
<br>
and transformation, and plenty of cool academic-ish technology, even
<br>
though very little of this has found its way into the commercial
<br>
software community.
<br>
