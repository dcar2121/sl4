Ben Goertzel, you wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being an arrogant jerk and a excellent scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or philosopher is not contradictory.  Being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant jerk when you're trying to raise funds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help you save the world, is not intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you're asking people to trust you for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than just science and philosophy, you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking them to trust you with their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I agreed with the statements you made in this paragraph when I first read
<br>
them.  However, on further reflection, I am not so sure that they will turn
<br>
out to be true.  There may be counter-intuitive value in harbouring an
<br>
obnoxious, outlandish character in the midst of a more serious group.  It
<br>
could easily be spin-doctored in a way that acquires additional donors.
<br>
Such a situation may offend my habitually earnest frame of mind, but am far
<br>
from certain that having everyone 'be nice' is optimal to achieving SIAI's
<br>
goals.  Better for people to be who they actually are and get the job done,
<br>
than waste energy pretending to be who you are not and delay progress.
<br>
<p>That said, I have a request for Eliezer, in reference to the following SL4
<br>
posting guideline:
<br>
<p>&quot;Flames: I have no objection to flames, but flames aren't allowed to be
<br>
boring.  Biting sarcasm and witty insults, please - not four-letter-words
<br>
used as punctuation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your more recent flames have been repetitive, and as such a bit boring.
<br>
Please don't lower the standard of this fine list by posting anything less
<br>
than your best &amp; most creative broad-sides.  Thank you. ;)
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
