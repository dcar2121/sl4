<em>&gt;&gt;Now I'm getting *really* confused. What is a qualia stream? Human minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just a temporal sequence of qualia. Qualia most times do not exist in a very

</em><br>

</em><br>
Pretty much all qualias (pain, any color, joy) seem instantenous to me. What
<br>
does &quot;appreciate&quot; mean? I may be able to get a reasonably good idea of how a
<br>
page of text looks within a split-second, but may need minutes to read it and
<br>
perhaps hours to understand the abstract concepts. But the information I parse
<br>
(part of the physical state of the page) can still exist in an arbitrarily small
<br>
time, how much time my limited mind needs to understand it on any level isn't
<br>
really relevant for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Qualia exist in time because the perception of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them takes place in time and because the apparatus that produces them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolves in time, and without the (4dimensional) complexity of that apparatus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia could (probably) not exist.
</em><br>
All perceptions of the human mind take place in time. Any event that is recorded
<br>
takes time to process.
<br>
Human minds are intrinsically self-modifying in a limited sense, but I don't
<br>
know of any data to support the assertion that the past or future states are of
<br>
any direct relevance for the processing in the present.
<br>
If I understood you correctly, this means that if our universe was just created
<br>
in this instance (complete with human brains, memories and all that), qualia
<br>
wouldn't work correctly because the brains wouldn't have existed for long enough?
<br>
The assertion that 4-dimensional (i.e. including data in the past/future)
<br>
complexity is durectly relevant for qualias appears rather strong and highly
<br>
nonobvious to me, I'd like to see some backing evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;present-self (at time of the thought; yes, this actually is an illusion in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;itself) at all, but by my past-selves. Some of these are close to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;present-self, others very distant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see your point although the overall subjective impression of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening is not to be continuously replaced by newer selves; living, feels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like existing in time. Therefore qualia stream continuity exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectively and that is all that matters from a first person perspective.
</em><br>
Yes, the &quot;overall subjective impression&quot; is not to be continously replaced by
<br>
newer selves, but subjective impressions of humans are frequently incorrect, for
<br>
a variety of reasons. One of these is, of course, that in the EEA slanted
<br>
impressions frequently yielded &quot;fitter&quot; behaviour.
<br>
Qualia stream continuity exists currently, in human minds, which are only a tiny
<br>
subset of all possible intelligences that perceive qualia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;future, there would then be two very similar versions of what my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;present-self would regard as future-selves of itself. Both would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the memories of my future-self just before the duplication. Both would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;perceive qualias they remember as part of &quot;their own&quot; qualia stream. So...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;does that mean that copying a human also creates a copy of its qualia stream?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Controversial, I think you would copy the qualia stream but the two would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still be causally separated (which means you couldn't get away with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminating the original), although I have no way to know for sure unless I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually try the experiment.
</em><br>
Shouldn't a theory about the nature of qualia predict a result of this
<br>
experiment? If you don't actually have this kind of theory to explain what
<br>
qualia are, how can you realistically draw conclusions about their relevance?
<br>
<p>My method, treating qualia as a functional adaption, predicts the result rather
<br>
trivially. According to it, if you duplicate a human, the two resulting
<br>
individuals are completely independent (though intially rather similar). Their
<br>
memories about qualias are not different from any other memories, and there is
<br>
no such thing as qualia streams at all. Regardless of that, I'm still not
<br>
willing to bet on my understanding being correct to the point of advocating a
<br>
direct implementation in an AI.
<br>
Why should I trust your understanding if you don't have a qualia hypothesis that
<br>
makes clear predictions about the result of relevant experiments?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Whatever qualities you need in a qualia-generator, designing one from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;scratch is likely to give you a more efficient result than using what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evolution came up with in humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, all positive minds with positive qualia balance deserve to exist. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, they don't, and we have been stuck with an unfavorable balance for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades,
</em><br>
I still don't know how you calculate the balance. You already stated that it 
<br>
isn't calculated by simply adding the &quot;goodness&quot; (positive or negative) of all 
<br>
qualia perceived anywhere in spacetime. I'd like to know the formula or at least 
<br>
the basic principle you use to arrive at the conclusion that the balance is 
<br>
&quot;unfavorable&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;These other means inevitably will take us and the ones we care about to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;a more favorable balance of positivity and negativity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That is afaik not always correct, and even in many cases where it is you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;could classify that as a side-effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example?
</em><br>
A human might decide to save the life of one of his offspring, thereby allowing 
<br>
them to live longer and altogether stack up even more negative qualia, before 
<br>
finally dying anyway. If this doesn't count now because of the pending 
<br>
singularity, there are still plenty of cases dating back several centuries.
<br>
Evolution doesn't care about qualia as an end, it only uses them as a means. 
<br>
Evolved beings are exeuctors of adaptions ultimately designed to maximally 
<br>
proliferate their genes, not to give the individuals carrying their genes 
<br>
maximally positive qualia on average.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That really won't do at all in my case. All that tells me is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;evolution wants me to avoid situation X&quot;, nothing more. I don't have any
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;compelling reason to assume that my 'OUCH' is objectively negative. I will
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;avoid it, partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Separate the ouch from the mechanicity of the physical response which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead you to avoid situation X.  They are not the same.
</em><br>
I agree, they aren't, but according to my hypothesis the function of the ouch is 
<br>
to trigger the response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I consciously avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations that I deem dangerous. Yet when I am in those situations I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a sudden and inexplicable subjective experience of negativity. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just consciously aware of the danger, that's all. With pain it's a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story altogether. Your hand on the flame. Or walking on a broken foot. Here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something very different is going on, not just an &quot;avoid situation X&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directive, but a spooky pain sensation.
</em><br>
It's spooky only as long as I refuse to analyze it from a distance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If I had the ability for complete and safe(!) self-modification, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;likely deactivate my qualia-generating code (yes, all of it) ASAP, assuming
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;that I find something to replace it with that works at least as well (afaik,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;a typical rational goal system would be likely to work).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And would that not be equivalent to physical death? What reason have you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you are still alive once you lose qualia?
</em><br>
&quot;life&quot; is in my opinion a horribly ill-defined property. I don't know if the 
<br>
typical uploaded mind would count as &quot;alive&quot; by the current standard of biology, 
<br>
and it matters little to me.
<br>
However, if my mind stopped existing, I wouldn't continue acting to fulfill my 
<br>
current supergoals. Thus, the supergoals would be less likely to be fulfilled. 
<br>
Thus, according to my current supergoals this is, all other things being equal, 
<br>
a less desireable future than one where my mind continues to exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even being aware of logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts requires qualia. These are often not strongly positive or strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative (unless you are thinking about emotionally charged topics). But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information processing without qualia (if it can exist) is just the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buzzing away in the background, without you really existing, without anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caring.
</em><br>
What does it mean to be aware? If information processing without qualia cannot 
<br>
exist, then I will probably need them to continue following my goals. On the 
<br>
other hand, an AI, or a PROP would also need them to function, so your probably 
<br>
don't have to worry that a working one can be built without using them in that case.
<br>
If it can (and I see absolutely no reason why it couldn't), There are the three 
<br>
final statements.
<br>
&quot;just the universe buzzing away&quot; - If I got this correctly it means basically 
<br>
that it would simply be physics at work. But my high-level cognitive processes 
<br>
are already based on plain old physics. If you look on sufficiently low levels 
<br>
that is always what you will find.
<br>
&quot;without you really existing&quot; - What is existence? I don't see any reason to 
<br>
assume that qualia are a critical part of it. Being a mind with a completely 
<br>
rational goal system looks a lot better to me than being software rewritten to 
<br>
work as orgasmium.
<br>
&quot;without anyone caring&quot; - Well, I don't really know that, since I don't advocate 
<br>
removing qualia from minds that would rather keep them (if that's a good idea 
<br>
I'll leave it to the CV to figure it out). But leaving that aside...&quot;caring&quot; as 
<br>
in &quot;feeling concern for the state of another being&quot; is just an emotion, a 
<br>
functional adaption of evolution. IIRC The Moral Animal stated that it was 
<br>
basically &quot;investment advice&quot;. You see that someone is very hungry, and if you 
<br>
are reasonably satiated and have some food over, you could play a non-zero-sum 
<br>
game by giving it to the hungry individual, which would put both of you ahead - 
<br>
the other individual by not starving immediately, and you by gaining an ally, 
<br>
that will likely reciprocate later. I don't see why anyone caring necessarily 
<br>
matters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Qualia based objective morality synthesizes a lot of human moralities, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparently have contradictory predictions, and puts them together in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coherent matter. It consolidates moral systems as diverse as: animal rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activism, scientology, islamic faith, christian faith... It consolidates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverse opinions concerning good and evil such as pro-abortionism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-abortionism, and so forth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also simpler to say positive/negative qualia than to recite passages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the bible or the quran.
</em><br>
I don't have a problem with treating qualia as motivational forces under certain 
<br>
conditions. That model probably has validity. I mereley don't see it as 
<br>
justified to assume an objective morality behind it.
<br>
What you need to explain these behaviours in terms of qualia is simply an 
<br>
assumption as weak as &quot;Many humans treat certain qualia as being objectively 
<br>
good or bad, and base their behaviour on that assumption&quot;. If the truth of this 
<br>
statement about reality is nonobvious, you can work out a questionaire, take 
<br>
some representative sample of current humans, and check the results. If you want 
<br>
data about history, you can correlate it with historic records. You don't need 
<br>
to base this assertion on anything else than empiric data to build upon it; if 
<br>
you want to explain it, though, there are several possibilities, and as long as 
<br>
one of them works out it doesn't matter which for the validity of the theories 
<br>
you stack on it.
<br>
<p>The task of explaining why the statement &quot;Many humans treat certain qualia as 
<br>
being objectively good or bad, and base their behaviour on that assumption&quot; 
<br>
appears to be true according to empiric tests is then completely independent of 
<br>
using the statement to build other theories.
<br>
I maintain my claim that EP is a simpler (and therefore more likely to be 
<br>
correct) method of doing this than Qualia based morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;No, the most URGENT need right now is to stop our house from burning down
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;without blowing it up (sorry, Eliezer). Suffering is a problem, but we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ?
</em><br>
&quot;The house burning down&quot;-metaphor was afaik coined by Eliezer, and as far as I 
<br>
understand it refers to the problem that our society's technological 
<br>
developement in the next years is likely to make several existential risks much 
<br>
more relevant. One of these is planetary-scale destruction by nanotechnology. 
<br>
Another is planetary or higher -scale destruction by UFAI.
<br>
Unless something to radically alter the situation happens (a Friendly SI or 
<br>
PROP; large-scale destruction of society without killing all humans) first, it 
<br>
is likely that one of these problems will occur and cause much larger problems 
<br>
than the ones we have currently within a few decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;probably tolerate a few more years/decades/centuries of it if we need that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;time to find a safe way to alleviate it. We probably don't have that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We? can probably tolerate? Who? Is this you typing at the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keyboard? or kids in the street with dirty feet and disease trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive until tomorrow? or is it laboratory animals who are cut up alive? or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it people with chronic depression or other mental problems who literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in hell? There is still a food chain out there. We fortunately stepped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of it when we developed the neocortex, but animals still live with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality of having their flesh torn apart and eaten. The world is a nasty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty place unless you are an upper class human with good mental health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another century of the biosphere creating massive amounts of negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia? Utterly immoral.
</em><br>
That &quot;we&quot; was over-the-top, I can of course not really speak for all sentient 
<br>
beings.
<br>
While I don't share your opinion of certain qualia being objectively morally 
<br>
good or bad, I'm certainly not pleased with having a death clock of 
<br>
150000humans/day ticking in the background. I agree that there are a lot of 
<br>
serious problems, but rushing a solution with the potential to make everything 
<br>
orders of magnitude worse is not a good idea.
<br>
<p>I have no idea how you would calculate the balance of goodness given all qualia, 
<br>
but if we screw this up we lose our only chance of fixing everything. Food 
<br>
chains have existed for millions of years, and humans have existed for 
<br>
thousands, another hundred more is not going to cause any irreparable damage. An 
<br>
UFAI is very likely to cause irreparable damage, and taking unnecessary risks in 
<br>
this area is not justified, regardless of what you believe to be objectively 
<br>
good. Qualia, intelligence, cheesecake, whatever; if we do this right we can 
<br>
then correct the balance, and we will have more time, more intelligence and more 
<br>
resources than we could use in the past to damage it. If we do it wrong, we have 
<br>
lost. Permanently. Rushing into this is gonna make things worse, for everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok this is quite new. Then you can start a zero-qualia movement! :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it is really easy to switch them off just suicide. As for the mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of life, once you stop being aware of them, who cares??
</em><br>
My goal system does; and again I remark that I have no reason whatsoever to 
<br>
believe that qualia are not &quot;mechanical&quot;.
<br>
I have no intention to start a zero-qualia movement. This is just my relatively 
<br>
uninformed opinion, and while I haven't read nearly enough to convince me of it 
<br>
being wrong, I'm not willing to assume that it is right either. I'll leave it to 
<br>
the CV to figure that out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if I screw up we are still left with paradise, it's a good plan B :)
</em><br>
I strongly disagree, see reasons above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I would go farther and claim that they aren't detached from the process at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of them are detached from the process, I could be here talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia and not really 'feeling' them.
</em><br>
Thinking and talking about X does not require having any direct contact to and 
<br>
part of X. I could think and talk about mammoths, Vogons and Jovian Lizards 
<br>
without ever having had contact with one, never mind that about 1.4 of these 
<br>
three are fictional.
<br>
The ability to manipulate concepts about X does not in itself give any 
<br>
information about the preconditions of X or its links with reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;It is imho self-evident for certain qualias because evolution hardcoded 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it. Does yellow have a self-evident positive or negative nature?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some qualia are mostly neutral or only take on a value if associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other qualia. For example you can have very pleasant sensations of color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you look at something beautiful. But yellow in itself... slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive I guess, not _that_ positive.
</em><br>
And why do you suppose that's the case? I'd like a theory that allows me to 
<br>
explain the good-/badness quotient of old qualia, and predict that of new ones 
<br>
given certain data about the qualia.
