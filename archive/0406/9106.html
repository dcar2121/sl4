<p>Robin etc.,
<br>
<p>I've met Eli in person a few times, and we even shared a hotel room once
<br>
(at that point, shortly after my company Webmind Inc. closed its doors,
<br>
I was harder-up for funds than him and he was nice enough to let me
<br>
share his room with him).  Of course, we got along fine.  I've seen Eli
<br>
be really obnoxious to *other people* in some cases, but he's always
<br>
been really nice to me in person, and I think I've always been nice to
<br>
him in person as well.
<br>
<p>I like Eliezer, I think he's a fun and fascinating guy, and one of the
<br>
cleverest people I know.
<br>
<p>That doesn't imply he doesn't scare me sometimes, though ;-)
