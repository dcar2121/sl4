Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; PS: Do you mean this literally or are you assuming that the FAI with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a collective volition function will externally observe (or converse with)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 6+ billion people individually and inductively model them or would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expect the collective volition function to just gather what information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it can from all sorts or primary and secondary sources (like we do) but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just on a more massive scale?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EY: Yes.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming that your one-word reply was not intended to be ambiguous, 
<br>
then apparently 'all of the above' was what you had in mind?
<br>
<p>That means that to create the collective volition to ensure that a 
<br>
superAI is friendly the AI will:
<br>
<p>- directly inspect what goes on in the brains of over 6 bllion+ people
<br>
<p>- will directly observe or perhaps converse with over 6 bllion+ people
<br>
<p>Could a pre-singularity AI do this?  That is, it seems like the technology 
<br>
required goes way beyond anything humans are likely to develop in the 
<br>
next few decades and the scale of the task is clearly astronomical.
<br>
<p>Also, is it likely that more than a small percentage of the 6 billion+ 
<br>
people would agree to have an AI trawling around in their heads.  If 
<br>
only a small (most likely non-representative) sample of humanity 
<br>
participate in the mind reaming, will the data collected be adequate.
<br>
<p>Are you proposing to do this mind reaming against the will of those who 
<br>
object?  Or are you proposing that the AI do the reaming without asking 
<br>
for permission?
<br>
<p>If the tasks outline above can only be accomplished by a post-
<br>
singularity AI, how will you ensure friendliness in any advanced but pre-
<br>
singularity AIs?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
