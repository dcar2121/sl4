</em><br>
<p>Nope.  Bad example ;)  Even in general relatively
<br>
there is still an objective ordering of events:  Given
<br>
an observer that records event x and records event y
<br>
as occuring later than x, if light from x had time to
<br>
pass through the point where y occurred before y
<br>
occurred, then x is in the ASBOLUTE past of y for all
<br>
observers.
<br>
<p>Time does have some flexibility yes, but there is
<br>
still an absolute ordering of events even in
<br>
relatively theory.

<em>&gt; Remove humans from the universe and where is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing about gravity.  Seems to me the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of morality is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human invention.  What morality is there in galaxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colliding, animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the food chain eating each other, etc?
</em><br>
<p>Remove humans from the universe you say?  What about
<br>
any alien civilizations that might exist?
<br>
<p>Don't be so sure there is no morality in: 'galaxies
<br>
colliding, animals in the food chain eating each
<br>
other'.  There are theories of consciousness which
<br>
ascribe some degree of sentience to everything
<br>
(panpsychism).  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you were the last human alive, and the race would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die out after you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were gone, is there anything you could do to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immoral?  
</em><br>
<p>Quite possibly.  What about alien cilivizations else
<br>
where in the universe?  Humans still living in
<br>
alternative branches of the quantum multiverse? 
<br>
Humans in the past?  Any other sentients that might
<br>
exist in the future?  The actions taken by the last
<br>
human alive could still be related to all the things
<br>
mentioned, even if these actions only had a tiny
<br>
effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To answer one of your questions, I think that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard by which you can say that Ghandi is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than Hitler.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only your rules of morality that tell you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hitler is bad (and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would personally agree).  But in some societies, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most vicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warrior gets the most honor and privilege.  By his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, he's a hero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By their morality, he's doing everything right.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you ask their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, they would tell you Ghandi is weak, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coward, and not someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to emulate.  One obvious example of this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samurai in Japan a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred years ago.  If they had to guess at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of the &quot;objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality&quot;, their guess would look nothing like mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How can our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moralities come from the same source and be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different?  
</em><br>
<p>Are our moralitites really so totally different
<br>
though?  Deduct out the differences and I think you'd
<br>
still find a great common of commonality.
<br>
<p><p>The answer
<br>
<em>&gt; comes when I answer your other questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by what standard would they define 'best'? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why would it be good if people thought 'longer or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faster'?  What is 'wisdom'?  It would seem that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objective morality is still implied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't &quot;best&quot; just end up being, in the long run,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever maximizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your potential to survive and reproduce?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samurai think best is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being better with the sword.  We think best is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking faster.  It all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on where you live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike W.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
'best' might possibly be related to whatever maximizes
<br>
your potential to survive, but even if this was so:
<br>
the fact that the laws of physics are the same
<br>
everywhere mean that there would still be some
<br>
objective standards for deciding what maximized
<br>
'potential to survive', no matter where you lived.
