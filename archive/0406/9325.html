'Moral perturbation theory'
<br>
<p>After thinking about the problem of extrapolated
<br>
volition I now don't think it would be so hard after
<br>
all.  What made me really skeptical at first was the
<br>
fact that there would be a huge number of different
<br>
components contributing to the 'Collective Volition'. 
<br>
But then I realized that not all these components
<br>
would be of equal importance.
<br>
<p>In astronomy, within the solar system there are a
<br>
large number of bodies whizzing around.  Aside from
<br>
the planets there are various asteroids and so forth. 
<br>
Now when astronomers calculate the motions of a planet
<br>
they don't try to make an exact calculation.  There
<br>
are just too many different gravitational influences,
<br>
and an exact calculation would be enormously complex. 
<br>
So astronomers use something known as 'Perturbation
<br>
theory'.  What makes the calculations tractable is the
<br>
fact that not all the gravitational influences are
<br>
equal.  All they have to do is look at the biggest
<br>
gravitational influence for a first approximation. 
<br>
Then they say that the actual motion of the planet in
<br>
question is this approximation plus a 'perturbation'
<br>
representing all the other gravitational influences. 
<br>
The accuracy can be increased to any desired degree by
<br>
successively factoring in the influence of each other
<br>
body in the solar system in order of decreasing
<br>
gravitational influence.
<br>
<p>To approximate the collective volition of humanity we
<br>
don't need to look at the brains of 6 billion people
<br>
at all.  In fact I think that the brains of only a few
<br>
hundred should suffice as a very good approximation!
<br>
Further if we wanted to calculate the approximate
<br>
extrapolated volition of any particular individual,
<br>
we'd simply take the CV as a generic first order
<br>
approximation , then add the  'moral perturbations'
<br>
caused by the more specific mental characteristics of
<br>
the individual under consideration.  
<br>
<p>Here's my reasoning:  Remember the extrapolated
<br>
volition is defined to be the volition that would
<br>
result if one thought longer, faster, knew more , was
<br>
more wise etc.  In other words: the volition resulting
<br>
from an increased over-all cognitive capacity.  So a
<br>
sampling of the people in the world with the highest
<br>
cognitive capacity would be a good generic first order
<br>
approximation of a typical humans 'extrapolated
<br>
volition'.  We only need look at our bright and
<br>
brightest.. the Gandhi’s, Einstein’s  etc.   
<br>
<p>Consider: as the extrapolations are projected forward
<br>
in time, small initial differences get magnified.  The
<br>
principle is similar to two different objects
<br>
following slightly different trajectories under
<br>
gravitational influence.  Initially there isn’t much
<br>
difference in the location, but as we extrapolate
<br>
forward the objects would get further and further
<br>
apart.  By analogy the psyches of just a few hundred
<br>
of humanities ‘best and brightest’ people would ‘blow
<br>
up’ in influence relative to everyone else on the
<br>
planet as the extrapolation projected forward.  In
<br>
fact this small group of people would end up exerting
<br>
the major 'moral influence' on the collective volition
<br>
in the long-term.  So we can safely say that the
<br>
collective volition of humanity is largely represented
<br>
by only these few hundred people plus a smaller
<br>
'perturbation'.  The smaller 'perturbation' would be
<br>
the moral influence of the rest of the people in the
<br>
world.  Remember the astronomy analogy.  To increase
<br>
the accuracy of the first order approximation, we
<br>
would simply expand the pool of people under
<br>
consideration, in order of decreasing cognitive
<br>
ability.  The 'moral perturbation' on the
<br>
approximation would become smaller and smaller as more
<br>
people were considered.
<br>
<p>Here's the really neat bit:  To extrapolate the
<br>
volition of any particular typical human  with
<br>
approximate accuracy we don't even need much detailed
<br>
information about that individual.  We simply take the
<br>
generic first order approximation that is  Collective
<br>
Volition, and say that the volition of the specific
<br>
individual we wish to approximate is simply the CV
<br>
plus a smaller 'perturbation' caused by the mental
<br>
characteristics specific to that particular
<br>
individual.  To increase the accuracy of the
<br>
extrapolation for that particular individual we don't
<br>
need to look at all their mental characteristics, we
<br>
just start by factoring in the  ones exerting the most
<br>
'moral influence' on their psyche.  As more mental
<br>
characteristics are considered, the 'moral
<br>
perturbation' caused by the remaining characteristics
<br>
would be growing smaller and smaller aka the astronomy
<br>
analogy.  A database of 'human mental characteristics'
<br>
would be consulted, moving from a small number of
<br>
generic characteristics exerting large  'moral
<br>
influence' on the psyche, to a larger number of more
<br>
specific characteristics exerting smaller 'moral
<br>
perturbations' on the earlier approximations. 
<br>
Obviously the further these calculations were carried,
<br>
the more accurate the volitional extrapolation.  But
<br>
the point is that using this 'moral perturbation
<br>
theory' only a very few mental characteristics should
<br>
be sufficient to produce reasonable approximations of
<br>
volition even on the individual level!          
<br>
<p>I also now think that the ‘sentient humane FAI’
<br>
approach would actually produce results more or less
<br>
equivalent to Eliezer's ‘non-sentient collective
<br>
volition process’ approach.
<br>
<p>Here’s my reasoning for this:  Suppose we created a
<br>
sentient FAI based on a generic altruistic human with
<br>
transpersonal philosophy.  Blowing this seed up to the
<br>
super-human level would be more or less equivalent to
<br>
a 'first order approximation' of the Collective
<br>
Volition of humanity (because as I explained, one only
<br>
needs to sample the minds of a small number of
<br>
humanities best and brightest (i.e. a seed A.I based
<br>
on a generic competent well balanced human altruist),
<br>
then 'extrapolate the volition' of this small sampling
<br>
(i.e. make the seed A.I  'think faster, longer' etc as
<br>
in 'hard takeoff).
<br>
<p>Imagine that the sentient humane FAI implemented a
<br>
global political system whereby 'rights' would were
<br>
assigned according to cognitive ability, as I
<br>
suggested.  So the FAI (which would actually be
<br>
equivalent to the 'first order approximation' of
<br>
humanities Collective Volition remember) would have
<br>
the most say in what went on in the world (because
<br>
most of the cognitive power on Earth would reside with
<br>
it).  Humans (having less cognitive ability than the
<br>
FAI) would initially have fewer rights than the FAI,
<br>
but they would still have some say.  This is
<br>
equivalent to factoring in the 'moral perturbations'
<br>
caused by more specific non generic characteristics of
<br>
the human psyche to increase the accuracy of the
<br>
original 'first order approximation' of humanities CV
<br>
(represented by the altruistic FAI).   
<br>
<p>So if the first FAI was a sentient FAI based on a
<br>
generic altruistic human with transpersonal
<br>
philosophy, it could exactly duplicate the results of
<br>
the non-sentient CV FAI system simply by setting up
<br>
the global Meritocracy system I proposed (giving
<br>
rights to each sentient on Earth based on that
<br>
sentient's cognitive capacities and including itself
<br>
as one of the sentients).
