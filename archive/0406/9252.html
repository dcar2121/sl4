<p><em>&gt; Hi Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It's not my intent to be Orwellian.  But sometimes I invent new ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and I have found it best to give them understandable labels. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is exactly the problem - the label you chose was not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable - to most people beyond yourself.  If a word has a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply embedded meaning in common speech
</em><br>
<p>That's why I picked &quot;volition&quot;, which sounds - at least to me - much more 
<br>
strange and exotic, less likely to be used in everyday speech, than 
<br>
&quot;decision&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, or &quot;best interest&quot;.  When was the last time you heard 
<br>
someone not a philosopher say, &quot;My volition is to drink a glass of water&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and you then try to use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in a special way - especially a way that is not just different from but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost the opposite of the normal meaning
</em><br>
<p>With this I disagree.  It is not the opposite of the normal meaning.  It is 
<br>
just that sometimes people's short-distance volitions oppose their 
<br>
medium-distance or long-distance volitions *within a reasonable construal* 
<br>
of volition.
<br>
<p>I also point out that collective volition is not about democracy, and 
<br>
moreover, I never said anywhere that it was about democracy.  That seems to 
<br>
be an assumption that other people are making.  I am not turning over an SI 
<br>
to a majority vote; that is genocide by genie bottle.  At the same time, I 
<br>
am not personally taking over the world, and I am not turning the world 
<br>
over to a separate humane intelligence.  I want to do something 
<br>
*complicated*, and yes, I need a new word to describe it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then you must expect that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will misunderstand what you are saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We already have a term in common usage that covers what you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about and it is the notion of acting in an entity's 'best interest'.
</em><br>
<p>The connotations of this term are not correct.  &quot;Best interest&quot; *is* a term 
<br>
in ordinary usage, and that is a problem; in the ordinary usage someone 
<br>
else construes the interest, and moreover, it is a human doing it.  It is 
<br>
not the same as a transparent optimization process extrapolating a person's 
<br>
*decision* - not their interests, their *decision* - given a set of 
<br>
cognitive transformations.
<br>
<p>I refuse to use &quot;best interest&quot; *because* it is a term in common English 
<br>
usage, and an extremely misleading one with respect to this novel thing I 
<br>
want to describe.  A collective volition is not going to look like a parent 
<br>
or politician talking about best interests.
<br>
<p>There is an art to picking words.  I do not claim to be a master at it, but 
<br>
it seems clear that &quot;volition&quot; is better than &quot;best interest&quot;, because 
<br>
volition is less often used, and has fewer connotations that cut against 
<br>
the grain of what I want to say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I might act in someone else's best interest - possibly even flatly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradicting what that person might say they want.  But my defense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be to say that I understood the way to meet their needs better than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did.  And they can counter-charge that I failed to understand them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that it was none of my business or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Another good reason not to use the word &quot;best interest&quot;, since it has 
<br>
connotations of defensible decisions in human politics.  A collective 
<br>
volition *extrapolates* politics but is of itself apolitical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You want the FAI to act in the best interest of humanity.
</em><br>
<p>This is *not* what I want.  See my answer to Samantha about the hard part 
<br>
of the problem as I see it.  I want a transparent optimization process to 
<br>
return a decision that you can think of as satisficing the superposition of 
<br>
probable future humanities, but that actually satisfices the superposition 
<br>
of extrapolated upgraded superposed-spread present-day humankind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why not call a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spade a spade?  You want you FAI to have a &quot;human collective best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest&quot; inference engine.
</em><br>
<p>Because this sounds like someone is defining the &quot;best interests&quot; and 
<br>
moreover the FAI will serve those &quot;best interests&quot; even when it contradicts 
<br>
our informed decision, which is the With Folded Hands scenario and other SF 
<br>
stories of Singularity Regret, which I am not silly enough to deliberately 
<br>
do.  Prime Intellect acts in the individual best interest, within the 
<br>
intuitive sense of the way that often works in human politics; this is not 
<br>
what we need.
