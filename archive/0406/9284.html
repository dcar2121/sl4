<p><em>&gt; sometimes the meter would correspond to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants and sometimes it wouldn't. 
</em><br>
<p>And sometimes they would correspond to the flip of a coin and sometimes
<br>
they would not, I’m sure out of 6 billion people on the planet you could
<br>
find somebody who thought putting on a green hat on Thursday was evil.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You were assuming that there would be absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no correlation between objective morality and human wants. 
</em><br>
<p>No I don’t assume that at all, there is a correlation and it’s exactly
<br>
what you would expect, from chance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The meter is supposed to indicate objective morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By definition it would not indicate that something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'horribly evil' without very good reasons. 
</em><br>
<p>By definition? Objective good is supposed to be an end in itself and is
<br>
complete in itself, it needs no reasons. The true saint is supposed to
<br>
do good because he should do good, not because it will aid him or
<br>
anybody else.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If putting on a green hat on Thursday really had no consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for you or anyone else, the meter could not possibly designate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this as 'horribly evil'.
</em><br>
<p>The positive or negative consequences to a person are irrelevant, people
<br>
have nothing to do with it, good and evil are objective not subjective
<br>
remember. The meter says putting on a green hat on Thursday is evil and
<br>
that’s just the way things are, it’s like complaining that a voltmeter
<br>
reads 6 volts. However if that is true then I see no reason not to be
<br>
evil. I mean, what’s so good about objective good?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; a German living in Nazi Germany might have checked the meter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Nazism and the dial might have swung to 'horribly evil'.  
</em><br>
<p>The suffering produced by Nazi Germany mean nothing because good and
<br>
evil are not subjective, so the meter could just as easily say it was
<br>
wonderfully virtuous, and that is why I have no use for such a meter.
