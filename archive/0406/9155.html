For a while now I've thought that an FAI might very likely have to 
<br>
establish a variety of enclaves, &quot;real&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot; where persons and 
<br>
groups could live according to their lights.  Indeed it may be so they 
<br>
must live in such a way if they are to have a hope of ever reaching 
<br>
their full potential.   It may be that the nearest approximation to 
<br>
Friendliness is to upload everyone but not tell most of them and let 
<br>
them live out their life or lives until they developed enough to be 
<br>
ready for more.    This might be a real upload and it might seem more 
<br>
like some very vivid and enlightening dreams.    It might be a 
<br>
techo-reincarnation scheme from certain perspectives.    Should a real 
<br>
FAI allow people to slaughter one another or to die utterly just 
<br>
because they aren't &quot;in their right and rational minds&quot;?

<em>&gt;&gt; Having followed some of the recent volition discussions I thought it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; might be interesting and appropriate to have codified (specified as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; supergoal?) into the (yet to be developed) fai's interaction with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sentients protocols a 'right of withdrawal'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think/feel that you have a very good idea here. I guess it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle of tolerance that exists in some well-functioning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everyone counts, communities of people add a lot of value to isolated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals but if a particular community is not to your taste you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be part of another one - but each community must abide by the rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they will not oppress the other - ie. do things to them that that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggreived society *really* does not want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It could be that some humans (or other sentients) choose to forgo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many/most of the 'benefits' that others see coming from the new age.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this response may *not* be conservatism, it might be that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people want to choose different evolutionary paths into the future - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what some see as an improvement others may not.  So coercive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'improvement' of others is not allowed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The really tricky bit (as always) is how do you make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals and communities do *not* do each other harm (some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventive coercion is presumably requiredhere from a 'higher'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority - ie. the collective governance) so how do you stop people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to slip coercive 'improvement' of others in under the guise of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing harm or slipping in harmful actions to others under the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of claims of self-determination?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where wisdom is required - not only of individuals , but also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our governance systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess the ultimate safeguard comes from individuals or communities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceiving actual or threatened harm and then challenging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominanct system to notice, acknowledge and respond productively to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their perception.  In our society non-violent action is probably the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective last-ditch defence.  Have a look at Gene Sharp's ideas to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sense of what I mean: <a href="http://www.aeinstein.org/">http://www.aeinstein.org/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
