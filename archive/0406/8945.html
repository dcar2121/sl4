<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, I don't see how anyone can make this huge fuss 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over sentience in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI when you don't know how it works and you can't give me a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walkthrough of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it produces useful outputs. 
</em><br>
<p>On this topic, I'm going to make a response that I often hear from you:
<br>
That is a long story and I don't have time to try to jam a summary into
<br>
an email.  Some of my recent essays that are on the dynapsyc site have
<br>
addressed this topic.  This topic will occupy some of Book III of my
<br>
long-awaited, in-process AI trilogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My brilliant new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand what I am doing, rather than randomly guessing, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see if that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lets me finish my work before the meddling dabblers blow up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident.  Though in your case it does begin to border on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being on purpose.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, I have never advocated nor pursued &quot;random guessing&quot; as an
<br>
approach to AI.  I have studied a large percentage of relevant science
<br>
and am acting on that basis.
<br>
<p>I have advocated creating infrahuman AGI systems and experimenting with
<br>
them, in order to learn more about AGI and develop a better theory of
<br>
general intelligence and its dynamics.
<br>
<p>Your characterization of me as a &quot;dabbler&quot; is silly; I've spent a lot
<br>
more time thinking about this stuff than you have, due to having been
<br>
around longer; and I've spent a large percentage of my life at it.  
<br>
<p>Your characterization of me as a &quot;meddler&quot; is ridiculous -- I don't even
<br>
know how to react.  By working on AI, I'm meddling in what you consider
<br>
to be properly your business and not mine??  Egads!  Perhaps you've been
<br>
watching too much Scooby-Doo.
<br>
<p>Finally, your allegation that I am semi-intentionally working to blow up
<br>
the world is nasty as well as absurd.  Quite honestly, I believe my
<br>
approach to AGI has a lot better chance of &quot;saving the human race&quot; than
<br>
yours does.  You're welcome to disagree with me on this -- but such
<br>
disagreement doesn't give you the right to tell me what my own motives
<br>
are.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I have better things to do with my day than respond at greater
<br>
length to your unwarranted insults.  
<br>
<p>Have fun with your intriguing philosophizing, my friend...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
