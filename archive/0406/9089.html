</em><br>
<p>Okay... now, note that it's YOU who decide how to be permissive towards 
<br>
your kids.
<br>
<p>If kids tried to decide how permissive their parents should be, it wouldn't 
<br>
work out at all.
<br>
<p>A powerful but dangerous analogy.  Still, it helps show why the *initial 
<br>
dynamic* uses extrapolated volition.  I don't think it'll be our volition 
<br>
to live out our lives as pawns to our own volitions - more reliably so than 
<br>
one can rely on a parent not to try and take over their child's life; 
<br>
between parents and children there are genetic conflicts of interest, and 
<br>
opportunity for parental selfishness, and parents are not always 
<br>
knowledgeable, or smart, or the people they wish they were.  Our 
<br>
extrapolated volitions will know, as human parents do not know, the limits 
<br>
of their ability to guess on our behalf.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, I think, a FAI should weight &quot;free choice of sentient beings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty high among the values it tries to optimize.
</em><br>
<p>And you'll pick the weighting yourself?  And it'll last for the next 
<br>
billion years?  Ben, I don't think I've ever seen you try to think of a 
<br>
single thing that could go wrong with *your own* solutions, whatever 
<br>
criticism you apply to mine.
<br>
<p>I'll make it a challenge:  Can you show me a single bit of self-criticism, 
<br>
a single extrapolation of error or catastrophe in your own plans, in any of 
<br>
your online pages?  (No sudden updates, that's cheating.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I note that my preference for free choice over extrapolated volition, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherever possible, is an ETHICAL value choice, it's not something that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be argued for or against rationally, at least not in a definitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
</em><br>
<p>And yet my ethical choices change, often after I learn new sciences.  Isn't 
<br>
that odd?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, it might be possible to show that having an FAI weight &quot;free 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice of sentient beings&quot; very highly is somehow pragmatically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible, whereas having an FAI weight collective volition very highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more plausible.  I don't believe that this is true, but, Eliezer, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think you have a demonstration of this I'd like to see it.
</em><br>
<p>If you can build FAI at all, you can build libertarian FAI, though one with 
<br>
that high art would also see the structural disadvantage, the moral danger.
<br>
<p>It's not possible or impossible.  It's wise or unwise.
