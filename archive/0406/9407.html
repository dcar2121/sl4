<p>Its certainly comforting to think that the superAI (or
<br>
AI conglomerate if we are lucky) will end up choosing
<br>
the goal of increasing, among other things, the amount
<br>
of interestingness in the universe (it gives us a huge
<br>
chance of survival for one thing - or even
<br>
reincarnation if we die before the Singularity). I
<br>
expect their actual goal to be more abstract than is
<br>
currently comprehensible to us, but an increase in
<br>
overall interestingness may well be a side-effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The universe is more interesting with us in it. 
</em><br>
<p>LOL. Really?  Well you could be right, but given that
<br>
at some point the superAI would be capable of bringing
<br>
into existence any number of an infinite variety of
<br>
&quot;designer intelligences&quot;, i tend to think that we
<br>
would only really be interesting from a historical
<br>
perspective...and is history all that interesting?
<br>
Maybe to some humans it is but i doubt whether higher 
<br>
intelligences would be at all bothered about anything
<br>
like that. I mean im sure historians think they are an
<br>
interesting bunch of people, but IMO the only
<br>
interesting thing about them is their abililty to
<br>
repeat the mantra: &quot;history always repeats itself&quot;
<br>
when quizzed about the usefulness of the subject, and
<br>
they just dont see the irony there... If there is any 
<br>
wisdom to be derived from this cliche then it is
<br>
rapidly becoming stale, and the further we head up the
<br>
double exponential curve of accelerating times the
<br>
more obsolete it becomes. Oops im starting to rant; i
<br>
think im just bearing a little grudge from my
<br>
schooldays when history lessons used to bore me stiff
<br>
:o}
