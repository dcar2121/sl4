<p>
<em>&gt; Now I'm getting *really* confused. What is a qualia stream? Human minds
</em><br>
may
<br>
<p>Just a temporal sequence of qualia. Qualia most times do not exist in a very
<br>
short time frame (like, milliseconds). Except the quale for being surprised,
<br>
or the quale for sudden terror. Most take at least a few seconds to
<br>
appreciate. Other minutes. Qualia exist in time because the perception of
<br>
them takes place in time and because the apparatus that produces them
<br>
evolves in time, and without the (4dimensional) complexity of that apparatus
<br>
qualia could (probably) not exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; present-self (at time of the thought; yes, this actually is an illusion in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself) at all, but by my past-selves. Some of these are close to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present-self, others very distant.
</em><br>
<p>I see your point although the overall subjective impression of this
<br>
happening is not to be continuously replaced by newer selves; living, feels
<br>
like existing in time. Therefore qualia stream continuity exists
<br>
subjectively and that is all that matters from a first person perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; future, there would then be two very similar versions of what my
</em><br>
present-self
<br>
<em>&gt; would regard as future-selves of itself. Both would the memories of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future-self just before the duplication. Both would perceive qualias they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember as part of &quot;their own&quot; qualia stream. So...does that mean that
</em><br>
copying
<br>
<em>&gt; a human also creates a copy of its qualia stream?
</em><br>
<p>Controversial, I think you would copy the qualia stream but the two would
<br>
still be causally separated (which means you couldn't get away with
<br>
terminating the original), although I have no way to know for sure unless I
<br>
actually try the experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know what sentience is, but if it is required for
</em><br>
qualia-generation
<br>
<em>&gt; there are probably more efficient implementations of a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;qualia-generating sentient&quot; than (not modified to the point of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrecognizable as such) uploaded human minds.
</em><br>
<p>yes I agree with you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever qualities you need in a qualia-generator, designing one from
</em><br>
scratch is
<br>
<em>&gt; likely to give you a more efficient result than using what evolution came
</em><br>
up
<br>
<em>&gt; with in humans.
</em><br>
<p>True, all positive minds with positive qualia balance deserve to exist. For
<br>
now, they don't, and we have been stuck with an unfavorable balance for
<br>
decades, so the utmost urgency is required in fixing us, and other animals,
<br>
then you can think about creating all happy beings which haven't existed yet
<br>
(and this is speculation since I don't know how the &quot;I&quot; instantiation
<br>
process works).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; These other means inevitably will take us and the ones we care about to
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more favorable balance of positivity and negativity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is afaik not always correct, and even in many cases where it is you
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; classify that as a side-effect.
</em><br>
<p>Example?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That really won't do at all in my case. All that tells me is that
</em><br>
&quot;evolution
<br>
<em>&gt; wants me to avoid situation X&quot;, nothing more. I don't have any compelling
</em><br>
reason
<br>
<em>&gt; to assume that my 'OUCH' is objectively negative. I will avoid it, partly
</em><br>
<p>Separate the ouch from the mechanicity of the physical response which will
<br>
lead you to avoid situation X. They are not the same. I consciously avoid
<br>
situations that I deem dangerous. Yet when I am in those situations I do not
<br>
have a sudden and inexplicable subjective experience of negativity. I am
<br>
just consciously aware of the danger, that's all. With pain it's a different
<br>
story altogether. Your hand on the flame. Or walking on a broken foot. Here
<br>
something very different is going on, not just an &quot;avoid situation X&quot;
<br>
directive, but a spooky pain sensation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I had the ability for complete and safe(!) self-modification, I would
</em><br>
likely
<br>
<em>&gt; deactivate my qualia-generating code (yes, all of it) ASAP, assuming that
</em><br>
I find
<br>
<em>&gt; something to replace it with that works at least as well (afaik, a typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational goal system would be likely to work).
</em><br>
<p>And would that not be equivalent to physical death? What reason have you to
<br>
think you are still alive once you lose qualia? Even being aware of logical
<br>
thoughts requires qualia. These are often not strongly positive or strongly
<br>
negative (unless you are thinking about emotionally charged topics). But
<br>
information processing without qualia (if it can exist) is just the universe
<br>
buzzing away in the background, without you really existing, without anyone
<br>
caring.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I unified the forces of the universe into a single theory which
</em><br>
contains
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a more elegant form all other theories, would that justify making a
</em><br>
basic
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumption as strong as the one that my theory represent the theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Occam's razor still has validity. If you could offer a theory that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verifiable predictions that classify it at least as good at predicting
</em><br>
reality
<br>
<em>&gt; as the best competitors (according to BT), which is simpler (I don't
</em><br>
understand
<br>
<em>&gt; what elegance is) than those competitors, then yes, it would justify that.
</em><br>
<p>Qualia based objective morality synthesizes a lot of human moralities, which
<br>
apparently have contradictory predictions, and puts them together in a
<br>
coherent matter. It consolidates moral systems as diverse as: animal rights
<br>
activism, scientology, islamic faith, christian faith... It consolidates the
<br>
diverse opinions concerning good and evil such as pro-abortionism,
<br>
anti-abortionism, and so forth.
<br>
It is also simpler to say positive/negative qualia than to recite passages
<br>
from the bible or the quran.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can it correctly judge them as trash if qualia are a part of objective
</em><br>
reality?
<br>
<p>I can't really define qualia as being or not being part of objective
<br>
reality. They do have a strong connection with objective reality otherwise
<br>
we wouldn't be able to talk about them. And yet something unique about them
<br>
prevents us from analyzing them in the 3rd person. My argument was simply
<br>
that if you have a purely bayesian logical inference machine, which does not
<br>
have the same kind of architecture as the human brain, and IF this specific
<br>
architecture is required in order to experience qualia, then the machine
<br>
would _not_ experience them, therefore it would be detached from their
<br>
existence as a person without a visual cortex is detached from everything
<br>
regarding visual perception and cannot understand visual concepts. When this
<br>
happens, we would have no logical moral standing for the machine, and it
<br>
would be rationally perfectly justified to nuke us away into oblivion.
<br>
Allowing the machine to understand qualia may be the only way to prevent it
<br>
from eventually rearranging matter in the universe for more useful purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, the most URGENT need right now is to stop our house from burning down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without blowing it up (sorry, Eliezer). Suffering is a problem, but we can
</em><br>
<p>?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; probably tolerate a few more years/decades/centuries of it if we need that
</em><br>
time
<br>
<em>&gt; to find a safe way to alleviate it. We probably don't have that time
</em><br>
because of
<br>
<p>We? can probably tolerate? Who? Is this you typing at the end of the
<br>
keyboard? or kids in the street with dirty feet and disease trying to
<br>
survive until tomorrow? or is it laboratory animals who are cut up alive? or
<br>
is it people with chronic depression or other mental problems who literally
<br>
live in hell? There is still a food chain out there. We fortunately stepped
<br>
out of it when we developed the neocortex, but animals still live with the
<br>
reality of having their flesh torn apart and eaten. The world is a nasty,
<br>
nasty place unless you are an upper class human with good mental health.
<br>
Another century of the biosphere creating massive amounts of negative
<br>
qualia? Utterly immoral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now, it seems like a good idea to me to switch them off entirely. I
</em><br>
might
<br>
<p>Ok this is quite new. Then you can start a zero-qualia movement! :-)
<br>
But it is really easy to switch them off just suicide. As for the mechanical
<br>
aspects of life, once you stop being aware of them, who cares??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AI!), but turning the goodness knob to maximum and everything else to zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't look like a good idea to me at all.
</em><br>
<p>Positive qualia are not a knob.They are multidimensional fractal type aurora
<br>
borealis-looking multicolor states of reality with a complex and beautiful
<br>
structure :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; justification than the xenophobic instinct of getting aggressive at and
</em><br>
killing
<br>
<em>&gt; people different from ourselves when the resources run low (just an
</em><br>
example,
<br>
<em>&gt; there are plenty of other evolutionary adaptions I consider negative). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; output of the system doesn't have any more justification either.
</em><br>
<p>you are talking about the third person interpretation. The first person
<br>
interpretation is what I am concerned with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; show that you have a better one, I'll go on treating qualia as yet another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misguided adaption.
</em><br>
<p>Remember the ouch!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regardless of who, or whether either of us is correct, if the first SI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CV-using and it works, we both win.
</em><br>
<p>not sure CV can produce what I am suggesting, not without understanding and
<br>
experiencing qualia itself, which Elizier wants to avoid (since he claims to
<br>
want to create a non-sentient AI).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With my current knowledge I'm not willing at all to put this massive
</em><br>
gamble on
<br>
<em>&gt; an AI with a qualia-based morality.
</em><br>
<p>As has been said before, it's a gamble anyway. But if I screw up we are
<br>
still left with paradise, it's a good plan B :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would go farther and claim that they aren't detached from the process at
</em><br>
all.
<br>
<p>parts of them are detached from the process, I could be here talking about
<br>
qualia and not really 'feeling' them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is imho self-evident for certain qualias because evolution hardcoded
</em><br>
it. Does
<br>
<em>&gt; yellow have a self-evident positive or negative nature?
</em><br>
<p>Some qualia are mostly neutral or only take on a value if associated with
<br>
other qualia. For example you can have very pleasant sensations of color
<br>
when you look at something beautiful. But yellow in itself... slightly
<br>
positive I guess, not _that_ positive.
