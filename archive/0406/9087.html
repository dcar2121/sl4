<p><p>The analogy with raising young children seems to work OK here (not

perfectly).
<br>
<p>A child isn't always cautious enough either.
<br>
<p>I tend to be a permissive parent, which means that I basically let my
<br>
kids do what they want.  I don't place restrictions on how much TV they
<br>
watch, for instance, even though I don't like TV and I think when they
<br>
grow up they might look back and wish they hadn't watched as much TV in
<br>
their childhood (not that they watch it constantly or anything...).
<br>
<p>However, if one of them is about to do something really dangerous or
<br>
stupid, then I stop them, invoking the &quot;When you grow up, you'll look
<br>
back and be glad I stopped you!&quot; principle.
<br>
<p>Similarly, I think, a FAI should weight &quot;free choice of sentient beings&quot;
<br>
pretty high among the values it tries to optimize.
<br>
<p>The &quot;collective volition&quot; factor should come into play, in effect, as a
<br>
mediating factor, to be invoked only when different beings' free choices
<br>
collide with each other too severely.  
<br>
<p>I note that my preference for free choice over extrapolated volition,
<br>
wherever possible, is an ETHICAL value choice, it's not something that
<br>
can be argued for or against rationally, at least not in a definitive
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>However, it might be possible to show that having an FAI weight &quot;free
<br>
choice of sentient beings&quot; very highly is somehow pragmatically
<br>
impossible, whereas having an FAI weight collective volition very highly
<br>
is more plausible.  I don't believe that this is true, but, Eliezer, if
<br>
you think you have a demonstration of this I'd like to see it.
