<em>&gt; I did not say it would not understand &quot;qualia&quot;.  The FRPOP has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand &quot;qualia&quot; so as to create zombies instead of real people when it
</em><br>
<p>OOOhhhh _now_ we start talking about qualia! But I remember Elizier and
<br>
others saying that *theories that cannot be tested and that do not have any
<br>
effect on the real world are a waste of time as they will prove to be just
<br>
some stupid illusion of humans* or something like that.
<br>
<p>If your collective volition understands qualia (which in my opinion would
<br>
REQUIRE it to experience them) then I think it has a very formidable tool
<br>
with which to assess the moral content of certain situations. And it
<br>
wouldn't need to extrapolate anything either; current present likelihood of
<br>
creating neg/pos qualia could drive the process. Factor in potential for
<br>
future creation of positive qualia (which indirectly implies growth), and
<br>
factor in the possible presence of metaqualia (different states of being of
<br>
extremely intense awareness, superior layers of existence that would make
<br>
human life seem as dull as a rock's)...
<br>
<p>In order to maximize positive qualia the religious delusions of certain
<br>
groups will need to be corrected but this will need to be done in a way that
<br>
does not create anguish or despair in these people. It really seems that
<br>
maximizing positive qualia (while preserving complexity if you wish) would
<br>
create all the specific requirements that we have been listing such as
<br>
freedom, growth, joy, love and laughter, creating a nice place to live,
<br>
letting christians know that they are wrong without offending them,
<br>
eliminating
<br>
illogical memes etc.
<br>
<p>Measuring Qualia requires discovering new physics. That's what a
<br>
superintelligence is for.
<br>
I have previously described a way in which the ai could be bootstrapped into
<br>
caring about qualia.
