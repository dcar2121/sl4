<p>There are formal techniques for verifying, or at least, reviewing and 
<br>
checking whether a program is doing what it should.  &quot;Safety&quot;, or in my 
<br>
field, &quot;Security&quot; is much harder to do because it deals with &quot;aspects&quot; 
<br>
of a system.  An &quot;aspect&quot; is an emergent property of a system that does 
<br>
not derive from any particular Java object.  Even if every object does 
<br>
everything exactly right, the overall system may not be safe or secure. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Information Assurance comes in.  It involves testing, 
<br>
review, auditing, and all sorts of processes that most developers never 
<br>
do in a formal way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    If the specification is detailed enough and is itself provably 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You are exactly correct here!  Java is a high-level language (or a 
<br>
medium-level language according to some people).  It still compiles 
<br>
down to the same machine code that C does.  What this means is that the 
<br>
differences between C++ and Java are merely at the human readable 
<br>
abstraction layer.  These differences do not exist in the executable 
<br>
binaries themselves.  Security people often run into these &quot;gotchas&quot; 
<br>
where Java programmers can't understand how they are getting the same 
<br>
errors as C programmers:
<br>
<p>- Pointer errors.  Just because Java doesn't show pointers to the 
<br>
humans in the syntax layer does not mean they don't exist.  Just as in 
<br>
C, Java can get pointer problems.  Make a string (which is really a 
<br>
character array) called A.  Give it a value of &quot;This is A&quot;.  Assign B 
<br>
to equal A.  B is really a pointer to the same physical memory space as 
<br>
A, even though Java hides this from you.  Change B to &quot;This is B&quot;.  
<br>
Guess what value A has in it now?  Yep, it says &quot;This is B&quot;.  A C 
<br>
programmer expects this.  A Java programmer does not.
<br>
<p>- Similarly, Java can abort with null pointer exceptions, even though 
<br>
the syntax language does not define pointers, the compiler does.
<br>
<p>- Java does garbage collection for you, so the language doesn't provide 
<br>
this feature.  This just means that Java doesn't control it of 
<br>
understand it, not that it doesn't have it.  Java will fill up memory 
<br>
until it runs out, and then the entire program freezes while garbage 
<br>
collection occurs.  The program will continue after a brief pause.  
<br>
This makes Java unacceptable for real-time or critical operations, 
<br>
because it can unpredictably freeze in an uncontrolled manner where C++ 
<br>
can be controlled.
<br>
<p>- Also Java security is at the syntax layer.  You can define an object 
<br>
class to be private, and the compiler won't let other people access it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the executable doesn't do this.  Binaries can read anything they 
<br>
want and will not get the compiler error.  Also, the compiler only 
<br>
forbids it if your header files tells it to.  If you redefine your 
<br>
PRIVATE to be compiled as PUBLIC, you can access anything you want.  To 
<br>
a security person, there is no Java security.  The Java protections are 
<br>
suggestions only and are not enforced or controlled.  For auditing 
<br>
purpose, these are not controls.
<br>
<p>Just some nitpicks, to show where things can go wrong in the final 
<br>
system that are not detectable in the individual objects or from the 
<br>
source code.  Every object can function perfectly, while the entire 
<br>
system fails.  This is where security and safety become difficult to 
<br>
enforce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I believe you can do this type of formalism for fairly small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs.   If it works for larger software systems then your friends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should practically own the server software space.
</em><br>
<p>People like me try to do this formal assurance for large systems.  My 
<br>
new job in Washington DC is as Principle Security Architect for the 
<br>
National Archives and Records Administration.  It is my job to define 
<br>
the architecture that will keep government records safe.  This even 
<br>
includes classified records.  It is huge and it does require formal 
<br>
assurance that will take years.  Security, Assurance, and Safety must 
<br>
be full-time jobs within the design team from the beginning, or else 
<br>
the system won't be secure, assured or safe.
