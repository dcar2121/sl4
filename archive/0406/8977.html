</em><br>
<p>In 2003 I tried to be Belldandy, sweetness and light.  It didn't work.  It 
<br>
was not until that point, when I grew mature enough to for the first time 
<br>
aspire to something that didn't easily fit my personality, that I 
<br>
understood just how hard it is to cut against the grain of one's character. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Striving toward total rationality and total altruism comes easily to me. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetness and light doesn't; I tried and failed.  Now I have much more 
<br>
sympathy for people whose personalities don't happen to easily fit 
<br>
rationality or altruism; it's *hard* to cut against your own grain.
<br>
<p>But y'know, this shiny new model of Friendly AI *does not require* that I 
<br>
be Belldandy, or even that I *approximate* Belldandy.  I can't be the 
<br>
person I once aspired to be, not without hardware support.  So while I am 
<br>
human, I will try to enjoy it, instead of torturing myself.  And ya know 
<br>
what?  I'm arrogant.  I'll try not to be an arrogant bastard, but I'm 
<br>
definitely arrogant.  I'm incredibly brilliant and yes, I'm proud of it, 
<br>
and what's more, I enjoy showing off and bragging about it.  I don't know 
<br>
if that's who I aspire to be, but it's surely who I am.  I don't demand 
<br>
that everyone acknowledge my incredible brilliance, but I'm not going to 
<br>
cut against the grain of my nature, either.  The next time someone 
<br>
incredulously asks, &quot;You think you're so smart, huh?&quot; I'm going to answer, 
<br>
&quot;*Hell* yes, and I am pursuing a task appropriate to my talents.&quot;  If 
<br>
anyone thinks that a Friendly AI can be created by a moderately bright 
<br>
researcher, they have rocks in their head.  This is a job for what I can 
<br>
only call Eliezer-class intelligence.  I will try not to be such an ass as 
<br>
Newton, try hard not to actually *hurt* anyone, but let's face it, I am not 
<br>
one of the modest geniuses.  The best I can do is recognize this and move on.
<br>
<p>As Anissimov points out, there are three people in SIAI right now, 
<br>
Anissimov, Emerson, and myself.  I'm not the public face of SIAI.  They 
<br>
are.  I am SIAI's cackling mad scientist in the basement.  That is my job 
<br>
function, and everyone needs to get used to the new division of labor.  At 
<br>
least some other people on the programming team will probably be arrogant 
<br>
mad scientists too.  Isn't it enough that we save the world?  Do we have to 
<br>
be frickin' *modest* about it?  Now that just seems unreasonable.  How are 
<br>
we supposed to stay sane?
<br>
<p>They laughed at my inventions!  They thought that I was mad!  They tried - 
<br>
to take me away - from my machines - but SOMEDAY!  Someday I'll show them 
<br>
ALL!  BWAHAHAHAHAHA!
