<br>
<p>I would like to level shift this discussion, hopefully in the direction of 
<br>
insight.
<br>
<p>Unless there are some AIs on this list--we are all social primates whose 
<br>
genes and resultant behavioral mechanisms were shaped by our ancestors 
<br>
being reproductively successful during the millions of years when they 
<br>
lived as hunter-gatherers.  This is basic evolutionary psychology.
<br>
<p>Because social status had such drastic effects on reproductive success 
<br>
during the past, it is a major (if not the prime) driver of human motivation.
<br>
<p>(Does anyone doubt that on average high social status men had more 
<br>
wives/children?  That the children of high social status women were more 
<br>
likely to survive?)
<br>
<p>Further, evolution may have favored those who are (at the conscious level) 
<br>
blind or actively blind to their motivations.  Why is not obvious.  Perhaps 
<br>
it was easier to enlist others in your tribe into cooperative activities if 
<br>
you were not consciously aware of your deep motivations.  Or perhaps such 
<br>
awareness does not have a reproductive payoff for other reasons.
<br>
<p>A consequence (of our blindness to our motivations) is a deep level bias 
<br>
against discussing the evolutionary origin of our motivations--especially 
<br>
if you apply it to yourself.  I worked out this application of EP over a 
<br>
period of years mostly on the alt.religion.scientology news group and took 
<br>
some ugly flame for applying it to myself.
<br>
<p>&quot;I know you won't attempt to justify what you did, because you
<br>
acknowledge the only reason you did it was to increase your social
<br>
standing.  I also know you'll continue to attempt putting a spin on
<br>
what I've done, because it's a threat to the social status you believe
<br>
you've gained.
<br>
<p>&quot;Evolutionary psychology is nothing more than a crock of shit, but
<br>
it certainly does go a long way in explaining why you do what
<br>
you do, Keith.  Thanks!&quot;

and
<br>
<a href="http://groups.google.ca/groups?selm=3b4ff9f9.5884992%40news1.bway.net&amp;output=gplain">http://groups.google.ca/groups?selm=3b4ff9f9.5884992%40news1.bway.net&amp;output=gplain</a><br>
<p>I will be amusing to see how much flame I get here.  I hope you can do 
<br>
better than the self defeating argument of the above flamer.
<br>
<p>Humans have higher order thinking skills, but they are far more used in 
<br>
service of deep motivations (rationalizations) then they are for rational 
<br>
thinking.  Thus you have to take all arguments by social 
<br>
primates--including this one--with a grain of salt.
<br>
<p>Understanding our motivations and those of others at the EP level applies:
<br>
<p>To the social context of people who are trying to understand the problem(s) 
<br>
of creating an AI with social features we want;
<br>
<p>To understanding what it is we want or should want and;
<br>
<p>To the AI itself.
<br>
<p>If there is interest I can go into further discussion on the first 
<br>
point.  Cooperation and consensus seeking on a list might not be as hard as 
<br>
FAI, but it sure has not been solved.
