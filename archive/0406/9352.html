From: &quot;Metaqualia&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:metaqualia@mynichi.com?Subject=Re:%20qualia,%20once%20and%20for%20all">metaqualia@mynichi.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Do I advocate death in the preponderance of negative qualia? I prefer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss this privately since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. It will take everyone's interest away from the more important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications of this theory
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that it is a cardinal point whether survival is a key value,
<br>
or only a key value in the preponderance of positive qualia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Realistically even with just human-level intellect and _some_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology the balance of positive vs negative qualia can be extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorable. If we go into super-human AI and total control over matter then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's easy to see that negative qualia do not need to exist at all.
</em><br>
<p>The human mind is a rather complex system (an understatement) an essentially
<br>
the fulfilling of people's material needs does not ensure (perhaps not even
<br>
tend to) the preponderance of positive qualia. People find all sorts of good
<br>
(and bad) reasons to be unhappy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Against their own interest, means, against their own long term interest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which means, against their goal system (if they had one). Look at people
</em><br>
who
<br>
<em>&gt; do things against their interst. People smoke. Because they like the
</em><br>
smoking
<br>
<em>&gt; quale. People gamble, and inevitably lose money in the long term. But they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the gambling quale. So the fact that people take actions against
</em><br>
their
<br>
<em>&gt; own interest just proves my point.
</em><br>
<p>It's not this type of action I'm referring to. Rather, it's the action of
<br>
someone who sacrifices his life to safe a perfect stranger, for example, or
<br>
some other similar case you can imagine. Something which, coinciding with
<br>
one's goal system, is however a positive qualia minimizer, at least locally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why destroy altruism? Altruism creates warm fuzzy feelings and lets humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bond, if it weren't for the kick in the rear nature gives us when our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _personal_ needs are not satisfied, we'd all be very altruistic,
</em><br>
constantly
<br>
<em>&gt; giving and constantly happy about giving.
</em><br>
<p>I have no intention to destroy altruism, it seems a _good thing_ to me.
<br>
However, altruism can be a source of negative qualia, in the individual as
<br>
in the social level, so that's why I was asking whether you'd advocate its
<br>
destruction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because according to your current goal system, happiness itself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with acquiring material wealth and power and other things. When
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; propose happiness for the sake of happiness, you automatically transform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this word into &quot;not happiness&quot; since &quot;happy for the sake of being happy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not have much utility in your current goal system. However the
</em><br>
&quot;happy&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am proposing is the same &quot;stuff&quot; that happens when you are happy for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake of other stuff; it is not something you rationalize and to which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are free to assign a happiness value. Happiness is happiness! Can't
</em><br>
possibly
<br>
<em>&gt; not like it :)
</em><br>
<p>Let me put it this way: you can 1) modify the environment and slightly
<br>
modify the human mind so that happiness is atainable and roughly corresponds
<br>
to the achievement of goals which overlap the collective volition or 2) you
<br>
can modify the human mind so that happiness becomes necessary (id est,
<br>
whatever happens the subject will be happy). I would argue that, under any
<br>
reasonable objective goal system (I am doubtful that qualia are as objective
<br>
as you think they are, but that's a whole other matter) 1 is a superior
<br>
choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you are grossly underestimating an eternal orgasmic machine. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, to imagine an orgasmic machine you must not imagine an orgasmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine. You will probably imagine a world in which everyone is productive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and joyful and altruistic and you have a beautiful house and you are in
</em><br>
love
<br>
<em>&gt; and your kids are healthy and whatever you happen to desire. Imagine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most intense and wonderful moments of your life. That is more like an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orgasmic machine! With all the subtleties of these experiences, not just
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; on/off switch.
</em><br>
<p>The key issue as I see it is the issue of necessity: if you modify people
<br>
such that they are no longer able to be unhappy, you have removed the basis
<br>
for happiness to have any meaning. Under my current goal system, that has a
<br>
high negative utility.
<br>
<p>However, maybe I'm not smart/knowledgeable/good enough to see the truth in
<br>
your argument. In such case, collective volition could sort it out and set a
<br>
qualia-maximizer (or whatever compromise of qualia-maximization is found to
<br>
be best) as a successor dynamic.
<br>
