</em><br>
<p>Intelligence is one of the pillars of morality.  Another pillar is 
<br>
interdependence.  Another, even more subtle, is growth.
<br>
<p>Wasn't so long ago, in the evolution of humanist thought, that 
<br>
*intelligence* was first seen as the beacon of enlightenment that would 
<br>
allow humanity to move beyond the previous confines of religion and 
<br>
superstition.  &quot;Free thinkers&quot; made great progress and patted themselves 
<br>
on the back for how smart they were.  Naturally they applied this 
<br>
powerful concept to everything they could, and impressed with the 
<br>
revolutionary progress they had made, extrapolated that all of 
<br>
humanity's questions could be best answered via the application of 
<br>
rational intelligence.  I think they were right, within the context of 
<br>
their awareness.
<br>
<p>A few of these rational free thinkers sensed that there was still 
<br>
something missing.  Rationality is bounded by knowledge, and a new level 
<br>
of enlightenment arose in which people began to realize a need for 
<br>
wisdom within uncertainty.  Some of these people were mistaken for 
<br>
mystics, but rather than abandoning rational thought, these newer 
<br>
thinkers worked to incorporate rational thinking into a larger framework 
<br>
that acknowledged, and even welcomed uncertainty.  Mathematical 
<br>
statistics (of the frequentist sort and more recently Bayesian) were 
<br>
joined by newer concepts of entropy and theories of information and 
<br>
incompleteness, and there was a pervasive belief among rational 
<br>
free-thinkers that if humanity just learned the right equations, they 
<br>
could understand the universe.  And great strides were made in many 
<br>
technological areas, and they were right, within the context of their 
<br>
awareness.
<br>
<p>More recently, concepts of uncertainty and randomness are being 
<br>
overtaken by ideas of chaos and complexity, and rational free-thinkers 
<br>
are discovering some of the inherent  limits of modeling and prediction 
<br>
with finite computational resources.  We're finding that much of the 
<br>
really interesting stuff can't be modeled or predicted and the only way 
<br>
to determine the end result is to actually play it out.  *This changes 
<br>
the focus of the game away from modeling and extrapolation, and towards 
<br>
understanding  what freedoms (points of influence) are available to us 
<br>
in order to create an always evolving and unpredictable future.*  These 
<br>
new concepts do not replace, but encompass and extend the previous paradigm.
<br>
<p>I offer this as a necessarily abbreviated and simplified history of the 
<br>
development of rational thinking on the human scale, and also perhaps 
<br>
the development of individual thinking among members of this list 
<br>
growing up within that knowledge environment.  Although overstated, 
<br>
perhaps &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; applies here as well.
