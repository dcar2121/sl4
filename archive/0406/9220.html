<p>Suppose you tell me that you don't know which way is &quot;up&quot;, but you know 
<br>
it's not exactly the direction of gravity, although gravity obviously has 
<br>
something to do with it, but you're not sure exactly what.  It may be that 
<br>
the exact specific direction of &quot;up&quot; is not something I can read out of 
<br>
your skull, the same way I can't read your volition off an LED display on 
<br>
the back of your neck.  But to find out what you *mean* by &quot;up&quot;, I need to 
<br>
look inside your head.  And you must already know something about this &quot;up&quot; 
<br>
of yours - maybe knowledge about the algorithm used to compute, rather than 
<br>
knowledge of the output of the algorithm - or you wouldn't know that &quot;up&quot; 
<br>
was *not* the exact direction of gravity.
<br>
<p>By the time you're finished telling me how to look inside your skull and 
<br>
read the cues used to find the algorithm that an AI runs to compute your 
<br>
&quot;up&quot;, you will, once again, have a volition-extrapolating dynamic.
<br>
<p>Morality is not *allowed* to be a mystery; you are in immediate possession 
<br>
of all information needed to untangle the mysteriousness, since your mind 
<br>
contains everything that generates the perception of mystery.  The same 
<br>
holds true of consciousness; I have not yet finished untangling that, but I 
<br>
know it is not allowed to be a mystery.
<br>
<p>If I had not already untangled morality, I cannot think of any algorithm 
<br>
Eliezer-2001 could have given an FAI to determine the answer except &quot;give 
<br>
the answer I would give if I knew more, thought faster&quot; (more drastic 
<br>
transformations not being necessary in this case).  CFAI does in fact 
<br>
specify something of this sort, albeit not clearly.
