<p>What is realtime? Im a believer in quantum multiverse
<br>
theory so in my view all conceivable future scenarios
<br>
happen in at least some Everett branches. Some are
<br>
more probable than others, but they're all equally
<br>
real. Also, in my eyes, everything can be seen as
<br>
information - not just scenarios and opinions, but
<br>
entire material universes can be reduced to lumps of
<br>
information -  so what is NOT information?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Example: If you can find an unbutchered version of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Terry Gilliam's Brazil, you see Jonathan Pryce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rescued from a torture chamber by swashbuckling     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-union plumber Robert De Niro. Pryce ends up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the far north living in a truck camper with his lady

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the recommendation! Ive just put in a bid
<br>
for it on Ebay (i saw a trailer of Brazil awhile ago
<br>
and wanted it but forgot to order it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, Pryce has escaped into a dream, but it's the   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only escape possible, and for him  it's a happy     
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ending of sorts. Is that the sort of mental illness
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; your scenario posits? 
</em><br>
<p>Well not really, by use of the phrase &quot;mental illness&quot;
<br>
i was referring to something that couldnt be classed
<br>
as an adequent alternative to consensual normality.
<br>
The device may be addictive but that doesnt mean the
<br>
resultant mental illness is a particularly pleasant
<br>
experience. I was also inferring that the rise in the
<br>
proportion of mentally ill people in society was the
<br>
cause of, either directly or indirectly, rocketing
<br>
crime rates (although i didnt explicitly state this).
<br>
This society eventually came to the opposite 
<br>
conclusion that you did i.e. that SOME sources of
<br>
information SHOULD be limited. 
<br>
<p>But the broader point was: sticking to any rule (even
<br>
rules that seem harmless or good) is not necessarily
<br>
the most enlightened way to live, because with any
<br>
rule or moral code etc you will be able to pick holes
<br>
in it or find counterexamples where it doesnt work.
<br>
Needless to say, my &quot;theory of morality&quot; if you can
<br>
call it that is very much inspired by Godel, but this
<br>
type of thinking also arises naturally from studies of
<br>
Taoism, or Eastern mysticism in general.
