<p><em>&gt; Question: What happens to a human who has no self interest or self
</em><br>
worth
<br>
<em>&gt; and is treated like dirt by those close to him because it is
</em><br>
assumed
<br>
<em>&gt; (incorrectly) he has no true feelings?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer: People in that position tend to kill themselves or become
</em><br>
serial
<br>
<em>&gt; ax murderers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question: Is there any reason to think an AI in the same situation
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; react much differently?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer: No. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The AI is _not human_
<br>
<p>It would react that way if its structure was such that it would act
<br>
that way. Else, it wouldn't. Yes, I know this is tautalogical, but
<br>
the point is that human psychology is human.
<br>
If the AI is explicitly structured differently, then why would it
<br>
react the same way as a human? Is there some magical amount of
<br>
problem solving capability that, when reached, automatically results
<br>
in humanlike emotions and such? That does not seem likely to me.
<br>
<p>Is it possible to create an AI that would behave this way? I
<br>
certainly expect so.
<br>
<p>Is it likely that _any_ AI would, automatically behave this way? I
<br>
rather doubt that.
<br>
<p>For that matter, why it be treated &quot;like dirt&quot; in the first place?
<br>
