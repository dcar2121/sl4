<p><em>&gt; Eliezer, let me try to summarize your current thinking (without commenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the feasibility), to see if I understand the essentials:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Seed AGI is too dangerous, and its development should be shelved in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what you propose.
</em><br>
<p>For our purposes (pragmatics, not AI theory) FAI is a special case of seed 
<br>
AGI.  Seed AGI without having solved the Friendliness problem seems to me a 
<br>
huge risk, i.e., seed AGI is the thing most likely to kill off humanity if 
<br>
FAI doesn't come first.  If a non-F seed AGI goes foom, that's it, game 
<br>
over.  I think we should be building in takeoff safeguards into essentially 
<br>
everything &quot;AGI&quot; or &quot;seed&quot;, because it's too dangerous to guess when 
<br>
safeguards start becoming necessary.  I can't do the math to calculate 
<br>
critical mass, and there are too many surprises when one can't do the math.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) You propose building a non-AGI, non-sentient system with the goal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to:
</em><br>
<p>A Really Powerful Optimization Process is an AGI but non-sentient, if I can 
<br>
figure out how to guarantee nonsentience for the hypotheses it develops to 
<br>
model sentient beings in external reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    a) extract a coherent view from humanity of what humans would want if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were more 'grown up' - ie. were more rational, used more/better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge in their decisions, had overcome many of their prejudices and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional limitations.
</em><br>
<p>...more or less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    b) recurse this analysis, assuming that these human desires had largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been achieved.
</em><br>
<p>Recursing the analysis gets you a longer-distance extrapolation, but 
<br>
presumably more grownup people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    c) Continue to improve this process until these computed human wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converge/ cohere 'sufficiently'
</em><br>
<p>Or fail to converge, in which I'd have to look for some other reasonably 
<br>
nice solution (or more likely move to a backup plan that had already been 
<br>
developed).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- only then implement strategies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure that these wishes are not thwarted by natural events or human action.
</em><br>
<p>That's phrased too negatively; the volition could render first aid, not 
<br>
only protect - do whatever the coherent wishes said was worth doing, 
<br>
bearing in mind that the coherent wish may be to limit the work done by the 
<br>
collective volition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is this essentially correct?
</em><br>
<p>Minor quibbles aside, yeah.
