<em>&gt; Why not just write some kind of happiness-maximization algorithm?
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
<br>
<p>Any of the principles that have been mentioned on the list can be connected
<br>
back to qualia. Nobody has proposed a single mechanism of morality that (if
<br>
implemented/enforced correctly) will have any chance of producing more
<br>
negative qualia than positive ones.
<br>
<p>Let's sum up:
<br>
<p>There are some important things we wish to see through and after the
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>- survival (continuing to function as conscious beings rather than not
<br>
existing)
<br>
- freedom (we don't want to be forced to act against our will)
<br>
- equality (we don't want small segments of the population to be less free)
<br>
- happiness (laughter, Joy, reaching the goals determined by our free will)
<br>
- growth (not being stuck in the same configuration endlessly)
<br>
<p>according to some, a correct interpretation of the Quran
<br>
<p>and so forth.
<br>
<p>I think everyone agrees on these, and yet Elizier pointed out that
<br>
hardcoding them would be dangerous. In fact I think that is true, the system
<br>
should be as simple as possible, but not simpler than that. Elizier also
<br>
points out there may be other things in the future we may consider to be
<br>
more important yet. I agree.
<br>
<p>Now,
<br>
<p>All of the items above, in my view, can be traced back to achieving a good
<br>
balance between positive and negative qualia.
<br>
<p>Survival is essential to continue to have qualia.
<br>
<p>Freedom has always been associated with the ability of carrying out one's
<br>
wishes which are supposed to increase positive qualia and decrease negative
<br>
ones.
<br>
<p>Equality comes in where we start considering the qualia produced by other
<br>
people's brains and not just our own.
<br>
<p>Happiness is positive qualia, no more no less.
<br>
<p>Growth is seen by us as positive because we get used to things. We don't
<br>
want to get bored, we feel that being stuck in one point is evil because
<br>
traditionally this meant no further progress could be made. Additionally
<br>
positive qualia soon fade after we have achieved something. But this is
<br>
evolutionary. A positive quale does not need to fade. We can sustain it
<br>
indeterminately and it is no less wonderful after you have been in it for a
<br>
million years! YET, we can strike a compromise here and say that the
<br>
_Variety_ of positive qualia is also important, therefore we account for
<br>
growth. More intelligence, bigger brains, more complex and interesting
<br>
positive qualia.
<br>
<p>Religious convictions and the kind of social order they impose are seen as
<br>
positive by those who hold them only because they stimulate positive qualia
<br>
in these people, and they are wired in such a way that removing these
<br>
convictions would create emotional distress (negative qualia).
<br>
<p>Fudley's argument:
<br>
Using qualia as a measuring stick gets beyond fudley's argument about
<br>
evolution (since qualia exist due to physical law, evolved wetware only
<br>
stimulates these patterns).
<br>
<p>Using qualia as a measuring stick we reconcile all our individual morality
<br>
assessments including why Hitler was evil, why we are justified in forcing
<br>
our children not to jump from the window thereby limiting their freedom at
<br>
times, why a paperclip universe sucks, and so forth.
<br>
<p>About Elizier's argument (do not hardcode):
<br>
If in the future we discover element X which becomes in our opinion more
<br>
important than freedom, more important than happiness, and so forth, it will
<br>
be because it stimulated positive qualia with greater strength or because it
<br>
avoids suffering where freedom and happiness do not. Or, IF in the future we
<br>
discover some _other_ state of existence which is more intense than human
<br>
qualia, then we can dump qualia and pass on (so we must allow for such a
<br>
discovery in the FAI). Keep in mind that we now call &quot;quale&quot; anything that
<br>
gives us a flash of experience with a certain flavour. So anything _like_
<br>
that even of a completely different magnitude will still be a quale, you can
<br>
use the same word, no matter if it is more complex.
<br>
<p>&quot;What if there's something _better_ than qualia and how to plan for it&quot; is
<br>
still an open topic for me (meaning that I will be giving it thought), but I
<br>
think that a favorable variety and balance of qualia is the most important
<br>
thing and there is no doubt in my mind about this now. I'd take a Biggest
<br>
Gamble, for 10 billion years of happiness of all sorts. If you screw it, you
<br>
miss out on the other stuff that doesn't make you happy, but you're still
<br>
there in a sort of transhuman heaven! I wouldn't take a Biggest Gamble on
<br>
some mind extrapolating machine though.
