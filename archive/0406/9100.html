<p>
With the recent SIAI-bashing on sl4, I might as well jump into the fray.
<br>
<p>My prediction:
<br>
<p>SIAI will self-destruct.  It will fail to attract substantial funding. 
<br>
It will lose in the race to the Singularity.  SIAI will still be working 
<br>
on movie website tie-ins, will still be marginally funded by college 
<br>
students and the occasional eccentric wealthy individual, and Eliezer 
<br>
will still be hammering out his friendliness theory with absolutely no 
<br>
working code in the year 2025 - about the time a generic bayesian 
<br>
knowledge network bootstraps itself into superintelligence.
<br>
<p>1.  Ben's points about the arrogance of Eliezer and Michael are *very 
<br>
much* relevant to the ability of SIAI to meet its goals.  There are a 
<br>
couple orthogonal reasons for this:
<br>
<p>1a. Arrogance tends to close one's mind to the consideration of outside 
<br>
ideas.  An idea monoculture can and usually does severely limit an 
<br>
organization's ability to succeed.  Ackoff and other organizational 
<br>
systems theorists have demonstrated this extensively.
<br>
<p>1b. Arrogance, even if it is &quot;correctly-placed&quot; and &quot;deserved&quot;, often 
<br>
limits an organization's fundraising capacity.  Acting like a complete 
<br>
ass is one very effective way of dissuading people from allocating 
<br>
resources in the direction of said ass.  This effect is *significantly* 
<br>
amplified if the principals in question have no external claim to the 
<br>
basis of their arrogance( e.g. high honors, doctorate degrees, industry 
<br>
success, etc ).  Serious investors do not buy into an idea on faith alone.
<br>
<p>1c. SIAI's apparent mistrust of &quot;outsiders&quot;, as demonstrated in the 
<br>
oft-repeated claims that LOGI is obsolete and there is something much 
<br>
better but it can't be published because evil people will implement it 
<br>
before we get friendliness worked out.  This position has the direct 
<br>
effect of discouraging talented potential seed AI programmers from 
<br>
becoming interested in the project.  It also has the direct effect of 
<br>
discouraging outside investment due to disclosure and control concerns. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It also has the direct effect( and I believe Ben has already noted 
<br>
this )of discouraging other AGI researchers from contributing ideas 
<br>
toward the development of SIAI's theory and project, e.g. &quot;why bother if 
<br>
what they've published is useless anyway?&quot;
<br>
<p>2.  Not only is there a complete lack of theoretical cohesiveness 
<br>
amongst AGI projects( e.g. Eliezer and Ben ), but there is a complete 
<br>
lack of theoretical, structural, and motivational cohesiveness amongst 
<br>
the principals of SIAI itself.  I don't think a day goes by( recently 
<br>
)during which Eliezer doesn't correct Tyler or Anissimov on at least one 
<br>
very critical point.  Acknowledging the fact that *correctness* is 
<br>
important to maintain, I would argue that when attempting to gain public 
<br>
interest or outside funding, this is a critical flaw.  Seasoned public 
<br>
relations professionals know that if one doesn't know the answer, one 
<br>
doesn't make it up.  When attempting to secure funding, one doesn't 
<br>
present to the public a group of highly disconnected individuals.
<br>
<p>3.  Awareness Efforts.  Admittedly, I was a little excited about the 
<br>
flurry of activity that Tyler initiated, as I got the impression that 
<br>
SIAI was finally getting serious about promoting itself.  This is what 
<br>
caused me to begin donating and helping in the first place.  After a 
<br>
while, however, it became clear to me that it was more of the same. 
<br>
Undertaking herculean efforts in order to drive a few more hits to a 
<br>
website.  Bringing on a 20-year-old with no significant network to go 
<br>
fundraising in silicon valley.  Wow.  What SIAI seems to not understand 
<br>
is that when one undertakes a serious round of fundraising, one must 
<br>
approach potential serious investors with either credibility or a 
<br>
product - and for reasons noted above, this is something SIAI does not have.
