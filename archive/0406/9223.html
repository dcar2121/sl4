You're asking good questions, and the process of asking these 
<br>
increasingly accurate questions will lead to increasingly accurate 
<br>
solutions.
<br>
<p>The vector sum of current human volition is not wisdom.  It's not even 
<br>
an early approximation of wisdom.  In fact, it's currently badly skewed.
<br>
<p>The vector sum of current human volition does not represent wisdom, let 
<br>
alone embody wisdom. Acting as if it did would invite disaster, given 
<br>
the current state of human development. The answers you seek do not 
<br>
exist yet, no matter how deeply and widely one might be able to probe 
<br>
the collective human psyche.  There are no pointers, maps, or 
<br>
transformations of this collective data that could be directly applied 
<br>
to the solution you (we all) seek.   The current data set is strongly 
<br>
skewed toward short term, local scope thinking.  The answers do not 
<br>
exist in the current data set but we can expect they will emerge only as 
<br>
part and result of the process.
<br>
<p>Yes, wisdom is present within the collective landscape, but most of 
<br>
humanity perceive and consider only a small portion of the whole, and 
<br>
the answers you seek within it require a broader scope of human 
<br>
intelligence.  The seeds exist but they have not yet grown, and it is 
<br>
impossible to see the tree without planting, nurturing, and waiting for 
<br>
the seeds to grow.
<br>
<p>To model the collective volition of humanity is a worthy goal, not to 
<br>
extract from it the ideal human volition, or even an a starting 
<br>
approximation of the ideal, but for the purpose of better understanding 
<br>
and contributing to the process that will get us wherever we will be in 
<br>
the future.  There is much work that can be done to improve the process 
<br>
of humanity getting closer to its evolving goals, but progress will be 
<br>
made by building upon the foundations of morality rather than futilely 
<br>
preparing to prune a unique and yet unknown tree when it is still a seed.
<br>
<p>What is moral, in the minds of people of disparate backgrounds, tends to 
<br>
converge as their understanding and interests broaden.  As the scope 
<br>
expands to include broader space of interaction, broader range of 
<br>
interacting parties, and broader time period being considered, &quot;what is 
<br>
moral&quot;, tends to converge into an ever clearer sense of shared 
<br>
direction.  You can only get there by performing the interactions -- a 
<br>
model of sufficient accuracy would take just as long to run the 
<br>
simulation as the reality -- but you can extract principles of 
<br>
successful interactions along the way and apply these principles toward 
<br>
&quot;promoting the good.&quot;
