<p>Would you like to name nine other things that are so fundamental to having

I'm sure nine other people would be happy to do so.  Al-Qaeda thinks that

basing the AI on the Koran is so fundamental to having an acceptable

</em><br>
<p>Including human infants, I assume.  I'll expect you to deliver the exact, 
<br>
eternal, unalterable specification of what constitutes a &quot;sentient&quot; by 
<br>
Thursday.  Whatever happened to keeping things simple?

<p><em>&gt; Change the environment, alter the systems, create the transcendent

</em><br>
<p>Could you please elaborate further on all the independent details you would 
<br>
like to code into eternal, unalterable invariants?  If you add enough of 
<br>
them we can drive the probability of them all working as expected down to 
<br>
effectively zero.  Three should be sufficient, but redundancy is always a 
<br>
good thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do this and I think the vision of the coming singularity will be more

</em><br>
<p>It's not about public relations, it's about living with the actual result 
<br>
for the next ten billion years if that wonderful PR invariant turns out to 
<br>
be a bad idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (and besides I can't really object about 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not under your system, no.  I would like to allow your grownup self and/or 
<br>
your volition to object effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do not tell me that 'oops we got it wrong...' as indicated here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason may be, &quot;That idiot Eliezer screwed up the extrapolation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  dynamic.&quot;  If so, you got me, there's no defense against that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll try not to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead (using the principal of no modification to sentients without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express permission) the system can tell me &quot;Hey, you'd be much happier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you had green hair, we've done some calculations and if at least 20%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the population had green hair then there would be a 15% reduction in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the general unhappiness quotient... Can I make this modification to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or would you like a deeper explanation of the intents and consequences?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I suppose that if that is the sort of solution you would come up with after 
<br>
thinking about it for a few years, it might be the secondary dynamic.  For 
<br>
myself I would argue against that, because it sounds like individuals have 
<br>
been handed genie bottles with warning labels, and I don't think that's a 
<br>
good thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think I'm mindful that the system is likely to evolve fast, (go foom! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hopefully in a good way!)) and that even if it is Friendly and has my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best interests at heart I still may not want to participate in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of the system, even if its calculations tell it that I would in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact in the future have appreciated being modified. I think I do foresee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hard takeoff scenario and as long as the fundamentals are good then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even when no person or group of people is capable of understanding even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small percent of the operations or actions of the system as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have and retain personal choice over their own person (and possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local environment) then things will be fine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I don't particularly care that the system decided it needed to convert 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 90% of Arizona into a giant radio transmitter - just don't make me into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the support beams!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brent &lt;== *likely to have green hair if the system says it would help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity, but glad to be consulted*
</em><br>
<p>The title of this subject line is &quot;fundamentals&quot;.  There is a fundamental 
<br>
tradeoff that works like this:  The more *assured* are such details of the 
<br>
outcome, even in the face of our later reconsideration, the more control is 
<br>
irrevocably exerted over the details of the outcome by a human-level 
<br>
intelligence.  This holds especially true of the things that we are most 
<br>
nervous about.  The more control you take away from smarter minds, for the 
<br>
sake of your own nervousness, the more you risk damning yourself.  What if 
<br>
the Right of Withdrawal that you code (irrevocably and forever, or else why 
<br>
bother) is the wrong Right, weaker and less effective than the Right of 
<br>
Withdrawal the initial dynamic would have set in place if you hadn't meddled?
<br>
<p>The more *predictable* is the particular detail you care about, the more 
<br>
that detail is being specified by a human-level intelligence.  I have said 
<br>
this before, but the moral challenges of FAI require FAI to solve - one 
<br>
must work with the stuff that good ideas are made of, dip into the well of 
<br>
good solutions, and not depend on one's own ability to come up with the 
<br>
best answer.
