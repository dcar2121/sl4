</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presumably by the point that this interaction becomes worth discussing

<em>&gt; the (hopefully) fai has access to technologies (probably self

</em><br>
<em>&gt; supportive environmental conditions to 'live out their lives' as they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish without the oversight, modification or interference by the fai. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This could be a separate 'no interference zone or enclave' or perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mobile field/area around the sentient. It (presumably) goes without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying (although I will say it) that although the 'withdrawn' sentient 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fai and the collective volition). Additionally the sentient at any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time should be able to 'emerge' from the withdrawn state as should any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descendants of the sentient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't really seen this view directly published (although it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follows logically and is somewhat akin to the 'last judge' sentiment - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however directed on an individual ongoing basis instead of at the fai

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the concept of volition.
</em><br>
<p>I think Greg Egan's _Permutation City_ epitomized the solopsist ideal of 
<br>
being able to live one's life enclosed in an environment of one's choice.
<br>
<p>Damien's _Transcension_ and David Zindell's _Neverness_ and _Broken God_ 
<br>
on the other hand, may be closer to what you had in mind, with a 
<br>
separate society decreed to be off-limits and expected to be safe from 
<br>
the contaminating effects of advanced technology.
<br>
<p>Vernor Vinge offered another idea, but I can't think of the title right 
<br>
now, where people could enter a stasis bubble and then &quot;time-travel&quot; by 
<br>
waiting a set period and then exit into a future time at which the odds 
<br>
of having any neighbors might be very small.
