</em><br>
<em>&gt; it on me. You notice that the state of my neurons is similar (but not
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to conclude that I am experiencing sadness just like you did. As proof

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my eyes and made a noise with my mouth that sounded like &quot;I feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sad&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this would be good evidence that your theory is probably

</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons were not identical to yours, only similar, we are after all

</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a noise like &quot; I feel sad&quot; but really I feel nothing.
</em><br>
<p>There are a large number of possible theories that fit
<br>
any set of facts, and which all make the same predictions
<br>
for experiment.  Given an intelligence which has the same
<br>
general construction (but not identical!  I know, I know),
<br>
it seems to satisfy Occam better to assume that similar
<br>
patterns of neuron firing and behavior is indicative of
<br>
similar internal states.
<br>
<p>Since you know you &quot;have consciousness&quot;, it seems simpler
<br>
to assume that others with similar structures and who
<br>
claim to &quot;have consciousness&quot; do.  This still doesn't mean
<br>
that consciousness is anything other than the interaction
<br>
of neurons, so you could conceivably ignore it, in the same
<br>
way that you could ignore all classical rules and calculate
<br>
the behavior of classical systems by using only the quantum
<br>
rules (I think?).  It's just that classical rules and
<br>
consciousness are a shortcut for doing the particle-by-particle
<br>
math.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; If I was convinced that was true I would have to become a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; creationist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd have no alternative because I would have absolutely no way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; explain  how random mutation and natural selection produced at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; creature that had personality and consciousness, me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I have no idea why that is your position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How is this different from a statement that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;would have absolutely no way to explain how random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mutation and natural selection produced at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; creature that can metabolize alcohol&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because regardless of how important consciousness is to us evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn’t give a damn about it, all it’s interested in is behavior. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to metabolize alcohol could change the probability of an animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surviving by a huge amount,
</em><br>
<p>It seems plausible that intelligence is only a useful selection
<br>
criterion if it occurs with self-interest, and that consciousness
<br>
is some combination of easy and likely for random points in the
<br>
space of intelligent, self-interested organisms.  If that's the
<br>
case, then it's not implausible that evolution would favor
<br>
organisms that have consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but if consciousness and behavior can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; segregated as you say then there is no way random mutation and natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection could ever have made us conscious, or rather made me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious, I’m not sure about you.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not actually arguing that consciousness and behavior can be
<br>
separated, only that *certain* behaviors exhibited by those who
<br>
report consciousness can be separated from consciousness.  Unless
<br>
you believe that any process is somewhat conscious (and I understand
<br>
that some of the people on this list do; I just don't think you're
<br>
one of them), you must agree.  No?  Is your wristwatch conscious?
<br>
<p>In particular, it seems that Eliezer believes that the behavior of
<br>
general problem solving can be separated from consciousness.  I
<br>
have no opinion on whether that's true, but I don't think it is
<br>
obviously wrong.  It may be that I've completely misunderstood
<br>
Eliezer, but if that's the case, I'm sure I'll be corrected shortly. :)
