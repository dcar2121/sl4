<p>
Sorry to break the 1-week layoff, but this was too interesting to not
<br>
pass on:
<br>
<p>(from
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/view.html?pg=4?tw=wn_tophead_9">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/view.html?pg=4?tw=wn_tophead_9</a>
<br>
)
<br>
<p>The second ominous frontier is brain augmentation, best embodied by the
<br>
remote-controlled rat recently created at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn.
<br>
Rats are ideal lab animals because most anything that can be done to a
<br>
rat can be done to a human. So this robo-rat, whose direction of travel
<br>
can be determined by a human with a transmitter standing up to 547 yards
<br>
away, evokes a nightmare world of violated human dignity, a place where
<br>
Winston Smith of Orwell's 1984 isn't merely eaten by rats but becomes
<br>
one. 
<br>
<p>Another troubling frontier is physical, as opposed to mental,
<br>
augmentation. Japan has a rapidly growing elderly population and a
<br>
serious shortage of caretakers. So Japanese roboticists (who have a
<br>
dominating presence at this Italian symposium) envision walking
<br>
wheelchairs and mobile arms that manipulate and fetch.
<br>
<p>But there's ethical hell at the interfaces. The peripherals may be
<br>
dizzyingly clever gizmos from the likes of Sony and Honda, but the CPU
<br>
is a human being: old, weak, vulnerable, pitifully limited, possibly
<br>
senile.
<br>
<p>Frontier number four is social: human reaction to the troubling presence
<br>
of the humanoid. Sony created a major success with its dog-shaped Aibo,
<br>
but the follow-up may never reach consumers. The new product, known as
<br>
the Qrio, is technically good to go and would be hopping off shelves in
<br>
the Akihabara district right now - except for one hitch. The Qrio is a
<br>
human-shaped, self-propelled puppet that can walk, talk, pinch, and take
<br>
pictures, and it has no more ethics than a tire iron. 
<br>
<p>In his 1950 classic, I, Robot, Isaac Asimov first conceived of machines
<br>
as moral actors. His robots enjoy nothing better than to sit and analyze
<br>
the ethical implications of their actions. Qrio, on the other hand,
<br>
knows nothing, cares nothing, and reasons not one whit. Improperly
<br>
programmed, it could shoot handguns, set fire to buildings, and even
<br>
slit your throat as you sleep before capering into a crowded mall to
<br>
detonate itself while screaming political slogans. The upshot is that
<br>
you're unlikely to be able to buy one anytime soon.
