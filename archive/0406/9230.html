<p>Now I am confused.  Our psychology was shaped by our evolution.  What 
<br>
we desire and see as the good is shaped by our evolution.  So how can 
<br>
you not care about the genes?  They had no small part in determining 
<br>
the memes.   If the result of CV extraction and use is to be good for 
<br>
human beings then isn't what type of creatures humans are (their genes) 
<br>
quite relevant?   Can a moral decision for the sake of a group of 
<br>
entities be meaningful if it doesn't consider the nature, including the 
<br>
limitations, of the entities involved?   Is it assumed that if we &quot;knew 
<br>
more and thought faster&quot; that we would no longer be running the same 
<br>
evolutionary programming?    Even if this is so (and I believe it is) 
<br>
the AI would still need to work through the EP determined programming 
<br>
of human beings in order to gradually &quot;uplift&quot; them into their CV 
<br>
ideal.
