<p>I don't even expect CV to be consistent over time.
<br>
<p>Does anyone doubt that wars are a result of &quot;collective volition&quot;?
<br>
<p>I make an argument rooted in evolutionary psychology and evolution that the 
<br>
volition leading groups into wars is a result of privation, especially 
<br>
&quot;looming&quot; privation where after a run up the economy goes sour for either 
<br>
the whole population or some sub group.
<br>
<p>(Put &quot;xenophobic memes&quot; in Google if you don't remember the argument.)
<br>
<p>In times of plenty the &quot;gain&quot; on xenophobic memes is low, so tribes can do 
<br>
business with each other and swap women.  But when times get bad . . . 
<br>
humans have had to be their own predators for a long enough time for 
<br>
conditional gene based psychological mechanisms to evolve.
<br>
<p>If you are going to even consider &quot;collective volition&quot; and don't want 
<br>
wars, then you are going to have to rewire these  &quot;go to war when times 
<br>
look bad&quot; mechanisms out of humans or keep them out of bad economic 
<br>
times--forever.
<br>
<p>I have no idea of what side effect rewiring would cause.  It might be a 
<br>
very bad idea.
<br>
<p>At the root of these mechanisms is the tendency for human populations to 
<br>
grow beyond their ecological limits.  In the west, productivity has stayed 
<br>
ahead of population growth for such a long time that few are aware of 
<br>
it.  But the mechanism is resurgent whenever there is an economic contraction.
<br>
<p>Since the privation that turns on &quot;collective volition&quot; to wars is 
<br>
ultimately driven by population growth, an AI that was trying to keep away 
<br>
from this mode would have to strongly limit births--to very low levels for 
<br>
immortal populations.
<br>
<p>If humans were given a choice between wars and population restrictions 
<br>
I  wonder what the choice would be?  No doubt it would vary with cultures.
<br>

<br>
<p>PS.  With respect to the dangers of AI, friendly or not, I no longer think 
<br>
anyone on this group has a handle on the problem.  I am not absolutely sure 
<br>
there even is a problem, but if there is I would say we are all some 
<br>
distance from understanding it.
