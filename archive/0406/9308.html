<p>
CV is a fascinating idea, like I said, but even after
<br>
thinking longer, faster etc I SILL don't think it's
<br>
possible, even in principle.  My current volition is
<br>
an extrapolation of the volition of my old self that
<br>
first read the CV document.  And this extrapolated
<br>
volition still says its impossible ;)
<br>
<p>I think the doubters are likely to be right.  Just too
<br>
much data, not even coherence and I don't think even a
<br>
single person's volition can be found, even in
<br>
principle, without running an actual simulation of
<br>
their brain state (which would defeat the purpose
<br>
because the simulation would be conscious).
<br>
<p>If we rule out CV as a global system, we have to ask
<br>
what other global system might be more practical.  I
<br>
favor demarchy.  Yes, I'm back to speculating about
<br>
what would be a 'nice place to live' ;)   (Marc looks
<br>
sheepish)
<br>
<p>Here's what I speculating an FAI might do:  Give each
<br>
'person'  rights according to their cognitive
<br>
abilites.  By 'cognitive abilities' I am not just
<br>
referring to IQ, I'm referring to the totality of
<br>
cognitive abilities (emotional experiences,
<br>
creativity, etc etc).  The advantage of this system is
<br>
that all forms of sentience can be included; animals,
<br>
dolphins, FAI's, cyborgs, you name it.  Each is given
<br>
rights according to their capacity for cognition. 
<br>
Animals would have only a little say, but still some. 
<br>
Humans would have more say.  And super-human FAI's
<br>
would have much more say.  
<br>
<p>So rather than FAI being a non-sentient optimization
<br>
process leading to CV, I am proposing a more human
<br>
like sentient FAI using an altruistic human with
<br>
transpersonal philosophy as a template, which I think
<br>
might then implement a global demarchy.
<br>
<p>Initally the FAI would have the majority of the voting
<br>
power in the demarchy, since it's cognitive abilities
<br>
are likely to exceed those of all the other sentients
<br>
on the planet combined.  But then as people are
<br>
offered uplifting, they will be entitled to expanded
<br>
rights (and hence more voting power).  Over time (as
<br>
humanity 'grows up' via uplifting ) the demarchy moves
<br>
in the direction of standard democracy as the voting
<br>
power moves away from the original FAI and shifts back
<br>
to the uplifted humans.
<br>
<p>A more practical possibility than Collective Volition?
