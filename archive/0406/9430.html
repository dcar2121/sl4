</em><br>
<em>&gt; the following additional conditions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. There's an open discussion prior to the experiment in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we explore various arguments for and against letting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI out of the box.  It seems reasonable that a group like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI would have such a debate before sending the Gatekeeper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off to watch the box.  (I believe this has been suggested before)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. As a group, we decide who the Gatekeeper will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>1.  That's an interesting new proposition, but I don't need outside
<br>
funding.  I can go higher on my own to make it worth his while, and I'll
<br>
still give 10 to 1 odds.  Eliezer can name the amount that he wants to
<br>
wager, up to $250, and I'll cover it 10 to 1, up to $2500.  And he can
<br>
hold the whole purse until it's concluded and one of us takes it all.  I
<br>
originally proposed this in the spirit that it started, as more or less
<br>
a gentleman's wager, but if it helps to back up my assertion with
<br>
serious cash, I'm willing to do so.
<br>
2.  The limit is preset at 2 hours, only changeable by mutual consent.
<br>
If Eliezer doesn't want it to go longer than 2 hours, then nothing is
<br>
forcing him to agree to extend it.  Personally I don't want to extend it
<br>
&quot;for a lot longer than 2 hours&quot;, and don't expect to agree to such an
<br>
extension either, although that's not part of the bet.  I actually
<br>
expect that Eliezer will concede before the 2 hours is over.
<br>
3.  There is no way I can be convinced to let the AI out.  I already
<br>
have sufficient reasons (and the bet has nothing to do with it).  I have
<br>
the proof written down, and I'll show it privately to whoever Eliezer
<br>
thinks would be able to verify that it's a reasonable approach.  I would
<br>
ask that this person only announce their opinion as &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;not
<br>
reasonable&quot;, with no further feedback to Eliezer, myself, or anyone
<br>
else.  The wager is not based on their opinion but on the actual 2-hour
<br>
test, if Eliezer chooses to participate.
<br>
4.  I fully understand if Eliezer chooses not to go for it, not only
<br>
because of his work, but because he has already proven his point twice
<br>
before and he has little reason to believe that this time will be any
<br>
different.  It's entirely his choice.  However, I don't wish to
<br>
participate with a substitute, because it would prove nothing to win
<br>
that contest.  Unless Eliezer agrees in advance to participate if I can
<br>
beat the substitute.
<br>
5.  If Eliezer still declines to participate after reading this offer,
<br>
then all bets are off, and I'll go ahead and post my proof, and we can
<br>
all discuss it openly anyway.  But since Eliezer keeps his escape
<br>
techniques secret, the rest of us will never know for sure whether he
<br>
could have escaped the cage or not.
