</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I detect the smoke of confusion from some readers of
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?CollectiveVolition">http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?CollectiveVolition</a> and suspect it is caused by a
<br>
part of Eliezer's article that I also found confusing.  Let me lay it out
<br>
for you...
<br>
<p>Collective volition (CV) defined as &quot;our wish&quot; or &quot;a theory about what
<br>
people want&quot; seems a clear definition, and relatively easy to grasp as an
<br>
idea.  Eliezer's article  discusses how we might think about what humans
<br>
want, both individually and as a group.  It proposes measures (eg: distance,
<br>
muddle, spread, coherence) that might assist us in this endeavour.  These
<br>
ideas seem to be quite useful in enabling clearer thought about people's
<br>
desires for the future.
<br>
<p>However, the article doesn't stick with this definition of CV, but attempts
<br>
to broaden it starting in the section titled &quot;Collective volition is an
<br>
initial dynamic.&quot;  This broadening of the definition seems confusing.  It
<br>
muddies the definition as initially presented, and conflates the measurement
<br>
aspect of CV with activities that might be taken toward reaching some of the
<br>
goals identified by our CV.
<br>
<p>AFAIK the 'initial dynamic' portrayed in the article is SIAI's first working
<br>
version of Friendly AI: call it FAIv1.  One of FAIv1's first jobs (as
<br>
presented in the article) will be to find out what we want - to obtain
<br>
first-hand data.  Once obtained this data would be a set of models defined
<br>
as: our CV at that point in time.  When Eliezer writes in the article:
<br>
<p>&quot;If there is some chain of moral logic so self-evident that any human who
<br>
hears with open mind must follow, then that is what the initial dynamic of
<br>
collective volition would produce on the next round.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is a bit confusing... so in my mind, I translate it to read:
<br>
<p>&quot;If there is some chain of moral logic so self-evident that any human who
<br>
hears with open mind must follow, then that is what ** FAIv1, having
<br>
obtained our collective volition readout, would incorporate into its moral
<br>
logic ** on the next round.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is confusing to talk about CV *doing* something.  CV is data used by FAI
<br>
to help figure out what humans *want* to do.  The 'optimization process'
<br>
then has to figure out just how to get from the existing situation to a
<br>
desired future situation, without 'breaking any eggs'.
