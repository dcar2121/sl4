Eliezer:
<br>
<p>You say that you don't have any idea what I mean by &quot;sentience.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you check out dictionary.com or any other dictionary you will get the
<br>
basic idea.  I'm not being flippant.  As inspection of any dictionary
<br>
indicates, the concept wraps up two different ideas, which I feel belong
<br>
together, but you may feel do not belong together.
<br>
<p>One core meaning of sentience is:
<br>
<p>1) &quot;Being an intelligent system that contains components devoted to
<br>
modeling and understanding itself and its relationship to its
<br>
environment, and determining its own overall actions.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Another core meaning of sentience is:
<br>
<p>2) &quot;Possessing conscious awareness&quot; 
<br>
<p>Note that 2 may be made empirical by changing it into: 
<br>
<p>2') &quot;Reports experiencing conscious awareness&quot;
<br>
<p>I separate 2 and 2' in order to dissociate the issue of the coherence of
<br>
the notion of sentience, from the issue of the &quot;reality&quot; of
<br>
consciousness.  If you are not comfortable with the notion of
<br>
consciousness, you should still be comfortable with 2', the notion of
<br>
reported consciousness.
<br>
<p>According to my own philosophy of mind, I think any system that is
<br>
&quot;sentient&quot; in sense 1 is almost surely going to be sentient in senses 2
<br>
and 2'.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if you believe that there are probably going to be
<br>
systems that are intelligent, self-modeling, self-understanding and
<br>
self-determining yet do NOT report having the experience of
<br>
consciousness, then naturally you're going to find the concept of
<br>
sentience to be ill-defined, because you don't consider the two meanings
<br>
1 and 2/2' to naturally adhere together.
<br>
<p>I think that, although you may disagree with it, you should have no
<br>
problem understanding the hypothesis that
<br>
<p>1 ==&gt; 2
<br>
<p>in the above definitions.  Of course, this is a conceptual rather than
<br>
fully scientifically/mathematically specified statement.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; About this idea of creating a non-sentient optimization process, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A) predict possible futures for the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; B) analyze the global human psyche and figure out the &quot;collective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; volition&quot; of humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instead of creating a superhuman mind....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't say it's impossible that this would work.   It goes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific intuition, which says that sentience of some sort would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; almost surely be needed to achieve these things, but my scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intuition could be wrong.  Also, my notion of &quot;sentience of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may grow and become more flexible as more AGI and AGI-ish systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become available for interaction!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not the vaguest idea of what you mean by &quot;sentience&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposing reflectivity - superhuman reflectivity, in fact.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why are you so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrified at my proposing to omit something if you do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean by the term, let alone what I mean by it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, it does seem to me that either problem A or B above is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significantly more difficult than creating a self-modifying AGI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system. Again, I could be wrong on this, but ... Sheesh.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, saving the world is significantly more difficult than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blowing it up. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would rise to the challenge, raise the level of my game 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change the default destiny of a seed AI researcher, rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than walking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the whirling razor blades of which I was once ignorant.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you decide that the challenge is beyond you, for yes, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is difficult. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it is harder to understand why you are still on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing field, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endangering yourself and others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To create a self-modifying AGI system, at very worst one has to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand the way the human brain works, and then emulate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like it in a more mutably self-modifiable medium such as computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; software.  This is NOT the approach I'm taking with Novamente; I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just pointing it out to place a bound on the difficulty of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-modifying AGI system.  The biggest &quot;in principle&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obstacle here 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that it could conceivably require insanely much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational power 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -- or quantum computing, quantum gravity computing, etc. -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get AGI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to work at the human level (for example, if the microtubule 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is right).  Even so, then we just have the engineering problem of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creating a more mutable substrate than human brain tissue, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reimplementing human brain algorithms within it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, the task of creating a non-sentient optimization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process of the sort you describe is a lot more nebulous (due to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lack of even partially relevant examples to work from).  Yeah, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principle it's easy to create optimization processes of arbitrary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power -- so long as one isn't concerned about memory or processor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; usage.  But contemporary science tells us basically NOTHING 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to make uber-optimization-processes like the one you're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envisioning.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ONLY guidance it gives us in this direction, pertains 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;how to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; build a sentience that can act as a very powerful optimization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I've got no clue what you mean by 'non-sentient'.  I was still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planning on using recursive self-improvement, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-modification, total 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-access or &quot;autopotence&quot; in Nick Bostrom's phrase, full 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflectivity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; et cetera.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, it seems to me that you're banking on creating a whole 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new branch 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of science basically from nothing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not from nothing.  Plenty of precedents, even if they are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely known.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whereas to create AGI one MAY not need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to do that, one may only need to &quot;fix&quot; the existing sciences of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;cognitive science&quot; and AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does that mean that you'll create something without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding how it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works?  Whirling razor blades, here we come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that, even if what you're suggesting is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible (which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I really doubt), you're almost certain to be beaten in the race by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone working to build a sentient AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;sentient AGI&quot; you mean recursive self-improvement thrown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random, which of course will be sentient whatever that means, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are sentient therefore so must be an AGI?  Or is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience just this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holy and mysterious power that you don't know how it works, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is important, so I'm committing blasphemy by suggesting that I not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include it, whatever it is?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, I don't see how anyone can make this huge fuss 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over sentience in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI when you don't know how it works and you can't give me a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walkthrough of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it produces useful outputs.  I have a few small ideas about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-understood architectural quirks that give humans the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious, architectural quirks to which I applied the term 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sentience&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evidently this was a huge mistake.  I hereby announce my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intent to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-floogly AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Therefore, to succeed with this new plan, you'll probably need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; create some kind of fascist state in which working on AGI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is illegal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and punishable by death, imprisonment or lobotomy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe that's what you'd do in my shoes.  My brilliant new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand what I am doing, rather than randomly guessing, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see if that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lets me finish my work before the meddling dabblers blow up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident.  Though in your case it does begin to border on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being on purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sentient&quot;, &quot;non-sentient&quot;, this is phlogiston, Greek 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot argue about something you do not understand, mystical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substances and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical properties of mystical systems.  I intend to unravel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sacred 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystery of flooginess, which I have already come far enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to declare as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-mysterious target.  Then, having unravelled it, I will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either know how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build a non-floogly optimization process, or I will know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in detail why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floogling is necessary.  I am only announcing my moral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference in favor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of non-floogly optimization processes.  I won't definitely say it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible or impossible until I know in more detail where the present 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion comes from, and I certainly don't intend to make up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campfire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories about the mystical powers of floogly systems until I can do a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walkthrough of how they work.  Do a walkthrough, not tell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  As far as I can guess, the whole thing will turn out to be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion, probably a very interesting confusion, but a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion nonetheless.
