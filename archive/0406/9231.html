<em>&gt;&gt; You're asking good questions, and the process of asking these

<em>&gt;&gt; solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The vector sum of current human volition is not wisdom.  It's not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even an early approximation of wisdom.  In fact, it's currently badly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; skewed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no such thing as the vector sum of &quot;current human volition&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are speaking of the vector sum of &quot;current human *decision*&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which, I quite agree, would be disastrous to hook up to an SI (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RPOP).  A volition is extrapolated beyond the self of this moment; a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *collective* volition extrapolates a planet beyond the selves of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment, and cannot be regarded as a vector sum of individual volitions.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;volition:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The act or an instance of making a conscious choice or decision.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A conscious choice or decision.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The power or faculty of choosing; the will.
<br>
<p>I understand your point, emphasizing the future sense as it entails the 
<br>
extrapolation to which you refer.
<br>
<p>I meant volition in the more abstract sense, emphasizing the faculty of 
<br>
choosing, the will, as represented by a set of vectors.
<br>
<p>Okay, onward then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The vector sum of current human volition does not represent wisdom, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; let alone embody wisdom. Acting as if it did would invite disaster, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; given the current state of human development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, provided that you are talking about the vector sum of current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human decision.
</em><br>
<p>I think we can agree on this using either sense of the word volition, as 
<br>
discussed above.  Either a reference to an extrapolated act of will as 
<br>
you seem to prefer, or the current faculty of will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The answers you seek do not exist yet, no matter how deeply and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; widely one might be able to probe the collective human psyche.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You cannot read out the volition from an LED display on the back of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone's neck; it has to be extrapolated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Decision is not volition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Volition is not decision.
</em><br>
<p>I was refering to a representation of the faculty of will, which we can 
<br>
expect to be exercised in the future, and which can be measured and 
<br>
represented in various dimensions by testing what *decisions* an 
<br>
individual makes in the present.  Key: Volition accurately represented 
<br>
with no extrapolation involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There are no pointers, maps, or transformations of this collective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; data that could be directly applied to the solution you (we all) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seek.   The current data set is strongly skewed toward short term, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; local scope thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I had any doubt before that you were speaking of &quot;decision&quot; rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than &quot;volition&quot;, it would be gone now.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think we should be clear now about these terms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The answers do not exist in the current data set but we can expect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they will emerge only as part and result of the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...the process which a &quot;collective volition&quot; attempts to extrapolate, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, that is the whole idea of collective volition, getting an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolated approximate satisficing advance answer to the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, wisdom is present within the collective landscape, but most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humanity perceive and consider only a small portion of the whole, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the answers you seek within it require a broader scope of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence.  The seeds exist but they have not yet grown, and it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; impossible to see the tree without planting, nurturing, and waiting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for the seeds to grow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you know this... how?  It sounds very wise and I suspect it simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't true.
</em><br>
<p>The attempt to extrapolate collective human volition is futile because 
<br>
of the inherent complexity of the object(s) to be modeled, and the 
<br>
fundamentally unknowable environmental factors that define the evolving 
<br>
context within which human volition operates.  The ensuing combinatorial 
<br>
explosion and cumulative error is my point, and I therefore encourage 
<br>
you to consider contributing to the science of understanding such 
<br>
complex systems from a bottoms-up approach by way of discovery and 
<br>
utilization of general principles rather than attemping to extrapolate 
<br>
to a higher-level from which to exert influence.
<br>
<p>Now let me turn your question back to you: How do you think you can 
<br>
accomplish such extrapolation with useful accuracy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To model the collective volition of humanity is a worthy goal, not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extract from it the ideal human volition, or even an a starting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; approximation of the ideal, but for the purpose of better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; understanding and contributing to the process that will get us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wherever we will be in the future.  There is much work that can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; done to improve the process of humanity getting closer to its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolving goals, but progress will be made by building upon the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; foundations of morality rather than futilely preparing to prune a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unique and yet unknown tree when it is still a seed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A collective volition doesn't prune.  It extrapolates and superposes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainties.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, well, it was a metaphor intended to convey an simple abstract 
<br>
concept, not a statement to be validated.  To be perfectly forthcoming, 
<br>
the metaphor of the seed was actually a seed itself, intended to take 
<br>
root in the mind of the reader and facilitate the coherence of 
<br>
associated thoughts.  Definitely not to be taken literally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What is moral, in the minds of people of disparate backgrounds, tends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to converge as their understanding and interests broaden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an assertion that the *collective volition* tends to cohere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than the vector sum of decisions.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's more than the static view that you express here.  I mean it 
<br>
in the sense of an observation about the tendencies of a set of dynamic 
<br>
and ongoing processes.  It loses all meaning if taken in the sense of a 
<br>
snapshot evaluation.  I really need to find some time to translate this  
<br>
&quot;Arrow of morality&quot; concept into terms that are less mystical-sounding 
<br>
and with mathematical backup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As the scope expands to include broader space of interaction, broader 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; range of interacting parties, and broader time period being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; considered, &quot;what is moral&quot;, tends to converge into an ever clearer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sense of shared direction.  You can only get there by performing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interactions -- a model of sufficient accuracy would take just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; long to run the simulation as the reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I think this sounds wise and simply isn't true.  Here you are, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making all sorts of abstract predictions about the collective volition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without running the simulation!
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, you really got me there.  Your mama too!  Please see my point 
<br>
earlier about combinatorial explosion and cumulative error, and my 
<br>
question back to you about how you hope to achieve usefully accurate 
<br>
extrapolation under these conditions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; -- but you can extract principles of successful interactions along 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the way and apply these principles toward &quot;promoting the good.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
