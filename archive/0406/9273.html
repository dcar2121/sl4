<em>&gt; Actually, I also would currently say that I want to grow up slowly.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that the decision as to whether the decision should be made by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current volitions should be made by our extrapolated volitions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to be visualizing something considerably &quot;off&quot; from what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting - i.e., forced transcendence as an immediate direct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of collective volition, some independent all-powerful being rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparent optimization process.  Have you read the Collective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Volition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; document?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; No, I am handing the decision off to an abstract invariant that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolates the collective volition of humankind to produce a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secondary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic that returns a decision.  I don't know what the decision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just know that the collective volition of humankind, which is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superposed spreads, will be satisficed by the choice of decision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is used to make the decision.  Oh, and I know that the Last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Judge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't throw the off switch on it.
</em><br>
<p>I think I'm gonna try to lump my thoughts into one section, as so we
<br>
don't form several different &quot;threads&quot; within a thread itself.
<br>
<p>Okay, I've read a good portion of it. I think I get the general gist:
<br>
<p>Collective volition = a  democracy via a extrapolated post-humanity's
<br>
will
<br>
<p>A big reason I tend to disagree with this is that with a Friendly SYSOP,
<br>
a governmental system like the USA is no longer needed to sustain
<br>
society. Are you trying to justify collective volition as some sort of
<br>
replacement because of the absence of a discernable moral absolute i.e
<br>
majority equals moral power?
<br>
<p>Sure, the idea of the individual is a slightly murky concept. But if
<br>
there's no defined point of a distinction with individualism, how could
<br>
there be a &quot;majority&quot; for a collective volition? Where do you begin to
<br>
start count?
<br>
<p>Shouldn't it be that person's right as their current self to determine
<br>
their future?
<br>
<p>I don't see the NEED for this. I recall you once commenting in a
<br>
interview how you thought a man eating Pringles while watching football
<br>
was &quot;dystopian&quot;.  What's wrong with a Friendly SYSOP scenario?  Do you
<br>
think the SYSOP scenario is dystopian?
