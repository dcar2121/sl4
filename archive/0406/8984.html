Hi Eliezer,  
<br>
<p>I think it's fine for people to have a strong ego and be at ease with 
<br>
being bright/clever/brilliant.  But over-weening arrogance can take 
<br>
clever people into unproductive modes of operation.
<br>
<p>Over-weening arrogance can block useful collaboration because some 
<br>
other people find it quite off-putting.
<br>
<p>It can block communication of good ideas from the brilliant one to 
<br>
others for the same reason.
<br>
<p>It can cause the brilliant one to be less inclined to question their own 
<br>
thinking *where other people raise issues* - which is bad for science.
<br>
<p>It can attract followers who are less thoughtful because they like 
<br>
basking in the brilliance of their guru.
<br>
<p>It can attract followers who are not as brilliant but who like being 
<br>
arrogant too and take the cue from their arrogant guru to behave 
<br>
similarly, even though they are less justified in having such a good 
<br>
option of themselves.
<br>
<p>In my experience, clever people are not always clever *all* the time 
<br>
and are not always right *all* the time.  So it is very useful for clever 
<br>
people to be mindful of that and open to other people's ideas and 
<br>
reactions which may alert the brilliant ones to errors, gaps, and 
<br>
occasionally less than brilliant ideas.  I think it is hard to be in mindful 
<br>
mode and over-weening arrogance mode at the same time - even for 
<br>
clever people who can multitask.
<br>
<p>So if getting the science as good as it can be is a priority and doing it 
<br>
fast is important then some moderation in arrogance might be helpful.
<br>
<p>And also an organisation that is dominated by somebody who is 
<br>
uncontrollably and severely arrogant is likely to develop disfunctional 
<br>
tendencies that can cause it to perform suboptimally and thus 
<br>
jeopardise its mission.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
<br>
