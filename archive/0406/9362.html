<em>&gt;  Ok, I will briefly take the bait, o dharma brother...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Clearly, human life as a whole isn't very well described by your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  phrase &quot;constant pleasure, but ... varying degrees of pleasure.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>True, I recognized that it wasn't well described, but for the sake of 
<br>
brevity, I did let that stand as written since the underlying principle 
<br>
is the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hence the well-known Buddhist dictum, &quot;All existence is suffering.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is true, in the context that all sentient existence involves *some* 
<br>
&quot;suffering&quot; related to displacement from a desired condition.  The 
<br>
wisdom of this statement supports that it's naive to think that constant 
<br>
pleasure is practical or attainable.  What I didn't spell out, assuming 
<br>
it was implied, is that &quot;constant pleasure&quot; simply resets the baseline.  
<br>
As I said earlier, it's the getting there that gives pleasure, not the 
<br>
having.   It's the differential that matters.  For electronic geeks, 
<br>
it's AC coupled, dude.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But perhaps a  more appropriate Buddhist quote, paraphrased, is &quot;pain 
<br>
is a given, suffering is optional.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Perhaps your phrase describes YOUR life reasonably well. If so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you're a fortunate dude.
</em><br>
<p><p>Interesting statement.  We could talk privately about some very painful 
<br>
stuff I've dealt with over the decades, mainly from marrying into a 
<br>
chronically dysfunctional family, but my point would be that no matter 
<br>
how much it hurt at the moment, I always saw it as a positive learning 
<br>
experience.  Fortunately, and exceptionally (I realize) I have always 
<br>
seen my own pain and suffering from a kind of third-person point of view 
<br>
that puts a lot of things into a useful perspective.  I seriously 
<br>
studied zen in my twenties (somewhat concurrently with reading the 
<br>
just-released and fabulous Godel, Escher, and Bach, Buckminster Fuller's 
<br>
Synergetics, Daniel Dennett, Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, and many other 
<br>
influential works that convinced me that we are indeed immersed in a 
<br>
dependable reality, that it's certainly not what it appears, but that we 
<br>
can do best by successively improving our understanding of what we are 
<br>
and what works.  At a certain point, I had an experience I describe as 
<br>
&quot;going into the void and coming out the other side&quot; that has left me 
<br>
with a lasting feeling of compassion with unattachment (more or less).
<br>
<p>(The above should make me a little clearer on various targeting 
<br>
screens.)  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It describes my life during its best intervals. It doesn't do much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  justice to the experience of the average Sudanese right now, or say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the average Afghani soldier.... Alas, even as a spoiled middle-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  American I've had many life experiences that don't match this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  description too well, such as serious auto accidents, divorce,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  colitis ... I'll refrain from boring you with the full list....
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't denying that people live in pain, but only that life of 
<br>
constant bliss is ultimately life without meaning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The phenomenology of pleasure and pain are somewhat subtle. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Nietzsche and many others have pointed out, pleasure and pain are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  exactly opposites. It may be possible to eliminate pain from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experience of intelligent beings without reducing everything to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  massive undifferentiated orgasmo-tinuum.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this, and appreciate the progress that we continue to make 
<br>
reducing pain from the human experience.
<br>
<p>Then we would be left with
<br>
<em>&gt;  your hypothesized phenomenology of &quot;constant pleasure ... but varying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  degrees of pleasure... such that we are motivated...&quot; Sounds good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to me!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -- Ben G
</em><br>
<p>What I enjoy most about this list, and a few others, is that the members 
<br>
are generally motivated to improving our understanding and our lives.  
<br>
At the same time, it is clear that some are strongly motivated (usually 
<br>
transparently to themselves) by pain from their past.  The 
<br>
one-upsmanship,  sarcasm,  arrogance, even idealistic fixations, that we 
<br>
see are all symptoms of pain and anger (among this demographic set, 
<br>
often from feeling misunderstood and unappreciated as a child) that 
<br>
while certainly motivating, get in the way of the clear value judgments 
<br>
that constitute wisdom.
