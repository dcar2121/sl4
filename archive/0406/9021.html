<em>&gt; When my managers first came back from the Far East they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shell-shocked. Especially Singapore and Japan. They reported that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had never seen anything like the almost feral intelligence of the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there. 5 day courses were completed in 1 to 2 days. They just sat like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sponges soaking up all the information. The programming done was to a
</em><br>
<p>This is an example of discipline, not intelligence. Discipline at these high
<br>
levels, if anything, prevents creative intelligence and blocks a balanced
<br>
emotional development (which is why japanese schoolgirls get attacked by
<br>
tentacles and american schoolgirls don't...).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our volition will disappear in the sum of the world volition. (Unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you assume that all the disagreeing volitions are primitive and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated and advanced would agree with us !?).
</em><br>
<p>Our standard for education and advancement would require them to agree with
<br>
us on certain points. Would you judge a terrorist &quot;finally educated&quot; if
<br>
after 10 years of intensive training he STILL believes that suicide bombing
<br>
is ok?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Third World has a ferocious intelligence which is mostly intent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing their enemies before their enemies kill them. Individuals will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill themselves if it kills more of their enemies in the process.
</em><br>
<p>Some of the intelligence in the world is not being put to good use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a summation is taken of world volition, this will be very significant.
</em><br>
<p>I made this point when we first started to discuss objective morality; just
<br>
averaging out individual volitions won't work since everyone wants very
<br>
different things. Now, Elizier is proposing that the AI simulates what they
<br>
would want if they were smarter, but a valid point has been raised as to
<br>
whether you'd actually be able to convince these people that the
<br>
extrapolated volition was actually theirs. A child is constantly told: when
<br>
you grow up you will understand. But this does not make this child
<br>
understand. Children still disagree with adults, and are forced to comply.
