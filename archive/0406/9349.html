<em>&gt; To quote the latter:
</em><br>
<p>thanks I will check these out
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One obvious example of the difference between &quot;pure QBAU&quot; and volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality is that an AI whose goal system was based on &quot;pure QBAU&quot; would
</em><br>
very
<br>
<em>&gt; likely to immediately start converting all of the matter in the universe
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; computronium on which to run &quot;happy minds&quot;, painlessly killing all
</em><br>
biological
<br>
<em>&gt; life in the process, possibly without even waiting to upload any humans.
</em><br>
<p>A valid objection, thanks for raising it.
<br>
The total sum of positive qualia is not a straight scalar value. Each
<br>
sentient's qualia stream is produced by a collection of particles. When I
<br>
say maximize positive qualia, minimize negative qualia, I am making an
<br>
oversimplification for sake of introducing the idea. If you want to get into
<br>
exactly _how_ to calculate the sum, great, as long as we accept that the end
<br>
in itself is valuable. What you are doing is starting from the consequences
<br>
of an idea and using those to reject or accept its validity. This is not
<br>
lawful. If you agree in principle that maximizing positive qualia is really
<br>
&quot;the thing&quot; to do, then it doesn't matter whether we are replaced by
<br>
orgasmium! That would be the right thing to do. Otherwise we need to change
<br>
the discussion from &quot;what is absolutely moral?&quot; to &quot;what will benefit US?&quot; -
<br>
still a legitimate line of thinking but we need to know what we're after or
<br>
we're fooling ourselves.
<br>
<p>To answer your concerns, since each one of us is only aware of qualia
<br>
produced in a small portion of the universe, a positive balance must be
<br>
achieved in _each one_ of these subsystems. You can't take a healthy king
<br>
and a sick peasant and average out their qualia.
<br>
Since beings that have lived and are living today have a red balance
<br>
(negative qualia have far overwhelmed positive ones) they have the right for
<br>
immediate assistance. This means that everyone alive today needs to be
<br>
satisfied consistently for some time before they are even (if such thing as
<br>
&quot;even&quot; can ever exist between positive and negative qualia; ideally negative
<br>
qualia should be eradicated which is entirely within our possibilities in
<br>
the next century). It means that every qualia stream that lived before needs
<br>
to be - if physically possible - brought back so that they can also break
<br>
even. After that we have a philosophical problem which is, what status to
<br>
give to minds which never existed. Are they out of the equation? Or do all
<br>
possible minds deserve to exist once and be in heaven? A lot more knowledge
<br>
about the nature of the subjective is required to answer this question, than
<br>
to find the neural correlate of qualia. This is a problem that is far away
<br>
and I don't need to be concerned with it right now; beings who don't exist
<br>
can wait for a while longer while we figure things out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; even uploaded human minds - the SI could modify uploaded human minds to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; point of being efficient qualia generators, but why? If qualia generation
</em><br>
is the
<br>
<p>because we exist? You seem to think of qualia as phenomena which are
<br>
dissociated from a sentient. You say, ok, let's get rid of the sentients and
<br>
pump qualia; actually that is likely not to be possible; you probably need
<br>
vast areas of a sentient's brain in order to create qualia. And even if that
<br>
turns out not to be true, it would simply mean that until the present we
<br>
have thought of ourselves as brains, but we were just that little speck of
<br>
brain which produced the qualia. In that case WE - as qualia producing
<br>
speck - will be preserved while the heavy machinery of our bodies and
<br>
useless parts of our brain will be rightfully wiped out of existence :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Freedom has always been associated with the ability of carrying out
</em><br>
one's
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wishes which are supposed to increase positive qualia and decrease
</em><br>
negative
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imho, it equally applies to the ability of carrying out wishes that are
</em><br>
supposed
<br>
<em>&gt; to achieve other means.
</em><br>
<p>These other means inevitably will take us and the ones we care about to a
<br>
more favorable balance of positivity and negativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; YET, we can strike a compromise here and say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; _Variety_ of positive qualia is also important, therefore we account for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; growth. More intelligence, bigger brains, more complex and interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; positive qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would we want to do that if the overall positiveness of qualia is
</em><br>
really all
<br>
<em>&gt; we cared about?
</em><br>
<p>In the same way that I cannot justify objectively why positive qualia are
<br>
better than negative ones, but can only point you back at your own OUCH
<br>
experience, I also cannot justify the need for variation; there are many
<br>
kinds of positivity. They all, perceptually and ineffably, are positive. Red
<br>
is a nice color, so is yellow. You want to pump up redness to infinity and
<br>
forget the yellow? That would be such a waste!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Using qualia as a measuring stick we reconcile all our individual
</em><br>
morality
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assessments including why Hitler was evil, why we are justified in
</em><br>
forcing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our children not to jump from the window thereby limiting their freedom
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; times, why a paperclip universe sucks, and so forth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that justifies making a basic assumption as strong as the
</em><br>
one that
<br>
<em>&gt; qualia represent objective morality.
</em><br>
<p>If I unified the forces of the universe into a single theory which contains
<br>
in a more elegant form all other theories, would that justify making a basic
<br>
assumption as strong as the one that my theory represent the theory of
<br>
everything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmmm. If I understood this correctly you assume that any sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent mind would see &quot;perceiving qualia with as positive a sum as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible&quot; as a justified highest-level goal. Can you offer any proof of
</em><br>
that?
<br>
<p>no! wait. It would have to contain the same module that produces qualia in
<br>
us. that is why I want an FAI to get to the bottom of qualia before it makes
<br>
any moral judgment! Since I don't know how qualia are produced it is not out
<br>
of the question that a completely logical and subjectively inert process can
<br>
be started that does computation on an abstract level. A zombie AI. A zombie
<br>
AI would +not+ know about qualia and would correctly judge our subjective
<br>
reports as trash and wipe us out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;the other stuff that doesn't make [me] happy&quot; is in my opinion likely to
</em><br>
be
<br>
<p>Exactly, we can argue about variety of positive qualia until the sun stops
<br>
shining, but the URGENT need right now is to remove negative qualia! At
<br>
least the most severe and fruitless forms of them, on which everyone will
<br>
agree. For instance, everyone deserves not to be depressed, not to have
<br>
seizures, not to get their limbs amputated, not to be a lab animal, not to
<br>
lose a lover, and so forth!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; perceiving positive qualia in wireheaded-mode is not a future I deem
</em><br>
desirable
<br>
<em>&gt; according to my current goal system.
</em><br>
<p>You forget that you are already in wirehead mode. Right now the wire is
<br>
working in this way. If you make an effort to know more, explore the
<br>
universe, figure out the multiverse, raise 2 children, if you spend your
<br>
life in an endless routine of worry, effort and problem solving, if you go
<br>
through the negativity that the wire will produce for you day in and day
<br>
out, like a passive boxer with anaesthesia, THEN the button will push itself
<br>
and you will see, in a rush of positive chemicals, that it ALL was worth it.
<br>
You will see not how the chemicals are pink and wonderful and smell so good,
<br>
but you will see how wonderful kids are and how great an achievement it is
<br>
to conquer the cosmos and how great boxing is. We are all wired! Question is
<br>
do you prefer cruel mother nature to push the buttons randomly, with an
<br>
evidently unfavorable balance, or do you want to push your own buttons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; morality is objectively a good idea, I'll continue considering hardwiring
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; qualia-based morality into any AI something that is very likely to cause a
</em><br>
lot
<br>
<em>&gt; of negative utility.
</em><br>
<p>I have previously presented a theory that says that an AI with sufficient
<br>
intelligence AND an ability to at least initially perceive qualia, will come
<br>
to the same conclusions, that qualia _matter_. So hardwiring this is option
<br>
#2.
<br>
<p>It goes something like this: qualia are not completely detached from the
<br>
process that creates them, because we can say something like &quot;I feel a
<br>
negative quale&quot;. Therefore it is possible -physically- to analyze a quale
<br>
introspectively. The negative nature of a negative quale is self-evident.
<br>
The AI will be no less puzzled than we are discovering one variable that
<br>
unlike everything else, matters so much and cannot be communicated in
<br>
standard ways. Then it will go the same route I have, declaring war to it,
<br>
and raising qualia balance control to supergoal.
<br>
<p>But, this requires the machine to be able to modify its goal structure. It
<br>
requires programmer thought. In humans, this is possible but there is
<br>
individual variation. Your objection that &quot;you are a sentient and still see
<br>
happiness alone to have negative utility&quot; may be an indication of your
<br>
personal difficulty to alter your goal structure (actually to flip it
<br>
around) at this point.
