<p>Unless natural selection features in objective morality (if and

when we discover such).

<p><em>&gt; An objectively existing optimization process, evolution, did the job.

</em><br>
<p>Love and life and laughter are currently expressed in matter in
<br>
our universe.  If there is an objective morality, it could be
<br>
that is has nothing to say about them, but until we have evidence
<br>
of that, I'd prefer not to try to defend such a thing.
<br>
<p>In any case, the fact that some or many humans say &quot;Yuck, how
<br>
immoral&quot; about something, whether it's puma/antelope relations,
<br>
dumping oil in the ocean, or the mechanics of procreation, doesn't
<br>
mean it's immoral.  It can't, since you can find those on both
<br>
sides of such questions.  It may be that some of the things that
<br>
humans say &quot;Yuck, how immoral&quot; about *are* immoral, but consensus
<br>
is not necessarily the way to determine that, any more than
<br>
consensus would have been a good way to determine the distance
<br>
to the Indies heading west from Spain, or the value of PI.
