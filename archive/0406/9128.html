<p>
*The implied enormous complexity required to compute
<br>
such a thing.
<br>
<p>*A proposed 'optimization process' wholly new to
<br>
science with no working examples and little
<br>
theoretical basis
<br>
<p>*The possibility that the volition does not cohere
<br>
<p>*The possibility that individual volitions cannot be
<br>
computed without the simulations becoming sentient
<br>
<p>*Serious unanswered questions about 'Person-hood' and
<br>
'Sentience'.  Why do people think that they have
<br>
'Qualia'?  What constitutes a 'Person'?  What if a
<br>
non-sentient FAI capable of computing 'Collective
<br>
Volition' is impossible?  With no precise definition
<br>
of 'sentience', why should the FAI itself not qualify
<br>
as a 'sentient' at some point?  Why are the cognitive
<br>
processes of the FAI excluded from moral calculations,
<br>
and if the FAI does include its own volition in future
<br>
iterations isn't the result infinite regress?
<br>
<p>*Quasi-totalitarian worries.  Why should the
<br>
collective volition give good results?  Isn't there a
<br>
possibility of running rough-shod over individual
<br>
rights?  If the extrapolated volition is too different
<br>
from the original volition wouldn't it be perceived as
<br>
something alien and invasive?  Why have a single
<br>
all-powerful FAI trying to save the world at all - why
<br>
not a diversity of different FAI's with more modest
<br>
goals?
<br>
<p>To sum up:  Too grandiose,  too difficult and too many
<br>
unanswered questions!  Why not try to build a more
<br>
human-like sentient FAI, using as a template a generic
<br>
altruistic human with transpersonal philosophy?  This
<br>
would seem to me to be a far easier task and one that
<br>
we can be reasonably sure is possible.  We don't need
<br>
an FAI that is 'Friendly' with a capital 'F', just one
<br>
is 'friendly' (mostly altruistic but perhaps with some
<br>
observer centered goals mixed in).  And we don't need
<br>
it to attempt to single-handedly 'save the world'
<br>
either, just provide some degree of help to us.  This
<br>
FAI would be much better equipped to judge the worth
<br>
of schemes like 'Collective Volition' than we are.  So
<br>
why not settle for this more modest kind of FAI and
<br>
leave grander schemes to it?
