<p>
Long time reader (off again on again), just wanted to post about this.
<br>
I do not think a transhuman superintelligent mind could necessarily
<br>
*know* it was inside a box. You invent a universe for it, you plop it
<br>
in there, volia.
<br>
<p>You can still get useful stuff out of that universe by observing it
<br>
and essentially reverse engineering the things the AI did to meet its
<br>
technological achievements. If the AI invents some super matter
<br>
discombobulator that can figure out things about its underlying
<br>
universe, you could reasonably create a similar machine in the
<br>
physical universe. And for those who would think that the technology
<br>
an AI would create would be too complex for a mere human mind (which I
<br>
don't think is possible, personally), we could simply coerce someone
<br>
within its universe to ask it.
<br>
<p>We just say &quot;hello verse AI, ask the super-AI what's going on.&quot; How
<br>
could we reasonably believe that a superintelligent AI would believe
<br>
some crackpot human talking about the &quot;higher verse,&quot; etc? (This is
<br>
assuming we even talk about a higher verse! We could simply manipulate
<br>
these verse AI's into doing anything we wanted, disguise it as genetic
<br>
coding and the super-AI wouldn't know squat and believe that Genetic
<br>
Type Z's are Curious and Ask Lots of Technological Questions.)
<br>
<p>Of course, a transhuman super-AI could quite easily, on a whim, tell
<br>
the humans to build some technology they don't understand, but I think
<br>
that since we're taking this box AI approach, by our very nature we
<br>
would only work on technologies we do understand. So an AI couldn't go
<br>
(for some metaphysical reason) &quot;build this fancy thing which is in
<br>
reality a copy of me&quot; and actually be successful.
<br>
<p>So, I would take Eliezer's little bet, but I will admit that I
<br>
wouldn't even talk to him as someone outside the box throughout the
<br>
whole chat. :) The whole premise is based on the assumption that a
<br>
super-AI could even know it was inside a box, while I think a
<br>
sufficiently built box makes that impossible.
