<em>&gt; The subtle difference here is that morality is conventionally thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of in terms of  human (group) values apprehended and stated as if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were universal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;arrow of morality&quot; concept  is that there really are certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches that *work* better than others, that with increasing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence we broaden our *understanding* of what works, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing scope of interdependence we broaden our *agreement* of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works, and there is a universal tendency for these conditions to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to expand as with thermodynamics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Jef
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
Suggestion:
<br>
<p>Attempting to model human volition and then extrapolate from it to 
<br>
determine wiser supergoals seems to be the long way around, and likely 
<br>
to be found to be impractical due to fundamental problems that intrude 
<br>
into any such attempts to model/forecast/predict/extrapolate the future, 
<br>
let alone trying to then apply negative feedback in a top-down attempt 
<br>
to control the processes underlying the direction of humanity.
<br>
<p>As in the &quot;arrow of morality&quot; stated earlier, if we agree that that the 
<br>
universe operates according to physical laws that can be understood (to 
<br>
an ever-increasing degree) and that the kind of &quot;morality&quot; that matters 
<br>
is simply the kind that works, then I would suggest that a greater 
<br>
benefit to humanity will be achieved though study and understanding of 
<br>
the principles underlying the dynamics of organizational complexity (and 
<br>
many related fields), and developing enabling technologies, in a 
<br>
bottom-up approach, to facilitate people achieving their evolving goals, 
<br>
wherever they might lead us.
<br>
<p>When I was in school, I was measured at a high-genius level IQ, but I'm 
<br>
now twice as old as Eliezer, and therefore roughly half as smart.  ;-)  
<br>
I've had grand visions, most of which evaporated after wider exposure to 
<br>
reality, and a few that remained and have grown.  I've also had 
<br>
wonderful and challenging experiences working with teams of people, and 
<br>
found that the cynicism of my youth (based mainly on my inability to 
<br>
find commonality with my peers) has increasingly turned to greater and 
<br>
deeper appreciation of the capabilities of humanity, and the real 
<br>
progress we are making in the bigger picture, although punctuated with 
<br>
sadness in the nearer view (with its always-greater emotional value.)
<br>
<p>I've been watching Eliezer for about ten years now through the ExI list 
<br>
and others, and continue to be impressed with his altruism, his 
<br>
brilliance, and his willingness to publicly admit when his views and 
<br>
understanding change with new knowledge.  I see others, generally young 
<br>
and smart, who are attracted to these qualities and feel the urge to follow.
<br>
<p>My advice, likely unwelcome at this time and place, but required by my 
<br>
own values, is that by all means each should follow his dream, but keep 
<br>
in mind that there is always a bigger picture that one has yet to see.
<br>
<p>- Jef
