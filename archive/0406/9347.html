<p>Subjective is what you feel inside.
<br>
<p>Objective is what people can see and more or less agree about on the outside.
<br>
<p>Objective morality would be what we could agree about.  The common feature 
<br>
that people can see in moral behavior is that it takes a viewpoint from 
<br>
genes, life enhancing in a longer term sense.
<br>
<p>So, to take extreme examples, it is moral (from the viewpoint of your 
<br>
genes) to defend your family against those who would kill them.
<br>
<p>But it is also moral (from the viewpoint of *their* genes) for a hungry 
<br>
tribe to attack and kill off the males of your tribe (or even all your 
<br>
tribe's members) so the hungry tribe can eat through the winter.
<br>
<p>This kind of behavior almost certainly goes back to the split between us 
<br>
and the chimps--since they engage in genocide as well.  It is rooted in the 
<br>
fact that humans (and chimps) in the wild state reproduce in excess of that 
<br>
the environment can support and have no significant predators besides other 
<br>
humans (chimps).
<br>
<p>(If anyone knows what limits bonobo populations, please post or send me a 
<br>
pointer.)
<br>
<p>To paraphrase EO Wilson, we are incredibly lucky that the response of human 
<br>
females to high material wealth is to strongly restrict the number of 
<br>
children they have (at least this has happened with European and Asian 
<br>
populations).  There is no reasonable mechanism by which this could have 
<br>
evolved, so it must be a side effect of something else.
<br>
<p>Objective morality doesn't have to go back to the origin of the universe, 
<br>
it is just something that emerges from life, particularly social animals 
<br>
such as us.
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
<br>
<p>PS.  Not wishing to be on either side of a tribal morality play, my 
<br>
preference is to strike out for new &quot;lands&quot;--preferable at a significant 
<br>
fraction of the speed of light.
