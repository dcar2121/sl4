That's kind of a straw-man, since I doubt anybody in this community 
<br>
would make the assumption that AIs have no true feelings or advocate 
<br>
treating them like dirt. I think this community would agree that an AI 
<br>
designed incorrectly or taught incorrectly would not be friendly, just 
<br>
like abused children often grow up to be unfriendly humans. That doesn't 
<br>
meen that the existance of child abuse is an argument against raising 
<br>
children, does it?
