<p>I agree, provided we limit the case to human morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few of these rational free thinkers sensed that there was still

<em>&gt; something missing.  Rationality is bounded by knowledge, and a new level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of enlightenment arose in which people began to realize a need for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisdom within uncertainty.  Some of these people were mistaken for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystics, but rather than abandoning rational thought, these newer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinkers worked to incorporate rational thinking into a larger framework 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that acknowledged, and even welcomed uncertainty.
</em><br>
<p>I think you mean &quot;logical thinking&quot; not &quot;rational thinking&quot;.  Rational 
<br>
thinking, in the modern, Bayesian sense of the term, is precisely the 
<br>
framework that correctly handles uncertainty.  Hence expected utility and 
<br>
Bayesian probability.  We know exactly how uncertain we are; the Way is 
<br>
still a precise art, a dance rather than a walk.  (Calmly knowing the 
<br>
source of your uncertainty and the rules that govern your ignorance is 
<br>
sometimes mistaken for &quot;overconfidence&quot; by those who know not the Way.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mathematical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics (of the frequentist sort and more recently Bayesian) were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joined by newer concepts of entropy and theories of information and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompleteness,
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;joined&quot;, I presume you mean that people (example: E.T. Jaynes) showed 
<br>
that the concepts of entropy and information were special cases of Bayesian 
<br>
probability theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More recently, concepts of uncertainty and randomness are being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overtaken by ideas of chaos and complexity, and rational free-thinkers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are discovering some of the inherent limits of modeling and prediction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with finite computational resources.  We're finding that much of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really interesting stuff can't be modeled or predicted and the only way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to determine the end result is to actually play it out.  *This changes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the focus of the game away from modeling and extrapolation, and towards 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding  what freedoms (points of influence) are available to us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to create an always evolving and unpredictable future.*  These 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new concepts do not replace, but encompass and extend the previous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigm.
</em><br>
<p>The new concepts are special cases of the previous paradigm.  The Way is 
<br>
yet a precise art.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I offer this as a necessarily abbreviated and simplified history of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of rational thinking on the human scale, and also perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the development of individual thinking among members of this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing up within that knowledge environment.  Although overstated, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; applies here as well.
</em><br>
<p>What has this to do with AI morality?
