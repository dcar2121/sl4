</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I get that and it is enticing.  But precisely how will the FRPOP 
<br>
gets its bearings as to what is the &quot;direction&quot; of &quot;more the person&quot;?  
<br>
Some of the others are a bit problematic too.  But this one seems the 
<br>
best and central trick.  More the person I would like to be?  I, with 
<br>
all my warts?  Wouldn't I have a perhaps badly warped view of what kind 
<br>
of person I would like to be?  Would the person I would like to be make 
<br>
indeed better choices?   How will the AI know of this person or model 
<br>
this person?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The benefit of CV is that (a) we aren't stuck with your decision about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness forever (b) you don't have to make the decision using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-level intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, we don't make the decision at all it seems to me.  The AI does 
<br>
based on its extrapolation of our idealized selves.   I am not sure 
<br>
exactly what our inputs would be.  What do you have in mind?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It's easy to see that all those other darned humans can't be trusted, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but what if we can't trust ourselves either?  If you can employ an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolation powerful enough to leap out of your own fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; errors, you should be able to employ it on all those other darned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans too.
</em><br>
<p>Well yes, but it is an &quot;if&quot; isn't it?   It is actually a fairly old 
<br>
spiritual exercise to invoke one's most idealized self and listen to 
<br>
its advise or let it decide.   It takes many forms, some of which put 
<br>
the idealized self as other than one's self, but the gist is not that 
<br>
different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe a better metaphor for collective volition would be that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refers questions to an extrapolated adult humankind, or to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superposition of the adult humanities we might become.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So the AI becomes an adjunct and amplifier of a specialized form of 
<br>
introspective spiritual exercise?  Wild!  AI augmented self-improvement 
<br>
of humankind.
