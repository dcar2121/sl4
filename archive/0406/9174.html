</em><br>
<em>&gt; become tenuous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to be assuming that CV and friendliness are strongly positively

<em>&gt; In my experience people's decisions bear little correlation with

</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations.  What benefit would we derived from creating an CVAI rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an FAI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CV would appear to be a useful theory, and if realized as a *process*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would provide useful data on how humanity might make decisions, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't sound in the least bit friendly.  I suggest that if it did turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to approximate &quot;human friendliness&quot; better than a very friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human would, then it would be an accident.  I do not expect humanity's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective volition to be friendly.  Do you expect it to be friendly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, why?
</em><br>
<p>This question does appear to keep popping up.  Roughly, a collective 
<br>
volition is what I get when:
<br>
<p>(a) I step back and ask the meta-question of how I decided an earlier 
<br>
Eliezer's view of &quot;Friendliness&quot; was &quot;mistaken&quot;.
<br>
<p>(b) I apply the same meta-question to everyone else on the planet.
<br>
<p>Whatever it is that you use, mentally, to consider any alternative to 
<br>
collective volition, anything that would be of itself friendlier - that's 
<br>
you, a human, making the decision; so now imagine that we take you and 
<br>
extrapolate you re-making that decision at a higher level of intelligence, 
<br>
knew more, thought faster, more the person etc.
<br>
<p>The benefit of CV is that (a) we aren't stuck with your decision about 
<br>
Friendliness forever (b) you don't have to make the decision using 
<br>
human-level intelligence.
<br>
<p>It's easy to see that all those other darned humans can't be trusted, but 
<br>
what if we can't trust ourselves either?  If you can employ an 
<br>
extrapolation powerful enough to leap out of your own fundamental errors, 
<br>
you should be able to employ it on all those other darned humans too.
<br>
<p>Maybe a better metaphor for collective volition would be that it refers 
<br>
questions to an extrapolated adult humankind, or to a superposition of the 
<br>
adult humanities we might become.
<br>
<p>To be blunt:  Yes, the collective volition is supposed to extrapolate far 
<br>
enough to wash out the stupid.  Otherwise, as I currently imagine it, the 
<br>
Last Judge says &quot;no&quot; and vetoes.  The whole Last Judge business is really 
<br>
ad-hoc, and I hope to replace it with something better, but any 
<br>
something-better would require at least that level of assurance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; *If the FAI works correctly*, then the existence of an FAI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; transparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transparent in what sense?
</em><br>
<p>In the sense that you'd look at it and say, &quot;Oh, look, there's the 
<br>
collective volition of humankind,&quot; not, &quot;Oh look, there's an FAI.&quot;
