<em>&gt; As any blind person can tell you, just because one doesn't have a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modality it doesn't mean they have to refuse the information offered by
</em><br>
it.
<br>
<p>A blind person who has never seen won't have a clue about vision but they
<br>
can still do visual analysis with mathematics and with breille code
<br>
displays.
<br>
A person without qualia is not only unable to feel anything, but has no
<br>
reason whatsoever to admit the existence or anything beyond straight
<br>
physicality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I mean is the following: if someone builds a CV machine and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolation works properly (otherwise all bets are off) it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (correctly) find out that we value subjective experience, and that whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia exist or not as primitives is not so very important, but what
</em><br>
matters
<br>
<em>&gt; is our volition about them. This is why CV is compatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive-qualia-maximization, assuming that's what we really want, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt.
</em><br>
<p>I understand what you mean, as I explained I don't see that CV will
<br>
necessarily get to qualia even if that is what we want, besides I doubt the
<br>
technical feasibility of CV.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Making it non-sentient (thus presumably not self-centered) and making it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow the CV of humans is a safer bet, since I doubt very much humans
</em><br>
want
<br>
<em>&gt; their matter rearranged into &quot;more useful&quot; patterns for now.
</em><br>
<p>So explain to me how a non-sentient (if that's even possible) being will
<br>
believe us about having these nonphysical experiences ;)
<br>
If I didn't have qualia and heard such nonsense I would turn you into a
<br>
little mountain of paperclips in no time
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, we have no reason to believe that animal
</em><br>
suffering
<br>
<em>&gt; (if that's not a misnoma) is at all important in the big scheme of things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly not compared to, say, survival under a runaway self-centered
</em><br>
SAI.
<br>
<p>I disagree. There is no big scheme of things that is more important then the
<br>
quality of any one sentient's qualia stream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An end to consciousness except by a self-centered SAI, or even an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unacceptable chance of such? Utterly immoral too.
</em><br>
<p>We don't have to choose between the two!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, we've seen your capacity for mystic-sounding statements. We are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awed. You must really know what you're talking about.
</em><br>
<p>There was a point to using that analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; you are talking about the third person interpretation. The first person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interpretation is what I am concerned with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it is substantially less important.
</em><br>
<p>why would it be less important?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; or how vision works. A CV optimizing-process doesn't need to experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia in order to understand their place in the collective volition it
</em><br>
<p>see example above
