<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Samantha, you write that you might have a badly warped view of what kind

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;of person you would like to be.  &quot;Badly warped&quot; by what criterion that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;feed to the FAI?  Your criterion?  Someone else's?  Where am I supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;to get this information, if not, somehow, from you?  When you write down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;exactly how the information is supposed to get from point A (you) to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;point B (the FAI), and what the FAI does with the information once it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;there, you'll have something that looks like - surprise! - a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;volition-extrapolating dynamic.  It's not a coincidence.  That's where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the idea of a volition-extrapolating dynamic *originally comes from*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That is my point.  The information is not necessarily available from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;person[s] in sufficient quality to make wise decisions that actually work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for the good of humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Okay... how do you know this?
</em><br>
<p>I think the point is that she doesn't know for sure.  &quot;. . . not 
<br>
necessarily . . .&quot;  I can see two sources for lack of knowledge.  I don't 
<br>
think we can ever predict something like individual radioactive decay.  But 
<br>
even if something is completely deterministic, we might not know all the 
<br>
influences that shape the outcome.
<br>
<p>And furthermore, changing environmental conditions make last week's &quot;wise 
<br>
decisions&quot; less than wise.  Consider how things would change if we found we 
<br>
were going to get smacked in a few years by a dinosaur killer comet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, where do I get the information?  Like, the judgment criterion for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;wise decisions&quot; or &quot;good of humanity&quot;.  Please note that I mean that as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious question, not a rhetorical one.  You're getting the information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from somewhere, and it exists in your brain; there must be a way for me to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suck it out of your skull.
</em><br>
<p>Not when it isn't there.
<br>
<p>Further, the question is poorly framed.  &quot;good of humanity&quot; for 
<br>
example.  What is the more important aspect of 
<br>
humanity?  Genes?  Memes?  Individuals built by genes who are running 
<br>
memes?  I have been thinking around the edges of these problems for close 
<br>
to two decades and I can assure you that I don't have *the* answer, or even 
<br>
*an* answer that satisfies me.  (Right now, of course, they are all important.)
<br>
<p>That said, Eliezer is absolutely right to grope in this direction.
