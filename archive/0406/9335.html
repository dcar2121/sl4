</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that is correct.
</em><br>
<p>So, unless there is no possible way to design a &quot;oops, reset&quot; button
<br>
into this system, it behooves you to add such a button with suitable
<br>
safeguards against unwise use.   Hmm, wise judged according to what?  
<br>
I see a problem here..
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And this is supposed to be safer than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creating a fully conscious SAI how?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You suppose it is not possible to fuck up the task of creating an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent humane SAI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  But I would trust a full Super Intelligent conscious
<br>
entity that happened to turn out reasonably benevolent more than a
<br>
super optimizer running out the logical consequence of some error in
<br>
its initial settings with no or at least far less ability to
<br>
self-correct.   To self-correct it would need something more than its
<br>
own flawed CV model, which by construction you will not give it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  The Judge of Last Resort must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somehow be the future persons who must live under this thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that is one major *difference* between a independent humane SAI and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective volition.  You can always shut off a collective volition if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to do so is not muddled according to a collective volition that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no built-in tendency to rationalize or self-protect on that type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolation.  
</em><br>
<p>This is circular.  The very CV whose flawed nature would make us want
<br>
to shut it off must approve this action using its flawed judgment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The question is one of simple fact, and it is just, &quot;Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people who say 'No!' still going to agree with that decision in a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not workable because of the above.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Including human infants, I assume.  I'll expect you to deliver the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; exact, eternal, unalterable specification of what constitutes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;sentient&quot; by Thursday.  Whatever happened to keeping things simple?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is not required.  Being able to shut down the optimization if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gets wildly out of hand is required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Current plans call for around three off-switches:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  The programmer verification process, viewing the dynamics;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  The Last Judge, viewing the outcome;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  The ability of our collective decision to shut down the collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volition providing our collective decision is not defined by the collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volition as muddled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So effectively only the first two can help as the third is circular.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If this can't be done why on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; earth would anyone trust you or a hundred persons equally bright and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with excellent intentions to not fuck it up drastically?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has to be reduced to a pure technical issue.  It's not a question of who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserves trust.  It's a question of what safeguards you can take.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former question is not solvable and not helpful; the latter question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solvable and helpful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes.  But the safeguards mentioned thus far are not reassuring.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not at all.  Make sure everyone is backed up at all times and give them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free choice but with nudges/reminders/more grown-up advise at whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level each one is willing/desirious of taking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, you and Brent Thomas can fight it out about which of these is the One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fundamental Right we all need, and then I'll take on the winner?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am serious.  I think the above is more likely to give a good outcome
<br>
across the Singularity than what you are proposing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Set things up so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't do themselves in ultimately (although it make look like they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to them).   Keep it going long enough for each to grow up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not think we are so wise, as to decide this thing.  Too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unforeseen consequences.  We can't evaluate the real effect of our actions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as opposed to the imagined effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Most of it would be done by a true SAI.  How to get it going and
<br>
benevolent is of course the Big Problem.
<br>
<p>&lt;aside&gt; What do you think extrapolating the CV is doing if it is not
<br>
evaluating imagined effects?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It's not about public relations, it's about living with the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; result for the next ten billion years if that wonderful PR invariant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; turns out to be a bad idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Instead we live with an original implementation of EV extraction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decision making for the next 10 billion years without any possibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a reset or out?  Hmm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, hence the whole distinction between initial dynamic, successor dynamic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But these are just unfoldings of the original setup of the CV
<br>
extrapolation mechanisms and its subsequent optimization.   Hmm.  Is
<br>
there enough freedom the Optimizing Process could decide an approach
<br>
like the one hinted at above was the successor dynamic  and go in that
<br>
direction?  If so then I have little real objection.  :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Not under your system, no.  I would like to allow your grownup self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and/or your volition to object effectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But that being exists only within the extrapolation which may in fact be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; erroneously formulated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right.  If you fuck up the extrapolation, you're screwed.  If you try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build in a separate emergency exit, and you fuck up the emergency exit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're screwed.  If you build an independent humane mind and you fuck that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up, you're screwed.  Hence, keep it simple, and keep it technical, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on moral problems you can fuck up even if everything works exactly as planned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But if the technical problem as you have currently formulated it is
<br>
unsolvable then you are still screwed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Genie bottle with warning labels AND the ability to recover from errors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't be so bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be a total shift in human society and an enormous impact on every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual.  Maybe we want to take it slower than that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Agreed.  Only a very few people would be likely remotely ready
<br>
for such a thing right now.   More could survive it.  But they
<br>
probably wouldn't learn nuthin'.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not unless you design the system so that eternal damnation is possible!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Without the ability to opt-out or try something different or recover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from any and all errors eternal damnation will always be possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Collective volition has this, and it is one of the primary motivations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yes, this requires that the initial dynamic work satisfactorily, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as any other method requires that the technical solutions work satisfactorily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Yep.
