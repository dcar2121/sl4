Maybe I'll write a more detailed reply to this later, but:
<br>
<p>1)  Those who dance often seem insanely self-confident to those who hear 
<br>
not the music.  Michael Wilson does strike me as overconfident, and I am 
<br>
diligently correcting his remarks.  I regard myself as moving to the beat 
<br>
of a partially formed technical theory that is different in kind from the 
<br>
wild guessing of my earlier days.  For this reason must I sadly refuse many 
<br>
of the brilliant &quot;intuitive&quot; insights that people seem eager to offer me. 
<br>
I'm sorry if it seems that I think I know vastly more than you do, but 
<br>
that's exactly what I think.  The arrogance is useless and irrelevant, 
<br>
though not particularly harmful and a part of my present-day self whoever I 
<br>
wish to be.  But someone has to acquire considerably greater competence 
<br>
than all this wild guessing, and that is what I am in the process of doing.
<br>
<p>2)  If SIAI does not scare the crap out of you, you don't take us 
<br>
seriously.  SIAI has scared the crap out of me since late 2000 when I first 
<br>
realized it was theoretically possible for someone to screw up the 
<br>
Singularity.  For that matter, we should scare the crap out of you even if 
<br>
you think we have a 100% probability of success on FAI.
<br>
<p>3)  If [AGI Project X] does not scare the crap out of [AGI Researcher X], 
<br>
he doesn't believe in himself, he's still processing the potentially lethal 
<br>
challenge using the part of the brain that handles movies and philosophy 
<br>
books, or he hasn't realized it's possible to screw up.
<br>
