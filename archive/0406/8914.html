<p>
Very interesting Tyler. First, kudos for your &quot;Becoming a Seed AI
<br>
Programmer&quot; article which is one of the very best job offered texts that I
<br>
have ever seen.
<br>
To business: reading the description of your project, and having some
<br>
experience in managing large software development proejcts, I found myself
<br>
trying to quantify your human resource needs and came up with a core staff
<br>
of 50 software managers, architects, designers, coders, testers, plus
<br>
cognitive scientists, mathematicians, hardware and communications experts,
<br>
*insert here all current IT buzzwords*, and of course you also need support
<br>
staff. As part of the team you need some of the very best money can buy,
<br>
people who would command a salary of 250k+/yr in the job market. Your total
<br>
budget requirement is, I believe, between 10 and 20M/yr, and these may well
<br>
be very conservative estimates. How good are your funding projections over
<br>
the next few years? Of course we will try contributing individually a few
<br>
tens of bucks every now and then but you know this is not enough.
<br>
Yes of course you can use volunteers, but my advice is not to underestimate
<br>
the requirement for paid staff. Volunteers can contribute very brilliant but
<br>
intrinsically unreliable work (they are available today, tomorrow they need
<br>
money find a job and go), you need paid staff for reliability.
<br>
Have you thought of intermediate marketable results that would look good on
<br>
a business plan?
<br>
G.

<p><p>Although we are not ready to begin our AI project, we are close enough to
<br>
begin forming the development team. Presently, we have two confirmed team
<br>
members. We're now actively searching for Singularitarians with software
<br>
engineering and cognitive science expertise to join the development team. If
<br>
you believe you may be a suitable candidate, or know someone who may, please
<br>
read &quot;Becoming a Seed AI Programmer,&quot; and consider getting in touch at
<br>
institute@intelligence.org. The Institute is searching for nothing less than
<br>
the core team to fulfill our mission; we need the very best we can find.
