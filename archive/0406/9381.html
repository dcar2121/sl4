You still haven't shown that there is anything wrong with this approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not saying I have complete understanding of qualia and the &quot;I&quot;, no one

</em><br>
This statement may seem obvious to you, but I can't accept it unless you can 
<br>
show that this hypothesis allows you to make more accurate predictions about 
<br>
reality than any alternatives; or, alternatively, allows you to make exactly as 
<br>
accurate predictions about reality as the best alternative, and is simpler.
<br>
<p>Even if you can show this to be the case, I will still not understand how you 
<br>
arrived at your 5-element list for making estimations on the universal goodness 
<br>
balance of qualia. There seem to be significant more assumptions than the one 
<br>
you stated above contained in those statements, which don't appear correct to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the rest of the ideas that you have presented, I think you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically looking at the problem from a third person perspective; I can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it from that perspective too and then all you are saying is correct. Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia are subjective that's the whole point.
</em><br>
I don't think there is anything gained from using a first person perspective, 
<br>
and I see the danger of jumping to a lot of wrong conclusions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Existence is only observed directly. Existence manifests itself as pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence, it is not something you analyze from the outside. Existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurs when you perceive something consciously and it creates a quale.
</em><br>
That looks like a &quot;mythical answer&quot; to me. It doesn't really explain anything 
<br>
about &quot;existence&quot;. From that description, I wouldn't know how to tell it apart 
<br>
from anything else; let alone predict whether it would be present in a certain 
<br>
situation.
<br>
What's wrong with analyzing anything from the outside? Afaik that's usually the 
<br>
only effective and reliable way of gaining information about it.
<br>
I don't see any reason to treat &quot;existence&quot; in this unexplained, ill-defined 
<br>
form as anything relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who is rushing? We are discussing things here. We're all looking for a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to screw up.
</em><br>
To quote an earlier post: &quot;[...]the URGENT need right now is to remove negative 
<br>
qualia!&quot; - I maintain that the most urgent thing to do right now is to not make 
<br>
things any worse; and I think that trying to implement qualia-based morality 
<br>
would likely make things significantly worse. Treating it as something very 
<br>
urgent increases the chance of not spending enough time on verifying whether 
<br>
implementing this solution is a good idea at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just think I'm right that's all.
</em><br>
Most people probably believe that when they argue honestly; or at least they 
<br>
believe that they are probably more right than what they are arguing against.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference in basic stance between us (I accept and embrace the first person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective while you want to reduce it to 3rd person data) will lead to two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different currents of thought. And if you keep your stance and I keep mine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's the end of it.
</em><br>
If this was a purely theoretical and philosophical discussion, I'd probably 
<br>
agree and move on (or not even have started discussing). But since each of the 
<br>
models we are defending would have significant effects on both of us if it were 
<br>
to be implemented in an AI that reaches SI status, agreeing to disagree doesn't 
<br>
work here unless we both accept that the other person doesn't have any realistic 
<br>
chance of getting their idea successfully (successful as in 'the AI takes off', 
<br>
not successful as in 'the morality then actually works as intended') implemented 
<br>
first.
<br>
Having several ideas of a good method to implement morality in an AI spread out 
<br>
between leading research teams is furthermore a bad idea in itself because it 
<br>
increases the chance that each of the teams will view the competitors as a 
<br>
threat to their goals, giving them justification to rush research on morality, 
<br>
and increasing the chance that whoever does win the race has taken too many 
<br>
shortcuts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A lot of _independent_ qualia stream are going to be created during that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. Your argument is equivalent to : since so many people have died of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunger in the past, a million more or so won't make such a big difference.
</em><br>
Not really. According to my world model, there isn't really anything left of 
<br>
their mind, so how many have died in the past wouldn't be relevant for 
<br>
evaluating how bad X people dieing now is.
<br>
For this argument to work, you need something of them persisting in reality, 
<br>
like the &quot;qualia streams&quot; you suggested. My world model doesn't suggest that 
<br>
this is the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't TOTALLY agree on the permanent, there may end up being one big (U)FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or there may be many, the known cosmos may end up being dominated by one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monolithic AI or there may be a diverse fauna of agents.
</em><br>
Perhaps, but it seems very likely to me that the first one that takes off and 
<br>
reaches SI-status will determine how things go on from there. If there are any 
<br>
other AIs close to takeoff around that have significantly different goal system, 
<br>
the first SI will likely either destroy them outright, or limit their 
<br>
development as to prevent them from becoming a serious threat.
<br>
If it didn't, they would continue becoming more intelligent, and might 
<br>
eventually pose a threat to the first SI, and since they would continue 
<br>
following their own, differing goals, that would be a strongly negatively valued 
<br>
future according of the first SI's goal system.
<br>
Then again, perhaps the first SI would be content by taking control of most 
<br>
matter and being the first that can begin to spread out into space. If whatever 
<br>
matter it leaves to the followers isn't sufficient to allow them to become a 
<br>
threat to it, it may not need to limit them artificially.
<br>
In any event, it seems likely that the only AI whose morality will have any 
<br>
long-term effects is that of the first SI.
<br>
<p>This leaves out the possibility of another SI already being out there, and 
<br>
expanding quickly towards us. This scenario is of relatively little practical 
<br>
relevance; when the SIs meet, one of them will most likely be far more powerful. 
<br>
If it's the one built on earth, we are back to it dominating practically all of 
<br>
space. If it's the other one, what we do is of very little relevance in the long 
<br>
term in any event; planning for it is ineffective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's what Chalmers wants to do. We will find physical differences in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes that create different qualia, hopefully.
</em><br>
I'd really like to see that kind of results. If qualia can be empirically shown 
<br>
to be based on anything else than ordinary, known physics, we would have some 
<br>
more common ground to discuss your suggestions on morality (never mind that my 
<br>
world model would require significant modification first).
