Yep...it does require the sentient to make some decisions...and informed
<br>
ones at that...
<br>
But then doesn't everything? And at least its MY decision and the
<br>
potential effects of that decision
<br>
can be explained re: consequences and intents to whatever level I need
<br>
to be comfortable accepting or rejecting the
<br>
decision. That is indeed how it should be wouldn't you agree?
<br>
<p>In all the cases you just listed I would want to be asked to make the
<br>
decision not have it made for me...
<br>
and that's really the point isn't it?

<p><p><em>&gt; Instead (using the principal of no modification to sentients without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express permission) the system can tell me &quot;Hey, you'd be much happier
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; if you had green hair, we've done some calculations and if at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20% of the population had green hair then there would be a 15%
</em><br>
reduction
<br>
<em>&gt; in the general unhappiness quotient...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can I make this modification to you or would you like a deeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of the intents and consequences?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you weren't anorexic and put on a bit of
<br>
weight. Would you like me to make you into a normal person and then get
<br>
you a 4 season pizza?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you didn't blow yourself up anyway you
<br>
are not going to get 47 perpetual virgins after you die you know, can I
<br>
deactivate the explosive now?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if you stopped believing in this jesus
<br>
christ BS and took some science classes, can I sign you up right now?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, you'd be much happier if your higher mental functions were
<br>
inhibited and you were transformed in a positive qualia pumping process.
<br>
Just say the word&quot;
<br>
<p>hmmm.........
