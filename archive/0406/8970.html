<em>&gt; I can see how someone who is a young supersmart programmer, AND is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich enough to know that (s)he will never have to worry about money,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may prefer joining your project instead of doing other things with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her/his life. But how many young supersmart AND rich programmers do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know?
</em><br>
<p>The SIAI will certainly pay living wages and if funds were available
<br>
would be be happy to pay enough to keep the programming team from
<br>
any material want. The idea isn't to take self-supporting candidates
<br>
only. The problem is that joining the SIAI for the $250,000/year salary
<br>
would be joining the SIAI for the wrong reason, and making a salary
<br>
like that available would give people a very strong motivation to
<br>
fake caring about the real issues. If that happens then five years
<br>
later when the programmers get ready to pull The Switch the greedy
<br>
faker has a nervous breakdown when he realises that it's Really
<br>
Happening. The seed AI programmer job description page makes it clear
<br>
what does and doesn't count as a right reason; money isn't on there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But lack of money can force you to stop doing what you like and start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing something else that pays better.
</em><br>
<p>Again the SIAI won't ask anyone to starve, but letting the programmers
<br>
buy extra toys is a use of cash with strictly marginal utility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Especially if you have a family to support.
</em><br>
<p>A strict rationalist would ditch the family, because saving six billion
<br>
lives is more important. However the SIAI realises that people are in
<br>
fact human and wouldn't expect this in practice. Of course people with
<br>
families may get marked down for not being able to put in as much time
<br>
and mental effort as people who don't have them, not being able to move
<br>
to another country at a month's notice and getting squeemish and
<br>
complying with the demands of the Butlerian Jihad when they kidnap their
<br>
kids. Such bad stuff may not seem likely, but it's certainly possible.
