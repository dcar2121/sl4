On the simulation of opaque undetectable sandbox worlds:

</em><br>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and say the creation and running of an
<br>
undetectable virtual world with a coherent apparent casual history is
<br>
probably beyond us. On first blush it sounds like a much harder task
<br>
than an AI, actually.
<br>
<p>Any sufficiently intelligent entity is a sponge for regularities and
<br>
consequences. I can't even begin to imagine the requirements for
<br>
simulating either a self consistent copy of this universes' laws, or
<br>
some kind of restricted physics that allows for a smaller world. And
<br>
if you don't provide a casual explanation for everything in the
<br>
Virtual World within the virtual world, it will eventually become
<br>
quite obvious there is something missing, regardless of how seamless
<br>
the interfaces and such are.
<br>
<p>Anything less than some mythical herculean simulation, and the AI
<br>
would run against a hard inconsistency in the VW, very very quickly.
<br>
You could ameliorate this by running a copy of the real universe
<br>
incredibly slowly, but even such a copy simulation is far beyond us,
<br>
and would make the AI developing within it almost useless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I would take Eliezer's little bet, but I will admit that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't even talk to him as someone outside the box throughout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole chat. :) The whole premise is based on the assumption that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-AI could even know it was inside a box, while I think a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently built box makes that impossible.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose you could make that assumption, but the AI is free to make
<br>
his own assumptions about what he knows and doesn't know. Your freedom
<br>
to assume whatever role you choose is mirrored by the AI's freedom to
<br>
take or leave such roleplay.
