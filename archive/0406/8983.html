</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, are you saying that you are not sane?
</em><br>
<p>Nope, I'm saying that I plan on staying sane.

<p><em>&gt; You seem to be admitting that you are both rational AND irrational.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emotional outbursts, arrogance, self-descriptors of &quot;MAD scientists&quot; all
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What?  Why?  I think we are using extremely different definitions of 
<br>
rationality.  Rationality means &quot;Bayesian&quot; not &quot;Vulcan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while you simultaneously say rationality comes easy to you.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you please explain the discrepancy?
</em><br>
<p>I aspire to experience those emotions that I would feel if I knew the 
<br>
correct answers, not to be emotionless.  Oh, plus that standard business 
<br>
about a foolish consistency being the hobgoblin.  We humans are much 
<br>
happier when we acknowledge our conflicting facets, rather than trying to 
<br>
stuff them all into a consistent public image.  Nothing wrong with being a 
<br>
mad scientist and rationalist.  I can laugh maniacally all I want, so long 
<br>
as I still get the answers right on questions of simple fact.
<br>
<p>In fact, I think I'll laugh maniacally right now.  BWAHAHAHAHA!  BWAHAHAHA! 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I nearly fell into your clever trap, answering in tones of dull 
<br>
solemnity, just because you asked a solemn-sounding question!  I think I 
<br>
need to be more silly, lest the people around me fall into the trap of 
<br>
being solemn as well as serious.
<br>
<p>To this task I shall now apply myself.
<br>
<p>Weerp!  Wonk!  Warble!
