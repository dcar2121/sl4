From: &quot;Metaqualia&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:metaqualia@mynichi.com?Subject=Re:%20qualia,%20once%20and%20for%20all">metaqualia@mynichi.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; A blind person who has never seen won't have a clue about vision but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can still do visual analysis with mathematics and with breille code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; displays.
</em><br>
<p>An Optimizing Process without qualia will not have a clue about subjective
<br>
experience but it can still do qualia analysis by understanding people's
<br>
neural substrate and taking people's word for it about subjective
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A person without qualia is not only unable to feel anything, but has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason whatsoever to admit the existence or anything beyond straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicality.
</em><br>
<p>A person, maybe not. A well-designed Optimizing Process has the best of
<br>
reasons, it has been designed to do so. I don't think any reasonable CV
<br>
builder would build an optimizing process that would assign a low relevance
<br>
rate to information people have about their own subjective experience, about
<br>
which they are the best possible qualified beings to make statements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand what you mean, as I explained I don't see that CV will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily get to qualia even if that is what we want, besides I doubt
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; technical feasibility of CV.
</em><br>
<p>Doubting the tech feasibility of CV is, in my view, an appropriate argument.
<br>
Saying it won't get to qualia without showing why seems a week argument to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So explain to me how a non-sentient (if that's even possible) being will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe us about having these nonphysical experiences ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I didn't have qualia and heard such nonsense I would turn you into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little mountain of paperclips in no time
</em><br>
<p>A CV-driven optimization process? How do you extrapolate that people's
<br>
volition is to be turned into mountains of paperclips? I will continual
<br>
survival, probably most other people do too. I assume that, even if we were
<br>
more knowledgeable/smart/good we'd still do so. The CV has no incentive to
<br>
do anything against our interest. Can you explain why you think the CV would
<br>
fail at determining we value subjective experience as opposed to, for
<br>
example, fail at determining we need food? They're the same kind of problem,
<br>
at different levels of analysis. If the CV can show #2 it should be able to
<br>
show #1.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I disagree. There is no big scheme of things that is more important then
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; quality of any one sentient's qualia stream.
</em><br>
<p>OK, we cannot agree here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't have to choose between the two!
</em><br>
<p>Your approach requires that programmers find a reasonable algorithm to
<br>
assign moral value to qualia in relation to minds, and I think you'd agree
<br>
that's as non-trivial as it gets. I stipulate that trying for a SAI within
<br>
those constrains would lead to either 1) failure due to the complexity of
<br>
the approach or 2) a badly specified qualia algorithm that would make
<br>
potentially tragic mistakes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; why would it be less important?
</em><br>
<p>First person perspective has the usual characteristics of being compelling,
<br>
seemingly self-evident and wrong. The advance of all the sciences has come
<br>
through the abandonment of first-person perspectives (to the point of
<br>
equality of frames of reference under relativity) and the embracing of
<br>
objective reality from an observer viewpoint. I have no reason to believe
<br>
the future holds something different.
<br>
<p>--David.
