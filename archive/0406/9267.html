</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I understand. But at the same time, I just don't want to transcend
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; though if you've thought think far does it?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I also would currently say that I want to grow up slowly.  I just 
<br>
think that the decision as to whether the decision should be made by our 
<br>
current volitions should be made by our extrapolated volitions.
<br>
<p>You seem to be visualizing something considerably &quot;off&quot; from what I'm 
<br>
suggesting - i.e., forced transcendence as an immediate direct consequence 
<br>
of collective volition, some independent all-powerful being rather than a 
<br>
transparent optimization process.  Have you read the Collective Volition 
<br>
document?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Will the successor dynamic do anything without your current conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will? My guess is, yes, that is what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wise/benevolent/good-of-humanity etc., which is to say, if you thought
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; decision.  Philip Sutton and some others seem to think that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not only unwise, it would be unwise for the successor dynamic to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anything other than present helpful advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once there is a (virtually) all-powerful, benevolent being, what's the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurry to force us what to do? Do you know about a not-so-friendly AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traveling at light speed towards us or something?
</em><br>
<p>Who said anything about hurrying to force anyone to do anything?  In 
<br>
&quot;Collective Volition&quot; I explicitly talked about going slow, albeit that, 
<br>
too, was only a guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you write an initial dynamic based on individual volition, then as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  discussed extensively in the document, you are *pre-emptively*, on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the basis of your personal moral authority and your current human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence, writing off a hell of a lot of difficult tradeoffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without even considering them.  Such as whether anyone fanatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; convinced of a false religion ever learns the truth, whether it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; theoretically possible for you to even try to take heroin away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; drug addicts, and whether infants grow up into humans or superinfants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I do not say that I know the forever answer to these moral dilemmas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I say I am not willing to make the decision on my own authority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you undertake the creation of such a powerful being, you're already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing that!
</em><br>
<p>No, I am handing the decision off to an abstract invariant that 
<br>
extrapolates the collective volition of humankind to produce a secondary 
<br>
dynamic that returns a decision.  I don't know what the decision will be. 
<br>
I just know that the collective volition of humankind, which is a set of 
<br>
superposed spreads, will be satisficed by the choice of decision process 
<br>
that is used to make the decision.  Oh, and I know that the Last Judge 
<br>
didn't throw the off switch on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; No, not even for the sake of public relations.  The public relations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thingy is a lost cause anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well it surely is now. Do you think the politicians and military would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just hand over their wills, even if you say their &quot;future&quot; selves would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approve? There's a good chance this concept of yours could get some very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad press - and worse - governmental/police/military/whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervention.
</em><br>
<p>That was true regardless of whether I proposed the Right Thing on 
<br>
collective volition, or some hideously wrong hacked-up thing that sounded 
<br>
slightly better from a public relations perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Also, you must correctly define the &quot;is-individual?&quot; predicate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;individual volition&quot; exactly right on your first try, including the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whole bag of worms on sentience and citizenship, because if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; initial dynamic can redefine &quot;is-individual?&quot; using a majority vote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you aren't really protecting anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I very much doubt, at least initially, humanity would vote to merge into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a single Jupiter-brain (since 99.5%+ of them aren't Singularitarians),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever SL4 topic about sentience you wanna throw at me. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to many of those improbable moral dilemmas which won't have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application in a real world.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Why did you think I wouldn't agree?
