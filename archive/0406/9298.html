<em> &gt;&gt;Keith, evolutionary psychology is all very

<em> &gt;&gt;to it.  It can be useful for understanding some of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;do, but it is of little use as a guide to moral
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Conversely, I think you underestimate it.  You cannot talk about human
</em><br>
<em> &gt;psychology without talking about the evolutionary process that created it
</em><br>
<em> &gt;(well, you can, but you can also be wrong).  The human mind is a huge
</em><br>
<em> &gt;mystery until you look at it from an evolutionary perspective, but
</em><br>
<em> &gt;evolution lets you tear it apart and understand why the human mind works
</em><br>
<em> &gt;the way it does.  We don't understand everything and sometimes theories
</em><br>
<em> &gt;are revised (this is science, after all), but the important insight
</em><br>
<em> &gt;remains that humans and their brains are products of an evolutionary
</em><br>
<em> &gt;process and are shaped by that process.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;behaviour.  What is natural is not neccesserily good!
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Of course not, but this misses the point.  When we talk about moral
</em><br>
<em> &gt;behavior in humans, we talk about behavior that the human believes is good
</em><br>
<em> &gt;or bad.  It makes no difference whether there is external morality or not;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;the human decides based on an internal sense of morality, which is,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;incidentally, a product of human evolution.  It should be unsurprising
</em><br>
<em> &gt;that behaviors humans believe to be good benefitted the reproduction of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;genes carrying the genotype leading to such beliefs and that behaviors
</em><br>
<em> &gt;humans believe to be bad hurt reproduction of genes carrying the genotype
</em><br>
<em> &gt;leading to such beliefs, because good and bad are, inside the human mind,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;just another way of talking about desirable and undesirable.
</em><br>
<p>Well put.  The only thing I can add is that evolution of this kind
<br>
takes a very long time.  Thus our behaviors and what we have been
<br>
shaped to consider desirable and undesirable are still adapted to the
<br>
Pleistocene social and physical environment of small tribes.  This may
<br>
cause very serious problems in a high tech environment.  (Nomadic
<br>
tribal responses by sedentary corn farmers wiped most of them out.)
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The
</em><br>
<em> &gt;confusion comes when trying to prescribe external morality to humans or
</em><br>
<em> &gt;prescribe one human's morality onto another human (thus we get the idea of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;an evil scientist).
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;Further, what evolutionary psychology fails to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;consider is the power of memes
</em><br>
<p>Marc, you might want to look at the path I took from memetics to
<br>
evolutionary psychology.  Long ago I made grandiose claims for an
<br>
improved model of the human social dynamics through understanding
<br>
memes.

<p>After more than a decade of making very little progress I started
<br>
reading evolutionary psychology. About the same time I became involved
<br>
in a particularly vicious battle with the scientology cult.  *That*
<br>
will motivate you!  There were several pivotal events, observing an
<br>
amazingly similar emotional response to drugs and cults in early 1996
<br>
and making a connection to evolutionary psychology (with the help of
<br>
Kennita Watson) in late 1996.  Much of my journey is summed up here:
<br>
<a href="http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/cults.html">http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/cults.html</a>
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt;and the feed-back loop
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;between the conscious and unconscious mind.
</em><br>
<p>*What* someone does to gain status is learned, cultural, memetic.
<br>
*Why* people seek status (or act in other predictable ways) is because
<br>
we have built in, evolved psychological traits.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt;Sure I'm
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;prepared to believe that our immediate conscious
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;experience is largely just a reflection of our
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;sub-conscious impluses aka Libet , but what shaped
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;those sub-conscious impluses in the first place?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;Answer:  Conscious belief putting feed-back into the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;unconscious mind.  In fact conscious belief might well
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;be the most important factor.  So even as a guide to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;explaining behaviour, evolutionary psychology fails.
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt;Human brains are information processing mechanisms, so why do you suppose
</em><br>
<em> &gt;that memes and feedback are evidence against evolutionary
</em><br>
<em> &gt;psychology?  Memes and feedback are both products of evolution of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;human brain, so just because there may not currently be any explanations
</em><br>
<em> &gt;of these topics in evolutionary psychology (and I doubt either of us are
</em><br>
<em> &gt;well enough read in the literature to be sure of that), that does not mean
</em><br>
<em> &gt;they are evidence against evolutionary psychology.  For something to be
</em><br>
<em> &gt;evidence against evolutionary psychology, it must either be evidence
</em><br>
<em> &gt;against evolution or evidence against evolution being the process that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;created the human brain (like proof that aliens visited earth and
</em><br>
<em> &gt;arbitrarily changed all of humanity by design).  A lack of current
</em><br>
<em> &gt;explanation of how a particular psychological phenotype evolved does not a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;case against evolutionary psychology make; only a further research
</em><br>
<em> &gt;question does it create.
</em><br>
<p>Well stated.
