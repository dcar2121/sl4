<p><em>&gt; Keith, evolutionary psychology is all very

<em>&gt; interesting, but I think you give far too much weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it.  It can be useful for understanding some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying motivations as to why people behave they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do, but it is of little use as a guide to moral
</em><br>
<p>Conversely, I think you underestimate it.  You cannot talk about human 
<br>
psychology without talking about the evolutionary process that created 
<br>
it (well, you can, but you can also be wrong).  The human mind is a 
<br>
huge mystery until you look at it from an evolutionary perspective, but 
<br>
evolution lets you tear it apart and understand why the human mind 
<br>
works the way it does.  We don't understand everything and sometimes 
<br>
theories are revised (this is science, after all), but the important 
<br>
insight remains that humans and their brains are products of an 
<br>
evolutionary process and are shaped by that process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; behaviour.  What is natural is not neccesserily good!
</em><br>
<p>Of course not, but this misses the point.  When we talk about moral 
<br>
behavior in humans, we talk about behavior that the human believes is 
<br>
good or bad.  It makes no difference whether there is external morality 
<br>
or not; the human decides based on an internal sense of morality, which 
<br>
is, incidentally, a product of human evolution.  It should be 
<br>
unsurprising that behaviors humans believe to be good benefitted the 
<br>
reproduction of genes carrying the genotype leading to such beliefs and 
<br>
that behaviors humans believe to be bad hurt reproduction of genes 
<br>
carrying the genotype leading to such beliefs, because good and bad 
<br>
are, inside the human mind, just another way of talking about desirable 
<br>
and undesirable.  The confusion comes when trying to prescribe external 
<br>
morality to humans or prescribe one human's morality onto another human 
<br>
(thus we get the idea of an evil scientist).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, what evolutionary psychology fails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider is the power of memes and the feed-back loop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the conscious and unconscious mind.  Sure I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prepared to believe that our immediate conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is largely just a reflection of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub-conscious impluses aka Libet , but what shaped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those sub-conscious impluses in the first place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer:  Conscious belief putting feed-back into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious mind.  In fact conscious belief might well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the most important factor.  So even as a guide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining behaviour, evolutionary psychology fails.
</em><br>
<p>Human brains are information processing mechanisms, so why do you 
<br>
suppose that memes and feedback are evidence against evolutionary 
<br>
psychology?  Memes and feedback are both products of evolution of the 
<br>
human brain, so just because there may not currently be any 
<br>
explanations of these topics in evolutionary psychology (and I doubt 
<br>
either of us are well enough read in the literature to be sure of 
<br>
that), that does not mean they are evidence against evolutionary 
<br>
psychology.  For something to be evidence against evolutionary 
<br>
psychology, it must either be evidence against evolution or evidence 
<br>
against evolution being the process that created the human brain (like 
<br>
proof that aliens visited earth and arbitrarily changed all of humanity 
<br>
by design).  A lack of current explanation of how a particular 
<br>
psychological phenotype evolved does not a case against evolutionary 
<br>
psychology make; only a further research question does it create.
