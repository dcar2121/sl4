<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since you used the gravity example, I'll use a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; similar example.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that saying there must be an objective morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like saying there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; must be an objective time system.  But in the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's all relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the observer, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope.  Bad example ;)  Even in general relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is still an objective ordering of events:  Given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an observer that records event x and records event y
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as occuring later than x, if light from x had time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass through the point where y occurred before y
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred, then x is in the ASBOLUTE past of y for all observers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Time does have some flexibility yes, but there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still an absolute ordering of events even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively theory.
</em><br>
<p>As you point out, in that particular case there is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Remove humans from the universe and where is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality?  You can't say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the same thing about gravity.  Seems to me the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concept of morality is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human invention.  What morality is there in galaxies colliding, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; animals in the food chain eating each other, etc?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remove humans from the universe you say?  What about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any alien civilizations that might exist?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, remove them too.  Same question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't be so sure there is no morality in: 'galaxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colliding, animals in the food chain eating each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other'.  There are theories of consciousness which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascribe some degree of sentience to everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (panpsychism).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying sentience implies morality?  (And I'll believe rocks are
<br>
sentient when somebody can prove it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you were the last human alive, and the race would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; die out after you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were gone, is there anything you could do to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immoral?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite possibly.  What about alien cilivizations else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where in the universe?  Humans still living in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative branches of the quantum multiverse? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans in the past?  Any other sentients that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in the future?  The actions taken by the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human alive could still be related to all the things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned, even if these actions only had a tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Since you so strongly want to pull more sentients back into the 
<br>
question, is it accurate to conclude that you feel absolute
<br>
morality applies to multiple sentients but would not apply
<br>
to a single sentient if it could be truly isolated from all
<br>
other sentients for all time?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To answer one of your questions, I think that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standard by which you can say that Ghandi is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than Hitler.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only your rules of morality that tell you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hitler is bad (and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would personally agree).  But in some societies, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most vicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; warrior gets the most honor and privilege.  By his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society, he's a hero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By their morality, he's doing everything right.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if you ask their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinion, they would tell you Ghandi is weak, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coward, and not someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to emulate.  One obvious example of this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Samurai in Japan a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hundred years ago.  If they had to guess at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature of the &quot;objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality&quot;, their guess would look nothing like mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  How can our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moralities come from the same source and be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are our moralitites really so totally different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though?  Deduct out the differences and I think you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still find a great common of commonality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comes when I answer your other questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; by what standard would they define 'best'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would it be good if people thought 'longer or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; faster'?  What is 'wisdom'?  It would seem that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; objective morality is still implied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Doesn't &quot;best&quot; just end up being, in the long run,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever maximizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your potential to survive and reproduce?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Samurai think best is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being better with the sword.  We think best is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking faster.  It all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depends on where you live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mike W.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'best' might possibly be related to whatever maximizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your potential to survive, but even if this was so:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that the laws of physics are the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere mean that there would still be some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective standards for deciding what maximized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'potential to survive', no matter where you lived.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we disagree on the laws of physics.  What part 
<br>
of the laws of physics are you calling objective morality?
<br>
