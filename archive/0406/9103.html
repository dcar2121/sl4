<p>I would like to go on record, having met you in person, as finding you
<br>
personable and kind in practice.
<br>
<p>In fact, I would *not* be a current donor if this were not the case; I
<br>
wanted to meet Eliezer to find out how bad his Asperger's was[1] and how
<br>
friendly he was, because I have not the slightest intention of helping
<br>
to put humanities fate in the hands of a misanthrope.

<br>
<p>[1]:  Using the term &quot;Asperger's&quot; in a non-clinical sense.  I saw no
<br>
sign of any, but I find it tremendously unlikely that someone with Eli's
<br>
social history could be entirely devoid of it.  I only talked to him for
<br>
an hour or so.  The point is he doesn't have enough to have detectable
<br>
social problems, beyond the &quot;problem&quot; of his obvious urge to tell people
<br>
that try to reduce AI to a single sentence that they need to STFU.  This
<br>
is an urge I fully support.
