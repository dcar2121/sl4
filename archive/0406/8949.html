<em>&gt; I'm seeing a lot of debate between Eliezer and Ben where it's

</em><br>
<p>Ben is stubbornly holding to some fundamentally flawed ideas. There's
<br>
no point repeating debates that have already occured several times if
<br>
neither party is going to budge. Don't get fixated on Ben. You can
<br>
watch Eliezer having amusing debates with other people too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've noticed a lot of people asking for clarification where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going wrong and not receiving that clarification.
</em><br>
<p>The world slides inexorably closer to destruction every day. Seed AI
<br>
programmers and funding are desperately needed. The really good
<br>
people all seem to grasp the basics fine and proceed to argue about
<br>
technical details off list. This takes time, but it's worth responding
<br>
because they're more likely to be useful. Meanwhile, few of the
<br>
people wanting answers on SL4 seem to have large pocketbooks waiting
<br>
to be opened. Given this situation, arguing about stuff on SL4 is fun
<br>
but having the SIAI people spend a lot of time here isn't condusive
<br>
to saving the world. Thus please forgive Eliezer, Tyler etc for not
<br>
answering every question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also think that there are a number of missed opportunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both in the theory and in the attempt at spreading the meme.
</em><br>
<p>Spreading the meme is a risky thing to do, but talk to Michael
<br>
Anissimov if you have a cool idea about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Change in roles? I'm not sure what you mean. I don't want/expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer to change roles. I would like to see him work more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaboratively.
</em><br>
<p>That means supplying Eliezer with someone to work with who would
<br>
actually make him more productive rather than less. The SIAI is
<br>
certainly looking, but I don't know of any candidates yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Relying upon a single point of failure (meaning both a single FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and a single you) is incredibly foolish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is the best strategy we have for now.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say it's my preffered strategy, it's the only strategy we
<br>
have other than funding some utterly random people to work on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Why do you believe that a single FAI is the best strategy?
</em><br>
<p>It isn't, I just haven't seen anyone else qualified to do serious
<br>
work on it. There are a couple of people who might have a good
<br>
chance if they devoted their lives to it, but they're doing other
<br>
critical stuff. And if it's damn hard to find seed AI programmers,
<br>
it's more or less impossible to find FAI researchers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Why do you believe that relying on Eliezer and only Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a good strategy.
</em><br>
<p>Ditto. Lack of competition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I signed up on the seedaiwannabes list when I first joined SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite some time ago...
</em><br>
<p>Someone will presumably do an assessment of you sometime soonish
<br>
then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I'm much too busy to discuss it or even write it up for anybody&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The SIAI is composed of sane people who understand risk management
<br>
and sensible precautions have been taken as far as possible.
<br>
Furthermore as I'm sure you can imagine considerable discussion goes
<br>
on appart from the SL4 mailing list (which I hesitate to refer to as
<br>
the peanut gallery :) ).
