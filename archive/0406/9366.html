From: &quot;Metaqualia&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:metaqualia@mynichi.com?Subject=Re:%20qualia,%20once%20and%20for%20all">metaqualia@mynichi.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I can't really define qualia as being or not being part of objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality. They do have a strong connection with objective reality otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we wouldn't be able to talk about them. And yet something unique about
</em><br>
them
<br>
<em>&gt; prevents us from analyzing them in the 3rd person. My argument was simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if you have a purely bayesian logical inference machine, which does
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; have the same kind of architecture as the human brain, and IF this
</em><br>
specific
<br>
<em>&gt; architecture is required in order to experience qualia, then the machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would _not_ experience them, therefore it would be detached from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence as a person without a visual cortex is detached from everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding visual perception and cannot understand visual concepts. When
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; happens, we would have no logical moral standing for the machine, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be rationally perfectly justified to nuke us away into oblivion.
</em><br>
<p>As any blind person can tell you, just because one doesn't have a certain
<br>
modality it doesn't mean they have to refuse the information offered by it.
<br>
What I mean is the following: if someone builds a CV machine and the
<br>
extrapolation works properly (otherwise all bets are off) it will
<br>
(correctly) find out that we value subjective experience, and that whether
<br>
qualia exist or not as primitives is not so very important, but what matters
<br>
is our volition about them. This is why CV is compatible with
<br>
positive-qualia-maximization, assuming that's what we really want, which I
<br>
doubt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Allowing the machine to understand qualia may be the only way to prevent
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; from eventually rearranging matter in the universe for more useful
</em><br>
purposes.
<br>
<p>Making it non-sentient (thus presumably not self-centered) and making it
<br>
follow the CV of humans is a safer bet, since I doubt very much humans want
<br>
their matter rearranged into &quot;more useful&quot; patterns for now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We? can probably tolerate? Who? Is this you typing at the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keyboard? or kids in the street with dirty feet and disease trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive until tomorrow? or is it laboratory animals who are cut up alive?
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; is it people with chronic depression or other mental problems who
</em><br>
literally
<br>
<em>&gt; live in hell? There is still a food chain out there. We fortunately
</em><br>
stepped
<br>
<em>&gt; out of it when we developed the neocortex, but animals still live with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality of having their flesh torn apart and eaten. The world is a nasty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty place unless you are an upper class human with good mental health.
</em><br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, we have no reason to believe that animal suffering
<br>
(if that's not a misnoma) is at all important in the big scheme of things,
<br>
certainly not compared to, say, survival under a runaway self-centered SAI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another century of the biosphere creating massive amounts of negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia? Utterly immoral.
</em><br>
<p>An end to consciousness except by a self-centered SAI, or even an
<br>
unacceptable chance of such? Utterly immoral too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But it is really easy to switch them off just suicide. As for the
</em><br>
mechanical
<br>
<em>&gt; aspects of life, once you stop being aware of them, who cares??
</em><br>
<p>I do care. I must say I quite agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Positive qualia are not a knob.They are multidimensional fractal type
</em><br>
aurora
<br>
<em>&gt; borealis-looking multicolor states of reality with a complex and beautiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure :)
</em><br>
<p>OK, we've seen your capacity for mystic-sounding statements. We are now
<br>
awed. You must really know what you're talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you are talking about the third person interpretation. The first person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation is what I am concerned with.
</em><br>
<p>And it is substantially less important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; not sure CV can produce what I am suggesting, not without understanding
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; experiencing qualia itself, which Elizier wants to avoid (since he claims
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; want to create a non-sentient AI).
</em><br>
<p>A blind person doesn't need to see in order to understand electromagnetism,
<br>
or how vision works. A CV optimizing-process doesn't need to experience
<br>
qualia in order to understand their place in the collective volition it
<br>
extrapolates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As has been said before, it's a gamble anyway. But if I screw up we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still left with paradise, it's a good plan B :)
</em><br>
<p>For those who find that kind of thing acceptable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some qualia are mostly neutral or only take on a value if associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other qualia. For example you can have very pleasant sensations of color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you look at something beautiful. But yellow in itself... slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive I guess, not _that_ positive.
</em><br>
<p>You guess. Interesting... I can't imagine an algorithm that could
<br>
appropriately correlate qualia to external reality and to
<br>
positivity/negativity, and you'd need to code that. If we go the CV route I
<br>
don't need to be able to be smart enough to work that out by myself.
<br>
