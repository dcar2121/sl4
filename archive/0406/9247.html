Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not my intent to be Orwellian.  But sometimes I invent new ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I have found it best to give them understandable labels. 
</em><br>
<p>But this is exactly the problem - the label you chose was not 
<br>
understandable - to most people beyond yourself.  If a word has a 
<br>
deeply embedded meaning in common speech and you then try to use 
<br>
it in a special way - especially a way that is not just different from but 
<br>
almost the opposite of the normal meaning then you must expect that 
<br>
people will misunderstand what you are saying.
<br>
<p>We already have a term in common usage that covers what you are 
<br>
talking about and it is the notion of acting in an entity's 'best interest'.  
<br>
So I might act in someone else's best interest - possibly even flatly 
<br>
contradicting what that person might say they want.  But my defence 
<br>
will be to say that I understood the way to meet their needs better than 
<br>
they did.  And they can counter-charge that I failed to understand them 
<br>
or that it was none of my business or whatever.
<br>
<p>You want the FAI to act in the best interest of humanity.  Why not call a 
<br>
spade a spade?  You want you FAI to have a &quot;human collective best 
<br>
interest&quot; inference engine.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
<br>

<br>
<p>This is an official notice that I have adopted the English label &quot;volition&quot; 
<br>
to apply to a distinct, novel technical concept: an extrapolated decision 
<br>
(or superposed probable criterions) of a human, human group, or other 
<br>
decisionmaking entity, *after applying a set of transformations* (&quot;knew 
<br>
more, thought faster&quot;, etc.).  The volition may be &quot;short-distance&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;medium-distance&quot;, or &quot;long-distance&quot; as defined in 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?CollectiveVolition">http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?CollectiveVolition</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>The dictionary definition of this term is no longer relevant.  It now 
<br>
possesses a new technical meaning.  Anyone who feels that the new term is a 
<br>
distortion of the Enlgish meaning is free to use the namespaced substitute 
<br>
FAI::volition to emphasize that they are not speaking of the English word 
<br>
&quot;volition&quot;.
<br>
<p>For the love of Belldandy, please do not use this new technical word in 
<br>
other than its new technical sense, the way &quot;Friendliness&quot; went down the 
<br>
drain.  Kidnap your own words.  Don't kidnap my words, after all the 
<br>
trouble I went to kidnap them originally.  There are plenty of other 
<br>
helpless, kidnappable English words to lure into the back of your primer 
<br>
gray GMC van:  &quot;Will&quot;, &quot;inclination&quot;, &quot;intention&quot;, &quot;disposition&quot;, &quot;ideal 
<br>
self&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;wish&quot;, &quot;aim&quot;, &quot;hankering&quot;, &quot;velleity&quot; - whatever best 
<br>
suits your purposes.
<br>
<p>It's not my intent to be Orwellian.  But sometimes I invent new ideas, and 
<br>
I have found it best to give them understandable labels.
<br>
