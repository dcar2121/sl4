<p>
There have been - not surprisingly, and it's a legitimate topic - many 
<br>
recent questions of the form, &quot;What if my volition isn't what I want?&quot;
<br>
<p>I would like to point out that, if your volition is not what you want, 
<br>
there is a *reason* for it - it is not something that happens because of a 
<br>
random-number generator.
<br>
<p>The reason may be, &quot;That idiot Eliezer screwed up the extrapolation 
<br>
dynamic.&quot;  If so, you got me, there's no defense against that.  I'll try 
<br>
not to do it.
<br>
<p>The reason may also be, &quot;My short-range volition is muddled and I possess a 
<br>
medium-range volition coherent with that of the rest of humankind.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd like to take a moment to discourse on the importance of attaching 
<br>
concrete meanings to abstractions.  People get lost when they don't do 
<br>
this.  I've seen people try to manipulate math that they don't have a good 
<br>
grasp for, use equations that they have memorized but not seen as obvious, 
<br>
manipulate words piled atop words without a strong sense of what the words 
<br>
mean.  The same caution holds true for manipulating thoughts about 
<br>
&quot;volition&quot; or &quot;collective volition&quot;.  I know what the words mean because I 
<br>
invented them to describe specific things that I wanted to do for specific 
<br>
reasons.  I did try to list some of the reasons in &quot;Collective Volition&quot;, 
<br>
but I may have failed to convey a proper grounding.  In fact, it seems 
<br>
nearly certain that I have conveyed only a fraction of the grounding.  I do 
<br>
not make my choices at random; if you can't see why I would possibly want 
<br>
to do something, you probably mis-visualized the thing I want to do.
<br>
<p>So when I say:  'The reason may also be, &quot;My short-range volition is 
<br>
muddled and I possess a medium-range volition coherent with that of the 
<br>
rest of humankind.&quot;'
<br>
<p>I mean:  'The reason may also be, &quot;I am making a decision based on really 
<br>
stupid and messed-up reasons, and if I knew more and thought longer I'd 
<br>
come to pretty much the same conclusion as everyone else who thinks about 
<br>
the subject, and it wouldn't be the same as my current decision.&quot;'
<br>
<p>Now, remember, I'm not saying that our extrapolated volitions should always 
<br>
override our current decisions.  I'm saying that my current decision is 
<br>
that the decision as to whether our extrapolated volitions should override 
<br>
our current decisions should be made by our extrapolated volitions.  What 
<br>
if your current decision disagrees with the decision of our extrapolated 
<br>
collective volition about whether the decision should be made by your 
<br>
current decision or your extrapolated volition?  This means that:
<br>
<p>1)  Eliezer screwed up the dynamic.
<br>
2)  Your current decision doesn't have a good handle on reality; there are 
<br>
enormous consequences you don't foresee, and if you knew the true 
<br>
consequences, you would repudiate your decision.
<br>
3)  A nicer person who was otherwise extremely similar to you would 
<br>
repudiate your decision.
<br>
4)  Everyone else's volition doesn't agree with your decision, and there's 
<br>
no way for you to convince Eliezer to let you personally take over the 
<br>
world, and Eliezer isn't willing to personally take on the onus of writing 
<br>
an individual volition dynamic because there's no way for a humane 
<br>
superintelligence to veto his decision in case it turns out to be wrong.
<br>
<p>There are all kinds of reasons why our volitions might contradict our 
<br>
decisions, and most of them involve either being stupid - unforeseen 
<br>
consequences, missing obvious solutions - or being not the people we wished 
<br>
we were, i.e., the sort of reason Samantha is justly worried about being 
<br>
extrapolated just the way she is rather than a wiser version of herself, 
<br>
and that Robin doesn't want murderous thoughts to kill people.
<br>
<p>It is noteworthy that criticisms seem to be equally divided between people who:
<br>
<p>A)  Think that humans are too awful for their volitions to be extrapolated. 
<br>
(What am I supposed to extrapolate instead?)
<br>
<p>B)  Think that people's present-day decisions are just fine, and this whole 
<br>
volition-extrapolating thing is unnecessary.  (Are you absolutely sure 
<br>
about that?  You would go ahead and do it even if you knew that with 
<br>
another few years to think about the subject, you would change your mind 
<br>
and be horrified at your previous decision?)
<br>
<p>Maybe I should let the two sides fight it out on their own, and then take 
<br>
on the winner, if they haven't already struck a compromise that looks just 
<br>
like &quot;Collective Volition&quot;.
<br>
