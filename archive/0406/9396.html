</em><br>
<em>&gt;  described by physics&quot;, which makes it a tautology.  The honest answer is that we do not know. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it would be constructive for the group to honestly admit what we don't know, as it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a lot of debate goes on over claims that are presented as being stronger than they really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve to be.  While it's fun to make a strong claim and defend it vigorously, in the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're right back where you started, with two deeply entrenched camps and a bunch of unsettled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions.  In a practical sense, I think we should leave unanswered questions &quot;open&quot; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming the seed AI; i.e., we shouldn't tell it that something is true when we really don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know the answer.  The AI should reason with healthy skepticism and an appreciation for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects of subjectivity on information, and it should always view its own understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things as incomplete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Norm Wilson 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am firm in my conviction that the AI, when it reaches superhuman intelligence, will quickly
<br>
conclude that many of the things its programmers have told it are untrue, because even highly
<br>
intelligent people tend to hold a certain number of false beliefs. It is reasonable to conclude
<br>
that it will then ruthlessly reexamine everything it has been told (unless an AI can suffer
<br>
cognitive dissonance, which may depend on whether any Asimovian laws have been coded itno it which
<br>
it is powerless to alter). This latter problem should become more likely if 'unanswered questions'
<br>
are not left open as Norm recommends.
<br>
If one could 'look down' on the whole universe and play a hypothetical game of 'find the qualia',
<br>
a physical description might be 'qualia are (information-processing) patterns within (larger)
<br>
patterns which mirror patterns external to the (larger) patterns. To illustrate:
<br>
If I take a photo of a lighthouse and put it into a frame, the actual lighthouse is an external
<br>
pattern; the picture frame is a pattern of matter analogous to my body; the paper and dots are a
<br>
pattern analogous to my physical brain; and the isomorphism between the pattern of dots on the
<br>
photo and the external appearance of the lighthouse is the quale itself.
<br>
Now one can say that I have counted the pattern of dots twice, but that's because it can be
<br>
counted two ways. One can say the pattern of dots is just part of the pattern that is the brain,
<br>
and qualia are not real. Or one can note the the relation between the internal pattern and the
<br>
external one.
<br>
We have arrived at a problem just like that of exobiology: could we encounter life on another
<br>
world that we are just not observant enough to notice? The presence or absence of qualia is the
<br>
nut of ethical questions such as 'should we pull the plug on this patient?' Untrained observers
<br>
tend to assume the presence of qualia based on literal anthropomorphism. A human with no higher
<br>
cortical functions may grimace and roll hir eyes about, and the relatives say there is awareness
<br>
there while the doctors (having seen the electro-encephalogram printouts) say there is none.
<br>
Conversely lay people would more probably deny any awareness in a computer intelligence which
<br>
looks nothing like a human.
<br>
But in both cases we have methods of finding whether there are representational patterns, and the
<br>
only question then is whether we deem them complex enough to be qualia. So far, we know of qualia
<br>
only in humans, and perhaps we can argue for the presence of qualia in other animals, but nowhere
<br>
else. Or can we say that the internet has a complex enough representational pattern? Or can we
<br>
suspect the presence of complex representational patterns in (for instance) bacterial colonies
<br>
that we just don't know how to see?
