<em>&gt; In the initial dynamic?  Yesssssssssss!  Because there's no way in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that your current conscious will is going to understand the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic, much less construct it.  No offense.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I understand. But at the same time, I just don't want to transcend
<br>
yet. And I don't think you have the right to tell me (or program
<br>
something) to make me do that. I suppose that doesn't matter to you
<br>
though if you've thought think far does it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will the successor dynamic do anything without your current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious will? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   My guess is, yes, that is what is wise/benevolent/good-of-humanity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc., 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is to say, if you thought about it for a few years you would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that that was the right decision.  Philip Sutton and some others 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that this is not only unwise, it would be unwise for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic to do anything other than present helpful advice.
</em><br>
<p>Once there is a (virtually) all-powerful, benevolent being, what's the
<br>
hurry to force us what to do? Do you know about a not-so-friendly AI
<br>
traveling at light speed towards us or something? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you write an initial dynamic based on individual volition, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed extensively in the document, you are *pre-emptively*, on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis of your personal moral authority and your current human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing off a hell of a lot of difficult tradeoffs without even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  Such as whether anyone fanatically convinced of a false 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever learns the truth, whether it is theoretically possible for you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to take heroin away from drug addicts, and whether infants grow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans or superinfants.  I do not say that I know the forever answer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these moral dilemmas.  I say I am not willing to make the decision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own authority.  
</em><br>
<p>When you undertake the creation of such a powerful being, you're already
<br>
doing that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, not even for the sake of public relations.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations thingy is a lost cause anyway.  
</em><br>
<p>Well it surely is now. Do you think the politicians and military would
<br>
just hand over their wills, even if you say their &quot;future&quot; selves would
<br>
approve? There's a good chance this concept of yours could get some very
<br>
bad press - and worse - governmental/police/military/whatever
<br>
intervention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, you must correctly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;is-individual?&quot; predicate in &quot;individual volition&quot; exactly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your first try, including the whole bag of worms on sentience and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizenship, because if the initial dynamic can redefine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;is-individual?&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using a majority vote, you aren't really protecting anyone.
</em><br>
<p>I very much doubt, at least initially, humanity would vote to merge into
<br>
a single Jupiter-brain (since 99.5%+ of them aren't Singularitarians), or
<br>
whatever SL4 topic about sentience you wanna throw at me. It's similar to
<br>
many of those improbable moral dilemmas which won't have any application
<br>
in a real world.
