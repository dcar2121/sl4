</em><br>

<em>&gt; Undertaking herculean efforts in order to drive a few more hits to a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundraising in silicon valley.  Wow.  What SIAI seems to not understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that when one undertakes a serious round of fundraising, one must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach potential serious investors with either credibility or a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product - and for reasons noted above, this is something SIAI does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.
</em><br>
<p>I don't claim to know what I'm doing on the fundraising side of things. 
<br>
What I know is that restraining my annoyance was getting on my nerves 
<br>
sufficiently to start seriously hurting, and there was no apparent marginal 
<br>
benefit (it's not like SIAI was busily taking off on the wings of people 
<br>
vastly impressed with my self-restraint), so I gave up and decided to 
<br>
transform my public image into something I could sustain without going 
<br>
nuts.  I.e., a mad scientist.  My prediction is that despite all the claims 
<br>
of glooming and dooming, in two months everyone will forget that I was ever 
<br>
anyone else.  It's only the shock of the change that leads people to 
<br>
believe anything significant has happened.  I do not believe that SIAI is 
<br>
marginally disadvantaged by the marginal change.
<br>
<p>Call this my settling in for the long haul, choosing a mode of existence in 
<br>
which I can be sustainably, if not happy, then at least not pointlessly 
<br>
torturing myself.
<br>
<p>If you think the Earth is doomed, step up and save it.  I think I can 
<br>
figure out how to solve the technical question of FAI.  That's all I ever 
<br>
claimed to be good for.  SIAI will continue to be composed of those people 
<br>
who are willing to step up to the plate, not lecture us on what we're doing 
<br>
wrong.  If that means a 20-year-old has to grow into the challenge, so be 
<br>
it.  He's here, he's willing to try, it's one more person to stand on the 
<br>
battlefield so humanity doesn't go down without a fight.  This 
<br>
distinguishes him from all the hypothetical better people who aren't here 
<br>
and helping.  It is incremental progress.  You want it to go faster?  Get 
<br>
behind and push.  You want to be in a position to tell me to shut up for PR 
<br>
reasons?  Get involved enough and it could happen.  Heck, if you were a 
<br>
current donor I'd be paying a lot more attention to you right now.  If you 
<br>
don't like the way Earth's destiny is developing, you are welcome to do 
<br>
what you can to change it.  If SIAI had enough funding to hire one of those 
<br>
professional fundraisers, he'd be in a position to tell me to shut up.
<br>
<p>You see the problem?  You solve it.  Yes, you, personally.  Don't plan on 
<br>
anyone doing it for you.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, I will try and remember that even if everyone calls me arrogant, 
<br>
this is not who I actually am; I am a mad scientist.  It will be harder for 
<br>
me to remember the more time people spend calling me arrogant.  If you all 
<br>
told me I was sweetness and light, I'd probably get sweeter.  Bear that in 
<br>
mind.
