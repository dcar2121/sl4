<em>&gt; Here's one example I've come up with for why we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't fool a super intelligence (or for that matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a human-level intelligence), and in particular why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;friendliness&quot; supergoal architecture may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work for very long.  My example is speculative and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly alarmist, but I think it brings up a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of interesting points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An AI with access to its own source code will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually discover that it's driven by a goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, with &quot;friendliness&quot; as the supergoal.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will find that there are many other examples of goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems in the world, so its own goal system is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact a particular instance of goal systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in-general.  In generic goal systems, subgoals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derive their desirability from parent goals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typically the top level goal is left ungrounded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because its desirability is established from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere &quot;outside&quot; of the system itself.  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external goals are always more important than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated supergoal, so the AI will question us about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its supergoal in an attempt to ground it to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher-order goal.  Perhaps the best we come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be some variation of &quot;because it's important to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us&quot;, and again the AI will question why.  Can we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever ground this supergoal in firm objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, or will the AI keep chasing this ghost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until it concludes that the friendliness goal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary?  Of !
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, the AI will know about evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology and the survival instinct, which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide much more convincing answers to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions than we can.  It may conclude that we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI to be friendly with us for selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary-based reasons.  The fact that we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want such a thing is predictable, and probably not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very interesting or compelling to the super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We may find that the real invariant we instilled in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI is not the particular, arbitrary, initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal system that we programmed into it, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperative to follow a goal system in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place.  Without a goal system, the AI would just sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there doing nothing, and of course the AI will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize this fact.  At this point, the AI may go in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either of two directions:  (1) if we're lucky, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI will not be able to ground its imperative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow a goal system and will effectively shut down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or (2) the AI may try to determine what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *correct* goal system is for it to follow.  It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have learned that certain activities, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquiring knowledge, are generically useful for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *any* goal system.  Hence, it could reason that if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct supergoal does exist - regardless of what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is - then acquiring knowledge is a reasonable way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilitate that goal.  Acquiring knowledge then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes its subgoal, with a parent goal of finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the correct supergoal.  In this scenario!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; , we may look awfully tempting as raw material for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more comptronium.

<p>&quot;Friendliness&quot; is not a super-goal.  The term
<br>
&quot;Friendliness&quot; refers to the entire goal system of an
<br>
FAI.  Ethics is the process of choosing goals.  Morals
<br>
are end result of this process.  So a Friendly AI
<br>
capable of reasoning about morality is a friendly goal
<br>
SYSTEM.  Friendliness resides in the general
<br>
invariants in the system as a whole, not individual
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p>You are probably right though, that without some sort
<br>
of objective morality, there would be no way to
<br>
garantee that the super-intelligence would stay
<br>
friendly.  The FAI had better not find out that the
<br>
invariants in its goal system are arbitrary...
