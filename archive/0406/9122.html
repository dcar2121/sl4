<em>&gt; With respect,

<em>&gt; a) you couldn't possibly know enough about the SIAI project to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a reasonable guess about the shape of the tasks involved and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    amounts, types and grades of effort required to solve them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A safe bet as I don't believe anyone can make a reasonable guess about 
<br>
this at this time.  To much remains TBD.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) it seems unlikely that you've worked on software projects that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    have successfully invented brand new technology, repeatedly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    throughout the whole project while working within strict safety
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    standards.
</em><br>
<p>Which brings up the question of what your own background is.   What 
<br>
have you worked on that lends authority to your words?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; c) on this project, everyone has to understand more or less everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    that's going on. Keeping the bisection bandwidth down is critical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Those who have worked on real projects know that this is not really 
<br>
possible.  Different people have different skill sets, thinking styles, 
<br>
speed of thinking, creative patterns and so on.  Getting them &quot;on the 
<br>
same page&quot; is usually only very approximately doable for some subset.  
<br>
Whether it is convenient/ideally safe or not, there will be persons 
<br>
involved who are primarily the only ones who understand some aspects of 
<br>
the system.    Especially for pragmatic values of &quot;understand&quot; as in 
<br>
capable of diagnosing problems in depth and fixing/re-designing within 
<br>
critical constraints.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As part of the team you need some of the very best money can buy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people who would command a salary of 250k+/yr in the job market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nearly the whole team will need to be people like that. However even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the cash is available to pay them those salaries, they shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be doing it for the money. This is the end of the world as we know it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if no-one else really feels that in their bones the programmers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must.
</em><br>
<p>Real people at this level of expertise have real lives that require 
<br>
real funds to keep running.  It is not that they are &quot;doing it for the 
<br>
money&quot; as these people could do a lot of easier things &quot;for the money.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;the end is NEAR&quot; tirade  suggesting work for free or little more 
<br>
than subsistence will get true-believer converts but probably not the 
<br>
talent you need.   The end is not that obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How good are your funding projections over the next few years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It isn't possible to make reasonable projections because there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too many high-risk high-payoff operations underway. We can only plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for various possible outcomes.
</em><br>
<p>In short, they suck.   There is no realistic plan, yet.
