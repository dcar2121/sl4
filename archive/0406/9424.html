<em>&gt;Could those who advocate a qualia-based morality please
</em><br>
<p>hmmm ok that's me right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. reality discrimination is suppressed, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. is of much lower fidelity than normal qualia, but still passes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relaxed reality-discrimination tests so that you don't notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything is wrong (and if you occasionally do notice, you quickly forget)
</em><br>
<p>not when in lucid dream mode
<br>
<p>in lucid dreaming you can voluntarily focus on a particular object to
<br>
explore just how real it looks. And it looks _more_ real in the dream than
<br>
in external reality for two reasons:
<br>
<p>A- as you concentrate on some detail that you want to check your attention
<br>
shifts to that point and all your knowledge of what that should look like is
<br>
activated, therefore nothing is out of focus or only partially represented
<br>
<p>B- in real life you are limited in your perception by the way in which a
<br>
particular thing looks like in that particular moment from that particular
<br>
angle, while in a lucid dream all your knowledge about that object is
<br>
recalled; I remember a flying scene in particular which was a lot more
<br>
intense than any other waking sensation I can recall, I even had a &quot;touch&quot;
<br>
sensation for the shape of the mountains below, it was complete sensory
<br>
overload.
<br>
<p>In &quot;normal&quot; dream mode I can still recall having very vivid sensations. In
<br>
particular erotic scenes in dreams are usually a lot more intense than in
<br>
reality; there are some details which seem to lack detail at times but i
<br>
guess how much detail goes into every object is determined by how important
<br>
it is in the dream, its emotional meaning, and so forth...
<br>
<p>When you start focusing on a piece of an otherwise low-resolution thing in a
<br>
normal dream, most times the object transforms because things are not as
<br>
stable as in a lucid dream, so I have no way to say if A isn't really at
<br>
work in regular dreams too...
<br>
<p>It is possible that low-resolution things out there in a non-lucid dream
<br>
occur when conflicting areas of the brain are activated, for instance, what
<br>
happens if CUP+APPLE are activated? would you see a murky applish cup kind
<br>
of shape?? In this case lucid dream and the kind of consistency boost it
<br>
gives the dream could be explained in the following manner: normal dreams
<br>
allow conflicting neural patterns to be realized, while in lucid dream as in
<br>
real life conflicting data is shut down to allow more robust pattern
<br>
recognition. This could affect qualia directly since the particular
<br>
configuration of firing that creates a particular quale is interfered with
<br>
by other competitive firing patterns.
<br>
<p>so that's what I had to say about dreams being 'less real'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How should it evaluate whether these advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outweigh the disadvantages (if any)?
</em><br>
<p>coming back to your question, I think what you are asking is: should the AI
<br>
reduce the accuracy with which we perceive reality, and make us less &quot;in
<br>
sync&quot; with the external world, so that it can more effectively control the
<br>
balance between positive and negative qualia in a larger number of
<br>
sentients?
<br>
<p>I think that the ability to do very abstract and precise abstract reasoning
<br>
may indeed be reduced, unless the machine discovers that when taken to
<br>
extreme efficiency it generates very nice qualia. In humans, doing
<br>
mathematics etc. does not generate intense pleasure like imagery and other
<br>
stuff can. But this is just how we are wired _now_, there may be a way to
<br>
couple up solving theorems with psychedelic (but physically meaningful)
<br>
qualia, if so the machine would be motivated to not get rid of higher
<br>
cognitive abilities but take them from the abstract level to the perceptual
<br>
level (give us a quale-generating modality for them). For instance, take the
<br>
Dr Who titles with the strange special effects. They looked pretty cool. A
<br>
quale for some mathematical formula may feel like that (with more immersive
<br>
quality).
<br>
<p>So my compressed answer is: at present we can process data in two ways, the
<br>
perceptually boring way (programming, solving theorems) and the perceptually
<br>
intense way (pain sensations, appreciating beauty, etc) -&gt; taking
<br>
perceptually boring mental processes to the perceptually intense level would
<br>
be a neat thing that would give us cooler, more varied, and intense qualia.
<br>
On the other hand reducing accuracy would have negative consequences.
