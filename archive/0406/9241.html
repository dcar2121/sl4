Hi John,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that’s what I think is so crazy because we come right back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same problem, evolution only sees general problem solving, that’s the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only thing that enhances survival, so if they (intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness) can be separated what’s the point of consciousness? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That’s why I said if I though that was true I’d become a creationist. 
</em><br>
<p>I think that the way evolution works, at least in more complex animals, 
<br>
is that survival-pressure results in a set of capabilities and inbuilt 
<br>
motivations, and some of these take on a life of their own and become 
<br>
further developed - to the limit imposed by the need to survive.
<br>
<p>Some monkeys (eg. maques) have a rather complex caste system and 
<br>
the monkeys invest a large amount of their time and brain space to 
<br>
playing power games or protecting themselves from the impacts of 
<br>
power games.  I think it is arguable that the survival of the *group* 
<br>
doesn't benefit so much from this activity, but because the power 
<br>
games are linked to higher level of biological reproduction the genes 
<br>
that underpin the power game capability and predisposition do well.  (ie. 
<br>
the behaviour favours a subset of genes, not the genes of the whole 
<br>
clan - arguably the subset of genes are parasitic on the survival 
<br>
capability of the clan).
<br>
<p>In humans we have taken this even further and now in many societies 
<br>
the power games have become separated from biological reproduction 
<br>
- effective power-gamers might actually have smaller families (or 
<br>
none).
<br>
<p>So it's possible that consciousness has emerged and developed as a 
<br>
by-product - first as an enhancement that facilitated adaptibility and 
<br>
then through reproductively useful mind games and then as a turn-on in 
<br>
its own right.
<br>
<p>If this is so then consciousness is a form of intelligence but not all 
<br>
intelligence requires consciousness.
<br>
<p>Which is all very interesting!  What might this mean for FAI and the 
<br>
collective volition - does an FAI need to be not only intelligent but also 
<br>
adaptable and creative?  If so it might be that it needs or will exhibit 
<br>
consciousness as a byproduct.
<br>
<p>Eliezer wanted the FAI to be NON-conscious so that it didn't create 
<br>
simulation agents that were alive (ie. clones of real humans) which 
<br>
would be turned on and off as the FAI explored different issues.
<br>
<p>But I'm not sure that this is the right conclusion.  If an AGI is NOT 
<br>
conscious it may not be adaptible and creative at the whole-system 
<br>
level.  In this case the only way for it to come up with the goods on 
<br>
human volition then is to bury the necessary intelligence below the 
<br>
whole-system level ie. within the simulation agents.  This then creates 
<br>
'living' simulation artifacts - which is what Eliezer wanted to avoid.
<br>
<p>If the creation of 'living' simulation artifacts is to be avoided then the 
<br>
FAI will need instead to be very creative and adaptible at the whole-
<br>
system level - which means that most likely it will be conscious!
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
