On Fri, 4 Jun 2004 &quot;Randall Randall&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:randall@randallsquared.com?Subject=Re:%20Sentience%20%20[Was%20%20FAI:%20Collective%20Volition]">randall@randallsquared.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer intends  to build a very intelligent goal-oriented system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is explicitly *not* a person.
</em><br>
<p>That’s Eliezer’s intention but he will never have a way to know if he was
<br>
successful. At one time it was thought that human beings that had a lot
<br>
of pigment in their skin were not really people so it was OK to enslave
<br>
them. I believe assuming an intelligence, in fact an intelligence vastly
<br>
superior to our own, is not a person because it is made of metal not meat
<br>
is equally mistaken and will lead to similar tragic consequences. 
<br>
<p>Now no doubt Eliezer will have a theory that makes him think that however
<br>
intelligent the machine is it is not really conscious, but is his theory
<br>
right? There is no way to know. Consciousness theories are a dime a dozen
<br>
and there is no way to test any of them.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Someone arguing against this idea, pre-calculator, might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  very well point out that if a machine could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  answer math questions, like a person, then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  must have mental states that correspond to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  intermediate steps of the calculation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  having mental states presupposes personality.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, some might have argued that point, but as for me my rule of thumb is
<br>
that if something acts like a person it probably is. I can’t prove it of
<br>
course but it seems to work pretty well when I use it on my fellow meat
<br>
creatures and I see no reason to modify it if the creature is made of
<br>
something else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before you once again argue that sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must either be unimportant or an automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feature of intelligence, you might want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the possibility that general problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solving, like (some forms of) math, can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefully separated from personality.
</em><br>
<p>If I was convinced that was true I would have to become a creationist,
<br>
I’d have no alternative because I would have absolutely no way to explain
<br>
how random mutation and natural selection produced at least one creature
<br>
that had personality and consciousness, me.
