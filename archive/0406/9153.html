Hi Brent,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having followed some of the recent volition discussions I thought it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be interesting and appropriate to have codified (specified as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal?) into the (yet to be developed) fai's interaction with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients protocols a 'right of withdrawal' 
</em><br>
<p>I think/feel that you have a very good idea here. I guess it's the 
<br>
principle of tolerance that exists in some well-functioning democracies.  
<br>
Everyone counts, communities of people add a lot of value to isolated 
<br>
individuals but if a particular community is not to your taste you are free 
<br>
to be part of another one - but each community must abide by the rule 
<br>
that they will not oppress the other - ie. do things to them that that the 
<br>
aggreived society *really* does not want.
<br>
<p>It could be that some humans (or other sentients) choose to forgo 
<br>
many/most of the 'benefits' that others see coming from the new age.  
<br>
But this response may *not* be conservatism, it might be that some 
<br>
people want to choose different evolutionary paths into the future - ie. 
<br>
what some see as an improvement others may not.  So coercive 
<br>
'improvement' of others is not allowed.
<br>
<p>The really tricky bit (as always) is how do you make sure that 
<br>
individuals and communities do *not* do each other harm (some 
<br>
preventive coercion is presumably requiredhere from a 'higher' 
<br>
authority - ie. the collective governance) so how do you stop people 
<br>
trying to slip coercive 'improvement' of others in under the guise of 
<br>
preventing harm or slipping in harmful actions to others under the guise 
<br>
of claims of self-determination?
<br>
<p>This is where wisdom is required - not only of individuals , but also of 
<br>
our governance systems.
<br>
<p>I guess the ultimate safeguard comes from individuals or communities 
<br>
perceiving actual or threatened harm and then challenging the 
<br>
dominanct system to notice, acknowledge and respond productively to 
<br>
their perception.  In our society non-violent action is probably the most 
<br>
effective last-ditch defence.  Have a look at Gene Sharp's ideas to get 
<br>
the sense of what I mean: <a href="http://www.aeinstein.org/">http://www.aeinstein.org/</a>
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
