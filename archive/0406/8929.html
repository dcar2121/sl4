</em><br>
<p>The last question strikes me as irrelevant; insofar as I understand these 
<br>
matters, it is not only unnecessary to convince people that their volition 
<br>
represents their personal opinion, it is actively harmful.  I'd guess that 
<br>
no one should ever be told what their volition is.  If they argue, they are 
<br>
driven away from a good answer.  If they accept, you have an infinite 
<br>
recursion problem, where the volition asks what you'll think when you grow 
<br>
up, and the volition can return any answer, and you'll accept it because 
<br>
hey, it's your volition.  Like a time travel paradox where the inventor of 
<br>
the time machine goes back and tells herself how to do it.  It looks 
<br>
straightforward enough to choose an order of evaluation that prevents this 
<br>
in the volition, but you see the human problem?  Also, your volition will 
<br>
probably spread, and the answer given one that satisfices the spread, 
<br>
possibly not a *best* answer for any real individual.  And collective 
<br>
volition runs on many superposed spreads, not any individual volition.
<br>
<p>If this causes young humans to indignantly reject the collective volition - 
<br>
what, it's claiming to act on our behalf, and we can't even be told what 
<br>
our volition is? - that might also be a good idea.  A devout atheist like 
<br>
myself would hate to have created someone's God, and it probably wouldn't 
<br>
be good for humanity.
<br>
<p>But that is all speculation, so let us return to your right and proper 
<br>
question about dynamics.
<br>
<p>Let me toss your question back to you:  What do you think a devout 
<br>
Christian should be said to *want*, conditional upon Christianity being 
<br>
false?  Fred wants box A conditional upon box A containing the dimaond; 
<br>
Fred wants box B conditional upon box B containing the diamond.  What may a 
<br>
devout Christian be said to want, conditional upon Christianity being 
<br>
false?  I can think of several approaches.  The human approach would be to 
<br>
*tell* the devout Christian that Christianity was false, then accept what 
<br>
they said in reply; but that is the Christian's reaction on being *told* 
<br>
that Christianity is false, it is not what the Christian &quot;would want&quot; 
<br>
conditional upon Christianity being false.  If the Christian is capable of 
<br>
seriously thinking about the possibility, the problem is straightforward 
<br>
enough.  If not, how would one extract an answer for the conditional question?
