<p>
Volition:
<br>
The act or an instance of making a conscious choice or decision, the 
<br>
exercising of one's will
<br>
A conscious choice or decision.
<br>
The power or faculty of choosing; the will.
<br>
<p>If some entity works out what I should do and then it makes it happen, 
<br>
then this is not me 'exercising my will'.  It is not *my* volition that is 
<br>
expressed.
<br>
<p>To talk about a super powerful AI being driven by the collective volition of 
<br>
humans - where the expression of the original human will is radically 
<br>
transformed by the AI, into a form that the humans supposedly 
<br>
represented might not be prepared to own if they were offered the choice, 
<br>
is not collective volition.  It is in the fact *denial* of collective volition.
<br>
<p>It's a bit scary to think that a 'F'AI might change the world/universe against 
<br>
our will and say that it was enacting our collective volition.  But this type of 
<br>
inversion of language is common in dictatorships.  Which is why George 
<br>
Orwell's Ministry of Peace was so funny/not funny.
<br>
<p>Instead of using the term 'collective volition', it might communicate the 
<br>
intention more accurately to call it something like: &quot;AI morality transformed 
<br>
from an extract of human morality&quot;. (I know, it's not a very sexy term! 
<br>
Sorry)
<br>
<p>I think the best way to work with human volition is to feed insights from 
<br>
FAI back into the actual real human community and for those humans to 
<br>
exercise their volition by taking on or not the externally provided insight.  If 
<br>
an FAI is massively intelligent and technologically powerful my guess is 
<br>
that it could be *very* effective as an educational force without needing to 
<br>
dictate to human society.
<br>
<p>(If coercion is to be applied to particular humans to stop them being 
<br>
destructive then I think the wider human society needs to sanction that 
<br>
coercion.)
<br>
<p>If we see FAI as an educator (rather than a coercer), then it's worth 
<br>
thinking about how people learn best.  One really powerful way is learning 
<br>
by doing (and reflecting on learning while doing).  If FAIs wanted to 
<br>
maximise their educational effect they could do this by working with 
<br>
humans on all sorts of things that humans do.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
