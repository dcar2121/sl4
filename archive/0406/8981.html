</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disagreement here comes down to basic differences on the the need of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity to be saved versus enhanced... 
</em><br>
<p>I think you've hit on a key issue here.
<br>
<p>My own feeling is that human volition (the extended Eliezer version) is 
<br>
an complexly *evolving* thing and hence in a complex world cannot be 
<br>
fully predicted (ie. the only accurate model is the future that actually 
<br>
unfolds in reality) - so trying to *fully* predict and then *impose* a 
<br>
comprehensive rational collective human volition is a futile effort 
<br>
technically.  In any case even if collective human volition could be 
<br>
accurately modelled humans wouldn't believe it - especially if it was 
<br>
imposed and they would revolt.
<br>
<p>So the practical course I think is to use modelling (done by clever AI/ 
<br>
optimisation processes, people, etc.) to create some improved degree 
<br>
of insight into collective human volition and to - in the spirit of what Jeff 
<br>
suggested - work with people to help them develop wiser courses of 
<br>
action.  I think that Jeff's model of &quot;giving people the tools they can use 
<br>
to bottom-up decide their own evolving direction&quot; is basically the way to 
<br>
go.  
<br>
<p>If people/advanced intelligences/optimisation processes (or whatever) 
<br>
discover somebody about to turn the world into grey goo they should 
<br>
arrange for those people to desist - but otherewise comprehensive 
<br>
benevolent coercion is not, in my opinion, the way to go.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
