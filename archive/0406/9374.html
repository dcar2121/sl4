<em>&gt; Yes, the &quot;overall subjective impression&quot; is not to be continously replaced
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; newer selves, but subjective impressions of humans are frequently
</em><br>
incorrect, for
<br>
<p>point is, it doesn't matter. correct or incorrect _that_ is how we
<br>
experience existence. This is the datum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Shouldn't a theory about the nature of qualia predict a result of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment? If you don't actually have this kind of theory to explain what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia are, how can you realistically draw conclusions about their
</em><br>
relevance?
<br>
<p>no because in this experiment you have a correspondence problem, which does
<br>
not need to be solved in order to do the kind of maximization/minimization I
<br>
propose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My method, treating qualia as a functional adaption, predicts the result
</em><br>
rather
<br>
<em>&gt; trivially. According to it, if you duplicate a human, the two resulting
</em><br>
<p>Still the third person perspective, which does not create an arrow of
<br>
morality but only bits floating around in trivially existing space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why should I trust your understanding if you don't have a qualia
</em><br>
hypothesis that
<br>
<em>&gt; makes clear predictions about the result of relevant experiments?
</em><br>
<p>I am not saying I have complete understanding of qualia and the &quot;I&quot;, no one
<br>
does. The only thing I am saying is that the existence of subjective states,
<br>
whatever they are, creates an arrow of morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I still don't know how you calculate the balance. You already stated that
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; isn't calculated by simply adding the &quot;goodness&quot; (positive or negative) of
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt; qualia perceived anywhere in spacetime. I'd like to know the formula or at
</em><br>
least
<br>
<em>&gt; the basic principle you use to arrive at the conclusion that the balance
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unfavorable&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>1. For every being, positive qualia must greatly exceed negative qualia in
<br>
kind and intensity
<br>
2. Negative qualia above a certain threshold are not acceptable no matter
<br>
what kind of positive rewards are allotted in return.
<br>
3. The worst-off sentient is chosen as representative to evaluate the
<br>
system's score. Which means that 1 million happy people + 1 miserable person
<br>
= miserable score
<br>
4. Conundrums in which you have to choose between creating one wretched
<br>
person to satisfy millions of other beings must be avoided at all cost, this
<br>
is probably possible if you have atomic control over matter.
<br>
5. The least amount of interference is preferred. First level of
<br>
interference is with the being's environment. Only when the sentient's
<br>
neural substrate has been proven _incapable_ of substaining a favorable
<br>
qualia balance, no matter what the external conditions, is the System
<br>
allowed to perform small but crucial modifications to the being's qualia
<br>
apparatus.
<br>
<p>As for the rest of the ideas that you have presented, I think you are
<br>
basically looking at the problem from a third person perspective; I can see
<br>
it from that perspective too and then all you are saying is correct. Just
<br>
qualia are subjective that's the whole point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;without you really existing&quot; - What is existence? I don't see any reason
</em><br>
to
<br>
<p>Existence is only observed directly. Existence manifests itself as pure
<br>
existence, it is not something you analyze from the outside. Existence
<br>
occurs when you perceive something consciously and it creates a quale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in &quot;feeling concern for the state of another being&quot; is just an emotion, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional adaption of evolution. IIRC The Moral Animal stated that it was
</em><br>
<p>Are you seriously misunderstanding the real meaning behind my usage of the
<br>
verb &quot;to care&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I don't share your opinion of certain qualia being objectively
</em><br>
morally
<br>
<em>&gt; good or bad, I'm certainly not pleased with having a death clock of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 150000humans/day ticking in the background. I agree that there are a lot
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; serious problems, but rushing a solution with the potential to make
</em><br>
everything
<br>
<em>&gt; orders of magnitude worse is not a good idea.
</em><br>
<p>Who is rushing? We are discussing things here. We're all looking for a way
<br>
not to screw up. I just think I'm right that's all. I think that the
<br>
difference in basic stance between us (I accept and embrace the first person
<br>
perspective while you want to reduce it to 3rd person data) will lead to two
<br>
different currents of thought. And if you keep your stance and I keep mine
<br>
that's the end of it. The universe would be much simpler if I could also
<br>
take your stance however whenever I see RED I see the unexplained hit me in
<br>
the eye.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no idea how you would calculate the balance of goodness given all
</em><br>
qualia,
<br>
<em>&gt; but if we screw this up we lose our only chance of fixing everything. Food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chains have existed for millions of years, and humans have existed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands, another hundred more is not going to cause any irreparable
</em><br>
damage. An
<br>
<p>A lot of _independent_ qualia stream are going to be created during that
<br>
time. Your argument is equivalent to : since so many people have died of
<br>
hunger in the past, a million more or so won't make such a big difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; lost. Permanently. Rushing into this is gonna make things worse, for
</em><br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>Don't TOTALLY agree on the permanent, there may end up being one big (U)FAI
<br>
or there may be many, the known cosmos may end up being dominated by one
<br>
monolithic AI or there may be a diverse fauna of agents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And why do you suppose that's the case? I'd like a theory that allows me
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; explain the good-/badness quotient of old qualia, and predict that of new
</em><br>
ones
<br>
<em>&gt; given certain data about the qualia.
</em><br>
<p>That's what Chalmers wants to do. We will find physical differences in the
<br>
processes that create different qualia, hopefully.
