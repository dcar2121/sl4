<em>&gt; You're asking good questions, and the process of asking these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly accurate questions will lead to increasingly accurate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The vector sum of current human volition is not wisdom.  It's not even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an early approximation of wisdom.  In fact, it's currently badly skewed.
</em><br>
<p>There is no such thing as the vector sum of &quot;current human volition&quot;.  You 
<br>
are speaking of the vector sum of &quot;current human *decision*&quot; which, I quite 
<br>
agree, would be disastrous to hook up to an SI (or RPOP).  A volition is 
<br>
extrapolated beyond the self of this moment; a *collective* volition 
<br>
extrapolates a planet beyond the selves of this moment, and cannot be 
<br>
regarded as a vector sum of individual volitions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The vector sum of current human volition does not represent wisdom, let 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone embody wisdom. Acting as if it did would invite disaster, given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current state of human development.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, provided that you are talking about the vector sum of current 
<br>
human decision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answers you seek do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist yet, no matter how deeply and widely one might be able to probe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the collective human psyche.
</em><br>
<p>You cannot read out the volition from an LED display on the back of 
<br>
someone's neck; it has to be extrapolated.
<br>
<p>Decision is not volition.
<br>
Volition is not decision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are no pointers, maps, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformations of this collective data that could be directly applied 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the solution you (we all) seek.   The current data set is strongly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skewed toward short term, local scope thinking.
</em><br>
<p>If I had any doubt before that you were speaking of &quot;decision&quot; rather than 
<br>
&quot;volition&quot;, it would be gone now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answers do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in the current data set but we can expect they will emerge only as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part and result of the process.
</em><br>
<p>...the process which a &quot;collective volition&quot; attempts to extrapolate, yes, 
<br>
that is the whole idea of collective volition, getting an extrapolated 
<br>
approximate satisficing advance answer to the process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, wisdom is present within the collective landscape, but most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity perceive and consider only a small portion of the whole, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answers you seek within it require a broader scope of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.  The seeds exist but they have not yet grown, and it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to see the tree without planting, nurturing, and waiting for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the seeds to grow.
</em><br>
<p>And you know this... how?  It sounds very wise and I suspect it simply 
<br>
isn't true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To model the collective volition of humanity is a worthy goal, not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extract from it the ideal human volition, or even an a starting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation of the ideal, but for the purpose of better understanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and contributing to the process that will get us wherever we will be in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future.  There is much work that can be done to improve the process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity getting closer to its evolving goals, but progress will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made by building upon the foundations of morality rather than futilely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparing to prune a unique and yet unknown tree when it is still a seed.
</em><br>
<p>A collective volition doesn't prune.  It extrapolates and superposes 
<br>
uncertainties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is moral, in the minds of people of disparate backgrounds, tends to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converge as their understanding and interests broaden.
</em><br>
<p>This is an assertion that the *collective volition* tends to cohere more 
<br>
than the vector sum of decisions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As the scope 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expands to include broader space of interaction, broader range of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interacting parties, and broader time period being considered, &quot;what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral&quot;, tends to converge into an ever clearer sense of shared 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction.  You can only get there by performing the interactions -- a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of sufficient accuracy would take just as long to run the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation as the reality
</em><br>
<p>Again, I think this sounds wise and simply isn't true.  Here you are, 
<br>
making all sorts of abstract predictions about the collective volition 
<br>
without running the simulation!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- but you can extract principles of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful interactions along the way and apply these principles toward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;promoting the good.&quot;
