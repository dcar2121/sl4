</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, provided we limit the case to human morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A few of these rational free thinkers sensed that there was still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; something missing.  Rationality is bounded by knowledge, and a new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; level of enlightenment arose in which people began to realize a need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for wisdom within uncertainty.  Some of these people were mistaken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for mystics, but rather than abandoning rational thought, these newer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thinkers worked to incorporate rational thinking into a larger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; framework that acknowledged, and even welcomed uncertainty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you mean &quot;logical thinking&quot; not &quot;rational thinking&quot;.  Rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, in the modern, Bayesian sense of the term, is precisely the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework that correctly handles uncertainty.  Hence expected utility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Bayesian probability.  We know exactly how uncertain we are; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Way is still a precise art, a dance rather than a walk.  (Calmly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing the source of your uncertainty and the rules that govern your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance is sometimes mistaken for &quot;overconfidence&quot; by those who know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the Way.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Mathematical statistics (of the frequentist sort and more recently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Bayesian) were joined by newer concepts of entropy and theories of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information and incompleteness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;joined&quot;, I presume you mean that people (example: E.T. Jaynes) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed that the concepts of entropy and information were special cases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Bayesian probability theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; More recently, concepts of uncertainty and randomness are being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; overtaken by ideas of chaos and complexity, and rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; free-thinkers are discovering some of the inherent limits of modeling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and prediction with finite computational resources.  We're finding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that much of the really interesting stuff can't be modeled or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; predicted and the only way to determine the end result is to actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; play it out.  *This changes the focus of the game away from modeling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and extrapolation, and towards understanding  what freedoms (points 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of influence) are available to us in order to create an always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolving and unpredictable future.*  These new concepts do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; replace, but encompass and extend the previous paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The new concepts are special cases of the previous paradigm.  The Way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is yet a precise art.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I offer this as a necessarily abbreviated and simplified history of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the development of rational thinking on the human scale, and also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perhaps the development of individual thinking among members of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; list growing up within that knowledge environment.  Although 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; overstated, perhaps &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; applies here 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What has this to do with AI morality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The key summary statement is near the end, enclosed by asterisks.  It 
<br>
refers to a more practical approach to progress in terms of human 
<br>
morality. 
<br>
<p>More explicitly, reinforcing some of my previous messages on this topic, 
<br>
I suggest that an approach based on modeling/extrapolation followed by 
<br>
top-down feedback will be found to be impractical, and that real 
<br>
progress can be achieved via a more bottom-up approach involving better 
<br>
understanding and facilitating of existing human system dynamics.
<br>
<p>I am also suggesting, in the closing segment of my post that you didn't 
<br>
include or comment on, that the thinking of some smart young idealistic 
<br>
rational free-thinkers is still in the phase of believing that such a 
<br>
top-down understanding is both possible and effective, and that as they 
<br>
gain &quot;context&quot; their world view will develop to a higher level where 
<br>
interdependence is seen as essential for robust growth.
