‘Debunking Hippy-Dippy moral philosophy’
<br>
<p>Marc Geddes, 2nd June, 2004
<br>
<p>It's fashionable in this post-modern age to say that
<br>
morality is just a matter of opinion, just something
<br>
'made up'.  People just don't think that morality is
<br>
something with objective answers.  A lot of it
<br>
probably dates back to the philosopher David Hume, a
<br>
fairly radical skeptic who seriously questioned the
<br>
power of reason.  It was Hume who famously said:  'You
<br>
can't derive an ought from an is'.  And of course all
<br>
the modern pop-philosophers and moral relativists will
<br>
trot out Hume's tired old dogma to bolster their
<br>
(opinion!) that morality is all just a matter of
<br>
opinion. 
<br>
<p>But have the moral subjectivists seriously stopped to
<br>
consider what their philosophy actually implies? 
<br>
Consider this question:  Whose morality was better: 
<br>
Mahatma Gandhi’s or Adolph Hitler’s?   If you believe
<br>
that morality is just personal opinion what you are
<br>
saying is that they are objectively both equivalent. 
<br>
It's just a matter of opinion and there is actually no
<br>
real objective moral difference between them.  Hitler
<br>
was no better or worse than Gandhi.  You may object
<br>
that this is a ridiculous caricature.  No it isn't. 
<br>
It is exactly what is implied by the idea that
<br>
morality is just something made up.  If you believe
<br>
that morality is just something made up, you are
<br>
saying that there is no objective sense in which
<br>
Hitler was worse than Gandhi.  But who in their right
<br>
mind seriously believes this?
<br>
<p>The Humean claim that 'You can't derive an ought from
<br>
an is’, and therefore you can't reason to objective
<br>
answers about morality is a piece of pop-philosophy
<br>
which has obtained the status of a modern
<br>
superstition.  Hume's claim has about as much
<br>
credibility as the idea that the Earth is flat.  Hume
<br>
had an extremely limited conception of reason.  His
<br>
conception was strictly axiomatic:  he thought that
<br>
reasoning consisted of deriving conclusions from
<br>
axioms.  Of course modern methods of reasoning (like
<br>
Popperian epistemology or Bayesian reasoning) are not
<br>
confined to axiomatic methods at all.  Instead of
<br>
regarding reasoning as a hierarchy, reasoning can be
<br>
considered to be a network, with competing
<br>
probabilistic conjectures which draw on support from
<br>
each other.  These powerful modern reasoning methods
<br>
are not subject to Hume's critiques of reason, and
<br>
therefore his claim: 'You can't derive ought from is'
<br>
is a non sequitur.  Of course using axiomatic
<br>
reasoning you can't derive ought from is, but
<br>
non-axiomatic methods of reasoning don't need to rely
<br>
on deriving moral ought's from is's.   You can
<br>
formulate conjectures about morality, and then weigh
<br>
up competing explanations to see which conjectures
<br>
best fit with other knowledge about world.  Objective
<br>
conclusions can be drawn.  So the Humean
<br>
pop-philosophers are wrong.
<br>
<p>Another major objection to the idea that morality
<br>
could be objective is the fact that human morality
<br>
varies greatly from culture to culture.  If human
<br>
morality could be so varied, argue the
<br>
pop-philosophers, how could it possibly be objective? 
<br>
The mistake here is elementary.  If morality is
<br>
objective, then morality and knowledge about morality
<br>
are two different things.  There is the objective
<br>
referent 'morality' and then there are the subjective
<br>
human 'theories about morality'.  Take gravity as an
<br>
analogy.  Gravity is something which objectively
<br>
exists.  Prior to understanding gravity, there were
<br>
many different competing ideas about it.  Even after
<br>
Isaac Newton understood it, scientists continued to
<br>
refine the theory and argue about different competing
<br>
ideas.  Eventually Einstein's General Relatively
<br>
superceded Newton, and to this day competing theories
<br>
of gravity continue to be formulated and improved
<br>
upon.  Our knowledge of gravity is what is changing,
<br>
gravity itself does not.  And so it can be with
<br>
morality.  There might be wide variation in our
<br>
opinions about morality, but the nature of the
<br>
objective referent 'morality' is independent of what
<br>
our opinions about it may be.  Thus there is no basis
<br>
for the claim that the variation in human morals
<br>
disproves objective morality.  
<br>
<p>Modern subjectivists have another scheme:  they might
<br>
concede that morality is not just a matter of
<br>
individual opinion, but then they'll say it's a
<br>
'Social Construct'.  They rightly repudiate moral
<br>
relativism, but then they try to define the referent
<br>
'morality' as a sort of aggregate feature emerging
<br>
from all the sentient minds on the planet.  No longer
<br>
is morality just a matter of personal opinion.  The
<br>
scheme superficially looks like it gives some measure
<br>
of objectivity to the 'morality' concept.  They can
<br>
now talk about a 'Universal Morality' (the social
<br>
construct of humanity), a referent external to
<br>
individual minds.
<br>
<p>But it's pseudo-objectivity.  It's the hippy-dippy
<br>
mistake writ large.  If we try to take the opinions of
<br>
humanity as a whole as making up some sort of
<br>
'Universal Morality', morality is still just a matter
<br>
of opinion, only now it's the aggregate or summation
<br>
of individual opinions.  If the Nazis had won World
<br>
War II and say 80% of the world's population was
<br>
eventually indoctrinated into believing Nazi dogma,
<br>
would it be reasonable to regard Nazism as moral? 
<br>
Surely not.  It's moral philosophy by opinion poll. 
<br>
Perhaps subjectivists might counter that by morality
<br>
they mean the best in people, or what people would
<br>
believe if they thought longer or faster, were wiser
<br>
etc.  But by what standard would they define 'best'? 
<br>
Why would it be good if people thought 'longer or
<br>
faster’?  What is 'wisdom'?  It would seem that an
<br>
objective morality is still implied.
<br>
<p>We have seen that the hippy-dippy ideas that morality
<br>
is just a matter of opinion or perhaps some kind of
<br>
'social construct' are incoherent.  Reasonable people
<br>
must conclude that morality is something objectively
<br>
real, something that we can use reason to discover. 
<br>
The first thing we should objectively declare is:  No
<br>
more hippy-dippy moral philosophy please!
