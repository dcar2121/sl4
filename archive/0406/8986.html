</em><br>
<p>Oh, c'mon, you can't possibly believe I'm doing this to attract followers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite the reverse.  Now that there's three people in the Singularity 
<br>
Institute, it's time for people to get used to the fact that I AM NOT 
<br>
PERFECT.  One hell of a badass rationalist, yes, but not perfect in other 
<br>
ways.  I'm just here to handle the mad science part of the job.  It may 
<br>
even be that I'm not very nice.  Altruistic towards humans in general, yes, 
<br>
but with a strong tendency to think that any given human would be of 
<br>
greater worth to the human species if they were hung off a balloon as 
<br>
ballast.  So frickin' what?  I'm not SIAI's PR guy, and under the new 
<br>
edition of FAI theory, I don't have to be perfect.  Everyone get used to 
<br>
the fact that I'm not perfect, including people who have long thought I am 
<br>
not perfect, and feel a strong need to inform me of this fact.  I'm not 
<br>
perfect, and it doesn't matter, because there are other people in SIAI than 
<br>
me, and I'm *not* a guru.  Just a mad scientist working happily away in the 
<br>
basement, who can say what he likes.  Believe it, and it will be true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It can attract followers who are not as brilliant but who like being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant too and take the cue from their arrogant guru to behave 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly, even though they are less justified in having such a good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option of themselves.
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my experience, clever people are not always clever *all* the time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are not always right *all* the time.
</em><br>
<p>Then I shall aspire to be cleverer than those not-very-clever people whom 
<br>
you experienced.  And cleverer than my past self, who was foolish enough to 
<br>
make mistakes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it is very useful for clever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to be mindful of that and open to other people's ideas and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactions which may alert the brilliant ones to errors, gaps, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally less than brilliant ideas.  I think it is hard to be in mindful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode and over-weening arrogance mode at the same time - even for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clever people who can multitask.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're flat wrong.  Arrogance and humility are not opposites.  They 
<br>
are separate human capacities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if getting the science as good as it can be is a priority and doing it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast is important then some moderation in arrogance might be helpful.
</em><br>
<p>Nah.  I ain't buying this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And also an organisation that is dominated by somebody who is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncontrollably and severely arrogant is likely to develop disfunctional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendencies that can cause it to perform suboptimally and thus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jeopardise its mission.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I've been watching SIAI's dynamics and I don't think I'm the Sole 
<br>
Guy any more.  Tyler Emerson and Michael Anissimov are going to scream at 
<br>
me about this, and I'm doing it anyway because I'm guessing that public 
<br>
relations simply don't work the way people think.  But in any case, I'm not 
<br>
going to be &quot;uncontrollably and severely arrogant&quot; like people who build 
<br>
huge successful business empires.  I'm just going to be an impish, bad-boy 
<br>
mad scientist.  That's my new public image and I'm sticking to it.
