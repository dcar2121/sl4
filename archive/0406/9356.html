<p>The nature of  humans and other evolved creatures is that pleasurable 
<br>
feelings result from *getting* to the goal, not *having* the goal.  It's 
<br>
what keeps us moving, not satisfied.  Pleasure is part of the reward 
<br>
system that serves the overall goal of growth and reproduction.  It's 
<br>
there because it's a solution that works, not as an end in itself.
<br>
<p>As discussed before, we now have the technology to produce the feeling 
<br>
of pleasure within an organism, independantly of achieving any goals.  
<br>
We can do this with electrical or chemical modification of brain 
<br>
operation.  If you were to query that organism's state, it would respond 
<br>
that it is experiencing great pleasure.  However, there would be no 
<br>
incentive to growth or sustainability, and the pleasure would be 
<br>
relatively short lived.
<br>
<p>So, some would say, let us have the artificially induced pleasure, but 
<br>
modify our nature such that we continue to do all the things we normally 
<br>
do to sustain our lives and our living.  Then ask yourself, what would 
<br>
your motivations be?  You would be equivalent to a machine, in the sense 
<br>
of no internal purpose, all internal goals satisfied and simply 
<br>
following a program.
<br>
<p>So, some would say, let us have constant pleasure, but let it be varying 
<br>
degrees of pleasure, such that we are motivated to interact with our 
<br>
friends, love others, and inspired to create.  Well, then you would be 
<br>
right where you are now, with only a shift in viewpoint.
