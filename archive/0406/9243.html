Marc -
<br>
<p>I was quite aware of the glaringly illuminated (and humorous) pithole of 
<br>
a trap left in the ultimate sentence.  That's why I threw in the phrase 
<br>
&quot;if you look closely&quot; as a friendly warning not to fall in and mistake 
<br>
the wrapper for the content. 
<br>
<p>If you look closely at the concept I was describing (not my final 
<br>
meta-comment) about it,  I think you will not find any ought from is.  
<br>
You'll just find a rather rough and terse description of how morality 
<br>
tends to spread in scope and converge in direction.
<br>
<p>This concept of the &quot;Arrow of morality&quot; is useful because it shows that, 
<br>
while we can not point to any objective morality and say that is our 
<br>
goal, we can find shared values based on &quot;what works&quot; which are 
<br>
ultimately grounded in a sense of the term &quot;survival value&quot;, or perhaps 
<br>
more accurately &quot;growth&quot;.
<br>
<p>There appear to be some universal principles that describe &quot;growth&quot;.  
<br>
These principles are not well known or well thought-out, AFAIK, but 
<br>
could form the basis of a science of complex system dynamics that could 
<br>
be profitably applied to human endeavors at all scales.  I think these 
<br>
principles will include some of the following:
<br>
<p>A useful operational definition of Self and Other.
<br>
The value of Other for the growth of Self.
<br>
The value of diversity for growth.
<br>
The value of the &quot;adjacent possible&quot; for growth.
<br>
A useful working understanding of cooperation, synergy, etc.
<br>
A useful working understanding of the evolution of complex structures...
<br>
<p>These would form a useful set of &quot;moral teachings&quot; &lt;wink&gt; for the future.
