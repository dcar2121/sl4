Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A)  Think that humans are too awful for their volitions to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolated. (What am I supposed to extrapolate instead?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B)  Think that people's present-day decisions are just fine, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole volition-extrapolating thing is unnecessary.  (Are you absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure about that?  You would go ahead and do it even if you knew that with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another few years to think about the subject, you would change your mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and be horrified at your previous decision?)
</em><br>
<p>I would say this polarity completely misconstrues much of what people 
<br>
are saying.  I doubt that many people on the list think that humans have 
<br>
no redeeming features (pole A) or that humans are perfectly fine as 
<br>
they are (pole B).
<br>
<p>For example, in my own case I have devoted the last 30 years or so to 
<br>
trying to change the ways that humans act.  I *don't* think that a lot of 
<br>
what humans do is great.  I want to see humans change quite a lot of 
<br>
the things they do quite a lot.  And I want to see the changes happen 
<br>
quickly.
<br>
<p>But I think it's very important *how* you go about changing things.
<br>
<p>You seem to have a very strong dislike of 'politics' - seeing it as 
<br>
irrational and nasty etc.  Quite a bit of 'politics' is like of course.  But to 
<br>
choose to not understand poltical processes is to turn your mind away 
<br>
from critical *knowledge* and is therefore a good way to make your 
<br>
ideas unworkable and vulnerable.
<br>
<p>If you do not have an effective powerbase amongst humans, then you 
<br>
will find that David Dukes prognostication could well come true: 
<br>
&quot;There's a good chance this concept of yours could get some very
<br>
bad press - and worse - governmental/police/military/whatever
<br>
intervention.&quot;  That is if terrorist and crime groups don't get to your 
<br>
system first so that they can use it for domination.
<br>
<p>Also 6 billion people (quite powerful general inteligences, for all theor 
<br>
faults) feeling tetchy about your proposed coercive collective volition 
<br>
machine can form a very powerful swarm that could halt the project 
<br>
and the machine even if it has become very powerful (but not yet 
<br>
omnipotent). (eg. a very clever human can still be killed by a swarm of 
<br>
very stupid viruses.)
<br>
<p>But getting back to the theory.
<br>
<p>Somebody's will belongs to themselves - it only has meaning if it is 
<br>
manifested by *that* person.  A collective will can only exist if a 
<br>
collective of actual people form a group decision.
<br>
<p>Anything else is simply a guess.
<br>
<p>I can't know what my future will will be till I become my future person.
<br>
<p>I might try to guess my future will and then act on it.  But by that action 
<br>
I convert my guess at my future will into my actual current will.
<br>
<p>If anyone else tries to guess my future will or the future will of a 
<br>
collective of humans all they are doing is guessing.  If they impose this 
<br>
guess they are dictating to real people who have a real will that has 
<br>
been denied.
<br>
<p>Most people don't like being dictated to.  And many people resist this 
<br>
imposition. There are however a few cases where people agree to the 
<br>
dictation of the group interest over their personal will and that usually 
<br>
relates to issues of security and safety.  But most people like to be able 
<br>
to directly influence or control the process by which they cede control 
<br>
and they like to have the ability to withdraw the delegation if it is being 
<br>
exercised in a way that they don't approve of.  If an FAI is to be 
<br>
acceptably involved in coercion is should be as part of a process 
<br>
whereby real people exercise their actual current will to empower that 
<br>
FAI to act in certain circumscribed ways nd circumstances.  And this 
<br>
granting of power should be reversible or modifiable by a due process.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
