<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That’s Eliezer’s intention but he will never have a way to know if he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful. At one time it was thought that human beings that had a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pigment in their skin were not really people so it was OK to enslave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. I believe assuming an intelligence, in fact an intelligence

</em><br>
<em>&gt; meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is equally mistaken and will lead to similar tragic consequences.
</em><br>
<p>Not only is no one arguing that the material of composition
<br>
is essential to consciousness, but I find it hard to imagine
<br>
that anyone on this list would believe that it is so.  That
<br>
argument is a straw man; there is no need to refute it again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now no doubt Eliezer will have a theory that makes him think that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent the machine is it is not really conscious, but is his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right? There is no way to know. Consciousness theories are a dime a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there is no way to test any of them.
</em><br>
<p>Yet.  The hallmark of a good hypothesis will be that
<br>
it *is* testable.  I don't have one, but I'm not willing
<br>
to insist that it's logically impossible that one exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Someone arguing against this idea, pre-calculator, might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  very well point out that if a machine could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  answer math questions, like a person, then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  must have mental states that correspond to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  intermediate steps of the calculation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  having mental states presupposes personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, some might have argued that point, but as for me my rule of thumb 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if something acts like a person it probably is. I can’t prove it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course but it seems to work pretty well when I use it on my fellow meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures and I see no reason to modify it if the creature is made of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, and unless and until there is a working theory
<br>
of consciousness, that's a good rule.  No argument there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Before you once again argue that sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; must either be unimportant or an automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feature of intelligence, you might want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consider the possibility that general problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; solving, like (some forms of) math, can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; usefully separated from personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I was convinced that was true I would have to become a creationist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I’d have no alternative because I would have absolutely no way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how random mutation and natural selection produced at least one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that had personality and consciousness, me.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea why that is your position.
<br>
<p>How is this different from a statement that you
<br>
&quot;would have absolutely no way to explain how random
<br>
mutation and natural selection produced at least one
<br>
creature that can metabolize alcohol&quot;?
<br>
<p>Without understanding the process spaces of
<br>
consciousness and intelligence, how can you
<br>
know how likely it is that a random intelligence
<br>
would be conscious?  I see no reason to assert
<br>
that problem-solving ability must always be
<br>
associated with consciousness.
