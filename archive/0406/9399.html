How in the world would you apply &quot;reasonable&quot; to &quot;intuition&quot;?  Either
<br>
&quot;morality&quot;  can possibly be defined for some group (like humans) with
<br>
enough objectivity to make its consideration useful or it is useless
<br>
to worry over a word we attach no real meaning to.   I believe that
<br>
morality is objectively definable within the context of a particular
<br>
group of sentients and perhaps all sentients.   But that is a minority
<br>
position here.   The problem does not get better by assuming that a
<br>
poll of humanity or extrapolation of human/&gt;human intent/volition.  I
<br>
can agree that CV may give better guidance over some types of
<br>
planning/decisions than morality or what passes for morality for most
<br>
folks.
<br>
<p>Conflating morality and CV is a mistake that I don't see Eliezer making.  
<br>
<p>BTW, your notion of SM people and their desires is very out of whack.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Wants and needs are not something that have &quot;morality&quot; so speaking of
<br>
the morality of wants and needs is meaningless.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world really need anyone to 'run' it? Not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocating anarchy, I'm just pointing out that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole idea of a singeton centralized agent might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misguided. In any event the way the world seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work in the modern free market democracies is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are assigned status roughly acccording to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talent and latent cognitive abilities. For instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childen have fewer rights than adults, brilliant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adults who create good products end up with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic power etc. Since FAI would have cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities far beyond an ordinary human, it's not clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why it would be wrong for the FAI to be given the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that rights necessarily increase based on a
<br>
quantitative increase of some aspect of an entity whose rights are
<br>
being derived.  Rights, like morality, can only be tied to reality
<br>
through considering the nature of the entities we are talking about. 
<br>
Rights of the &quot;unalienable&quot; kind are those things required for the
<br>
well-functioning of the type of entity.  It is not a matter of &quot;more&quot;
<br>
rights but of different rights for different types of entities.   The
<br>
rights of entities will intersect on those rights deriving from more
<br>
or less intersecting aspects of their nature.   It is possible that a
<br>
vastly greater intelligence would require by its nature more rights
<br>
than we do, but since rights are in the interaction of entities I do
<br>
not see that it is necessarily so.
<br>
<p>The realm of morality is also the realm of inter-entity activity.  
<br>
This is a smaller and more delimited sphere than that potentially
<br>
covered by CV.
