<em>&gt; The nature of  humans and other evolved creatures is that pleasurable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings result from *getting* to the goal, not *having* the goal.  It's
</em><br>
<p>yes, that is why going for your goals gets you nowhere you have to push the
<br>
button instead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can do this with electrical or chemical modification of brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation.  If you were to query that organism's state, it would respond
</em><br>
<p>yes, but imperfectly and it's not socially accepted nor within the reach of
<br>
an individual or animals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that it is experiencing great pleasure.  However, there would be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive to growth or sustainability, and the pleasure would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively short lived.
</em><br>
<p>pleasure is not short lived, stimulation of pleasure is short lived for
<br>
evolutionary reasons. You can sustain pleasure indefinitely as wirehead mice
<br>
show.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, some would say, let us have constant pleasure, but let it be varying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees of pleasure, such that we are motivated to interact with our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends, love others, and inspired to create.  Well, then you would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right where you are now, with only a shift in viewpoint.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good to me, what about replace the pleasure/pain scale with a
<br>
pleasure/more pleasure scale. or with a pleasure1/pleasure2 scale.
<br>
<p>There is a lot of variation between individuals as far as the basic level of
<br>
happiness is concerned. If you look at human beings who are mostly upbeat
<br>
and euphoric they do better in life than those who are always pissed off, on
<br>
the average, since they have better social skills.
