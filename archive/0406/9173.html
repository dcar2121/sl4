<p>Then I misunderstood your concept of CV; thank you for clarifying.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather, the FAI views its own decision process as an

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is no guarantee that an AI with this type of decision process would
<br>
epitomize what I consider human friendliness to be.  You had &quot;human
<br>
friendliness&quot; as a first approximation of Friendliness in your former
<br>
writings, thus the word choice: Friendly.  You seem to be redefining
<br>
Friendliness as an approximation of CV.  You might as well rename it CVAI,
<br>
because its relationship with human friendliness has become tenuous.
<br>
<p>You seem to be assuming that CV and friendliness are strongly positively
<br>
correlated, but present no basis/evidence for this assumption.  If I
<br>
understand your assumption correctly, do you have any support for it?  In my
<br>
experience people's decisions bear little correlation with friendliness, and
<br>
appear to be made from a mix of selfish and altruistic motivations.  What
<br>
benefit would we derived from creating an CVAI rather than an FAI?
<br>
<p>CV would appear to be a useful theory, and if realized as a *process* would
<br>
provide useful data on how humanity might make decisions, but it doesn't
<br>
sound in the least bit friendly.  I suggest that if it did turn out to
<br>
approximate &quot;human friendliness&quot; better than a very friendly human would,
<br>
then it would be an accident.  I do not expect humanity's collective
<br>
volition to be friendly.  Do you expect it to be friendly?  If so, why?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *If the FAI works correctly*, then the existence of an FAI is transparent
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Transparent in what sense?
