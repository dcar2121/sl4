<em>&gt; There is a tendancy for &quot;what works&quot; to proliferate over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore shared values and accompanying moral judgments tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proliferate over time. (Broadening over time)
</em><br>
<p>Your analogy only very loosely applies. There is a tendency for new methods
<br>
to proliferate over time, some will work, some won't. Therefore values
<br>
remain fragmented. There is also a tendency for new groups to be created
<br>
over time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a tendency  toward increasing complexity and greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (problem solving ability) in the universe.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency toward increasingly discovering what works, and what works in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one place is likely to work in another place.  As above, this tends
</em><br>
<p>Complexity creates variation and with variation you have a range of personal
<br>
and group conditions which create many different &quot;sets&quot; of things that work
<br>
and that don't work. What works in a place for someone won't work in another
<br>
place for someone else. What works for a terrorist is to hop on a plane and
<br>
fly into a building, this won't work for high school students... This
<br>
division didn't exist before the invention of airplanes so that is one
<br>
example in which the advance of intelligence created two different
<br>
conditions where there used to be only one.
<br>
<p>Anyway the point with morality is that we decide what's right, not what
<br>
works. What works is to be a selfish and deceptive bastard! Always worked,
<br>
like clockwork :)
