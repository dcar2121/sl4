</em><br>
<p>To say that morality is `influenced' by evolution is like to say that a 
<br>
falling rock is `influenced' by gravity.  It might be true, but it 
<br>
eliminates all explanation of what's going on.  The only reason we can 
<br>
even talk about falling rocks is because of gravity.  Similarly, the 
<br>
only reason we can talk about morality is because during evolutionary 
<br>
history a certain sense of desirability lead to greater reproductive 
<br>
success than no sense of desirable behavior.  And the only reason we 
<br>
can talk about talking about morality is because an evolutionary 
<br>
adaptation at some point in human evolutionary history allowed humans 
<br>
to think about their own behavior and think about why some behaviors 
<br>
might be more desirable than others.  Like everything with humans, 
<br>
evolution didn't just `influence' it; evolution made it possible!
<br>
<p>As far as environment `playing a role', it's well established that 
<br>
environment molds the behaviors of a particular organism *within* the 
<br>
framework of its evolved adaptations, so again, `playing a role' is 
<br>
understating things.  In fact, I'd argue that there is no separation 
<br>
between environment and evolution---it's all evolution!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never said that memes and feedback were evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against evolutionary psychology.  What I said was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary psychology is simply insufficient as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of human behaviour.  Knowledge from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological evolution is insufficient to obtain a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of human psychology.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I think your creating a nature/nurture division, but calling it 
<br>
evolution/environment.  It's all the same story and there's little 
<br>
reason to pull it apart.  The only place I see to meaningfully make a 
<br>
division is between ancestral environment (the EEA of a species) and 
<br>
the current environment as it may differ from the ancestral 
<br>
environment.  If there's no difference, we have little to get excited 
<br>
about.  If there is a difference, as is certainly the case with humans, 
<br>
then something interesting may happen, again as is the case with 
<br>
humans.  But regardless of a difference between the environment now and 
<br>
then, evolutionary psychology is still able to provide a complete 
<br>
explanation because, remember, evolutionary psychology would otherwise 
<br>
be known just as psychology today if the Darwinian revolution had hit 
<br>
that field 50 years ago.  Evolutionary psychology encompasses all of 
<br>
psychology, but from an evolutionary perspective.
