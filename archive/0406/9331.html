</em><br>
<p>One human, one vote; so I intend to write the dynamic.
<br>
<p>If you guess that stupid, evil people will have less influence on those 
<br>
around them, or, hey, become less stupid and evil, as humanity grows - I 
<br>
certainly hope so.  Otherwise I'd ask for the moral justification why not, 
<br>
with one finger on the off switch, were I the Last Judge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it seems to me that if we restrict our attention to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best, brightest, most altruistic etc , the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics of these people are likely to 'ballon

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>More likely, you'll get something that very vaguely and distantly resembles 
<br>
an interim stage humanity goes through at some point, considered as 
<br>
individuals.  Our collective volition might never be that stupid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never said we exclude everyone else, I just said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that for the purposes of a first approximation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CV it would seem reasonable to restrict our attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the best, brightest, most altruistic humans etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For more accurate approximations we would then expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pool of people to be considered for a random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sample.
</em><br>
<p>If you mean that asking me for my personal philosophy is likely to get you 
<br>
a *better* approximation of a CV than asking Britney Spears, then you are 
<br>
probably right; but *hopefully*, Marc, the CV will be wiser than us *both*. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It'd be frustrating to do all that work, and then find out that I could 
<br>
have taken over the world and done as good a job.  And boring, if the world 
<br>
were so dull and prosaic as my wildest imaginings.
<br>
<p>The initial dynamic itself runs on (takes a deep breath) one human, one vote.
<br>
<p>If an RPOP wanted a good first approximation for a sample, it'd pick a 
<br>
hundred humans most a-priori likely to be informative about the largest 
<br>
clusters in the set of final extrapolated volitions, and then extrapolate 
<br>
out their volitions from that starting point.  Contrary to your intuitions, 
<br>
Marc, this means using 100 ordinary folks.  And then you extrapolate those 
<br>
people knowing more, thinking faster, growing up farther together; which 
<br>
may or may not arrive at an interim point vaguely reminiscent of Eliezer 
<br>
Yudkowsky before the extrapolation moves on.  Probably not.  The 
<br>
circumstances that forged me are too unusual.  The same would hold of those 
<br>
other geniuses that one might consider.  By the time a majority of humanity 
<br>
zips past the Einstein milestone for raw intelligence, they may have grown 
<br>
in other ways that would render Einstein a pointless comparison.  If you 
<br>
are someday as bright as Newton I do not think you will become an 
<br>
alchemist, and I do not think you will linger long at Newton's marker.  I 
<br>
am not a symbol of an extrapolated Indian day laborer who knows more, 
<br>
thinks faster.  I am myself.  Just myself.  One human, one vote.
<br>
<p>Look to the best, brightest, most altruistic humans, and you will find that 
<br>
they no longer come up with elaborate justifications for why they should be 
<br>
philosopher-kings.  Even if it is cleverly disguised.
