<em>&gt; &gt; I think that, as a first principle, sentient beings should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be allowed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their free choice, and issues of &quot;collective volition&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only enter into the picture in order to resolve conflicts between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different sentience's free choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what if you are horrified by the consequences of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice in 30 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?  How much thought did you put into this before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deciding to make it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the eternal law of the human species?  Are you so confident 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the power of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your moral reasoning, oh modest Ben?
</em><br>
<p>The basic principle of democracy (which is based on choice, not
<br>
extrapolated volition) has been around a long time, I don't claim to
<br>
have invented it.  Modern democracies work, pretty much, by letting
<br>
people do what they want except when their wants collide, in which case
<br>
a hodge-podge of moral principles and pragmatic considerations are used
<br>
for conflict resolution.  I don't always like the results but I find
<br>
them sorta acceptable, preferable to what I see coming out of other
<br>
governmental systems on Earth today or historically.
<br>
<p>Extrapolated volition based FAI is as much like fascism as it is like
<br>
democracy --- fascism being a political philosophy in which the will of
<br>
the individual is, in principle, subordinate to the will of the state
<br>
which is understood to represent the greater good.  In fact the will of
<br>
the state, in fascism, is supposed to represent what people SHOULD want,
<br>
and in some fascist theorists' writings, what the WOULD want if they
<br>
were freed of the damaging illusions plaguing their minds.
<br>
<p>I am confident that the majority of Earthlings would vote for democracy
<br>
over extrapolated-volition-based AI-control.  But of course, this is a
<br>
silly statements, since &quot;voting for democracy&quot; presumes that democracy
<br>
already exists ;-)  You could argue that, even if people would vote for
<br>
democracy now, their future selves wouldn't want them to... etc. etc.
<br>
etc.
