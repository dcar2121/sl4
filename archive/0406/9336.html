It doesn't require people to be uploaded exactly, but the difference
<br>
may be subtle.    If we had full physiological records including
<br>
mental backups and MNT, it shouldn't be possible to rebuild a
<br>
duplicate body and reinstall the full mind state as of the recording.
<br>
<p>A more sublte variant would be a techno-reincarnation into some
<br>
different body (possibly infant) with some &quot;essence&quot; of the mental
<br>
state of the person, possibly with the ability to regain more of the
<br>
lost state.
<br>
<p>Neither of these requires actual uploads.   If the recording methods
<br>
were subtle enough (full nanotech should be able to handle it), people
<br>
would not necessarily know they had been scanned.   Of course you
<br>
would like to have their permission.

<em>&gt; Hi Samantha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that having backups would be a good thing if there's a coercive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective 'volition' machine at work.  But it seems to me that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies people would have to have been uploaded.  I find it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine a rewind button working on humans who have not been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you do in relation to people who don't wish to be uploaded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you think they should be forceably uploaded or would you favour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them being allowed to opt out of the regime of change run by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercive collective 'volition' machine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers, Philip
</em><br>
