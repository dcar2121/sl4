<em>&gt; It seems to me that it is a cardinal point whether survival is a key
</em><br>
value,
<br>
<em>&gt; or only a key value in the preponderance of positive qualia.
</em><br>
<p>Preponderance of positive qualia is achievable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The human mind is a rather complex system (an understatement) an
</em><br>
essentially
<br>
<em>&gt; the fulfilling of people's material needs does not ensure (perhaps not
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; tend to) the preponderance of positive qualia. People find all sorts of
</em><br>
good
<br>
<em>&gt; (and bad) reasons to be unhappy.
</em><br>
<p>So that is why you must target happiness directly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not this type of action I'm referring to. Rather, it's the action of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who sacrifices his life to safe a perfect stranger, for example,
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; some other similar case you can imagine. Something which, coinciding with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's goal system, is however a positive qualia minimizer, at least
</em><br>
locally.
<br>
<p>Humans are imperfect positive qualia maximizers. what is your point?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, altruism can be a source of negative qualia, in the individual as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the social level, so that's why I was asking whether you'd advocate its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction.
</em><br>
<p>only in a zero sum society, only with imperfect technology and scarcity of
<br>
resources, only with legacy darwinian wetware. you can do better than that.
<br>
You can be altruistic and feel good about it, because being altruistic in a
<br>
world reshaped to maximize positive qualia, resources are boundless and
<br>
giving does not subtract from what you have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me put it this way: you can 1) modify the environment and slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modify the human mind so that happiness is atainable and roughly
</em><br>
corresponds
<br>
<em>&gt; to the achievement of goals which overlap the collective volition or
</em><br>
<p>sounds good enough to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can modify the human mind so that happiness becomes necessary (id est,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever happens the subject will be happy). I would argue that, under any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable objective goal system (I am doubtful that qualia are as
</em><br>
objective
<br>
<em>&gt; as you think they are, but that's a whole other matter) 1 is a superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice.
</em><br>
<p>The reason humans intuitively prefer #1 is that they are unable to
<br>
completely step outside their goal system and see that as long as the
<br>
positive qualia are substainable and expandable without real technical
<br>
limitations, the circumstances surrounding the &quot;physical&quot; world are utterly
<br>
unimportant.
<br>
<p>Oh my god, a world with the quale for raising children but without actual
<br>
children! What an abomination (since children won't actually _exist_ and my
<br>
DNA will not actually duplicate).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The key issue as I see it is the issue of necessity: if you modify people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that they are no longer able to be unhappy, you have removed the
</em><br>
basis
<br>
<em>&gt; for happiness to have any meaning. Under my current goal system, that has
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; high negative utility.
</em><br>
<p>The meaning of happiness is not dependent on unhappiness! read the FAQ on
<br>
chapter 4 on paradise-engineering.com
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, maybe I'm not smart/knowledgeable/good enough to see the truth in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your argument. In such case, collective volition could sort it out and set
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; qualia-maximizer (or whatever compromise of qualia-maximization is found
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; be best) as a successor dynamic.
</em><br>
<p>IF in fact the initial collective volition has any grasp of what qualia are,
<br>
which at this point is not at all obvious. It needs to have a hardcoded
<br>
instruction that it will figure out qualia before making moral decisions,
<br>
this is my definition of friendliness bootstrapping
