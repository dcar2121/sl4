<em>&gt; I wasn't denying that people live in pain, but only that life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant bliss is ultimately life without meaning.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is one of the biggest issues here, which is: do we want to be
<br>
always happy? Hell yeah! Who wants to be miserable? If you do, then you can
<br>
start your enclave of conservative retro-darwinian types, and see how many
<br>
sentients voluntarily join. My guess is that there wouldn't be anyone around
<br>
real soon except those who do not want to try the alternative.
<br>
<p>It seems that accepting pain is an act of emotional strength, while it is
<br>
actually an act of emotional weakness. By Justifying and Rationalizing pain
<br>
we manage to reduce the amount of pain we experience by a tiny speck. But if
<br>
we do have a serious chance of dealing with the existence of Evil squarely,
<br>
and with nanotech and AI we do, then it is an act of moral cowardice to pass
<br>
out on the opportunity. Screw present pain. Yeah, let's face it; shit
<br>
happens and there isn't even a reason why! Shit happens and it could have
<br>
been avoided! Shit happens and it doesn't make you a better person, no more
<br>
than good things happening could make you a better person. That's what evil
<br>
is, just evil. You don't get free consolation from the fact that yea it had
<br>
to happen, or some other kind of mystical consolation of which the false
<br>
meme &quot;being always happy is meaningless&quot; is the #1 example.
<br>
<p>I have a friend who is always happy. Everyone wants him around because he is
<br>
just fun to be with. He jokes, honestly appreciates people, is empathic and
<br>
euphoric. Shit happens to him. He gets well real soon. His basal dopamine
<br>
level is very high; he's as happy as supermario in the bonus level.
<br>
Sometimes being too euphoric creates problems for him. For example he can't
<br>
stand still and turns off some more serious people at work. But he has
<br>
hundreds of friends. He is the living proof that we can be happier and enjoy
<br>
it, and the lack of great suffering and depression does not diminish the
<br>
value of life at all.
<br>
<p>[Furthermore, I remind you of the urgency of first helping out those beings
<br>
who live in constant pain, before we sort out the desirability of different
<br>
types of heaven....]
