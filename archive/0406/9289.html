<em>&gt;&gt; You were assuming that there would be absolutely

</em><br>
<em>&gt; No I don’t assume that at all, there is a correlation and it’s exactly

</em><br>
<p>You are saying the same thing he is.
<br>
<p>Is it your contention, then, that if an objective morality
<br>
exists, it will necessarily have nothing to do with any
<br>
current human morality?  That, supposing the existence of
<br>
morality which has physical consequences like, say, gravity,
<br>
humans will turn out to have no ability to measure the
<br>
morality of an action?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The meter is supposed to indicate objective morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; By definition it would not indicate that something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'horribly evil' without very good reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By definition? Objective good is supposed to be an end in itself and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete in itself, it needs no reasons. The true saint is supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do good because he should do good, not because it will aid him or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody else.
</em><br>
<p>The term &quot;objective&quot; presupposes evidence, and therefore, a &quot;reason&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If putting on a green hat on Thursday really had no consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for you or anyone else, the meter could not possibly designate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this as 'horribly evil'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The positive or negative consequences to a person are irrelevant, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have nothing to do with it, good and evil are objective not subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember. The meter says putting on a green hat on Thursday is evil and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that’s just the way things are, it’s like complaining that a voltmeter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reads 6 volts. However if that is true then I see no reason not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil. I mean, what’s so good about objective good?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;People have nothing to do with it&quot; is a specific hypothesis
<br>
about an objective morality, and your confident assertion that
<br>
this is so contradicts your assertion that no such thing exists.
<br>
<p>That doesn't mean that the concept of objective morality is
<br>
self-contradictory (though it may later be shown to be), merely
<br>
that this particular straw man is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; a German living in Nazi Germany might have checked the meter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; about Nazism and the dial might have swung to 'horribly evil'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The suffering produced by Nazi Germany mean nothing because good and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil are not subjective, so the meter could just as easily say it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderfully virtuous, and that is why I have no use for such a meter.
</em><br>
<p>All your arguments work equally well to 'prove' that there
<br>
is no such thing as an objective temperature.
