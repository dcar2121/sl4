<p>Yes, that is correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And this is supposed to be safer than

</em><br>
<p>You suppose it is not possible to fuck up the task of creating an

independent humane SAI?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The Judge of Last Resort must

</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is one major *difference* between a independent humane SAI and a 
<br>
collective volition.  You can always shut off a collective volition if you 
<br>
desire to do so is not muddled according to a collective volition that has 
<br>
no built-in tendency to rationalize or self-protect on that type of 
<br>
extrapolation.  The question is one of simple fact, and it is just, &quot;Are 
<br>
the people who say 'No!' still going to agree with that decision in a few 
<br>
years?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Else it is a the biggest one time gamble in history.
</em><br>
<p>I expect it's the biggest one-time gamble in the history of any given 
<br>
intelligent species that makes it that far.  Whichever road you choose, 
<br>
it's still the biggest gamble, ever.  That is why I take it seriously, and 
<br>
why I think that certain others are not taking it seriously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Including human infants, I assume.  I'll expect you to deliver the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exact, eternal, unalterable specification of what constitutes a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;sentient&quot; by Thursday.  Whatever happened to keeping things simple?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not required.  Being able to shut down the optimization if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets wildly out of hand is required.
</em><br>
<p>Current plans call for around three off-switches:
<br>
<p>1)  The programmer verification process, viewing the dynamics;
<br>
2)  The Last Judge, viewing the outcome;
<br>
3)  The ability of our collective decision to shut down the collective 
<br>
volition providing our collective decision is not defined by the collective 
<br>
volition as muddled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this can't be done why on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth would anyone trust you or a hundred persons equally bright and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with excellent intentions to not fuck it up drastically?
</em><br>
<p>It has to be reduced to a pure technical issue.  It's not a question of who 
<br>
deserves trust.  It's a question of what safeguards you can take.  The 
<br>
former question is not solvable and not helpful; the latter question is 
<br>
solvable and helpful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Could you please elaborate further on all the independent details you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would like to code into eternal, unalterable invariants?  If you add 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enough of them we can drive the probability of them all working as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expected down to effectively zero.  Three should be sufficient, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; redundancy is always a good thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all.  Make sure everyone is backed up at all times and give them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free choice but with nudges/reminders/more grown-up advise at whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level each one is willing/desirious of taking.
</em><br>
<p>So, you and Brent Thomas can fight it out about which of these is the One 
<br>
Fundamental Right we all need, and then I'll take on the winner?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Set things up so they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't do themselves in ultimately (although it make look like they can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them).   Keep it going long enough for each to grow up.
</em><br>
<p>I do not think we are so wise, as to decide this thing.  Too many 
<br>
unforeseen consequences.  We can't evaluate the real effect of our actions, 
<br>
as opposed to the imagined effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's not about public relations, it's about living with the actual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; result for the next ten billion years if that wonderful PR invariant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; turns out to be a bad idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead we live with an original implementation of EV extraction and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision making for the next 10 billion years without any possibility of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reset or out?  Hmm.
</em><br>
<p>No, hence the whole distinction between initial dynamic, successor dynamic, 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Not under your system, no.  I would like to allow your grownup self 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and/or your volition to object effectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that being exists only within the extrapolation which may in fact be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; erroneously formulated.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  If you fuck up the extrapolation, you're screwed.  If you try to 
<br>
build in a separate emergency exit, and you fuck up the emergency exit, 
<br>
you're screwed.  If you build an independent humane mind and you fuck that 
<br>
up, you're screwed.  Hence, keep it simple, and keep it technical, because 
<br>
on moral problems you can fuck up even if everything works exactly as planned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I suppose that if that is the sort of solution you would come up with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; after thinking about it for a few years, it might be the secondary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dynamic.  For myself I would argue against that, because it sounds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like individuals have been handed genie bottles with warning labels, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and I don't think that's a good thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Genie bottle with warning labels AND the ability to recover from errors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't be so bad.
</em><br>
<p>It would be a total shift in human society and an enormous impact on every 
<br>
individual.  Maybe we want to take it slower than that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The title of this subject line is &quot;fundamentals&quot;.  There is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fundamental tradeoff that works like this:  The more *assured* are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such details of the outcome, even in the face of our later 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reconsideration, the more control is irrevocably exerted over the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; details of the outcome by a human-level intelligence.  This holds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; especially true of the things that we are most nervous about.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more control you take away from smarter minds, for the sake of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; own nervousness, the more you risk damning yourself.  What if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Right of Withdrawal that you code (irrevocably and forever, or else 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; why bother) is the wrong Right, weaker and less effective than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Right of Withdrawal the initial dynamic would have set in place if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hadn't meddled?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not unless you design the system so that eternal damnation is possible! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Without the ability to opt-out or try something different or recover 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from any and all errors eternal damnation will always be possible.
</em><br>
<p>Collective volition has this, and it is one of the primary motivations. 
<br>
And yes, this requires that the initial dynamic work satisfactorily, just 
<br>
as any other method requires that the technical solutions work satisfactorily.
