Hi Samantha,  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should a real FAI allow people to slaughter one another or to die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly just because they aren't &quot;in their right and rational minds&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it should, but is the solution to &quot;upload everyone but not tell 
<br>
most of them&quot;?  I think there would be very few people who would 
<br>
actually consent to this action were they given the opportunity to think 
<br>
about it beforehand.  What most people would agree to I suspect is for 
<br>
someone with the power to stop or prevent the killing, do just that.  This 
<br>
is what we expect our governments to do for us right now.  So if FAI 
<br>
simply works *with* people to achieve this then it will be doing a very 
<br>
useful thing with people's consent.
<br>
<p>Wouldn't you think that if an FAI was powerful enough to upload 
<br>
everyone without their knowing, it would be powerful enough to 
<br>
stop/prevent the killing in a direct way without involuntarily depriving 
<br>
everyone of their freedom to stay in the biological/non-virtual world?
<br>
<p>I would be very scared that an FAI that decided to upload me without 
<br>
my consent 'for my own good' might well not be that closely tuned to 
<br>
my needs and preferences and may well be simply imposing its own 
<br>
agenda on me and lots of other people/sentients.
<br>
<p>This was exactly why I was/am feeling uneasy about the way the 
<br>
'collective volition' work is going within the Singularity Institute.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For a while now I've thought that an FAI might very likely have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establish a variety of enclaves, &quot;real&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot; where persons and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups could live according to their lights.  Indeed it may be so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must live in such a way if they are to have a hope of ever reaching their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full potential.   It may be that the nearest approximation to Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to upload everyone but not tell most of them and let them live out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their life or lives until they developed enough to be ready for more.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This might be a real upload and it might seem more like some very vivid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enlightening dreams.    It might be a techo-reincarnation scheme from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain perspectives.    Should a real FAI allow people to slaughter one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another or to die utterly just because they aren't &quot;in their right and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational minds&quot;? 
</em><br>
