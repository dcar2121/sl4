<p>
Hmmm...i think Elizer and I may be speaking past each other to some
<br>
extent because of a terminology problem...
<br>
<p>Let me review:
<br>
<p>1) we (the human race in general and siai in particular) are heading
<br>
towards a singularity where technology will
<br>
create a F(hopefully)AI.
<br>
<p>2) If the attempts to create a FAI are not successful - no problem
<br>
(except that we make in our own ignorance)
<br>
<p>3) if a AI is created which is not F then (bad thing happens)
<br>
<p>4) Once the FAI is created it will quickly gain the ability to modify
<br>
and control the physical meat-space. (most likely
<br>
through nanotech)
<br>
<p>At this point is where my considerations of a personal 'right of
<br>
withdrawal' come into play.
<br>
Theoretically the Fai is able to manipulate and communicate with all
<br>
people on earth (sentients) at this point
<br>
and can do so with minimal effort.
<br>
<p>5) acting according to the collective volition principals and plans (see
<br>
recent posts and the wiki) the
<br>
Fai will attempt to determine our collective volition and enable it.
<br>
<p>The Fai here is functionally a very wise and powerful entity - it knows
<br>
a lot and can do a lot. Looking around itself
<br>
it will try to do what the people around it want done (collective
<br>
volition) if they were as smart/fast/better as they could be.
<br>
<p>In terms of the environment the Fai should react to our desires as a
<br>
species (enabling our collective volition) but do so in a safe manner
<br>
(ie no paperclip worlds)
<br>
<p>Interacting with the Fai is in my mind no different than interacting
<br>
with another person. It can express needs, desires, and plans of
<br>
action...sure talk all you like and lets discuss things!
<br>
<p>It will (most likely) work behind the scenes to modify the environment
<br>
according to the collective volition...thats fine, clean up the water,
<br>
remove the pollution, whatever works out...no problem there...
<br>
<p>Whoops...it started to transform the world into diamond....when the
<br>
change wave of transformation encountered the first sentient the wave
<br>
stops and the fai interacts with the sentient...hey I'd like to change
<br>
you over to diamond, let me explain why and tell me if its ok?
<br>
&lt;sentient&gt; No! I don't want to become diamond...keep me as I was [fai
<br>
proceeds to transform area around sentient into diamond but maintains an
<br>
enclave of normal environment around the sentient and does not transform
<br>
him. Change wave sweeps off into the distance and other encounters
<br>
proceed similarly (until and unless the collective volition realizes
<br>
that this is a silly example and we don't as a species want to become
<br>
diamond) - anyway this is a pretty silly example but it illustrates the
<br>
experience/interaction where when the FAI needs to modify a sentient it
<br>
asks, explains and only proceeds if ok'd
<br>
<p>The point here is that the sentient is protected from unwanted
<br>
modifications (even or especially!) if the collective decides that is
<br>
what the sentient would want (if better/faster/smarter) and there is the
<br>
ability for recovery without mass extinction...collective realizes that
<br>
its algorithms were wrong after querying 10,000 (arbitrary number for
<br>
example) sentients (its projection does not match actual will) - no harm
<br>
was done fai reverts landscape from diamond to our normal world (whew!)
<br>
- option of personal last judgement for conditions of physical
<br>
modification allowed fai to realize its projections did not match
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>6) the actual point is just to perserve a personal 'last judgement' for
<br>
any external action (unsolicited!) that the
<br>
system attempts which would modify the person (physically!- I don't care
<br>
if it wants to talk to me...attempt to sway my opinion...interaction
<br>
here is just like another person..if someone wants to preach at me fine,
<br>
I reserve the right to walk away but I don't mind discussion (with
<br>
person or Fai))
<br>
<p>The system can basically do whatever it wants to (based on extraplated
<br>
collective volition) environmentally preserving all the 'good' things
<br>
you're trying to accomplish with your scope and rules and transforms
<br>
(all the fiddly details that I expect you (siai, you personally,
<br>
whomever is actually coding the fai etc) to be working out ). There is a
<br>
lot of complexity here and I understand that you're still early days
<br>
(tick tick tick ;-) on this and have lots to work out. There will be
<br>
many special cases and rules to determine (either directly or via
<br>
optimization or some other method...however it works out is not
<br>
especially meaningful to me in this instant for this discussion). 
<br>
<p>But, once its working, it simply should not modify me (or any sentient)
<br>
without getting permission. Bottom line, full stop. 
<br>
(and again this is physical modification...if it wants to talk that's
<br>
fine - just like interacting with any other wise and powerful person) I
<br>
don't claim to know how you'll code this or arrange for it to happen,
<br>
but that is the bottom line.
<br>
Just as I don't expect the policeman on the corner to slap me in
<br>
handcuffs if I'm minding my own business I don't want the fai to modify
<br>
me with out asking (and if its bothering to ask there is probably a good
<br>
reason and I'll probably go along with it after sufficient
<br>
explanation...but still that element of choice)
<br>
<p>I hope this intent is clear, I'm sure you and others on the list can
<br>
follow this expectation (and I'm pretty sure that anyone (who hasn't
<br>
been brainwashed) would agree that 1) informed choice with option to
<br>
withdraw versus 2) modifications made 'in my best interest' (however its
<br>
been determined) --- hmmm 1 is prefered. 
<br>
<p>And in fact if the collective volition works as it should this rule of
<br>
'don't modify without asking' should almost be a given in the
<br>
dynamic...but still I wanted to 'spread the meme' and toss in my $0.02
<br>
(silly primate social dynamics) and I hope that even if you don't agree
<br>
that this fundamental invariant should be at the root of the system that
<br>
somewhere in your mind this idea will take root and all will be well -
<br>
theres really not a lot more I can do or say about this, so feel free to
<br>
reply or comment but otherwise I'll drop this for now.
<br>
<p>Hmmm...what was that country that had a snake on its flag and the 'don't
<br>
tread on me motto?'
