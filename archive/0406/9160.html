Marc Geddes:
<br>
<em>&gt; But have the moral subjectivists seriously stopped to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider what their philosophy actually implies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider this question:  Whose morality was better:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mahatma Gandhi's or Adolph Hitler's?   If you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that morality is just personal opinion what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying is that they are objectively both equivalent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's just a matter of opinion and there is actually no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real objective moral difference between them.
</em><br>
<p>You're making the same mistake I made so long ago: you are conflating
<br>
&quot;subjective&quot; with &quot;arbitrary&quot;. To understand the distinction I will give the
<br>
example which made me realize the difference; consider Pei Wang's NARS
<br>
system; the truth of the statement &quot;bird -&gt; animal&quot; is measured by a
<br>
frequency-confidence pair; the frequency is (total amount of positive
<br>
evidence) / (total amount of evidence (both positive and negative) gathered
<br>
thus far for the statement), while confidence is (amount of evidence) /
<br>
(amount of evidence + some positive constant), which increases monotonically
<br>
with the amount of evidence. The frequency value of a statement is
<br>
subjective in the sense that it is determined by the experience of the
<br>
system, while it is not objective in the sense that, as the amount of
<br>
evidence goes to infinity, the frequency value cannot be guaranteed to
<br>
converge; it may assume any value in the interval [0,1] no matter how much
<br>
evidence the agent has gathered thus far. However, this does NOT mean that
<br>
the frequency value is arbitrary; the system is not free to choose any
<br>
frequency-value whenever it wants, the frequency value is reflective of the
<br>
system's past observations.
<br>
<p>This is much the same with meaning in natural languages; the meaning of a
<br>
term (to us) is determined by how we have heard it related to other terms
<br>
(subjective). There is no &quot;objective meaning&quot; of most (non-technical) words;
<br>
usage defines meaning. What a word &quot;means&quot; is a consensus reached through
<br>
everyone's own subjective understanding of the word, but that does not make
<br>
any definition as good as any other (arbitrariness).
<br>
<p>Just as with meaning, people do NOT choose their morality out of a sea of
<br>
possible moralities randomly, it is a product of their own experience.
<br>
Hitler morality is &quot;decrease the freedoms of others (such as Jews), without
<br>
correspondinginly increasing the freedoms of anyone else&quot;, (negative-sum)
<br>
while Gandhi morality is &quot;increase your own freedom, but not at the cost of
<br>
decreasing someone else's freedom (such as through violence)&quot;
<br>
(positive-sum). Even if I generated a bunch of agents who held random
<br>
moralities and asked them to vote on whether they thought Hitler or Gandhi's
<br>
morality was better, Ganhi would win out everytime. Such a consensus is not
<br>
&quot;objective&quot; in the sense I think that you are using the word, but it's close
<br>
enough for me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that morality is just something made up [subjective], you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that there is no objective sense in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hitler was worse than Gandhi.
</em><br>
<p>This is a non-sequitur, analogous to saying &quot;because there is no largest
<br>
integer, every integer is just as large as any other&quot;; nonsense. Just
<br>
because there is no &quot;best morality&quot; (read: objective) does NOT mean that all
<br>
moralities are just as good as any other, or that subjective moralities are
<br>
incomperable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have seen that the hippy-dippy ideas that morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just a matter of opinion or perhaps some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'social construct' are incoherent.  Reasonable people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must conclude that morality is something objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real, something that we can use reason to discover.
</em><br>
<p>We have seen no such thing; you will need more than
<br>
thought-experiments-involving-Nazis-which-I-am-not-going-to-get-involved-in-
<br>
here-because-thought-experiments-with-Nazis-are-just-too-much-damn-fun to
<br>
derive such a strong conclusion.
<br>
<p>Even if objective morality does exist, (1) I don't know what it is, and (2)
<br>
I have no idea to find out what it is, so, practically speaking, objective
<br>
morality's existence or inexistence is irrelevant, unless you have resolved
<br>
(2) Marc. Reaching a global moral consensus is not objective morality, but
<br>
it's close enough.
<br>
<p>(Note: I apologize for the seeming lateness of this reply relative to when
<br>
Marc's original message was posted...)
