<em>&gt;  &gt; If not why (specifically)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Complete silence.)
</em><br>
<p>Do you remain silent for sake of not meddling with my future volition?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2. How well does the AI need to predict the future in order for all of
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See PAQ 5.
</em><br>
<p>I did read that; my question still stands. It seems that unless you can
<br>
perfectly simulate the earth and every intelligence in it including people
<br>
and other AIs you won't be able to predict the future with any degree of
<br>
accuracy. Small details produce very large changes; &quot;almost perfect&quot; is not
<br>
predicting the future, but a possible future of which there are billions,
<br>
all different. Why is this skepticism misplaced?
<br>
<p>One particular consideration: the 20th year in the future depends on what
<br>
the 19th year's FAI will look like. Under recursively improving
<br>
circumstances a 1st year AI cannot fathom what its grown up version will do
<br>
to satisfy its invariant 18 years down the road. Therefore predicting the
<br>
20th year is impossible. What is wrong with this reasoning?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not an issue of computing power.  Any FAI, any UFAI, that passes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the threshold of recursive self-improvement, can easily obtain enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power to do either.  It is just a question of whether an FAI or
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; UFAI comes first.
</em><br>
<p>Does everyone agree on this? You will admit that these are problems on a
<br>
completely different scale, and it may very well be that there is a
<br>
considerable window of time between being able to destroy humanity and
<br>
becoming able to predict the future, even under recursive self improvement.
<br>
How much harder is it to simulate the earth than to rearrange carbon atoms
<br>
into smileys? 100 times? 100 billion times? I have no clue, that is why I
<br>
raise the question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 4. FAI initially not programmed to count animals inside its definition
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collective. However we would like to be people who value all forms of
</em><br>
life
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and if we knew better we'd know that they are sentient to a certain
</em><br>
extent
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; THEREFORE should the FAI give a replicator to each household and forbid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killing of animals, even if we were opposed to it? (I think so, but just
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; check with you)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like speculation about outcomes to me.  Have you ever donated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to SIAI?
</em><br>
<p>I am just trying to get a feel for how the dynamic would work, I don't think
<br>
it's wasted time to find examples of what the AI would do in certain
<br>
situations right? Or, how would you like to propose this to the world if you
<br>
can't talk about concrete examples beyond the fred and the box case?
