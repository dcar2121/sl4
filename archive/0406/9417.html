</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire material universes can be reduced to lumps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information -  so what is NOT information?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Actually, I agree with every word of that, so you got me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Example: If you can find an unbutchered version of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Terry Gilliam's Brazil, you see Jonathan Pryce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rescued from a torture chamber by swashbuckling     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-union plumber Robert De Niro. Pryce ends up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the far north living in a truck camper with his lady
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friend. In 'reality' his body is still strapped to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the chair and everything after that is a fantasy. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stares catatonically into the distance and the      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; torturer says, &quot;We lost him.&quot; The End. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the recommendation! Ive just put in a bid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for it on Ebay (i saw a trailer of Brazil awhile ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wanted it but forgot to order it).
</em><br>
&nbsp;Sorry for the spoiler. Every Gilliam film is great. See them all. He's the Philip K. Dick of the
<br>
cinema.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, Pryce has escaped into a dream, but it's the   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only escape possible, and for him  it's a happy     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; ending of sorts. Is that the sort of mental illness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; your scenario posits? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well not really, by use of the phrase &quot;mental illness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i was referring to something that couldnt be classed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an adequent alternative to consensual normality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The device may be addictive but that doesnt mean the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resultant mental illness is a particularly pleasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience. I was also inferring that the rise in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportion of mentally ill people in society was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause of, either directly or indirectly, rocketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime rates (although i didnt explicitly state this).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This society eventually came to the opposite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion that you did i.e. that SOME sources of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information SHOULD be limited. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the broader point was: sticking to any rule (even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules that seem harmless or good) is not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most enlightened way to live, because with any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule or moral code etc you will be able to pick holes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in it or find counterexamples where it doesnt work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Needless to say, my &quot;theory of morality&quot; if you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call it that is very much inspired by Godel, but this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type of thinking also arises naturally from studies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taoism, or Eastern mysticism in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simon Gordon.
</em><br>
<p>Again I agree with all that, even the parts about Tao and Godel, except:
<br>
*I dislike the word 'moral' as it is too vague and misused; I would propose substituting 'ethical'
<br>
wherever it appears since that word still has some clarity. I even have a character make the same
<br>
proposal in a novel I wrote five years ago.
<br>
*I still stick to my rule 'Never limit your souces of information' because it has never, never let
<br>
me down.
<br>
*And I would still be first in line for that chip because I think it would be safe ***as long as
<br>
it had no wireless connectivity or other way for malware, viruses or hackers to mess with my
<br>
brain!*** I think that would be the real source of problems. On the other hand, perhaps we will
<br>
soon be vulnerabe to that even without consciously adding a chip. Uh oh... Can open, worms
<br>
everywhere...
