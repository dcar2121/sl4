<p><p>So you've engineered an impressive quantity of arrogance by leveraging a

modicum of competence.  That and a looney will buy you a bad cup of

coffee.  We've got enough people like that in Silicon Valley alone to

successfully invade a small Latin American country.

<p>Hubris is very cheap, which is why fools always seem to deliver it by
<br>
the pallet, and grants about as much stature as a double-wide with
<br>
plastic pink flamingos in front.  Very few people have the standing to
<br>
even attempt to make theoretical ukases, and merely pretending as though
<br>
you are currently one of those few people does not make it so in any sense.
<br>
<p>As disconcerting as it may be to you, there is no really obvious reason
<br>
why people should pay much attention to what you write at this point. 
<br>
Take that into consideration when posting and eventually this may change.
