<em>&gt; Either positive or negative. Do you advocate death in the preponderance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative qualia? What if in some years the balance would change? You can't
</em><br>
<p>Do I advocate death in the preponderance of negative qualia? I prefer to
<br>
discuss this privately since
<br>
<p>1. It will take everyone's interest away from the more important
<br>
implications of this theory
<br>
2. Realistically even with just human-level intellect and _some_
<br>
nanotechnology the balance of positive vs negative qualia can be extremely
<br>
favorable. If we go into super-human AI and total control over matter then
<br>
it's easy to see that negative qualia do not need to exist at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually one's wishes may do that, then again they may not. There are
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; who knowingly and wilfully take actions against their own interest. We may
</em><br>
<p>Against their own interest, means, against their own long term interest,
<br>
which means, against their goal system (if they had one). Look at people who
<br>
do things against their interst. People smoke. Because they like the smoking
<br>
quale. People gamble, and inevitably lose money in the long term. But they
<br>
like the gambling quale. So the fact that people take actions against their
<br>
own interest just proves my point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; argue for ages whether this has a selfish or altruistic reason at its base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the behaviour does exist. Do you advocate destroying this type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviours?
</em><br>
<p>Why destroy altruism? Altruism creates warm fuzzy feelings and lets humans
<br>
bond, if it weren't for the kick in the rear nature gives us when our
<br>
_personal_ needs are not satisfied, we'd all be very altruistic, constantly
<br>
giving and constantly happy about giving.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't like to be happy for the sake of being happy. OK, you can say
</em><br>
<p>Because according to your current goal system, happiness itself is
<br>
associated with acquiring material wealth and power and other things. When I
<br>
propose happiness for the sake of happiness, you automatically transform
<br>
this word into &quot;not happiness&quot; since &quot;happy for the sake of being happy&quot;
<br>
does not have much utility in your current goal system. However the &quot;happy&quot;
<br>
I am proposing is the same &quot;stuff&quot; that happens when you are happy for the
<br>
sake of other stuff; it is not something you rationalize and to which you
<br>
are free to assign a happiness value. Happiness is happiness! Can't possibly
<br>
not like it :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; happiness is not a supergoal, and give us what we really want, not a
</em><br>
varying
<br>
<em>&gt; eternal orgasmic machine.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are grossly underestimating an eternal orgasmic machine. In
<br>
fact, to imagine an orgasmic machine you must not imagine an orgasmic
<br>
machine. You will probably imagine a world in which everyone is productive
<br>
and joyful and altruistic and you have a beautiful house and you are in love
<br>
and your kids are healthy and whatever you happen to desire. Imagine the
<br>
most intense and wonderful moments of your life. That is more like an
<br>
orgasmic machine! With all the subtleties of these experiences, not just an
<br>
on/off switch.
