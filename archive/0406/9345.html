This has been suggested. There are quite a few sl4 wiki pages on the topic, e.g.

<a href="http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&amp;id=QualiaBasedAltruisticUtilitarianism">http://sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&amp;id=QualiaBasedAltruisticUtilitarianism</a><br>
which describes the basic idea, and there is some more speculation on

<br>
To quote the latter:
<br>
'
<br>
One obvious example of the difference between &quot;pure QBAU&quot; and volitional 
<br>
morality is that an AI whose goal system was based on &quot;pure QBAU&quot; would very 
<br>
likely to immediately start converting all of the matter in the universe into 
<br>
computronium on which to run &quot;happy minds&quot;, painlessly killing all biological 
<br>
life in the process, possibly without even waiting to upload any humans.
<br>
'
<br>
<em>&gt; All of the items above, in my view, can be traced back to achieving a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance between positive and negative qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Survival is essential to continue to have qualia.
</em><br>
Please define &quot;survival&quot;. The continued existence of any currently active human
<br>
minds is almost certainly not necessary for an SI to generate positive qualia. 
<br>
As a matter of fact, there are probably much more efficient implementations than 
<br>
even uploaded human minds - the SI could modify uploaded human minds to the 
<br>
point of being efficient qualia generators, but why? If qualia generation is the 
<br>
goal it would be easier to just use the code for the most efficient qualia 
<br>
generator known to the SI at the time.
<br>
<em>&gt; Freedom has always been associated with the ability of carrying out one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wishes which are supposed to increase positive qualia and decrease negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones.
</em><br>
Imho, it equally applies to the ability of carrying out wishes that are supposed 
<br>
to achieve other means.
<br>
<em>&gt; Equality comes in where we start considering the qualia produced by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's brains and not just our own.
</em><br>
Hmmm. But in the end for a pure QBAU-following mind it wouldn't really matter 
<br>
where (from which mind, if that distinction is still relevant) the qualia came 
<br>
from. If asymmetry led to a higher sum of total qualia, it would be a good idea 
<br>
to implement it according to this morality.
<br>
<em>&gt; YET, we can strike a compromise here and say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Variety_ of positive qualia is also important, therefore we account for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth. More intelligence, bigger brains, more complex and interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive qualia.
</em><br>
Why would we want to do that if the overall positiveness of qualia is really all 
<br>
we cared about?
<br>
<em>&gt; Using qualia as a measuring stick we reconcile all our individual morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessments including why Hitler was evil, why we are justified in forcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our children not to jump from the window thereby limiting their freedom at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times, why a paperclip universe sucks, and so forth.
</em><br>
I don't think that justifies making a basic assumption as strong as the one that 
<br>
qualia represent objective morality.
<br>
<em>&gt; About Elizier's argument (do not hardcode):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If in the future we discover element X which becomes in our opinion more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important than freedom, more important than happiness, and so forth, it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be because it stimulated positive qualia with greater strength or because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoids suffering where freedom and happiness do not.
</em><br>
Hmmm. If I understood this correctly you assume that any sufficiently 
<br>
intelligent mind would see &quot;perceiving qualia with as positive a sum as 
<br>
possible&quot; as a justified highest-level goal. Can you offer any proof of that? 
<br>
I'm merely a human, but this is not consistent with my current goal system.
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What if there's something _better_ than qualia and how to plan for it&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still an open topic for me (meaning that I will be giving it thought), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that a favorable variety and balance of qualia is the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing and there is no doubt in my mind about this now. I'd take a Biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gamble, for 10 billion years of happiness of all sorts. If you screw it, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miss out on the other stuff that doesn't make you happy, but you're still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there in a sort of transhuman heaven! I wouldn't take a Biggest Gamble on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some mind extrapolating machine though.
</em><br>
&quot;the other stuff that doesn't make [me] happy&quot; is in my opinion likely to be 
<br>
much more important than positive qualia. I don't know whether I'll even exist 
<br>
long enough to experience positive qualia if a mind with an QBAU-based morality 
<br>
reaches SI level (it seems more likely to me that the SI will instantly discard 
<br>
my mind in favor of efficient qualia-generating code), but that doesn't really 
<br>
matter - in the end, me and everyone else spending practically all of their time 
<br>
perceiving positive qualia in wireheaded-mode is not a future I deem desirable 
<br>
according to my current goal system.
<br>
Until I read about some very strong supporting evidence that qualia-based 
<br>
morality is objectively a good idea, I'll continue considering hardwiring a 
<br>
qualia-based morality into any AI something that is very likely to cause a lot 
<br>
of negative utility.
