<em>&gt; Doesn't &quot;best&quot; just end up being, in the long run, whatever maximizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your potential to survive and reproduce?  The Samurai think best is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being better with the sword.  We think best is thinking faster.  It all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on where you live.
</em><br>
<p>The difference was not in morality but in the range of individuals that
<br>
qualified as moral agents. Hitler did not classify jews as moral entities.
<br>
They had no moral weight for him so he was free to do with them as he
<br>
pleased. Hitler did not gas his mom. He did not gas his dog (well at least I
<br>
haven't heard about it). Only jews. For the people he _did_ consider to be
<br>
within his moral sphere, he only wished good things; he wanted his people to
<br>
be the most powerful, he wanted the arian race to be pure and
<br>
incontaminated. So he wanted what he thought was good for whom he thought
<br>
mattered. Not an expert on hitler though...
<br>
<p>The samurai were paid warriors, they did not have their own philosophy as to
<br>
whom to kill, they were brainwashed since childhood to obey orders. You can
<br>
say that their theory of morality did not include choosing who deserved to
<br>
get sliced. Most of them would not have sliced a child lightly yet some did.
<br>
They had a rule of conduct and a code of honour though.
<br>
So they are a particular case.
<br>
<p>Today there is no coherence in the world as to the kind of people we include
<br>
in our moral sphere. Some kids don't include their schoolmates, shooting at
<br>
them is like a game. Some people don't include other people who have
<br>
different religious ideas. Some people withdraw moral status to anyone who
<br>
disagrees with them on important issues which affect them personally. Some
<br>
people have personal rules which they wish to extend onto others, and
<br>
whoever breaks these rules loses moral worth.
<br>
<p>There is little coherence on what we would like to happen to those we do NOT
<br>
include (some wish them to die, some don't).
<br>
There is more coherence on what we would like to happen to those who we do
<br>
include though.
<br>
<p>Here the problem is not so much &quot;I want the people I care for to dominate
<br>
the world&quot; vs &quot;I want the people I care for to live happily&quot; vs &quot;I want the
<br>
prople I care for to die&quot; because 99.9% of people today are definitely going
<br>
to choose the second. Though we have an &quot;inclusion problem&quot; (who
<br>
qualifies??) which arises from:
<br>
<p>-inability to put oneself into other people's shoes (tyrants etc.)
<br>
-inability to correctly judge sentience (issues on abortion etc.)
<br>
-inability to see that anything experiencing qualia should qualify as moral
<br>
agent (animals have moral weight if they experience qualia etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remove humans from the universe and where is morality?  You can't say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing about gravity.
</em><br>
<p>Removing humans is removing the substance on which the arrow of morality
<br>
acts. It is like removing all matter from the universe in which case yes
<br>
gravity would seem to have disappeared (removing all matter in the universe
<br>
is assuming that matter exists in some 4dimensional glass box which is
<br>
probably not true; similarly &quot;removing people&quot; is assuming that there is an
<br>
external reality independent of observers which is probably not true).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What morality is there in galaxies colliding, animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the food chain eating each other, etc?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about galaxies colliding it is a very complex phenomenon which
<br>
may very well give rise to information patterns which encode sentient beings
<br>
who formulate theories about morality. Animals getting eaten experience the
<br>
arrow of morality (they feel pain) although they cannot formalize it and
<br>
think abstractly about it
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you were the last human alive, and the race would die out after you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were gone, is there anything you could do to be immoral?
</em><br>
<p>yes, punch yourself in the eye :-)
<br>
why should you not count? hey that's not fair hehehe
