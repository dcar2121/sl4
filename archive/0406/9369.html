</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the species and even life itself.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are loading &quot;objective&quot; with more than a standard meaning for 
<br>
the word.  If what you mean by the word is beyond what is here,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&amp;word=objective">http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&amp;word=objective</a><br>
<p>then I need to understand the way your are defining the word.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have never seen the tiniest scrap of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence that objective morality exists,
</em><br>
<p>I make the case that objective morality, that is a morality that is more or 
<br>
less common across the human species, exists.  Like all such psychological 
<br>
characteristics our morality judgement systems were shaped by genes that 
<br>
did better then alternative ones over evolutionary time in small 
<br>
tribes.  We have subjective feelings based on the outputs of evolved 
<br>
morality brain systems.  These systems have locations in human brains that 
<br>
can be (or already have been) located by functional MRI if some researcher 
<br>
can (or has) devise(d) an appropriate way to activate them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;but let me repeat, objective is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not the same as important and subjective is not the same as trivial, far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from it.
</em><br>
<p>I am in complete agreement with you on this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; to take extreme examples, it is moral (from the viewpoint of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your genes) to defend your family against those who would kill them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From that same genetic moral viewpoint it would be moral to kill your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;son and grandson to save your identical twin brother, and your daughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is worth 2 uncles but not 3. As for me I'll make up my own mind and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my genes don't like it my genes can lump it.
</em><br>
<p>Taking your examples, since identical twins are so rare, it doesn't seem 
<br>
likely that humans would evolve a special importance to treating an 
<br>
identical twin better than an ordinary brother.
<br>
<p>I might add that when forced to make such horrible choices, such as saving 
<br>
two uncles vs one daughter, the automatic/instinctive calculations are more 
<br>
complex and situational.  In a really nasty situation, the uncles might be 
<br>
critical to the survival of all members of the tribe where a very young 
<br>
daughter could possibly be replaced when and if things improved.  Or it 
<br>
could be reversed.
<br>
<p>And indeed, genes *always* lump it.  They build these survival machines and 
<br>
shape their psychology the best they can when the only levers of power they 
<br>
have are really indirect, ultimately *chemical.*  They build brains and 
<br>
bodies and &quot;hope&quot; for the best.  If (on average) they have done right for 
<br>
the environment they are in, the genes in question become more common.  The 
<br>
mind which you &quot;make up&quot; has been shaped foremost by genes, second by the 
<br>
memes of your culture and last by your experiences (some might reverse the 
<br>
order of the last two, but few on this list would argue against the 
<br>
importance of the hardware substrate).
<br>
<p>Of course, we don't live in the &quot;environment of evolutionary adaption&quot; at 
<br>
present.  So our instincts can be expected to be less than optimally adapted.
<br>
<p>Unsurprisingly though, there is much in common with &quot;objective&quot; morality 
<br>
based on what is good for gene survival and traditional morality.
