<p><em>&gt;The attempt to extrapolate collective human volition is futile because of

<p><p>Mine, too, or part of it. Here's another part (and of course I might be 
<br>
wrong or ill-informed): human volition is not algorithmic. It is 
<br>
lawful/law-abiding/causal, but not predictable for the reasons Jef mentions 
<br>
above. Even alone on a desert island, it might not be so constrained; in 
<br>
the context of the immensely exfoliated and imbricated social order and 
<br>
history within which we are persons making choices, it's unknowable. This 
<br>
is, indeed, one of the premises of the Singularity; one part of the 
<br>
unknowability of human choice is the technology we might build, the lessons 
<br>
we might learn from it, the Weltbild that will emerge, within which, as 
<br>
always, we will be changed--but in the exponential moment of the Spike, to 
<br>
an extraordinary and *truly* unknowable extent.
<br>
<p>Volition is non-algorithmic (if I'm right about this) in rather the way our 
<br>
use of language is non-algorithmic. We acquired words by ostention and 
<br>
fast-learning, in a social context of pragmatic use and conventions of 
<br>
discourse, politeness, evasiveness, self-deception, all of it to some 
<br>
extent templated by evolutionary prehistory, all of it to some extent 
<br>
generatively free; we use these tokens or signifers according to rules of 
<br>
performance mappable in X-bar structures, trees, all that menu-based 
<br>
template organization that places utterance constraints but not necessarily 
<br>
cognitive handicaps upon us. It all looks much closer to a Hopfield energy 
<br>
reduction landscape to me than to a set of specifiable algorithms.
<br>
<p>If so, there's no `volition' to `extract'. It just doesn't work that way.
<br>
<p>Which is not to say that a system might not be constructed that emulates 
<br>
this vast and messy skein of slopping, slurping spaghetti.
