<p><em>&gt; &gt; You are positing that all the &quot;really good people&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basically agree with the SIAI perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, for the same reason that I posit all the really good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicists accept general relativity as the starting point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for further work. If you think that AI is an area where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different points of view can be equally good, you have already failed.
</em><br>
<p>1) 
<br>
AI is at a far more primitive stage than gravitational physics right
<br>
now.  If you're suggesting that Eliezer's ideas about AI are currently
<br>
well-demonstrated to a level comparable to that of Einstein's general
<br>
relativity theory, I think you're badly wrong.
<br>
<p>There may one day be a theory of intelligent systems that is as rigorous
<br>
and well-documented and empirically proven as current physics theories
<br>
like general relativity.  When there is such a theory, certainly, I will
<br>
accept it to the same degree that I accept current physics theories (not
<br>
absolutely, but with a high degree of respect).
<br>
<p>When a science is at a primitive stage, it is foolish to assess a
<br>
scientist's quality by whether or not they agree with one or another
<br>
competing speculative perspective.
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
Even once AI science is far more advanced, there may still be many
<br>
different ways of creating AI's, and many different ways of creating
<br>
Friendly AI's.  AI science, at its present primitive stage, certainly
<br>
doesn't rule this out.
<br>
<p>If we're lucky, there will be a unified theory of AI that tells us which
<br>
ways of creating AI will be successful at creating intelligence, which
<br>
ways will be successful at creating FAI, etc.
<br>
<p>I see no evidence that Eliezer or anyone else possesses a rigorous,
<br>
demonstrated unified theory of this nature, at the present time.
<br>
