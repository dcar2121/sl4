Huh?
<br>
<p>Moral judgments are based on shared values and thinking about means to 
<br>
preserve and/or extend those values.  Values are generally the result of 
<br>
evolutionary  processes and environmental pressure, i.e. &quot;what works&quot;, 
<br>
and it's important to understand that values can change, with resultant 
<br>
ripples through the moral fabric.
<br>
<p>There is a tendancy for &quot;what works&quot; to proliferate over time.  
<br>
Therefore shared values and accompanying moral judgments tend to 
<br>
proliferate over time. (Broadening over time)
<br>
<p>There is a tendenancy for previously isolated groups to interact over 
<br>
time.   On the whole it always moves in this direction and not toward 
<br>
greater isolation.  The result again is a tendency toward shared values 
<br>
and therefore shared moral judgments. (Broadening of the interaction space)
<br>
<p>There is a tendency  toward increasing complexity and greater 
<br>
intelligence (problem solving ability) in the universe.  This is a 
<br>
tendency toward increasingly discovering what works, and what works in 
<br>
one place is likely to work in another place.  As above, this tends 
<br>
toward development of common values and common moral judgments overall.  
<br>
(Broadening awareness or intelligence)
<br>
<p>All of these tendencies are thermodynamic in nature and progressive.  
<br>
This is why I call this thinking the Arrow of morality.  Some jump to 
<br>
the conclusion that this is the Naturalistic Fallacy in new clothes, but 
<br>
if you look closely here there are no &quot;oughts&quot; imposed on what &quot;is&quot;.  
<br>
It's just the the Naturalistic Wisdom that it's better to choose what works.
