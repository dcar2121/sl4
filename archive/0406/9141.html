</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It's easy for us who've shrugged off the religious brainwashing to say
<br>
that everybody should be so enlightened.  However, I know that for my
<br>
mother (and many more like her), religion is an integral part of her
<br>
life.  It wouldn't matter if you could prove to her, as simply as 2 + 2
<br>
= 4, that there is no God.  She would go on believing.  And if you could
<br>
adjust her thinking to remove all traces of belief, it would still leave
<br>
a huge hole in her life, as large as if you removed mathematics from
<br>
your own life.  So to answer the question of what a devout Christian
<br>
should be said to *want*, the answer is &quot;anything they want to want&quot;.
<br>
Who are you to force a different belief on them?  Or is that just an
<br>
&quot;acceptable&quot; consequence of saving the world?  You wouldn't be the first
<br>
to use the &quot;ends justifying the means&quot; excuse to justify brutal actions.
<br>
<p>But as you indicated in another post, you're not all that concerned
<br>
about the effects on individuals, it's the group volition that is
<br>
considered.  Consider that most of the world believes in religion (and
<br>
flying saucers, etc).  
<br>
<p>[Unapproved speculation]  The group volition will very likely force
<br>
religion back onto the rest of us.
