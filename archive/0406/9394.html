I'm not really ignoring them, but I don't see any reason to give them special 
<br>
treatment over other data either, or to assume that they have any direct 
<br>
connection to morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With regards to your claim that transhuman mary would not learn anything new

</em><br>
It wasn't my intention to imply this. The original hypothetical situation was 
<br>
for mary to study the relevant phenomena, and for a single human-level mind to 
<br>
come up with all parts of modern physics relevant for light would likely take 
<br>
centuries, if not millenia - assuming they are motivated, don't have to spend 
<br>
their time doing anything else - and, of course, don't die prematurely.
<br>
And even if she knew everything about light as a physical phenomenon: she might 
<br>
not know everything about human perception, even on a strictly theoretical level.
<br>
Analyzing the reaction of humans to light of different frequencies can show that 
<br>
humans are (usually) capable of detecting the frequency of light to a certain 
<br>
degree.
<br>
For someone who doesn't have that knowledge to realize that they are capable of 
<br>
detecting the frequencies of light (which can also be measured using other 
<br>
methods) to a certain extent would provide strong empirical evidence for the 
<br>
theory that (at least some) humans are capable of this.
<br>
Of course, one could get even better evidence by asking other humans about how 
<br>
they see light, but barring that, one test subject is clearly better than zero. 
<br>
Empirical data doesn't necessarily lead to better understanding (it needs to be 
<br>
evaluated correctly for that to occur), but it is (limited) knowledge about (a 
<br>
small part of) reality.
