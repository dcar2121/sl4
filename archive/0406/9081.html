</em><br>
<p>Oh, give me a break.  All AGI projects are scary.  Period.  Anyone who does 
<br>
not realize this is scarier than any amount of, ahem, &quot;overconfidence&quot;.
<br>
<p>And as for depriving people of free choice, Ben, what exact form and 
<br>
dynamic of &quot;free choice&quot; will you irrevocably write into place forever, 
<br>
regardless of what future minds think of your decision?  You write of 
<br>
&quot;Choice, Growth, and Joy&quot; without asking whether humanity might want 
<br>
something quite different if we had a thousand years to ponder the problem, 
<br>
and &quot;volition&quot; is my shot at turning the deadly dangerous problem of the 
<br>
meta-dynamics of &quot;free choice&quot; over to a wiser humane decision process.  If 
<br>
a Last Judge (or whatever) peeks at the result and &quot;volition&quot; doesn't work 
<br>
as intended, people are seriously unhappy and so on, there's a chance to 
<br>
call a halt.  There are things that can go wrong with this plan, but at 
<br>
least I am *planning* to leave emergency exits and ask for smarter-mind vetoes.
<br>
<p>You speak of my overconfidence, I who propose failsafes and backup plans, 
<br>
and write papers that describe possible classes of error in my systems, and 
<br>
do not try to guess myself what morality humanity will want in five 
<br>
thousand years.  You show no sign of this *in-practice* humility.  You 
<br>
speak of my arrogance and overconfidence, and you show not one sign of 
<br>
taking safety precautions far in advance, or considering the errors you 
<br>
might have made when you make your proposals.
<br>
<p>That's scary.
<br>
<p>Me, I'm just a bad-boy mad scientist.
