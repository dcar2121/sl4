</em><br>
<p>Yes, really. I think you deem that the superAI will be &quot;vast, cool, and unsympathetic&quot; to the
<br>
degree that ve has no concept of how humorous our follies and farces are. Even our stupidity is
<br>
interesting. Strange, but true. And yes, I think even resurrecting the dead by recreating all
<br>
possible iterations of intelligence (including ourselves) is reasonable if the processing capacity
<br>
is available. To do otherwise is (to me) a bit like reproducing half the Mandelbrot set while
<br>
deciding that the other half is somehow inferior. I myself have strongly come to suspect that
<br>
human qualia are not intrinsically better than, say, bonobo qualia on a good day, or dolphin
<br>
qualia. Why would a superior intelligence deny itself access to other modes if ve had the choice?
<br>
I assert that this falls into the class of things people think a SAI might do that in fact ve
<br>
would not do, because ve would know better. There might be useful learnings or experiences ve
<br>
could derive from 'seeing through our eyes', so that if ve got rid of us before the resource was
<br>
exhausted, ve would be doing something dumb.
<br>
I once mentioned to a woman acquaintance a bit of data that I gleaned from an article in Esquire
<br>
(a men's magazine). She replied, &quot;I don't read men's magazines.&quot; I told her that this was
<br>
unenlightened because I have a rule: Never limit your sources of information.
<br>
Now, if I am smart enough to understand that, so is any SAI worth ver salt. Ve might run out of
<br>
uses for us eventually, but we can't predict if or when, and initially, neither can the SAI. Don't
<br>
sell us short the way we sell other life short, and don't sell SAI short the way you sell us
<br>
short. We are able to destroy other life and intelligence because we are smarter, but we do it
<br>
because we are not smart enough.
