<p>
David,
<br>
<p>I think you have some valid points about flaws in SIAI's current
<br>
approach to fundraising.  IMO, to succeed with their current approach,
<br>
they'll have to get pretty lucky.  
<br>
<p>However, my hope is definitely NOT that SIAI self-destructs; my hope is
<br>
that both SIAI and Eliezer &quot;grow up&quot; in a relatively graceful and
<br>
productive way.
<br>
<p>I have some problems with Eliezer's current attitude (not just his shiny
<br>
new &quot;bad-boy mad scientist&quot; persona, I mean his current *intellectual*
<br>
attitude), and somewhat bigger problems with Michael Wilson's current
<br>
attitude.  
<br>
<p>And I think the &quot;estimated collective volition&quot; approach to Friendliness
<br>
is either badly incomplete or badly flawed.  
<br>
<p>However, I think that if SIAI can attract the funds to hire a few of the
<br>
right people, AND if at the same Eliezer's thinking and personality
<br>
mature in the right direction, then SIAI will be able to do some great
<br>
stuff.  Even if they don't succeed in launching the Singularity, they
<br>
could make major contributions to the process.
<br>
<p>I'm not going to make any estimates the odds of SIAI self-destructing,
<br>
flourishing and growing, or remaining roughly in a steady-state.  The
<br>
point of this email is just to say that, in spite of my quite honestly
<br>
expressed criticisms, I hope very much for Eliezer &amp; SIAI to grow in a
<br>
positive direction.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the recent SIAI-bashing on sl4, I might as well jump 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the fray.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My prediction:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI will self-destruct.  It will fail to attract substantial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will lose in the race to the Singularity.  SIAI will still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on movie website tie-ins, will still be marginally funded by college 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students and the occasional eccentric wealthy individual, and Eliezer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will still be hammering out his friendliness theory with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working code in the year 2025 - about the time a generic bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge network bootstraps itself into superintelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Ben's points about the arrogance of Eliezer and Michael are *very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much* relevant to the ability of SIAI to meet its goals.  There are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple orthogonal reasons for this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1a. Arrogance tends to close one's mind to the consideration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of outside 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas.  An idea monoculture can and usually does severely limit an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization's ability to succeed.  Ackoff and other organizational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems theorists have demonstrated this extensively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1b. Arrogance, even if it is &quot;correctly-placed&quot; and &quot;deserved&quot;, often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits an organization's fundraising capacity.  Acting like a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ass is one very effective way of dissuading people from allocating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources in the direction of said ass.  This effect is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *significantly* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amplified if the principals in question have no external claim to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis of their arrogance( e.g. high honors, doctorate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees, industry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success, etc ).  Serious investors do not buy into an idea on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1c. SIAI's apparent mistrust of &quot;outsiders&quot;, as demonstrated in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oft-repeated claims that LOGI is obsolete and there is something much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better but it can't be published because evil people will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before we get friendliness worked out.  This position has the direct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect of discouraging talented potential seed AI programmers from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming interested in the project.  It also has the direct effect of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discouraging outside investment due to disclosure and control 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   It also has the direct effect( and I believe Ben has already noted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this )of discouraging other AGI researchers from contributing ideas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward the development of SIAI's theory and project, e.g. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;why bother if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they've published is useless anyway?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  Not only is there a complete lack of theoretical cohesiveness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amongst AGI projects( e.g. Eliezer and Ben ), but there is a complete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of theoretical, structural, and motivational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cohesiveness amongst 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the principals of SIAI itself.  I don't think a day goes by( recently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; )during which Eliezer doesn't correct Tyler or Anissimov on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very critical point.  Acknowledging the fact that *correctness* is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to maintain, I would argue that when attempting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain public 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest or outside funding, this is a critical flaw.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seasoned public 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations professionals know that if one doesn't know the answer, one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't make it up.  When attempting to secure funding, one doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present to the public a group of highly disconnected individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.  Awareness Efforts.  Admittedly, I was a little excited about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flurry of activity that Tyler initiated, as I got the impression that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI was finally getting serious about promoting itself.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused me to begin donating and helping in the first place.  After a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while, however, it became clear to me that it was more of the same. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Undertaking herculean efforts in order to drive a few more hits to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; website.  Bringing on a 20-year-old with no significant network to go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundraising in silicon valley.  Wow.  What SIAI seems to not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that when one undertakes a serious round of fundraising, one must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach potential serious investors with either credibility or a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product - and for reasons noted above, this is something SIAI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not have.
