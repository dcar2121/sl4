<em>&gt;You can't have it both ways, if humans are moral then morality is
</em><br>
what they want &gt;and morality is subjective.  Talk about circular
<br>
reasoning!
<br>
<p>What I said was that it is reasonable to assume that SOME human
<br>
impulses are moral.  So sometimes the meter would correspond to human
<br>
wants and sometimes it wouldn't.  Or do you claim that humans are
<br>
totally evil?
<br>
<p>Subjective thoughts will sometimes match objective knowledge. 
<br>
Randalls analogy showed this.  For instance subjective estimates of
<br>
the distance to the edge of the cliff can sometimes be right.
<br>
<p>You were assuming that there would be absolutely no correlation
<br>
between objective morality and human wants.  This assumption is not
<br>
justified.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If I estimate that the edge of a cliff is 100 feet away and I walk 60
</em><br>
feet towards it &gt;there will be consequences if the edge is really only
<br>
60 feet away; but if the meter &gt;says putting a green hat on Thursday
<br>
is horribly evil and I do it any way there are &gt;no consequences to me
<br>
or anyone else
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John K Clarke
</em><br>
<p>To borrow an analogy of Eliezer's, this is about as sensible as
<br>
arguing that a super Ghandi might start letting down everyone's tyres.
<br>
<p>The meter is supposed to indicate objective morality.  By definition
<br>
it would not indicate that something is 'horribly evil' without very
<br>
good reasons.  If putting on a green hat on Thursday really had no
<br>
consequences for you or anyone else, the meter could not possibly
<br>
designate this as 'horribly evil'.
<br>
<p>And note that many values that people have held DO result in
<br>
destructive consequences.  For instance a German living in Nazi
<br>
Germany might have checked the meter about Nazism and the dial might
<br>
have swung to 'horribly evil'.  If the German ignored what the meter
<br>
said and went on to join the Nazi party, his value system would indeed
<br>
have lead to disaster.
