Hi Jeff,
<br>
<p>The idea that morality is simply &quot;what works&quot; doesn't feel right to me.
<br>
<p>&quot;What works&quot; is really a description of &quot;what persists&quot;.  Throughout 
<br>
human history some people have exploited other people.  This behaviour 
<br>
pattern has been very persistent - but it doesn't match with what most 
<br>
people mean intuitively when they talk of morality.
<br>
<p>I think the essense of morality is that it is a *corrective* or *antidote* to 
<br>
what would otherwise occur if no action was taken - something that the 
<br>
group acting under or propagating the moral code would find distressing. 
<br>
(It requires an act of will to make morality have any effect.) 
<br>
<p>I think that humans can take lots of contrarian aspirations and make 
<br>
moralities out of them.
<br>
<p>I think your notion of the arrow of morality emerges when you narrow 
<br>
down and focus attention on moralities that emerge and persist.  These 
<br>
moralities are, most likely, persistent and prone to spreading because 
<br>
they 'work' ie. they meet the needs of lots of people through time and 
<br>
across geography.  But they are subset of all possible moralities.
<br>
<p>My guess is that some of these persistent moralities emerge because in 
<br>
any human population there are people who gain positions of power and 
<br>
influence whose activities deliberately or inadvertently impact negatively 
<br>
on others.  Because of that, moralities emerge among the people most 
<br>
likely to be disadvantaged that help them mobilise themselves to resist or 
<br>
prevent the impact and also to act a tool for behaviour modification 
<br>
amongst those are causing the negaive impacts.
<br>
<p>I think there's another class of moralities that relate to personal growth or 
<br>
self management ie. rlating to learning how to avoid major future regret 
<br>
owing to an excessive weighting of current benefit.
<br>
<p>If human society is becoming more integrated then I would expect at the 
<br>
least some aspects of morality to converge but if human societies 
<br>
fragmented again (eg. dispersal through space) then the moralities might 
<br>
diverge again.
<br>
<p>So while one might see some arrow of morality effects I think this is by no 
<br>
means the universal explanation for moral dynamics.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
