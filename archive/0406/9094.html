</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The basic principle of democracy (which is based on choice, not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have invented it.  Modern democracies work, pretty much, by letting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do what they want except when their wants collide, in which case 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hodge-podge of moral principles and pragmatic considerations are used 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; them sorta acceptable, preferable to what I see coming out of other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governmental systems on Earth today or historically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extrapolated volition based FAI is as much like fascism as it is like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy --- fascism being a political philosophy in which the will of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual is, in principle, subordinate to the will of the state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is understood to represent the greater good.  In fact the will of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the state, in fascism, is supposed to represent what people SHOULD want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and in some fascist theorists' writings, what the WOULD want if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were freed of the damaging illusions plaguing their minds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am confident that the majority of Earthlings would vote for democracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over extrapolated-volition-based AI-control.  But of course, this is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silly statements, since &quot;voting for democracy&quot; presumes that democracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already exists ;-)  You could argue that, even if people would vote for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy now, their future selves wouldn't want them to... etc. etc. 
</em><br>
<p>But do you, Ben, let alone the majority of modern-day Earthlings, have the 
<br>
ability to correctly weigh the risks and benefits of direct democracy 
<br>
controlling a superintelligence (EEEK!) versus collective volition?  I 
<br>
don't.  I could be wrong, and the collective volition could turn over the 
<br>
power to the UN General Assembly (EEEEEK!).
<br>
<p>It's people's lack of moral caution or fear of screwing up, their 
<br>
horrifying readiness to trust themselves with power, that causes me to turn 
<br>
the choice of meta-dynamic over to a collective volition (which is a form 
<br>
of humane transhuman intelligence, and one that structurally cares very 
<br>
strongly about our expected first-person perspectives on the issue).  I 
<br>
don't trust myself.  Nor do I trust other humans.  From my studies of 
<br>
cognitive psychology I know in too much detail how little grasp the human 
<br>
mind has upon reality, how ready people are to make decisions on the basis 
<br>
of what sounds like a good idea at the time and how unrelated that is to 
<br>
their actual future experience and reactions.  Just the prospect of humans 
<br>
deciding on the basis of their half-a-paragraph *description* of the 
<br>
outcomes, let alone their description of a human *prediction* of the 
<br>
outcomes, makes me want to flee screaming into the night.
