</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't see how &quot;formal verification of Java programs&quot; can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; done.  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at least, I would assume that the specification of what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; program is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; supposed to do is  where much of the trick takes place.   If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specification is detailed enough and is itself provably correct (why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't we get an infinite recurse?) then it might well be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better form
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the program than the Java one was anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Formal specification may take place in a mathematical specification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language such as Z.  This is not a good form for a practical software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program, because it doesn't deal with issues of memory or processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency, except at the very abstract level of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order-of-complexity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of algorithms and the design of data structures.  Currently there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology for taking a Z specification and turning it into an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software program.  However, the supercompiler technology may eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to such a capability, in which case, indeed, the specification 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is what I suspected.  Unfortunately Z will not handle the POC of 
<br>
the underlying mechanisms of Java/C##.  It is precisely in those 
<br>
mechanisms that unaddressed opportunities for failure or exploitation 
<br>
of weaknesses are found.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point is that the specification is much smaller and simpler than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program, and hence can be more thoroughly checed my humans.  We don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get an infinite recursion because the recursion stops with human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgment.  The problem is that software programs that are too big and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex are hard for humans to reliably verify as correct by direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So now sufficient POC to guarantee the SI will not take off and do 
<br>
terrible things depends on humans reading and verifying a specification 
<br>
of the intent of the programming?   This doesn't look very &quot;safe&quot; to 
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  The things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Java removed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from C++ do not afaik make it any more powerful, certainly not more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; succinct, and arguably no easier to prove a program is correct in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not true.  Java lacks pointers and explicit heap memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management, and this is what makes it orders of magnitude more feasible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to analyze Java programs mathematically, than C++ programs.  C# 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are tractable in the sense that Java programs are, if one doesn't use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsafe blocks of code and the pointer-manipulation that they permit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is not true?  Mere pointer arithmetic and memory allocation being 
<br>
out of the hands of programmers means that bugs in that stuff coded by 
<br>
the application programmers will not eat your lunch.  But it does not 
<br>
mean there are no bugs in the underlying Java/C# implementation.  It 
<br>
also doesn't mean that the code itself is more easily proven correct 
<br>
except in the narrow dimensions of pointers and memory management and 
<br>
then only when we assume the correctness of the implementation.   Most 
<br>
of what programs are written for is outside these areas which are 
<br>
simply means to some end.  That end is no more verifiable than it was 
<br>
before as actually being what the code will do in all possible 
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The existing, partially functional Java supercompiler -- and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing C# partial-evaluator made by the same team under a research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant from Microsoft -- could not have feasibly been made for C#.
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure I parse your intent there.
