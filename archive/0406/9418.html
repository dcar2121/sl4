HG Wells wrote the following lines more that a century ago but could be
<br>
a realistic description of a super AI:  
<br>
<p>&quot;This world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences
<br>
greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; as men busied
<br>
themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and
<br>
studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might
<br>
scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of
<br>
water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe
<br>
about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire
<br>
over matter. [….] minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of
<br>
the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,
<br>
regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their
<br>
plans against us.&quot;
<br>
<p>John K Clark
