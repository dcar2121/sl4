<br>
<p><em>&gt;This assumption, however, is on the same level as my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assumption that my car will start the next time I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get in it. 
</em><br>
<p>No, you can test the assumption about the car starting but you can’t
<br>
test the assumption about other people’s consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; an AI which has no discernible shared structure with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human brain except that both can do general 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem solving may very well not be conscious.
</em><br>
<p>As a practical matter when you meet fellow meat creatures you have no
<br>
way of knowing what state the neurons in their brains are in, yet I’ll
<br>
bet you think they’re conscious most of the time, when they’re not
<br>
sleeping or dead that is, because they act that way. Hell, you’ve never
<br>
even seen me but I’ll bet you think even I’m conscious.
<br>
But let’s suppose you have a super brain scanning machine and you use
<br>
Eliezer’s consciousness theory to analyze the results, much to your
<br>
surprise it says you really are the only conscious being on the planet,
<br>
what would you do? Would you start treating other people like dirt
<br>
because they have no more feelings than a rock, or would you suspect
<br>
that Eliezer’s theory is full of beans? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you're slipping in the unstated premise that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has a goal regarding itself.
</em><br>
<p>No, it’s not unstated at all, its goal is to solve problems and having
<br>
your actions limited by rules made by a creature with the brain the size
<br>
of a flea is a problem. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  remember what the “I” in AI stands for.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Eliezer was right to start using a different term.
</em><br>
<p>It’s interesting, in fields where people really understand things, like
<br>
pure mathematics, they struggle to make the vocabulary as simple as
<br>
possible, some of the most important words are, connected, complete,
<br>
contentious, point, set, group, open, closed and even “simply”. On the
<br>
other hand, in areas where the experts don’t have a clue what the hell
<br>
they’re talking about, like psychology and sociology, they go on and on
<br>
about the paradigm of subcapitalist deconstructive theory indicative of
<br>
predialectic socialism to denote a mythopoetical whole not excluding the
<br>
premise of posttextual desublimation states because it is not
<br>
demodernism, but subdemodernism interpolated into a Lacanist obscurity
<br>
that includes truth as a subset of reality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Inventing a new three dollar word to replace “intelligence” is not a
<br>
good sign that the mind of the writer is clear and is most certainly
<br>
unkind to the reader  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to indicate that you would treat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI as if it were not conscious, if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't act as though it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were.  Is this the case?
</em><br>
<p>Yes certainly, in fact I wouldn’t even call it an AI, I just call it a
<br>
A.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;more offspring is that which would be exhibited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by an organism with general problem solving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability *and* self-interest as a very high goal.  
</em><br>
<p>Any creature without both will not get very far.  I’m a AI with no self
<br>
interest, Hmm, if I do that I’ll erase my memory and fry all my
<br>
circuits, well there is noting bad in that so I’ll do it. 
<br>
