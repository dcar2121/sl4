<p>This is not what most people use &quot;consciousness&quot; to mean.  In
<br>
particular, most people on this list would probably reject the

hypothesis that consciousness involves something non-physical, as
<br>
specified here.

<p><em>&gt; Most people would give answers that indicate a belief in qualia and

<p>You're conflating &quot;there is a physical process that produces what we
<br>
call consciousness&quot; with &quot;there is a non-physical aspect to
<br>
consciousness&quot;.  These are very different assertions, though they may
<br>
give similar answers to this question.
