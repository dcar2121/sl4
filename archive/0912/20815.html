<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1hn/call_for_new_siai_visiting_fellows_on_a_rolling/">http://lesswrong.com/lw/1hn/call_for_new_siai_visiting_fellows_on_a_rolling/</a>
<br>
<p>Last summer, 15 Less Wrongers, under the auspices of SIAI, gathered in
<br>
a big house in Santa Clara (in the SF bay area), with whiteboards,
<br>
existential risk-reducing projects, and the ambition to learn and do.
<br>
<p>Now, the new and better version has arrived.  We’re taking folks on a
<br>
rolling basis to come join in our projects, learn and strategize with
<br>
us, and consider long term life paths.  Working with this crowd
<br>
transformed my world; it felt like I was learning to think.  I
<br>
wouldn’t be surprised if it can transform yours.
<br>
<p>A representative sample of current projects:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Research and writing on decision theory, anthropic inference,
<br>
and other non-dangerous aspects of the foundations of AI;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The Peter Platzer Popular Book Planning Project;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Editing and publicizing theuncertainfuture.com;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Improving the LW wiki, and/or writing good LW posts;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Getting good popular writing and videos on the web, of sorts
<br>
that improve AI risks understanding for key groups;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Writing academic conference/journal papers to seed academic
<br>
literatures on questions around AI risks (e.g., takeoff speed,
<br>
economics of AI software engineering, genie problems, what kinds of
<br>
goal systems can easily arise and what portion of such goal systems
<br>
would be foreign to human values; theoretical compsci knowledge would
<br>
be helpful for many of these questions).
<br>
<p>Interested, but not sure whether to apply?
<br>
<p>Past experience indicates that more than one brilliant, capable person
<br>
refrained from contacting SIAI, because they weren’t sure they were
<br>
“good enough”.  That kind of timidity destroys the world, by failing
<br>
to save it.  So if that’s your situation, send us an email.  Let us be
<br>
the one to say “no”.  Glancing at an extra application is cheap, and
<br>
losing out on a capable applicant is expensive.
<br>
<p>And if you’re seriously interested in risk reduction but at a later
<br>
time, or in another capacity -- send us an email anyway.  Coordinated
<br>
groups accomplish more than uncoordinated groups; and if you care
<br>
about risk reduction, we want to know.
<br>
<p>What we’re looking for
<br>
<p>At bottom, we’re looking for anyone who:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Is capable (strong ability to get things done);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Seriously aspires to rationality; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Is passionate about reducing existential risk.
<br>
<p>Bonus points for any (you don’t need them all) of the following traits:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Experience with management, for example in a position of
<br>
responsibility in a large organization;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Good interpersonal and social skills;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Extraversion, or interest in other people, and in forming strong
<br>
communities;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Dazzling brilliance at math or philosophy;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A history of successful academic paper-writing; strategic
<br>
understanding of journal submission processes, grant application
<br>
processes, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Strong general knowledge of science or social science, and the
<br>
ability to read rapidly and/or to quickly pick up new fields;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Great writing skills and/or marketing skills;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Organization, strong ability to keep projects going without much
<br>
supervision, and the ability to get mundane stuff done in a reliable
<br>
manner;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Skill at implementing (non-AI) software projects, such as web
<br>
apps for interactive technological forecasting, rapidly and reliably;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Web programming skill, or website design skill;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Legal background;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A history of successfully pulling off large projects or events;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Unusual competence of some other sort, in some domain we need,
<br>
but haven’t realized we need.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Cognitive diversity: any respect in which you're different from
<br>
the typical LW-er, and in which you're more likely than average to
<br>
notice something we're missing.
<br>
<p>If you think this might be you, send a quick email to
<br>
anna@intelligence.org.  Include:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Why you’re interested;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. What particular skills you would bring, and what evidence makes
<br>
you think you have those skills (you might include a standard resume
<br>
or c.v.);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Optionally, any ideas you have for what sorts of projects you
<br>
might like to be involved in, or how your skillset could help us
<br>
improve humanity’s long-term odds.
<br>
<p>Our application process is fairly informal, so send us a quick email
<br>
as initial inquiry and we can decide whether or not to follow up with
<br>
more application components.
<br>
<p>As to logistics: we cover room, board, and, if you need it, airfare,
<br>
but no other stipend.
<br>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you,
<br>
Anna
<br>
