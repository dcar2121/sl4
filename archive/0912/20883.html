2009/12/4 John McNamara &lt;<a href="mailto:harlequin@novastar.org?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading%20(was%20:%20goals%20of%20AI)">harlequin@novastar.org</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you know that destructive uploading will not damage your soul any more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ordinary life will, but are still afraid of it, then that is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; irrational fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually, my reasoning more along the lines of ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why risk the unknown philosophical possibilities in big-bang instant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive copy when I can try a much more strategically familiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (slow incremental migratory upload) Â way to achieve the exact same end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's like abseiling down the skyscraper instead of taking the lift.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure it's _exciting_ but obviously more risky.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand your point. What if we all agree that the
<br>
destructive copying will be at least as reliable as walking across the
<br>
room is. Is still possible that you might die or lose your identity
<br>
through the process? If so, what evidence is there that walking
<br>
doesn't have the same bad effect, and we just don't realise it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm claiming 2 things really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's rational to choose the lower risk option if the rewards are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal. No soul required. Even a non-sentient algorithm could make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and entirely separately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if your upload machine in any way performs a &quot;copy&quot; operation then by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition it has created a universe where there are 2 of that thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any subsequent events such as destruction cannot reach back in time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and alter that fact regardless of the details.
</em><br>
<p>But we can arrange it so that the two things do not exist
<br>
simultaneously. It's the same with walking: you vanish from the
<br>
universe at one point and reappear at another point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's a matter for culture to debate the value of anything destroyed .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Logic cannot prove what was destroyed had no value outside of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural context. Culture is obviously subjective.
</em><br>
<p>Well, conceivably there might be people who mourn the death of their
<br>
former selves when they realise that over the course of a year almost
<br>
all the original matter in their body has been replaced.
