I think a better way to phrase the concern than &quot;continuity&quot; is expectation of experience. I fully expect an upload to &quot;be me&quot; in basically every way. My concern is that I would not experience what they experience, just as I don't taste an apple when you bite it. Assuming I don't taste it when they bite it either, if I'm shot after (or before) that version is made, I don't expect to experience anything. I really like experiencing things, on inspection I care considerably more about that than if it can be said that &quot;I exist&quot;. I consider myself an all right fellow, but there are plenty of other bright altruists who could do the things I want done just as well. 
<br>
If it's discovered that we are routinely duplicated and one of us destroyed, I would be willing to give quite a lot to stop this process, and in so doing increase the chances that I will actually experience any of the future.

<br>
<p>Do you have any desire to change the situation, to eliminate this
<br>
duplication-and-destruction? How much desire - what would you give up
<br>
in order obtain &quot;continuity&quot; (whatever that means)? If continuity was
<br>
actually very preferable to &quot;duplication-and-destruction&quot;, then you
<br>
would have some intuition that you would be willing to give up
<br>
something in order to obtain continuity.
<br>
<p>I personally experience almost no desire to eliminate this physical
<br>
phenomenon, which leads me to believe that my gut reaction against
<br>
duplication-and-destruction is actually irrational, and explainable in
<br>
terms of the status quo bias, and maybe an aversion to violence or
<br>
suicide.
