Hello everyone.  I'm Roonie, I'm new here.
<br>
<p>As I've been reading up on the various websites and such in the Singularity circles, I can't have helped but notice that many of you seem to believe that the best way to save the world is to bring about the Singularity as soon as possible.
<br>
<p>This is totally unacceptable.
<br>
<p>At &quot;takeoff,&quot; an AI will be a very rational intelligence: it will operate in a world based on rules and discrete logic.  And it will most likey view our human, intuitive logic with a healthy bit of suspicion.  Our thought processes will appear to &quot;jump circuits,&quot; and that will seem a bit unnatural to the AI.
<br>
<p>So in order to convince the AI that this is not a completely dangerous thing, we will need to be able to show it that we are not in danger of destroying ourselves.  We will need to have *already* saved the world.
<br>
<p>Or it might just decide that we are incorrigible and untrustable.
<br>
<p>Besides, the Singularity is not a certainty . . . and if we don't take immediate action, we won't last that long anyways.
<br>
<p>I know this is not really the place to discuss economics, but you are concerned about making sure that the future goes off without a hitch, right?  Well, basically, this whole financial crisis that's been going on only makes sense if the forces of Evil did it on purpose.
<br>
<p>Which means that the world is in very immediate danger.
