<p><em>&gt; Suppose there was a program that simulated you so well that nobody could

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after &quot;You&quot; shoot &quot;Yourself&quot;?  Is it homicide or suicide?
</em><br>
<p>1) You(p) shoots You(~p)
<br>
2) You(~p) shoots You(~p)
<br>
<p>Or does #1 suppose the answer you are asking about?
<br>
<p>If the &quot;nobody&quot; in question is inclusive of the subjective experience of
<br>
both You(p) and You(~p) then it probably won't matter.  If You(~p) is aware
<br>
that it is in fact NOT You(p), then it would matter only to You(~p).  Of
<br>
course, in either case of You(~p) being dead, it would matter very little to
<br>
the continuous You(p).  However, it might matter to You(~p)'s friends that
<br>
You(p) is no longer able to show up to in-person events and makes up
<br>
increasingly convoluted (yet completely You(~p)-sounding) excuses for why
<br>
You(~p) didn't show up.  I guess once everyone has completely migrated to
<br>
You(p)'s digital environment it will once again not matter that You(~p) is
<br>
gone.
