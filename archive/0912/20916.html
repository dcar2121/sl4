<em>&gt;&gt; Even if some subjective experiences are highly similar to, and causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; computed from, other subjective experiences, they are not connected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So even if there is a connection (computation) between two things they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not connected. Huh?
</em><br>
<p>They may be connected due to their subjective content, but not due to
<br>
the causal link. If two experiences S1 and S2 are generated by the one
<br>
computation but share no content (because the program deletes data
<br>
from the memory of the subject and inserts unrelated data in its
<br>
place) then there is no subjective connection between them. On the
<br>
other hand, if the two experiences are generated by unrelated
<br>
computations but just happen to share content, so that S2 remembers
<br>
being S1, then they are subjectively connected.
<br>
<p>Essentially it is difficulty with this idea that leads people to
<br>
reject uploading, teleportation etc. They figure that only if the
<br>
thinking happens in the same head can you continue to be the same
<br>
person. But in fact the only reason to keep things in the same head is
<br>
that this is normally the only way to ensure that subjective
<br>
experiences keep happening, one after the other, with the right sort
<br>
of content. If this could be done in some other way then you would be
<br>
just as happy being you, remembering your past and looking forward to
<br>
more experiences in the future. It could be the case right now that
<br>
every second you experience is being computed on a different machine,
<br>
perhaps even causally disconnected machines. You would have no way of
<br>
knowing, and no reason to worry provided that future experiences keep
<br>
coming.
