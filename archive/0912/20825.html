<em>&gt;I can give an exact answer to your question. I would not hesitate to kill
</em><br>
myself if the copy that survives is running in lockstep with me, since in
<br>
that case I could expect to live on in the copy with an uninterrupted stream
<br>
of consciousness. 
<br>
<p>The only instance of you that is going to be in lockstep with you, is you!

<em>&gt;&gt; Suppose there was a program that simulated you so well that nobody 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could tell the difference between you and the program in a Turing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; test environment. What is the probability that the program will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you after you shoot yourself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely everyone recognizes my question as nonsense.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's nonsense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The more important question is: what will it take to convince you to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shoot yourself?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the more important question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer surely depends on the process by which the upload is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created, even if the end result is the same. There can not be an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;appearance&quot; of death, because as we know, all animals are programmed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by evolution to fear the things that can kill them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So naturally we value continuity of experience, and continuity of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical body, even though rationally it makes no difference. Having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two copies exist at the same time destroys the illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a similar reason, it is important that nobody else can tell the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between you and your copy. Otherwise they would believe the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload failed and not try it themselves. It doesn't make any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference to your copy if the memories are different or not, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be unaware of any differences.
</em><br>
<p>I can give an exact answer to your question. I would not hesitate to kill
<br>
myself if the copy that survives is running in lockstep with me, since in
<br>
that case I could expect to live on in the copy with an uninterrupted stream
<br>
of consciousness. This is what happens from day to day and year to year in
<br>
ordinary life: my body disintegrates and is replaced by a copy who thinks he
<br>
is me, and it doesn't worry me apart from the fact that the copy is a little
<br>
more decrepit every time. (Indeed, aging could be seen as being due to the
<br>
fact that the disintegration/copying process is not 100% accurate). But if
<br>
the two copies start to diverge then I would hesitate to kill myself, and
<br>
the longer the period of divergence the more hesitant I would be.
