Hi John,
<br>
<p>On Wed, Dec 2, 2009 at 05:11, John K Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:johnkclark@fastmail.fm?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading">johnkclark@fastmail.fm</a>&gt; wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; As usual in these thought experiments you assume you are the original,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the original and you would need EXTREMELY good evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince one of them that they were wrong. And even then many just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't believe it no matter what.
</em><br>
<p>agreed entirely
<br>
in the instant after duplication it is easy to arrange matters so that
<br>
both &quot;me&quot;s have no idea if they are the original or a copy.
<br>
however the original me before going to the upload clinic will know
<br>
this and therefore not go so as to avoid such a (to me) intolerable
<br>
result.
<br>
<p>if it happened to me against my will the resulting us would readily
<br>
admit that neither of us knew which was the original. It would be a
<br>
huge personal and legal mess no doubt.
<br>
If one of us happened to be dead the instant after duplication it
<br>
would not effect the remaining me's thoughts on the situation. It
<br>
would be the same as if one of us was ran over by a bus upon exiting
<br>
the clinic.
<br>
The only significant difference would be fear of the &quot;shooting people
<br>
clinic&quot; vs fear of deadly traffic.
<br>
I am of course assuming that the shock of such a situation would not
<br>
precipitate different reactions than how I currently think.
<br>
I fully recognise that others could have entirely different reactions,
<br>
some of which would seem very strange to me. Such is the great variety
<br>
of intelligent life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I would not consider them as having any property
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rights over any of my physical or informational assets.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You would think that regardless if you were the original or the copy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would both think you have exclusive rights to John McNamara's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets, and both would have an equally valid claim; after all you both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vividly remember buying them and you both remember earning the money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so.
</em><br>
<p>no
<br>
you personally might think that if you experienced that situation and
<br>
I wouldn't argue against you, but I know my own mind much better than
<br>
you. If _I_ woke up with a duplicate and neither of us had any which
<br>
was the original we would both (at least initially) consider ourselves
<br>
of undetermined legal identity and victims of a terrible crime. I
<br>
expect we would co-operate as much as possible to survive, prosper and
<br>
exact vengeance on the criminal that duplicated us without permission.
<br>
If it was later proved to me beyond reasonable doubt that I was the
<br>
copy I would relinquish all legal property claims. Hopefully I would
<br>
live in society that would offer me charitable support.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I would be of the opinion that there should be legal societal rules to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; handle such an awkward situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the scientific method cannot detect any difference between the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but nevertheless you think there should be laws that treat the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently. Sounds rather like South Africa under apartheid.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't imply &quot;there should be laws that treat the two differently&quot;.
<br>
And I certainly didn't imply that either should be oppressed in any way.
<br>
In fact I deliberately make no comment on what laws I would politically support.
<br>
My sole point is that any ordered society in which these kinds of
<br>
events occur will write new laws in reaction to these events that have
<br>
not occurred previously.
<br>
They could be very very nasty laws like your sinister apartheid
<br>
reference or they could be very very nice laws. I'll leave both to the
<br>
readers imagination.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; If a friend had an upload made and they didn't survive, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consider my friend dead, mourn them and probably avoid the upload to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; preserve my own mental health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well of course you would. As I said before most people, even most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on transhuman lists, believe in the soul. I don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Â John K Clark
</em><br>
<p>You might be right. I have no evidence either way.
<br>
However, I get the impression that you're implying I personally also
<br>
believe in souls even if I were to say I didn't, based on the bit you
<br>
quoted ?
<br>
I don't.
<br>
I think their only existence is exactly the same as Santa Claus and
<br>
the Easter Bunny.
<br>
I don't mock children who believe in Santa Claus though I would be
<br>
very wary of scientific neural engineering research done by scientists
<br>
who claimed the soul was real. I still wouldn't mock them though.
<br>
<p>My reference to avoiding a known non-original duplicate of a dead
<br>
friend for my mental-health is a perfectly logical psychological
<br>
reaction. I know my friend was shoot in the head (or whatever) and I
<br>
know this other person was an exact duplicate at one point in time
<br>
(and is otherwise indistinguishable still).
<br>
It would just be plain creepy for many people. No need whatsoever to
<br>
drag &quot;souls&quot; into the explanation.
<br>
<p><p>Best Regards
<br>
John Mc Namara
