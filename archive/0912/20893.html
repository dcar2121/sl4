<p>
I've noticed a discussion deadlock between 2 different interpretations
<br>
of the &quot;instant copy and destroy&quot; style upload.
<br>
This is an attempt to explore that further by varying the experiment.
<br>
<p>I'll be dropping the topic after this as I think it very unlikely to
<br>
happen anyway for reasons unrelated to what anyone thinks about it.
<br>
<p>The &quot;instant upload&quot; thought experiment has appeared several times on
<br>
this list for a few reasons.
<br>
The most common I've noticed is as support of the hypothesis that an
<br>
uninformed uploaded mind could notice no difference if put in an
<br>
identical body, therefore they are &quot;the same person&quot; for all rational
<br>
considerations and therefore the same follows if they are uploaded
<br>
into a non-identical body as well. An identical body would of course
<br>
not be desirable in practice as it would offer exactly zero advantages
<br>
over the original body (ignoring teleportation).
<br>
<p>i respectfully submit that weaknesses of previous experiments include
<br>
biases due to
<br>
the &quot;blackbox&quot; nature of the device, mind data in = mind data out
<br>
the small time and distance of the effect relative to human scale (ie
<br>
'instant' and only a few meters away)
<br>
<p><p>consider this thought experiment
<br>
hypothesis 1 : that &quot;selfness&quot;/&quot;me-ness&quot;/&quot;continuity of mind
<br>
existence&quot; is an entirely cultural quality and cannot be rationally
<br>
proved OR disproved to exist in any specific case outside of a
<br>
cultural value context.
<br>
<p>hypothesis 2 : that information (specifically including a 100% perfect
<br>
model of a specific sentient mind) has no existence separate of
<br>
matter+energy therefore it is subject to the same physical travel
<br>
restrictions as matter+energy.
<br>
<p><p>I'm not sure what the current physics says about the possibility of
<br>
moving information from one particle to another without at least
<br>
briefly creating a copy, (any takers ?)
<br>
<p>- - - - -
<br>
<p>A billion years ago in the galaxy 'AG1026' that is just outside the
<br>
observable universe (from Earth) and causally disconnected from us,
<br>
lived a vast Jupiter brain named 'bob', whose hobby was to
<br>
pseudo-randomly design minds. It creates them based on rational base
<br>
designs and randomises the details. They are all stored as binary data
<br>
and are never 'run'.
<br>
<p>One day it happens to create data perfectly identical to mind '2'. (see below)
<br>
The odds are of course laughable, but non-zero. It is a thought experiment.
<br>
<p>in the year 2099 here on Earth...
<br>
[mind '1' housed in body 'A'] voluntarily enters an &quot;instant copy and
<br>
destroy&quot; style upload clinic.
<br>
The copy is not intended to be perfect, instead all organs but the CNS
<br>
will be upgraded.(hence the motivation to do this at all)
<br>
The CNS is always copied 100 %perfectly.
<br>
[mind '2' housed in body 'A'] is scanned and the observation signals
<br>
travel through the sensor wires into the device's memory cells where
<br>
they rest and can be non-destructively read and manipulated.
<br>
the mind changed from '1' to '2' because several minutes passed
<br>
between entering the clinic and the scanner activating.
<br>
exactly one Planck time later ..
<br>
[mind '2' housed in body 'B'] is created
<br>
exactly one Planck time later ..
<br>
the machine fails (1 in a 10billion chance) and completely destroys
<br>
[mind '2' housed in body 'A'] and [mind '2' housed in body 'B'] and
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>A billion years later in the galaxy 'AG1026' that is still outside the
<br>
observable universe (from Earth) and causally disconnected from us,
<br>
'bob' starts running the mind '2' dataset, it previously created
<br>
pseudo-randomly, in a nice VR that seems normal to it where it
<br>
marries, has kids, grows old and dies. At the point of death bob
<br>
simply stops the simulation but keeps the data and all past changes to
<br>
that data.
<br>
<p><p>no other significant events occur and no information is hidden from
<br>
you as (god-like) observers of these events
<br>
<p>- - - - -
<br>
<p>so
<br>
what happened ?
<br>
Is there 1,2,3 or more 'self's in existence here ?
<br>
<p>if 1 when did it die ?
<br>
did it die more than once ?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>My interpretation is that there are 3 entirely separate 'self's.
<br>
As the scanner is designed to copy there are immediately 2 of
<br>
something when it does so.
<br>
It cannot destroy the original exactly 0 time after the copy operation
<br>
as that makes a nonsense of causality
<br>
AFAIK the Planck time is the shortest interval of time between two
<br>
causally related events.
<br>
It doesn't matter if all the bits of [mind '2' housed in body 'A'] are
<br>
copied and then destroyed in a single batch or binary bit by binary
<br>
bit, the result is the same.
<br>
If the device was designed to somehow freeze all activity and
<br>
physically move the body subatomic particle by subatomic particle from
<br>
one chamber to another, then I would allow that no copy had been made
<br>
and nothing significant destroyed. It would be teleportation though
<br>
rather than &quot;copy and destroy&quot; uploading.
<br>
<p>So in summary, my POV
<br>
[mind '2' housed in body 'A'] is arranging a copy of themselves to be
<br>
'born' and then their own destruction.
<br>
both [mind '2' housed in body 'A'] and [mind '2' housed in body 'B']
<br>
die in an accident.
<br>
[mind '2' housed in body 'B']'s lifespan from 'birth' to death is only
<br>
one Planck time (exactly enough time for every sub-atomic particle to
<br>
make the least possible action that is greater than &quot;no action&quot;.
<br>
The fact that [mind '2' in 'AG1026'] is the same as the others is mere
<br>
coincidence.
<br>
<p><p><p>I'm much more interested in hearing your interpretations.
<br>
<p><p>Best Regards
<br>
John Mc Namara
