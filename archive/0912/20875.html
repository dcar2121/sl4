<em>&gt;There wouldn't be a problem if the programs were an inputless virtual
</em><br>
environment with conscious inhabitants. You could run it on any general
<br>
purpose computer with enough time and memory and the result would be just
<br>
the same, independent of the actual hardware. If you are living in such a
<br>
virtual reality now there is no way you could know anything about the
<br>
details of the hardware you are running on, or notice any change if the
<br>
hardware is changed.
<br>
<p>I can somewhat agree with all that but this uses a notion of identity that
<br>
is purely based on introspection. Surely any useful idea of identity enables
<br>
an external observer to find sameness/equivalence. If I imagine another
<br>
universe that is running just like ours, only its been going faster so we're
<br>
all older in that universe, I still find it hard to say there's any useful
<br>
notion of equivalence between the two universes *except* inasmuch as one
<br>
predicts the future of the other.

<p><em>&gt; The example of the Universe you give is interesting but I don't think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is analagous because by definition the Universe is not dependent on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its environment. Every conscioussnes that we can conceive of, is. Even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we stretch our definition of consciousness to include these systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without input, no real system is immune to the effects of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment... E.g. cosmic rays, quantum effects etc. There are going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be perturbations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But lets even assume that we can somehow prevent that (with shielding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example). You're saying that it is ok they run at different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speeds. But if we have two essentially identical intelligent agents, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lets call them Forex Trading Black Boxes A and B, similar in every way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except that B is ever-so-slightly faster, clearly B has an advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if we assume that these two programs can eternally run the exact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same code-sequence, they still differ in their respective performance. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is why again I make the point that I don't think it makes sense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say the identity resides purely in the code. The physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation makes a difference. To outside observers, these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementations display different behaviour. These agents have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different personalities. If my brain ran at double speed, people would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice the difference. I'd be some kind of superhero or at least I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would drive my wife nuts twice as often.
</em><br>
