<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I assume that you are referring to the no clone theorem, which says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; that it is impossible to perfectly duplicate a given quantum state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; However, this ultimate level of copying fidelity cannot be fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; to identity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Cannot&quot; is a very strong word.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes but no stronger than accuracy demands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Very unlikely&quot; is more apporpriate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show me how it could possibly be untrue.
</em><br>
<p>First of all, I don't have to. You are claiming an impossibility
<br>
theorem - quantum effects have no significant effect on consciousness,
<br>
with probability one - so the proof here is for you to supply. All I'm
<br>
claiming is that there is not enough evidence for probability one.
<br>
<p>But I'll still try and suggest how it could be untrue, anyway.
<br>
<p>Second, if AI is possible on traditional computers (which I believe,
<br>
with probability 0.999), and quantum computing is possible
<br>
(probability 0.99999), then you can implement an AI on a quantum
<br>
computer. You can even do so in such a way that the data of
<br>
consiousness, the connections to use, is stored in supperimposed form.
<br>
In this AI, erasing the quantum information would kill it. So there is
<br>
nothing wrong in principle with an consciouss dependent on quantum
<br>
effects.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, appealing to chaos theory, you can get great macroscopic
<br>
stability in the outcomes of certain differential equations. It
<br>
therefore seems pretty likely that you could implement the AI above in
<br>
such a way that it is resilient to macroscopic shocks. Even if that is
<br>
not possible, simple redundancy would accomplish the same thing.
<br>
<p>Fourthly, our brain is a mess, cobbled together according to what
<br>
worked at the time, and there is no such thing as &quot;turning our brains
<br>
off&quot; or erasing the quantum effects and starting it up again.
<br>
<p>So to sumarise - quantum dependent resilient consciousness is
<br>
possible, our brain has structures close to the quantum scale,
<br>
evolution would have used quantum effects if these were easily
<br>
accessible to it, and we have not seen what erasing these qunatum
<br>
effects does to the brain. So a retreat from perfect certainty seems
<br>
justified.
