Hi Folks,
<br>
<p>First post to list (braces for the bullet) and observation on this thread's
<br>
debate.
<br>
<p>To me this sounds like a matter of simulation resolution.
<br>
<p>A human mind is the information output 'artefact' of a physical system.
<br>
We can choose to simulate that physical system over a wide range between the
<br>
following 2 extremes.
<br>
a: extreme low resolution
<br>
1 bit, 1=mind is 'on' 0 = mind is 'off'
<br>
only useful in financial accounting obviously
<br>
<p>b: extreme high resolution
<br>
simulate using _all_ information on the system
<br>
as we don't have a final complete physics theory of everything we obviously
<br>
cannot even determine if this is even possible
<br>
it would effectively be an absolutely perfect simulation of actual physical
<br>
reality all the way down past quarks, strings and n dimensions to whatever
<br>
idea is at the very bottom.
<br>
a bit beyond sl4 i suspect
<br>
<p>between a and b is a large range
<br>
it's possible (pending TOE) that b resolution simulation guarantees a zero
<br>
error rate in the simulation output, the mind. Barring non-physical
<br>
influences that would leave no wiggle-room left to say that the simulation
<br>
isn't perfect in every way.
<br>
<p>Any level of simulation below b introduces errors in the output data all the
<br>
way down to having just 1 bit of reliable data at simulation level a
<br>
<p>Therefore its a matter of deciding the acceptable error level for your
<br>
objective.
<br>
All you need is a mastery of the physics and math required to get down to
<br>
your required level of acceptable error rate.
<br>
<p>b involves all sorts of things we not good at like probability and
<br>
infinities.
<br>
<p>There are 2 separate questions here.
<br>
<p>1
<br>
Is any non-zero error acceptable in principle ?
<br>
This is a philosophical question I think, not an engineering one.
<br>
<p><p><p>2
<br>
What is the maximum tolerable error that will not result in the failure of
<br>
your engineering project (ie upload of a live human with no apparent
<br>
deviations from expected normal thinking patterns (including fuzzy things
<br>
like emotions/inspiration etc) for at least 1000 years with 99.9999
<br>
confidence level etc etc).
<br>
This is a practical engineering problem for a branch of engineering that
<br>
doesn't exist yet.
<br>
<p>my answers for the curious
<br>
1
<br>
I'm not comfortable with a non-zero error I must admin, now that it's &quot;on
<br>
the menu&quot; so to speak. That said, the now pre-upload me would jump at any
<br>
error rate accepted by sane-looking engineering types as an alternative to
<br>
oblivion. I wouldn't be surprised if the post-upload me wanted a lot of
<br>
virtual beer to get over the whole thing.
<br>
<p><p>2
<br>
no idea, but I wouldn't be stunned to learn that something more detailed
<br>
than neural charge levels was required. Which would be unfortunate because
<br>
it would be harder. Perhaps I'm pessimistic on this one.
<br>
<p><p>Apologies if this has wandered off-topic.
<br>
<p>Best Regards
<br>
John Mc Namara
