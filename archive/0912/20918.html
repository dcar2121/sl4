<em>&gt;If two experiences S1 and S2 are generated by the one computation but share
</em><br>
no content (because the program deletes data from the memory of the subject
<br>
and inserts unrelated data in its place) then there is no subjective
<br>
connection between them. On the other hand, if the two experiences are
<br>
generated by unrelated computations but just happen to share content, so
<br>
that S2 remembers being S1, then they are subjectively connected.
<br>
<p>This is interesting. What kind of content overlap does it take for two data
<br>
sets to be &quot;subjectively connected&quot;? Is there a clear definition?

<p><p>2009/12/7 John K Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:johnkclark@fastmail.fm?Subject=RE:%20Copying%20nonsense%20(was%20Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading%20(was%20:%20goals%20of%20AI))">johnkclark@fastmail.fm</a>&gt;:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Even if some subjective experiences are highly similar to, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; causally computed from, other subjective experiences, they are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; connected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So even if there is a connection (computation) between two things they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not connected. Huh?
</em><br>
<p>They may be connected due to their subjective content, but not due to the
<br>
causal link. If two experiences S1 and S2 are generated by the one
<br>
computation but share no content (because the program deletes data from the
<br>
memory of the subject and inserts unrelated data in its
<br>
place) then there is no subjective connection between them. On the other
<br>
hand, if the two experiences are generated by unrelated computations but
<br>
just happen to share content, so that S2 remembers being S1, then they are
<br>
subjectively connected.
<br>
<p>Essentially it is difficulty with this idea that leads people to reject
<br>
uploading, teleportation etc. They figure that only if the thinking happens
<br>
in the same head can you continue to be the same person. But in fact the
<br>
only reason to keep things in the same head is that this is normally the
<br>
only way to ensure that subjective experiences keep happening, one after the
<br>
other, with the right sort of content. If this could be done in some other
<br>
way then you would be just as happy being you, remembering your past and
<br>
looking forward to more experiences in the future. It could be the case
<br>
right now that every second you experience is being computed on a different
<br>
machine, perhaps even causally disconnected machines. You would have no way
<br>
of knowing, and no reason to worry provided that future experiences keep
<br>
coming.
