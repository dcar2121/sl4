2009/12/7 Bradley Thomas &lt;<a href="mailto:brad36@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Copying%20nonsense%20(was%20Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading%20(was%20:%20goals%20of%20AI))">brad36@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If two experiences S1 and S2 are generated by the one computation but share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no content (because the program deletes data from the memory of the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and inserts unrelated data in its place) then there is no subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection between them. On the other hand, if the two experiences are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generated by unrelated computations but just happen to share content, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that S2 remembers being S1, then they are subjectively connected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is interesting. What kind of content overlap does it take for two data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sets to be &quot;subjectively connected&quot;? Is there a clear definition?
</em><br>
<p>There is no exact definition. It is possible to lose large chunks of
<br>
your memory and personality as a result of brain injury and still
<br>
remain you, i.e. feel that you are subjectively connected to previous
<br>
versions of yourself. But if the injury is bad enough that you
<br>
remember nothing of the past and people who know you don't recognise
<br>
you apart from your physical appearance, then you may as well be dead.
<br>
Things would be more complex if memories, personalities and the sense
<br>
of identity itself could be altered easily and discontinuously. On the
<br>
other hand gradual alteration might be OK, even if the end result is
<br>
radically different, since that is what happens as a person grows up.
