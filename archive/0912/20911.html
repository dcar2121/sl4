<em>&gt;There are no threads connecting subjective experiences.  There are simply
</em><br>
different subjective experiences.  Even if some subjective experiences are
<br>
highly similar to, and causally computed from
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/qx/timeless_identity/">http://lesswrong.com/lw/qx/timeless_identity/</a>&gt; , other subjective
<br>
experiences, they are not connected.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To me, this is just flat wrong, not less wrong! The &quot;thread&quot; that causally
<br>
ties one subjective experience to the next, or one observer moment to the
<br>
next, is the physical manifestation of that experience (e.g.
<br>
electrical/chemical signals) in physical matter (e.g. neurons/transistors).
<br>
The reason I don't wake up feeling like Britney Spears some mornings is
<br>
obvious. I don't have her body and brain. I have my body and brain. Clearly
<br>
my subjective experiences are dependent on my physical makeup. If my
<br>
physical body woke up in her bed and someone came in and told me I had dance
<br>
rehearsal at 11am, I still wouldn't feel like Britney Spears. I'd wonder
<br>
what the hell happened although it might be fun to play along to see if
<br>
anyone noticed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
That's also why I believe this physical body [taps self] will still produce
<br>
the subjective experience of Brad Thomasness -- with certainty -- not 50% or
<br>
any other number -- even after this physical body is cloned or uploaded.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In my view it makes no sense to say that OM2 is causally computed from OM1
<br>
and yet there is no connection between them. A causal effect is a logical
<br>
relationship and a logical relationship models nothing real unless it models
<br>
some kind of interaction subject to physical law in space-time, i.e. some
<br>
kind of physical connection.

<br>
<p><p>I quite agree with this. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p>You ask which copy will be you? What will you experience? These are not well
<br>
formed questions because &quot;you&quot; is not a well defined concept in a world
<br>
where minds can be copied. The question only has artificial importance
<br>
because of this evolved belief in this nonexistent thing that people so
<br>
desperately want to preserve, sometimes called a &quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;qualia&quot;,
<br>
&quot;experience&quot;, or a &quot;soul&quot; that has absolutely no effect on behavior. So why
<br>
even talk about it? If you taboo the words &quot;you&quot; and &quot;I&quot; then there is no
<br>
controversy whatsoever.
<br>
<p><p>It really seems about time for a philosopher (or whoever) to define some new
<br>
words with a finer grain. Even on the scale of a society, it looks like we
<br>
we'll need them. I agree those terms are tricky. I have strong suspicions
<br>
that upwards of 50% of disagreement stems from different uses of them. I've
<br>
tried to stay away from them, except in asking &quot;what do you expect to
<br>
experience?&quot;. In this case however, I'm referring to &quot;you&quot; in the now sense,
<br>
before uploading, when the concept is more solid.  
<br>
<p>I still feel like the point of the disagreement is not well understood by
<br>
many. I'll make one last quick attempt to lay it out like I see it, and try
<br>
to make this balanced in terms of word use (e.g. not calling anything from
<br>
either perspective &quot;magical&quot;). There is indeed no effect on behavior, the
<br>
concern is for something different (noting that such non-objective concerns
<br>
are rare/nonexistent in every other aspect of life). Everyone seems to agree
<br>
that -assuming sufficient technology - each instance will experience the
<br>
same things: everyone will remember their life as the unique person, and
<br>
those in new locations will simply perceive that they have been teleported. 
<br>
<p>We strive for pleasurable future experience. The critical question is
<br>
whether - in normal life - whether we are justified in expecting to
<br>
experience anything. To have it explained by someone with higher status than
<br>
I, I quote Yudkowsky from his LW article on The Anthropic
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/19d/the_anthropic_trilemma/">http://lesswrong.com/lw/19d/the_anthropic_trilemma/</a>&gt; Trilemma. 
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;And the third horn (ETA: possible solution) of the trilemma is to reject
<br>
the idea of the personal future - that there's any meaningful sense in which
<br>
I can anticipate waking up as myself tomorrow, rather than Britney Spears.
<br>
Or, for that matter, that there's any meaningful sense in which I can
<br>
anticipate being myself in five seconds, rather than Britney Spears.  In
<br>
five seconds there will be an Eliezer Yudkowsky, and there will be a Britney
<br>
Spears, but it is meaningless to speak of the currentEliezer &quot;continuing on&quot;
<br>
as Eliezer+5 rather than Britney+5; these are simply three different people
<br>
we are talking about.
<br>
<p><p>There are no threads connecting subjective experiences.  There are simply
<br>
different subjective experiences.  Even if some subjective experiences are
<br>
highly similar to, and causally computed
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/qx/timeless_identity/">http://lesswrong.com/lw/qx/timeless_identity/</a>&gt; from, other subjective
<br>
experiences, they are not connected.
<br>
<p>I still have trouble biting that bullet for some reason.  Maybe I'm naive, I
<br>
know, but there's a sense in which I just can't seem to let go of the
<br>
question, &quot;What will I see happen next?&quot; &quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p>So maybe we can't expect to &quot;continue on&quot; as our future selves, maybe we
<br>
can. If we can, then we have a reason to try to preserve whatever allows us
<br>
to &quot;continue on&quot;. If we can't ever expect to do this, then we never have to
<br>
be concerned about it. And yes, once again, I agree that there are no
<br>
objective differences, and that to be so concerned with something
<br>
unmeasurable is unusual or unique. I do not find this terribly surprising,
<br>
as this issue disassembles the very subject, in the grammatical sense. Like
<br>
you suggested, it is quite possible that there is no &quot;continuing on&quot;. It is
<br>
impossible to measure or test for it (AFAIK), and for that reason it is
<br>
quite unjustified to assume it does or does not exist.  
<br>
<p><p>Really, this whole discussion is getting tedious. I could go through the SL4
<br>
archives and find a dozen more just like it if I didn't have more important
<br>
things to do with my time.
<br>
<p><p>It's my first time with such a discussion so it's still fun for me, but I
<br>
realize it's not the first time for others. My concern is whether any
<br>
fence-sitters will be left with a suggestion of some large hole (as I see
<br>
it) in this perspective, but I will make a strong effort to resist further
<br>
replies.
