<em>&gt; I wasn't referring to the miscalculation of risk with fear of flying,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to an irrational fear of being a kilometre up in the air in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aluminium tube even though you know it is perfectly safe.
</em><br>
<p>I guessed wrong.
<br>
'perfectly' ? do you have shares an airline :-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you know that destructive uploading will not damage your soul any more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary life will, but are still afraid of it, then that is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational fear.
</em><br>
<p>actually, my reasoning more along the lines of ....
<br>
why risk the unknown philosophical possibilities in big-bang instant
<br>
destructive copy when I can try a much more strategically familiar
<br>
(slow incremental migratory upload)  way to achieve the exact same end
<br>
result ?
<br>
It's like abseiling down the skyscraper instead of taking the lift.
<br>
Sure it's _exciting_ but obviously more risky.
<br>
<p>I'm claiming 2 things really
<br>
<p>It's rational to choose the lower risk option if the rewards are
<br>
equal. No soul required. Even a non-sentient algorithm could make the
<br>
same choice.
<br>
<p>and entirely separately
<br>
<p>if your upload machine in any way performs a &quot;copy&quot; operation then by
<br>
definition it has created a universe where there are 2 of that thing,
<br>
any subsequent events such as destruction cannot reach back in time
<br>
and alter that fact regardless of the details.
<br>
<p>it's a matter for culture to debate the value of anything destroyed .
<br>
Logic cannot prove what was destroyed had no value outside of a
<br>
cultural context. Culture is obviously subjective.
<br>
<p>Best Regards
<br>
