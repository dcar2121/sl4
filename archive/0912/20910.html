On Sat, 5 Dec 2009  &quot;Filipe Sobreira&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:warlordbcm1@yahoo.com.br?Subject=Re:%20Res:%20Copying%20nonsense%20(was%20Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading%20(was%20:%20goals%20of%20AI))">warlordbcm1@yahoo.com.br</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One doesn't need to believe in the soul to verify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if they are two _observers_ then they're also part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely, provided of course that the premise is true and
<br>
there really are TWO observers. Or do you also have the crazy idea that
<br>
Filipe Sobreira is a noun?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the time the copy is created/instantiated both the copy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the original (doesn't matter if they know or not who's who)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be able to measure their positions regarding the other (a measurable quality)
</em><br>
<p>How in the world are you going to measure absolute position? You must be
<br>
in a symmetrical room with your copy or you'd be seeing different things
<br>
and your exact copy would no longer be exact. Suppose I show you a
<br>
button
<br>
and claim that if you push it you and your copy will instantly change
<br>
positions. You both push the button and of course absolutely nothing
<br>
seems to have happened either objectively or subjectively. You can't
<br>
even tell if I was telling the truth, the button may be connected to
<br>
nothing, there is no way to know and no reason to care.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and also they'll be able to tell themselves apart, just by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poking themselves and verifying the other don't feel nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Don't be silly, if you are an exact copy and you decide to poke yourself
<br>
then the original will want to also.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of self'. If you don't believe or don't know what is a sense of self,
</em><br>
<p>Everybody knows and believes in a sense of self although some may claim
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; both copies are neuron by neuron identical, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they should be the same, but they aren't 
</em><br>
<p>And it still looks like bread and wine after a certain Roman Catholic
<br>
ritual but it's not, really it's the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the observer won't go away.
</em><br>
<p>I have no problem with the idea of an observer, I have a problem withe
<br>
TWO identical observers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lots of people around, and that includes the most famous _troll_ of this list
</em><br>
<p>Gee, I wonder who you could be referring to. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; like to believe themselves to be computer programs running in the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a quite extraordinary delusion, without any reasonable foundation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a blind dogma, not worse of those held by many religions, Abrahamic or not.
</em><br>
<p>What a devastating retort! I'm known for despising religion so accuse me
<br>
of being religious. Wow, I never heard that one before!
