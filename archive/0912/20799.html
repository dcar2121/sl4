<em>&gt; Suppose there was a program that simulated you so well that nobody could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell the difference between you and the program in a Turing test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. What is the probability that the program will be you after you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shoot yourself?
</em><br>
<p>In order to understand the predicate &quot;will be you&quot; we need to
<br>
understand what the consequences of it are - otherwise we're making a
<br>
distinction without a difference.

<p>There's a status quo bias, which might lead us to favor an environment
<br>
similar to the present one (no uploading). In order to combat the
<br>
status quo bias, we can use Nick Bostrom's reversal test.
<br>

<br>
<p>Suppose that (unbeknownst to all of us), we are routinely duplicated
<br>
and one copy is destroyed - some unknown physical process that has
<br>
been operating for a long time.
<br>
<p>Do you have any desire to change the situation, to eliminate this
<br>
duplication-and-destruction? How much desire - what would you give up
<br>
in order obtain &quot;continuity&quot; (whatever that means)? If continuity was
<br>
actually very preferable to &quot;duplication-and-destruction&quot;, then you
<br>
would have some intuition that you would be willing to give up
<br>
something in order to obtain continuity.
<br>
<p>I personally experience almost no desire to eliminate this physical
<br>
phenomenon, which leads me to believe that my gut reaction against
<br>
duplication-and-destruction is actually irrational, and explainable in
<br>
terms of the status quo bias, and maybe an aversion to violence or
<br>
suicide.
