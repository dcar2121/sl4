<em>&gt;As usual in these thought experiments you assume you are the original, but
</em><br>
you must realize that both parties after the duplication would think they
<br>
are the original and you would need EXTREMELY good evidence to convince one
<br>
of them that they were wrong. And even then many just
<br>
wouldn't believe it no matter what.     
<br>
<p>It is arbitrary which person is used as the example from which the
<br>
perspective is drawn. I don't think this means there's necessarily an
<br>
assumption. I compare it to using &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; in writing, when either
<br>
gender works.

<p><p>On Wed, 2 Dec 2009 &quot;John McNamara&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:harlequin@novastar.org?Subject=RE:%20[sl4]%20Uploading">harlequin@novastar.org</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Were a type 1 upload made of me involuntarily (I would not permit it) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I survived, I would consider them to be a sort of weird off-spring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or distant relation.
</em><br>
<p>As usual in these thought experiments you assume you are the original, but
<br>
you must realize that both parties after the duplication would think they
<br>
are the original and you would need EXTREMELY good evidence to convince one
<br>
of them that they were wrong. And even then many just
<br>
wouldn't believe it no matter what.       
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not consider them as having any property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights over any of my physical or informational assets.
</em><br>
<p>You would think that regardless if you were the original or the copy, you
<br>
would both think you have exclusive rights to John McNamara's assets, and
<br>
both would have an equally valid claim; after all you both vividly remember
<br>
buying them and you both remember earning the money to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would be of the opinion that there should be legal societal rules to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle such an awkward situation.
</em><br>
<p>So the scientific method cannot detect any difference between the two but
<br>
nevertheless you think there should be laws that treat the two differently.
<br>
Sounds rather like South Africa under apartheid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a friend had an upload made and they didn't survive, I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider my friend dead, mourn them and probably avoid the upload to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve my own mental health.
</em><br>
<p>Well of course you would. As I said before most people, even most people on
<br>
transhuman lists, believe in the soul. I don't.
