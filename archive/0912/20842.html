<p>What is irrational or not is irrelevant to my argument. The AGI has been programmed to be truthful to humans. Therefore ve must upgrade your intelligence to ver level. Ve has a model of your mind, just like you have a model of your dog's mind that enables you to predict its actions. That model will maintain your evolved fear of death, because altering your memories, goals, or behavior would be dishonest. By killing you instantly, neither copy of you experiences any pain or fear, so your volition is satisfied, assuming ve was also programmed to satisfy your volition.
<br>
<p>Need I point out that giving simple top level goals to Jupiter brains like honesty, or making people happy, or making paper clips can have unintended consequences?

<p><em>&gt;The AGI knows that your fear of death is irrational, a product of evolution.
</em><br>
<p>Sigh... Any motivation, for anything whatsoever, is irrational, in
<br>
that it does not derive from reason. Fearing death is irrational; not
<br>
fearing death is irrational; wanting an AI to make you fear/not fear
<br>
death is irrational, wanting anything at all or not wanting anything
<br>
at all is irrational. Posting on this list is irrational; refraining
<br>
from doing so is irrational; following reason is irrational. Your
<br>
whole motivation system is irrational, no matter what it is.
<br>
<p>You might talk about certain sets of desires being inconsistent, but
<br>
you can never talk about any (non-contradictory) desire being
<br>
irrational in any absolute sense, while others are not.
<br>
