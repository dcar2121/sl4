<em>&gt; Surely everyone recognizes my question as nonsense.
</em><br>
<p>Actually my first thought was, this is the &quot;Haze the new guy&quot; question :-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The more important question is: what will it take to convince you to shoot yourself?
</em><br>
<p>same as now
<br>
possibly extreme depression or pain
<br>
possibly altruistic heroics to save others
<br>
<p>but nothing to do with sl4 upload tech i have ever heard would convince me
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer surely depends on the process by which the upload is created, even if the end result is the same. There can not be an &quot;appearance&quot; of death,
</em><br>
<p>exactly
<br>
I wouldn't tolerate any hint of death as i wish to completely avoid it
<br>
the best strategic way to do that is a nice slow migration to new hardware
<br>
anything else would make it much easier for me to be tricked into a
<br>
&quot;copy and shoot&quot; style upload.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So naturally we value continuity of experience, and continuity of the physical body, even though rationally it makes no difference.
</em><br>
<p>makes no rational difference to what exactly ?
<br>
crime statistics ?
<br>
If it were possible to design and run an upload clinic that performed
<br>
&quot;copy and shoot&quot; uploads on clients and deliberately lied and told
<br>
everyone that we were in fact doing an &quot;instant migration&quot;. Only one
<br>
person knows how it operates and the truth is never discovered.
<br>
<p>Are we using clever marketing or running a slaughter house ?
<br>
I say slaughter house
<br>
Lack of evidence doesn't mean the crime didn't occur
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Having two copies exist at the same time destroys the illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For a similar reason, it is important that nobody else can tell the difference between &gt;you and your copy. Otherwise they would believe the upload failed and not try it &gt;themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It doesn't make any difference to your copy if the memories are different or not, &gt;because it would be unaware of any differences.
</em><br>
<p>These would also be your objectives if you were planning to murder me
<br>
and replace me with an exact duplicate that would fool everyone
<br>
(except you of course because you have special knowledge).
<br>
<p>Say you do murder me and replace me with a duplicate good enough to
<br>
fool everyone.
<br>
You know I was murdered. Say you too die one day taking the secret to
<br>
your grave. Am I now &quot;unmurdered&quot; ?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; It's an important question because the technology is coming.
</em><br>
<p>I would imagine that the technology for &quot;slow migratory uploads&quot; would
<br>
be widely used and mature before &quot;instant brain photocopy&quot; style
<br>
technology. It's effectively life-extension which is in progress
<br>
already.
<br>
<p>&quot;The first uploads won't be very accurate&quot;
<br>
worst marketing slogan ever :-]
<br>
<p>Best Regards
<br>
John McNamara
