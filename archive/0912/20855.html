<p><em>&gt; The example of the Universe you give is interesting but I don't think it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analagous because by definition the Universe is not dependent on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. Every conscioussnes that we can conceive of, is. Even if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretch our definition of consciousness to include these systems without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input, no real system is immune to the effects of the environment... E.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmic rays, quantum effects etc. There are going to be perturbations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But lets even assume that we can somehow prevent that (with shielding for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example). You're saying that it is ok they run at different speeds. But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have two essentially identical intelligent agents, lets call them Forex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trading Black Boxes A and B, similar in every way except that B is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever-so-slightly faster, clearly B has an advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if we assume that these two programs can eternally run the exact same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code-sequence, they still differ in their respective performance. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why again I make the point that I don't think it makes sense to say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity resides purely in the code. The physical implementation makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference. To outside observers, these implementations display different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour. These agents have different personalities. If my brain ran at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double speed, people would notice the difference. I'd be some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhero or at least I would drive my wife nuts twice as often.
</em><br>
<p>There wouldn't be a problem if the programs were an inputless virtual
<br>
environment with conscious inhabitants. You could run it on any
<br>
general purpose computer with enough time and memory and the result
<br>
would be just the same, independent of the actual hardware. If you are
<br>
living in such a virtual reality now there is no way you could know
<br>
anything about the details of the hardware you are running on, or
<br>
notice any change if the hardware is changed.
