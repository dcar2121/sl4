<em>&gt;&gt; Most humans are only content to accept the &quot;existential risk&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; _gradual_ destructive copying because that's all we've experienced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; during our evolutionary history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We have no experience of instant destructive copying as a species and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; its is therefore quite reasonable that one of the common varied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reactions to it is going to be some level of apprehension or fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Assuming our species (assuming we bother staying as a coherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; species) has been exposed to, and widely uses, instant destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; copying for a subjectively long time we will undoubtedly display a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; significantly changed range of reactions to the idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't this a bit like fear of flying?

<p>sort of , yes
<br>
my interest in this thread is to point out that the anticipatory
<br>
thought processes of informed humans considering any form of upload
<br>
will be varied and it is not good science to dismissively lump them
<br>
into 2 categories &quot;the rational&quot; and &quot;the soul biased&quot;.
<br>
<p>some will be eager
<br>
some will be ambivalent
<br>
some will specifically fear losing their soul
<br>
some will subconsciously specifically fear losing their soul
<br>
some will be cautious in principle
<br>
some will see the instant upload as a logical illusion
<br>
etc etc
<br>
<p>I'm guessing you mention 'fear of flying' specifically because of its
<br>
reputation for average people to illogically assign it a much higher
<br>
level of risk than than the data shows. They should logically have a
<br>
greater fear of road travel but few do.
<br>
<p>However, ability to rationally calculate risk accurately is only part
<br>
of the question
<br>
If ones logical objection is to the destruction of the physical brain
<br>
that enters an instant upload booth, then the fact that the
<br>
probability of the booth working as designed is 100% or 99.999999%
<br>
doesn't matter.
<br>
<p>irrationally calculated risk of flying doesn't map to logical
<br>
objections to events that 100% likely to occur.
<br>
