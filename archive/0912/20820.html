<p>this happens, in a way, with continuous cellular replacement of most

of the body.
<br>
I've gotten used too it so I no longer consider it an interruption of continuity
<br>
the fact that it is piecemeal reinforces this
<br>
<p>i got used to sleep long before i could think of it as an interruption
<br>
of continuity
<br>
remembering dreams may help
<br>
<p>if a scientist proved the entire universe was destroyed and recreated
<br>
every Planck time I doubt it would bother me from a continuity pov as
<br>
it's so far removed from my macro view of reality. But perhaps a very
<br>
far future me would be horrified by the universe working like that and
<br>
try to fix it like we would fixed a skipping record ?
<br>
<p>i think the devil is in the details for continuity-breaking scenarios
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you have any desire to change the situation, to eliminate this

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; something in order to obtain continuity.
</em><br>
<p>from some perspectives &quot;duplication-and-destruction&quot; and &quot;continuity
<br>
upload&quot; are not alternatives approaches to the same objective. That
<br>
would make value comparisons pointless.
<br>
rename them to
<br>
&quot;child creation and self-destruction&quot;
<br>
and
<br>
&quot;buying a long series of body upgrades&quot;
<br>
for a total different perspective
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally experience almost no desire to eliminate this physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon, which leads me to believe that my gut reaction against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplication-and-destruction is actually irrational, and explainable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of the status quo bias, and maybe an aversion to violence or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Johnicholas
</em><br>
<p>excellent point
<br>
For me, the danger of a bias is not the bias itself but blindly
<br>
allowing it's influence to trick oneself into making logical
<br>
fallacies.
<br>
<p>we wont all have the same detailed objectives for &quot;uploading myself&quot;
<br>
for some maintaining continuity will be a key detail in that objective
<br>
for others it will be the opposite
<br>
others may have requirements none of us have yet imagined.
<br>
<p>not much point doing an upload if the uploaded you afterward is going
<br>
to be unhappy with the situation. It will have to be tailored to the
<br>
individual personality to some degree.
<br>
