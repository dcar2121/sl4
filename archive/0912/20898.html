2009/12/6 Pavitra &lt;<a href="mailto:celestialcognition@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading%20(was%20:%20goals%20of%20AI)">celestialcognition@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think it helps in these thought experiments to take an &quot;Observer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Moment&quot; (OM) as the fundamental unit of experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting approximation, but why do you assume that experience is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental? Is there a fundamental unit of fire? Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triangle-shaped-ness? Of being-a-liquid-ness? Some concepts break down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when examined closely.
</em><br>
<p>The concept perhaps breaks down if we try to precisely define the
<br>
duration of an OM. Nevertheless, it is useful to think in terms of
<br>
OM's even if we just arbitrarily choose a time interval, such as
<br>
Observer Second or Observer Minute.
<br>
<p>The problem with discussions of duplication thought experiments is
<br>
that the idea of a person as single entity travelling in the forward
<br>
direction through time is tacitly assumed as fundamental. It is not,
<br>
and this is perhaps the most important thing these thought experiments
<br>
show. If we stick to the unequivocal facts we can say something like
<br>
this: physical structure A is generating a sequence of experiences A1,
<br>
A2, A3... and physical structure B is generating a sequence of
<br>
experiences B2, B3, B4... . We then further note that B2, B3, B4...
<br>
include a similar memory of experiencing A1 as that which A2, A3,
<br>
A4... have, and that as a result there are two partly overlapping
<br>
continuous streams of consciousness, A1, A2, A3... and A1, B2, B3...
<br>
who will claim to be the same person. These things we can all agree
<br>
on. Whether we say that there is one person or two, or one person that
<br>
splits into two, or whether the feeling of being a continuous person
<br>
should be called real or illusory in one or other case, is not part of
<br>
the facts of the matter. Rather, it is an attempt to shoehorn the
<br>
facts into a psychological framework which did not evolve in a world
<br>
where copying was possible.
