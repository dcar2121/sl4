<br>
<p><em>&gt; if it happened to me against my will the resulting us would readily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit that neither of us knew which was the original.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't care which was the original although I know it would matter
<br>
to you; there is no disputing matters of taste.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it was later proved to me beyond reasonable doubt that I was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy I would relinquish all legal property claims.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't do that because I would feel that my atoms were every bit as
<br>
good as the atoms in that smug original, but then unlike most I don't
<br>
believe in a soul.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I get the impression that you're implying I personally also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in souls even if I were to say I didn't
</em><br>
<p>A copy of you is made as accurate as Mr. Heisenberg allows and then the
<br>
original is instantaneously destroyed. The scientific method cannot
<br>
detect any difference. In fact there is no objective difference of any
<br>
sort. In fact there are no reports of a subjective difference either.
<br>
Nothing has changed objectively, nothing has changed subjectively;
<br>
nevertheless you are convinced that a gargantuan change has happened.
<br>
You can't explain what this change could possibly be but whatever it is
<br>
it is of enormous importance. And you don't like this mysterious
<br>
alteration one bit, you dislike it so much you would quite literally be
<br>
willing to fight to the death to prevent it.
<br>
<p>Granted you don't like the word &quot;soul&quot;, but given the above are you
<br>
going to try to tell me with a straight face that you don't believe in
<br>
the idea behind the soul? Don't be ridiculous. The only thing worse than
<br>
having an irrational belief is failing to admit even to oneself that it
<br>
is irrational.
