<em>&gt; As usual in these thought experiments you assume you are the original,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you must realize that both parties after the duplication would think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the original and you would need EXTREMELY good evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince one of them that they were wrong. And even then many just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't believe it no matter what.
</em><br>
<p>This assume perfect duplication, where both copy and original behave
<br>
in identical fashion. Agreed that in that situation, there's no way of
<br>
distinguishing them.
<br>
<p>But we should still keep tabs on the original, in case there is an
<br>
unexpected divergence between the two (more than can be explained by
<br>
just different experiences, chaos and quantum fluctuations). If the
<br>
copy diverges from a simple continuation of the pre-copy life
<br>
experience, it means the copying procedure is flawed.
<br>
<p>Just to pick on one small issue, I estimate there in no more than 1%
<br>
chance that quantum effects in the brain are fundamental to identity.
<br>
These quantum effects are impossible to duplicate. So if a seemingly
<br>
perfect copy's behaviour diverges too fast, I would say that I was
<br>
wrong, that these quantum effects were important after all, and that
<br>
the original is the true Stuart and the copy is a mutated Stuart. If
<br>
the mutated Stuart is still somewhat similar to me, he would agree
<br>
with that proposition.
<br>
<p>In other words, the original does have a special status, until we
<br>
become certain that the copying procedure is near-perfect.
