Actually, the best thing about Amit's associative neural networks is that it
<br>
is NOT DEPENDENT UPON QUANTUM COMPUTING in order to generate a quantum-like
<br>
result in terms of dynamics (not of time)!  This mirrors my own academic
<br>
studies in the 1980s and that of many others: cellular automata networks
<br>
(e.g., neural networks) are really good at simulating single and
<br>
multi-particle quantum systems (see also, Wolfram).  No surprise, there.
<br>
Does D-Wave move the &quot;toy computer&quot; simulation (thanks Jack, those words
<br>
have stuck in my head for over 10 years now) into the realm of real quantum
<br>
manipulation?  This is where D-Wave can even fool its builders: A SIMULATED
<br>
QUANTUM COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT MIGHT VERY WELL LOOK LIKE A REAL ONE.
<br>
<p>The D-Wave computing system is hybrid, like a GPU, in that the array must be
<br>
set up, allowed to compute, results read and integrated into a separately
<br>
running classical system.  The overall order-of timing of the system is
<br>
reduced from the theoretical maximum of a total quantum computing system
<br>
(geometric but not quite quadratic) and left somewhere above the current
<br>
state of the art of a classical multiprocessing.  The precise theoretical
<br>
timing for a true quantum/classical hybrid system is difficult to determine
<br>
since the expected variance in the computing times would be quite high.
<br>
This leaves experimenters with a really difficult task of determining if
<br>
D-Wave is actually computing in the quantum realm or merely simulating the
<br>
expected spectrum of results.  Remember, cellular automata networks are
<br>
really good a simulating quantum systems from the perspective of value
<br>
expectation.

<p>The real test is whether D-Wave can break RSA. All forms of public key
<br>
encryption including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Rabin, and their ECC analogues are
<br>
vulnerable to Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer. However it requires 2
<br>
qubits per key bit, and so far they are only claiming 28 qubits. The largest
<br>
number factored by Shor's algorithm so far is 15, in which a 7 qubit
<br>
computer found the factors 3 x 5.
<br>
<p>Practical quantum computing with thousands of qubits would be a setback for
<br>
distributed AI systems that depend on digital signatures for reliable sender
<br>
authentication (like my proposal at <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/agi2.html">http://mattmahoney.net/agi2.html</a> ).

<br>
<p>In the Google case D-Wave is probably an ultra-cold system that enjoys some
<br>
advantage from being ultra-cold and perhaps even takes advantage of Ising
<br>
glass dynamics in a way described originally by Daniel J. Amit (&quot;Modeling
<br>
Brain Function: The World of Attractor Neural Networks&quot;).  That book, I
<br>
remember, was in my opinion one of the first to describe a coherent method
<br>
of taking advantage of quantum effects to obtain a real world computing
<br>
advantage (in this case, in the case of pattern recognition).

<p>I was very skeptical of D-waves claim to have made a working Quantum
<br>
Computer, it's still probably Bullshit but I'm no longer quite as
<br>
certain. It seems that Google has taken an interest in D-Wave through
<br>
their head of image recognition, Hartmut Neven. Neven started a image
<br>
recognition company called Neven Vision and about 3 years ago Google
<br>
bought the company. Either Neven and Google are not as smart as I
<br>
thought they were or D Wave is not a total scam after all.
