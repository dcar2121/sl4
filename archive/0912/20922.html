2009/12/7 Glenn Neff &lt;<a href="mailto:roonie@thisoughttohelp.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20I%20saved%20the%20world.%20I%20can%20prove%20it.">roonie@thisoughttohelp.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hello everyone.  I'm Roonie, I'm new here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I've been reading up on the various websites and such in the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circles, I can't have helped but notice that many of you seem to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the best way to save the world is to bring about the Singularity as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is totally unacceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At &quot;takeoff,&quot; an AI will be a very rational intelligence: it will operate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a world based on rules and discrete logic.  And it will most likey view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our human, intuitive logic with a healthy bit of suspicion.  Our thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes will appear to &quot;jump circuits,&quot; and that will seem a bit unnatural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in order to convince the AI that this is not a completely dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, we will need to be able to show it that we are not in danger of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying ourselves.  We will need to have *already* saved the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or it might just decide that we are incorrigible and untrustable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides, the Singularity is not a certainty . . . and if we don't take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate action, we won't last that long anyways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know this is not really the place to discuss economics, but you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned about making sure that the future goes off without a hitch, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Well, basically, this whole financial crisis that's been going on only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes sense if the forces of Evil did it on purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which means that the world is in very immediate danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It seems that you haven't read about any of the basic texts involving this
<br>
subject, however, you're confused about what people (especially people on
<br>
sl4 and related &quot;memecomplexes&quot; want to do. Their goal is to create a
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI&quot;, which by definition is not dangerous. And they want to create
<br>
it quickly, because the more they wait, the more there's chance that
<br>
something kills everyone (which is also called an existential risk).
<br>
