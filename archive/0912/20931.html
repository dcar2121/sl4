Hey, this is my first post, so apologies if I come across mistaken, ignorant 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>I question your use of good and evil. To me, such things are far too 
<br>
subjective to use in this way. Now, you can either base your definitions of 
<br>
good and evil either on religious belief or personal perception (or both 
<br>
perhaps). Take for example an actor (whose name I forget) who played many, 
<br>
what we might consider to be, &quot;evil&quot; characters. Yet, in an interview, he 
<br>
claims he never has because all his characters believed what they were doing 
<br>
was right. Now, of course to us individually, it may seem that what they did 
<br>
was clearly evil or whatever, but my point is that it isn't correct to make 
<br>
these views appear good or evil and forcing them on to others. Abortion is 
<br>
considered evil by some, and good by others, yet the public can be very 
<br>
split over this. See what I mean?
<br>
<p>So with AI, some might argue that AI that takes control of our lives would 
<br>
be better, and some would argue that AI which allows us to decide our own 
<br>
fate is better. However, we can agree to an extent that Friendly AI would be 
<br>
AI that did not take away our free will, or at least, our illusion of free 
<br>
will. You may attribute other aspects to Friendly AI such as it allowing us 
<br>
to survive and such, but I'm not an expert Singularitarian so I'll leave 
<br>
definitions to them.
<br>
<p>Who are we to say that whoever is in charge is good or evil? There is going 
<br>
to be two people somewhere who believe either things! It's just we can't 
<br>
start labeling these things as good or evil, because who are we to decide 
<br>
for others?
<br>
<p>Thanks, Amer A. Qaiyum.

<em>&gt;&gt; It seems that you haven't read about any of the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; texts involving this subject, however, you're confused
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; about what people (especially people on sl4 and related
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;memecomplexes&quot; want to do. Their goal is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; create a &quot;Friendly AI&quot;, which by definition is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dangerous. And they want to create it quickly, because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more they wait, the more there's chance that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; kills everyone (which is also called an existential risk).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; - Panu H.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you've got everything covered then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought there was a risk that the AI might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *not* be friendly, despite all the smartest peoples' best efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the point that I was trying to make is that we are facing an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risk right now . . . so unless you've got that friendly AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready to go *right* *now*, we need a different plan.  What I am trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish in bringing this to your attention is to make sure that Evil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are not in control of the world when said AI is developed.
