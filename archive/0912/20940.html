<em>&gt; You understand that I can't define something which doesn't exist.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me put it this way. Consider the AI program that observed  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything you did for the last several years until it became so  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good at predicting your behavior that none of your friends or  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatives could distinguish it from you in a Turing test  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. Unfortunately the building containing the only copy of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the program is on fire.  It is just you and the computer in a room  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly filling with smoke. There is just enough time either for you  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get out, allowing the only copy to be destroyed, or for you to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload a copy of the program to a remote site over the internet with  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your last dying breath. Which do you do?
</em><br>
<p>... from a rational point i would
<br>
a) think that copy and me are the same
<br>
b) assume that saving the copy is a better long-term strategy
<br>
<p>... however i would nonetheless feel strange because if dying i would  
<br>
(probably) recognise it as my *own* death, because i will (probably)  
<br>
not perceive what the copy does but what i do. a distructive upload  
<br>
would not have these divergences, or?

<em>&gt; If you got out, then you must believe in this nonexistent thing.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise you would logically conclude that by preserving your  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories in a form that can be backed up, that you become immortal.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, you have the opportunity to enhance your intelligence  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and your environment by running on more powerful computers and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodied in better robots in the future. Why would you ever allow  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one copy to be destroyed now and the only other copy in a few decades?

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The problem arises because all animals, including those that have

<em>&gt;&gt; 1. I believe that I have conscious experience. (I am programmed to).

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm with Daniel Dennet on this: the P-zombie is (to paraphrase an  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; earlier poster)  2+2 = 5. Purely hypothetical, a character in a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gendankenexperiment, The Man Who Wasn't There. In practice, any  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; creature with a human brain that could say &quot;Ouch, that hurt&quot; has an  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; internal process isomorphic to what we experience as consciousness.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Please see my post of a few hours ago on the Edge talk.  <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dehaene09/dehaene09_index.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dehaene09/dehaene09_index.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Consciousness in the human brain is a global pattern of activation  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and we now have methods of scanning and can say whether that  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pattern appears or not. This scanning has been applied to comatose/ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; vegetative patients. From Dr. Dehaene's talk:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Let me just give you a very basic idea about the test. We  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stimulate the patient with five tones. The first four tones are  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; identical, but the fifth can be different. So you hear something  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like dit-dit-dit-dit-tat. When you do this, a very banal  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; observation, dating back 25 years, is that the brain reacts to the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; different tone at the end. That reaction, which is called mismatch  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; negativity, is completely automatic. You get it even in coma, in  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sleep, or when you do not attend to the stimulus. It's a non- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conscious response.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Following it, however, there is also, typically, a later brain  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; response called the P3. This is exactly the large-scale global  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; response that we found in our previous experiments, that must be  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specifically associated with consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (snip)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The P3 response (a marker is absent in coma patients. It is also  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gone in most vegetative state patients — but it remains present in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  most minimally conscious patients. It is always present in locked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; -in patients and in any other conscious subject.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Consciousness, according to Dr. Dehaene's findings, is how the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human brain gets around certain limitations of being an analog  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; computer. If you've read Eliezer Yudkowsky's posts you'll know that  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; his approach to AGI would not necessarily call for the AGI to be  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conscious in the sense we understand. I recall he said &quot;I'm not  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; looking for the AGI to be a new drinking buddy, at least not at  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; first&quot; or words close to that. Paramount, to him, is that the AGI  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be Friendly, and not damage us intentionally or otherwise. While  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the human brain is a kind of analog computer, and much research is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; now afoot to emulate it on digital computers, our minds are not  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exactly computer programs. They are certainly not fungible programs  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; running on a general computing machine, but rather embedded in the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; structure. The mind is not fungible unless the neural structure is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; made fungible, which may or may not ever be possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To sum up, there's no real-world way a zombie could react as if  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conscious, using human brain architecture, without being conscious.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Unless you believe in magic. And the subject of zombies, even if  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such could exist, probably doesn't really apply to the problems of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; building an AGI.
