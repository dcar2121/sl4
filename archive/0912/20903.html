<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;If a copy of you is made by some means then there will be two people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; claim to be you. If one of them is killed then one of them is killed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't understand why this is such a difficult concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;You ask which copy will be you? What will you experience? These are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; well formed questions because &quot;you&quot; is not a well defined concept in a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; where minds can be copied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Change 'you' for 'observer'. A copy of an observer is made by some means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then there are two observers who claim to be the same people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Defining 'same': sharing _all_ measurable qualities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're right in their assertions? Yes, in a sense, but only for a _third_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer. Under their own perceptions, they're not the same person. They not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share all measurable qualities. No matter how hard you argue they do, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how you naively troll me telling you don't believe in the soul: One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't need to believe in the soul to verify that if they are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _observers_ then they're also part of the experience, and they also can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure their own qualities. By the time the copy isÂ created/instantiated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both the copy and the original (doesn't matter if they know or not who's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who) will be able to measure their positions regarding the other (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurable quality) and also they'll be able to tell themselves apart, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by poking themselves and verifying the other don't feel nothing. Both of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them will retain their own 'sense of self'. If you don't believe or don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what is a sense of self, imagine it as the reflexive mental process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that informs each observer he is a separate being. It is what makes people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer themselves as 'me'.
</em><br>
<p>So which one is really &quot;you&quot;? We can know and agree on all the
<br>
empirical facts and still disagree on this. And this is because, as
<br>
Matt points out, &quot;you&quot; is not a well-defined concept if minds can be
<br>
copied.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the reflexive processes were copied to the other individual too!!! so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they must be the same right? wrong. And that's what constitutes the so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called 'hard problem': both copies are neuron by neuron identical, so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be the same, but they aren't (!) since them, as observers, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish themselves as being different from each other, measuring their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of me'ness and verifying this property (perceived as being 'me')
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't the same for them.
</em><br>
<p>The two copies can be the same, but not one and the same, since for a
<br>
start they occupy different spaces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In these mental experiments, Extropians and transhumans in general like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore the fact people are observers. Lots of people around, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes the most famous _troll_ of this list, like to believe themselves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be computer programs running in the brain. This is a quite extraordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion, without any reasonable foundation. It is a blind dogma, not worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those held by many religions, Abrahamic or not. Just ignorance and hubris
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disguised as intelligence and reason.
</em><br>
<p>The claim is not that the mind is a computer program running in the
<br>
brain but that the brain can be emulated by a computer program
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You guys need a reality check sometimes: check out the essay on H+, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman magazine:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/ai/ghost-shell-why-our-brains-will-never-live-matrix">http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/ai/ghost-shell-why-our-brains-will-never-live-matrix</a>
</em><br>
<p>That article is full of non-sequiturs and straight out factual errors.
<br>
For example, it is claimed that neurons in the brain are not replaced
<br>
through life. They are replaced, but gradually over time, unlike
<br>
dividing cells. A neuron is like a car where you are gradually
<br>
replacing parts as they wear out, so that eventually none of the car
<br>
is original. A cell in the gut epithelium is like a car that is
<br>
scrapped when it develops faults and replaced with a new car from the
<br>
factory. In both cases you end up with a car that looks like the
<br>
original but isn't, and the same happens to the human body over time.
