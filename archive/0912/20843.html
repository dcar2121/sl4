<p>I don't think I would bother raising the dog's intelligence to have a
<br>
rational conversation.  I think it more likely that It would go to the vet
<br>
and piss on the floor.  I would as likely see that as part of the expected
<br>
behavior and forgive that animal tendency and throw a stick to fetch.  I
<br>
believe the analogy holds.  SuperIntelligence probably endures your natural
<br>
human tendency to complain about whatever comparatively minor thing, then
<br>
you'll lose interest when some primitive drive overrides memory of recent
<br>
events.  (ex: hungry, horny or tired)  A SuperIntelligence seeded from Matt
<br>
would probably keep a counter of the number of unaugmented humans it has
<br>
convinced that they should kill themselves.  :)
