IMO, lying is about intentionality much more than it is about
<br>
truth/falsehoods (i.e. than relating to an objective reality - an elusive &amp;
<br>
shaky idea if ever there was one anyway).
<br>
<p>For example, A, believing his work is not completed, would in my view still
<br>
be lying to his boss by saying &quot;it is done&quot;, even if (unknown to A) the work
<br>
had already been completed for A by someone else.
<br>
<p>Also, note that someone who is known to always tell falsehoods is
<br>
effectively telling the truth and deceiving no-one, because people just
<br>
always believe the opposite of what they are told.

Subject: [sl4] A Thought Experiment: Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness
<br>
<p><p>Here's what I thought was a simple question, but while I tried to articulate
<br>
it, it grew tentacles.
<br>
<p><p>Assume you are on track to complete and activate the first AGI of human
<br>
intelligence. Proposition: Someone on the team has suggested two related
<br>
ideas to consider.
<br>
<p>A.) A mechanism should be inbuilt, preferably hardwired, which forces the
<br>
AGI to tell the truth to all human queries, and volunteer information ve
<br>
deems relevant rather than deceive by silence. It is proposed that the AGI
<br>
should be constitutionally incapable of misleading humans even if ver
<br>
intelligence far exceeds our own. Since ve may also think far more quickly
<br>
than ve can communicate with our slow brains, the same mechanism would
<br>
prevent the AGI from acting on any idea ve had just thought of which might
<br>
reasonably harm or discomfit us, just because nobody had time to dissuade
<br>
ver, until ve had made us aware of this volition. The truth-telling
<br>
mechanism must be tamperproof as far as that can be achieved. Call this
<br>
Eternal Truth Mode.
<br>
<p>B.) The same, but not in operation at all times. Instead the mechanism would
<br>
be switched on and off as humans saw fit: call it toggling Diagnostic Truth
<br>
Mode.
<br>
<p>Questions:
<br>
Can either mechanism actually work for any significant length of time? How
<br>
should the mechanism work? Which method might be more or less effective,
<br>
more or less ethical: pain or pleasure stimulation; jamming neural signals
<br>
or their equivalent; power cut/brownout (what happens when you faint);
<br>
involuntary lie-revealing behaviors (&quot;tells&quot;); other? How shall falsehoods
<br>
be detected in the AGI's neural circuitry or equivalent; high-level
<br>
(thoughts) or low-level (cell-level computation/machine language)? Is
<br>
Diagnostic Truth Mode more secure or less? How would human engineering to
<br>
get a human to toggle Diagnostic Truth off be prevented? Who should and
<br>
should not be trusted with such control? Should only one human have this
<br>
power for this AGI? Is giving any human the power over the AGI to toggle
<br>
Diagnostic Truth modes on and off more or less ethical than Eternal Truth
<br>
mode?
<br>
<p>If either mode can somehow be made to work reliably as described, is it a
<br>
good idea or a bad one? Is it ethical or not? Is it unethical but necessary?
<br>
What do you think, and why?
<br>
<p>Tom Buckner
<br>
<p>P.S. For new readers: ve, ver, and vers are genderless pronouns often used
<br>
for AGI's in sl4 discussion; I can't remember right now who coined them. I
<br>
actually prefer hes, hir, and hirs, which I think were coined perhaps thirty
<br>
years ago by Robert Anton Wilson. They fit better with existing English
<br>
pronouns. However, ve is preferred by others at sl4.
