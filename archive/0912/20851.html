<em>&gt;Divergence would not occur if there is no outside input, i.e. if there is a
</em><br>
self-contained virtual environment. The Universe could be an example of
<br>
this. It wouldn't matter if the two computers were not running in parallel
<br>
as long as they ran the same program. I would not mind if my program is
<br>
terminated today if I could be sure that it would run again at some future
<br>
time, since I would experience no gap in consciousness; nor would I be aware
<br>
from inside the program of any change in processor speed.
<br>
<p>The example of the Universe you give is interesting but I don't think it is
<br>
analagous because by definition the Universe is not dependent on its
<br>
environment. Every conscioussnes that we can conceive of, is. Even if we
<br>
stretch our definition of consciousness to include these systems without
<br>
input, no real system is immune to the effects of the environment... E.g.
<br>
cosmic rays, quantum effects etc. There are going to be perturbations.
<br>
<p>But lets even assume that we can somehow prevent that (with shielding for
<br>
example). You're saying that it is ok they run at different speeds. But if
<br>
we have two essentially identical intelligent agents, lets call them Forex
<br>
Trading Black Boxes A and B, similar in every way except that B is
<br>
ever-so-slightly faster, clearly B has an advantage.
<br>
<p>Even if we assume that these two programs can eternally run the exact same
<br>
code-sequence, they still differ in their respective performance. This is
<br>
why again I make the point that I don't think it makes sense to say the
<br>
identity resides purely in the code. The physical implementation makes a
<br>
difference. To outside observers, these implementations display different
<br>
behaviour. These agents have different personalities. If my brain ran at
<br>
double speed, people would notice the difference. I'd be some kind of
<br>
superhero or at least I would drive my wife nuts twice as often.

<em>&gt;&gt;A computer program running on two machines in parallel could produce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; streams of consciousness in lockstep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice idea in theory but in practice this set-up is out of lockstep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost immediately since no two processors run at exactly the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed. That's not to mention that as soon as you introduce input 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (necessary for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness) then the systems differ substantially in their exposure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external entropy. Divergence may not be huge to begin with but any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divergence is sufficient to show that they are not the same consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Divergence would not occur if there is no outside input, i.e. if there is a
<br>
self-contained virtual environment. The Universe could be an example of
<br>
this. It wouldn't matter if the two computers were not running in parallel
