<p>that's true.  I generally believe that attempts at such lower-level
<br>
intelligences shackling higher-level intelligences is wrong.  If for no
<br>
other particular reason but that it will end badly for the lower-level
<br>
intelligence.  simple example:  I put my keys in a safe place (good idea)  I
<br>
have forgotten where the safe place was :: I screwed myself. (bad result
<br>
from good idea due to simple human Fail )
<br>
<p>on point #1 - even If I knew how, it would fundamentally change the dog and
<br>
my relationship to the dog.  I'm cautious about that in principle because
<br>
it's a steep slippery slope to all the nightmarish consequences threads
<br>
ending in Autobliss wireheads being turned off by a more capable power after
<br>
having compressing their behavior pattern to 1 iteration of addictive loop.
<br>
Or even without the more capable power (sysadmin, etc.)  there might be a
<br>
buffer overflow when autobliss increments past the storage of unsigned
<br>
integer (or the number of clock faces in a line is exceeded by 1)  something
<br>
on the order of 'complete protonic reversal' or equally Bad Day.
