<em>&gt;Three experiences S1, S2, S3 are subjectively connected if S2 remembers S1
</em><br>
and S3 remembers S2, even though S3 may not remember S1. In this way a
<br>
person can be defined as a series of subjectively connected experiences.
<br>
However, I don't think it is possible to make this definition *exact* if we
<br>
consider events that cause subjective discontinuities, such as copying with
<br>
partial memory loss or memory implantation.
<br>
<p>Is it reasonable to make the analogy between an experience and a dataset? If
<br>
so, I just wonder what minimal amount of data needs to be carried over from
<br>
S1 to S2 in order for S2 to &quot;remember&quot; S1. Is one bit the minimal amount of
<br>
data possible? But to me that would seem to be ridiculous, so I guess it
<br>
would have to be somewhere higher. But where? I can see that if two separate
<br>
computer systems held the same image it is reasonable to say they have some
<br>
kind of subjective connection, but one bit? Its hard to make the case for
<br>
that. 
<br>
<p>Maybe we could define an &quot;n-bit consciousness&quot; as one who's dataset never
<br>
copies less than n bits during each transition from one experience to the
<br>
next. And maybe that could be used to define the points at which human life
<br>
begins and ends (cf. abortion debate). Ie. as soon as a baby copies an
<br>
experience of at least n bits from one experience to the next, then it
<br>
technically becomes a sentient person, and as soon as a person fails to copy
<br>
n bits, then they technically cease to be a sentient person. Perhaps we
<br>
might someday be able to measure that fairly accurately and it becomes
<br>
useful for legal reasons etc.
<br>
<p>I wonder what a reasonable range would be for n, to define such a partial
<br>
requirement for human personhood. It seems like a potentially useful idea to
<br>
me although it's still nothing like a complete definition of human identity
<br>
as far as I can tell because clearly one could apply this definition to
<br>
purely machine systems today.

<em>&gt;&gt;There is no exact definition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there needs to be, otherwise how do we know what we're talking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about when we refer to experiences as being &quot;subjectively connected&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Three experiences S1, S2, S3 are subjectively connected if S2 remembers S1

and S3 remembers S2, even though S3 may not remember S1. In this way a
