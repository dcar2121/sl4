You are confusing a subjective difference with &quot;reports of a subjective difference&quot;. The second is in fact an objective phenomenon, and I'll agree with you that there is no objective difference (assuming the duplication technique is perfect). 
<br>
 
<br>
What experiences do you expect in the following situations?
<br>
 
<br>
1) You are shot and killed instantly
<br>
2) All relevant details of your brain are scanned and a perfect copy is then constructed, let's say on a different continent, Antartica. I am using &quot;copy&quot; in the sense that both of you are now equally &quot;copies&quot;. The copy on your current continent is then shot and killed instantly. 
<br>
3) No upload or duplication takes place and you travel to Antartica. 
<br>
 
<br>
Admittedly there are some people who don't care about future experience, only that which is describable as objective reality. And getting it out of the way: Some people believe in a soul. You don't.

Nothing has changed objectively, nothing has changed subjectively;

nevertheless you are convinced that a gargantuan change has happened.
<br>
You can't explain what this change could possibly be but whatever it is

it is of enormous importance. And you don't like this mysterious
<br>
alteration one bit, you dislike it so much you would quite literally be
<br>
willing to fight to the death to prevent it.
