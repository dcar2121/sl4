On Wed, 2 Dec 2009 &quot;John McNamara&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:harlequin@novastar.org?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Uploading">harlequin@novastar.org</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Were a type 1 upload made of me involuntarily (I would not permit it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I survived, I would consider them to be a sort of weird off-spring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or distant relation.
</em><br>
<p>As usual in these thought experiments you assume you are the original,
<br>
but you must realize that both parties after the duplication would think
<br>
they are the original and you would need EXTREMELY good evidence to
<br>
convince one of them that they were wrong. And even then many just
<br>
wouldn't believe it no matter what.       
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not consider them as having any property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights over any of my physical or informational assets.
</em><br>
<p>You would think that regardless if you were the original or the copy,
<br>
you would both think you have exclusive rights to John McNamara's
<br>
assets, and both would have an equally valid claim; after all you both
<br>
vividly remember buying them and you both remember earning the money to
<br>
do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would be of the opinion that there should be legal societal rules to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle such an awkward situation. 
</em><br>
<p>So the scientific method cannot detect any difference between the two
<br>
but nevertheless you think there should be laws that treat the two
<br>
differently. Sounds rather like South Africa under apartheid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a friend had an upload made and they didn't survive, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider my friend dead, mourn them and probably avoid the upload to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve my own mental health.
</em><br>
<p>Well of course you would. As I said before most people, even most people
<br>
on transhuman lists, believe in the soul. I don't.
