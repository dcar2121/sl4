<p><em>&gt; &gt; But why would instant replacement of the brain be a problem if gradual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replacement isn't?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is to say: I put a high probability on the idea that my brain is not gradually replaced, at the relevant level of organization.
</em><br>
<p>But your brain is gradually replaced by the cellular repair
<br>
mechanisms. Over the course of a year almost all the matter in it is
<br>
replaced. What difference would it make if the replacement happened
<br>
all at once on a periodic basis, for example?
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I admit that it it is possible for subjective experience to be an illusion, and that perhaps we are never justified in expecting to experience the future. I have no strong evidence against this proposition. However, I also have no strong evidence for this proposition. Considering that a life of subjective experience could be at stake, I have a very large preference for a cautious approach in my own uploading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My present physical body won't be around in a year's time, but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be another body made up of different matter in approximately the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same configuration, which will consider itself to be me. These are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; facts of the matter. Whether we say that I survive this process or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there is only the illusion of survival is a matter of semantics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and makes no difference to how I feel about myself or my future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prospects.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I Â agree that those are the objective facts of the matter. That this is a merely semantic difference to you displays that either you do not believe in a subjective experience, or that you have no concern for it. With regards to your own life I have no problem with the second (no snide remark just a support for self-determination), but for any who might care about the subjective, it seems dangerous and lacking in sufficient evidence to assume that it does not exist.
</em><br>
<p>I believe in subjective experience and I think it's the most important
<br>
thing in the world. But I don't think there is any logical difference
<br>
between actually being the same person from day to day or - all else
<br>
being equal - only having the illusion of being the same person from
<br>
day to day.
