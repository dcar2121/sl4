<p>
I would like to begin by saying that I don't believe my own statements are
<br>
True, and I suggest you don't either. I do request that you try thinking
<br>
WITH them before attacking them. It's really hard to think with an idea
<br>
AFTER you've attacked it. I've been told my writing sounds preachy or even
<br>
fanatical. I don't say &quot;In My Opinion&quot; enough. Please imagine &quot;IMO&quot; in front
<br>
of every one of my statements. Thanks!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>When I first started talking to my friends about Existential Risks and The
<br>
Singularity, I got some really amazing responses. Although the details were
<br>
just plain noise, there was a pattern: smart people, readers of science
<br>
fiction, who had never studied AI research, IMMEDIATELY KNEW why this was a
<br>
Bad Idea and why it would never work. Sometimes they brought up the old
<br>
Hollywood cliche : it's just a more dangerous villain. It has never occurred
<br>
to most people that an intelligence could be different from us. (With the
<br>
possible exception of &quot;emotionless&quot;. A cold, calculating, hateful
<br>
super-villain, that's what they expect and fear.) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>However, I have found common folks surprisingly receptive to some of our key
<br>
ideas, as long as I present them as &quot;it could be that ...&quot; rather than
<br>
asserting them as True. With few exceptions, they quickly acclimate to most
<br>
of:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>1. Humanity is in danger, maybe even to the point of extinction.
<br>
<p>1.A. The time scale is short: decades at the long end, at the short end:
<br>
&quot;the missiles could be in the air right now&quot;.
<br>
<p>2. The root of the danger is us.
<br>
<p>2.A. The traits that make us dangerous can't be removed
<br>
<p>2.B. Any solution that depends on half the people changing their minds,
<br>
opinions, or habits is just too slow.
<br>
<p>3. We think and hope we may be able to make a thinking machine (AGI) in
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>3.A. The good news is that we might create an intelligence explosion.
<br>
<p>3.B. The terrific news is that an AGI doesn't have to have the traits that
<br>
make us dangerous.
<br>
<p>3.B.i. If it is possible to make an AGI at all, the easy part will be making
<br>
it a much nicer person than us.
<br>
<p>3.B.ii. It would be a great coach or advisor, and 
<br>
<p>3.B.iii. might be able to persuade us to actually change our opinions AND
<br>
take action. 
<br>
<p>3.C. Even so, this is dangerous; there is a lot of work remaining to do it
<br>
and to get it right.
<br>
<p>3.C.i. Humanity has been bad, and should fear the coming of an unbiased
<br>
Power.T
<br>
<p>4. But really, we MUST do it 
<br>
<p>4.A. We are already in too much danger
<br>
<p>4.B. It's only a matter of time before somebody does it wrong
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>As evidence for their absorption of these ideas, I notice that they quickly
<br>
start to tell me evidence that they see, examples, even further concerns. If
<br>
I start by asking them to think with the uncertain ideas, if I ask them to
<br>
estimate how likely these things are, over half of them get to Shock Level 4
<br>
within 20 minutes. I'm not saying that they agree, but they are conversant.
<br>
I send them away with a &quot;homework card&quot; containing links they can use to
<br>
start their own investigation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>All right, I admit, that's not quite Shock Level 4
<br>
(<a href="http://sl4.org/shocklevels.html">http://sl4.org/shocklevels.html</a>), even though it does include Intelligence
<br>
Explosion
<br>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosi</a>
<br>
on). Would you believe Shock Level 3.5?
<br>
(www.wouldyoubelieve.com/phrases.html).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>These days, I don't mention, &quot;Meet the new ruler of the planet,&quot; or &quot;This is
<br>
the Voice of World Control&quot; (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/quotes</a>).
