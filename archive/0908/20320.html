The most common stance I am faced with is that of a disdain towards
<br>
technology in general. Far too often it seems that as soon as I bring up the
<br>
singularity people stop listening, claiming that technology is essentially
<br>
the root of all our problems and that more sophisticated technology can only
<br>
bring about more sophisticated problems.  Then they drive home, check their
<br>
e-mail, etc.  People seem to forget that a tool is a tool.  It can be used
<br>
in positive as well as negative ways.  I suppose it's a lot easier to blame
<br>
a tool than to take responsibility for misusing it.

<em>&gt;&gt;  I would like to begin by saying that I don't believe my own statements

<em>&gt;&gt; are True, and I suggest you don't either. I do request that you try thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; WITH them before attacking them. It's really hard to think *with* an idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; AFTER you've attacked it. I've been told my writing sounds preachy or even

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; When I first started talking to my friends about Existential Risks and The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Singularity, I got some really amazing responses. Although the details were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just plain noise, there was a pattern: smart people, readers of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fiction, who had never studied AI research, IMMEDIATELY KNEW why this was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Bad Idea and why it would never work. Sometimes they brought up the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hollywood cliche : it's just a more dangerous villain. It has never occurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to most people that an intelligence could be different from us. (With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible exception of &quot;emotionless&quot;. A cold, calculating, hateful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; super-villain, that's what they expect and fear.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; However, I have found common folks surprisingly receptive to some of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; key ideas, as long as I present them as &quot;it could be that ...&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; asserting them as True. With few exceptions, they quickly acclimate to most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1. Humanity is in danger, maybe even to the point of extinction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1.A. The time scale is short: decades at the long end, at the short end:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;the missiles could be in the air right now&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2. The root of the danger is us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2.A. The traits that make us dangerous can't be removed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2.B. Any solution that depends on half the people changing their minds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; opinions, or habits is just too slow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3. We think and hope we may be able to make a thinking machine (AGI) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.A. The good news is that we might create an intelligence explosion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.B. The terrific news is that an AGI doesn't have to have the traits that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; make us dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.B.i. If it is possible to make an AGI at all, the easy part will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; making it a much nicer person than us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.B.ii. It would be a great coach or advisor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.B.iii. might be able to persuade us to actually change our opinions AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; take action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.C. Even so, this is dangerous; there is a lot of work remaining to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and to get it right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.C.i. *Humanity has been bad, and should fear the coming of an unbiased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Power.*™
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 4. But really, we MUST do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 4.A. We are already in too much danger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 4.B. It's only a matter of time before somebody does it wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As evidence for their absorption of these ideas, I notice that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; quickly start to *tell me *evidence that they see, examples, even further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; concerns. If I start by asking them to think *with* the uncertain ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if I ask them to estimate how likely these things are, over half of them get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to Shock Level 4 within 20 minutes. I'm not saying that they *agree*, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are conversant. I send them away with a &quot;homework card&quot; containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; links they can use to start their own investigation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; All right, I admit, that's not quite Shock Level 4 (
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://sl4.org/shocklevels.html">http://sl4.org/shocklevels.html</a>), even though it does include

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Would you believe Shock Level 3.5? (www.wouldyoubelieve.com/phrases.html
