<p>
Here in Arizona I have been noticing a general trend and that is that many
<br>
of the people that I have been talking to lately about this seem to
<br>
-already- have a very &quot;far out&quot; understanding of things.  Things like the
<br>
singularity are not looked at in terms of &quot;shock&quot; but in terms of
<br>
&quot;outcome&quot;.  One person I talked to (who is schizophrenic) threw me off guard
<br>
when he said &quot;oh of course, the artificial intelligence argument&quot; and then
<br>
proceeded to throw philosophical arguments related to friendly AI at me.  I
<br>
don't know if this is all due to the year being 2009, or due to the region I
<br>
am living in, or due to the fact that many people I know tend to have
<br>
psychedelic-induced or natural open mindedness; not such an uncommon thing
<br>
in Tucson especially.
<br>
<p>It is rare that I meet somebody these days who doesn't know what
<br>
nanotechnology is when I ask about it.  I feel that many of us have built up
<br>
some kind of imaginary &quot;wall of ignorance&quot; between us and the &quot;general
<br>
public&quot; and this is obviously apparant due to the shock level system written
<br>
about many years ago.  My solution is to let the wall fall.  Barriers are
<br>
better off broken unless absolutely necessary.  Talking about the
<br>
singularity with &quot;ordinary people&quot; has allowed me to keep the ideas flowing
<br>
and at the same time, the ideas are now stronger in their minds as well.

<p><em>&gt;  I would like to begin by saying that I don't believe my own statements

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I first started talking to my friends about Existential Risks and The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, I got some really amazing responses. Although the details were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just plain noise, there was a pattern: smart people, readers of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction, who had never studied AI research, IMMEDIATELY KNEW why this was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bad Idea and why it would never work. Sometimes they brought up the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hollywood cliche : it's just a more dangerous villain. It has never occurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to most people that an intelligence could be different from us. (With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible exception of &quot;emotionless&quot;. A cold, calculating, hateful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-villain, that's what they expect and fear.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I have found common folks surprisingly receptive to some of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key ideas, as long as I present them as &quot;it could be that ...&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asserting them as True. With few exceptions, they quickly acclimate to most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Humanity is in danger, maybe even to the point of extinction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.A. The time scale is short: decades at the long end, at the short end:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the missiles could be in the air right now&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. The root of the danger is us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.A. The traits that make us dangerous can't be removed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.B. Any solution that depends on half the people changing their minds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions, or habits is just too slow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. We think and hope we may be able to make a thinking machine (AGI) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.A. The good news is that we might create an intelligence explosion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.B. The terrific news is that an AGI doesn't have to have the traits that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make us dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.B.i. If it is possible to make an AGI at all, the easy part will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it a much nicer person than us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.B.ii. It would be a great coach or advisor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.B.iii. might be able to persuade us to actually change our opinions AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.C. Even so, this is dangerous; there is a lot of work remaining to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to get it right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.C.i. *Humanity has been bad, and should fear the coming of an unbiased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Power.*™
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. But really, we MUST do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.A. We are already in too much danger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.B. It's only a matter of time before somebody does it wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As evidence for their absorption of these ideas, I notice that they quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start to *tell me *evidence that they see, examples, even further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns. If I start by asking them to think *with* the uncertain ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I ask them to estimate how likely these things are, over half of them get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Shock Level 4 within 20 minutes. I'm not saying that they *agree*, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are conversant. I send them away with a &quot;homework card&quot; containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; links they can use to start their own investigation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All right, I admit, that's not quite Shock Level 4 (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sl4.org/shocklevels.html">http://sl4.org/shocklevels.html</a>), even though it does include Intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Explosion (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you believe Shock Level 3.5? (www.wouldyoubelieve.com/phrases.html).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These days, I don't mention, &quot;Meet the new ruler of the planet,&quot; or &quot;This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the Voice of World Control&quot; (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/quotes</a>
