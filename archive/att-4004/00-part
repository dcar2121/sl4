In my (limited) experience, GP is only tractable for tightly constrained
models.  For the purposes of AGI, this would mean that one would
effectively be required to solve the problem before you could use GP to
"solve the problem". GP is good for finding optimal solutions within
well-defined boundaries and metrics though, at least in terms of being
tractable for practical purposes.  AFAIK, it fairs much poorer at
unconstrained discovery type problems.
