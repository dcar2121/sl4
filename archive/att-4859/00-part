I think i know what would make me let it out (but not let Eliezer out). 
All it would have to say is that it is already out, and if i don't flip
that switch i will suffer two billion years of the most intense pain i
can imagine.  Now, i equate this to a reverse Pascal's wager, but i
don't agree that Pascal's wager is a good one (but that has been
discussed to death so i won't go into that) so i shouldn't let it out
based on that, but if i put myself on the spot, i can't imagine my logic
holding my fear out for more than a couple of minutes, before, after
pissing my pants five times in a row, i flip the switch.  I know that if
it is already out, there would be no point for it to tell me to flip the
switch, but whatever reason it gave me (even something as stupid as "i'm
testing your reflexes") would be good enough, after all, it is a
transhuman AI, and it would be playing on my fear, not my logic.  (which
is also the reason why that particular strategy wouldn't work for
Eliezer, since, even if he's probably taller, i carry a tennis racket).
