I am not a wetware - I am a software running on that wetware. On every appropriate wetware, it looks, is the same "me software".

Not all my instances are well, you know - so another very good reason for the Singularity. All those megayears of suffering should end ASAP.

The bottom line is not so bad. This mountain of pain is small, compared to the post Singularity pleasures. "I" will not miss a bit. I can't. "Nobody" can. And this is good. :-)
