</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would recommend an open source language, since you definitely want

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted, if solving this problem requires learning or inventing some 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
This is largely a matter of taste, however:
<br>
<p>Most computer languages are as complete as Number Theory for numbers up 
<br>
to a certain finite size.  Currently 2^63-1 is the most common limit.
<br>
<p>OTOH, different languages make it easier to think of different 
<br>
implementations.  This is arguably significant.  But for design.  
<br>
Implementation in some languages is easier than in others, but these 
<br>
languages tend to lose that advantage because the implemented code is 
<br>
slower.  For this combination of reasons my preferred language is D, 
<br>
which has most of the design advantages without having the cost at 
<br>
execution time.  (OTOH, D is dependent upon C libraries...well, it's a 
<br>
new language, and that's only a significant drawback when the libraries 
<br>
expect to make callbacks.)
<br>
<p>D does have two open source implementations, though one is lagging, and 
<br>
seems unmaintained and the other isn't yet complete.  Still, their 
<br>
existence proves that it could be maintained independent of the 
<br>
originator (Walter Bright).
<br>
<p>A better language for basic design is probably Python, but it's fatally 
<br>
slow at executing large programs.  I'm not considering Java, as I 
<br>
consider that it's both slower than a good compiled language and 
<br>
clumsier to use than Python or Ruby.  (Actually I consider Java clumsier 
<br>
than D.  If D didn't exist I'd probably be recommending Ada, despite 
<br>
it's lack of built-in garbage collection, and the awkwardness of string 
<br>
literals of different lengths being of different types.  [Ada is of an 
<br>
older paradigm, and their UnboundedString representation is, possibly 
<br>
intentionally, made more difficult to use than strings of defined length.])
<br>
<p>Well, Ada 2006 has supposedly cleared up many of the warts...but they 
<br>
still haven't implemented garbage collection as a standard feature of 
<br>
the language (i.e., easy to use and dependably present), and D *does* 
<br>
exist, so I haven't looked at it again.  Ditto for Fortran 2007(?).  And 
<br>
C++ 2008(or whatever they're calling it).  A good compiled Java might be 
<br>
worth looking into, but I really find the Java IO libraries a nuisance.  
<br>
Still, Java has LOTS of libraries, and that might be a sufficient 
<br>
benefit...but it would require the speed that can only be obtained with 
<br>
compiled code.  (There are parts of an AI that would benefit more from 
<br>
the flexibility of interpreted code than from the speed of compiled 
<br>
code, but not as the base layer, and for those Python has a clear 
<br>
lead...and a well defined linkage convention that lets it use the C 
<br>
calling convention.  Or just write the interface layer in Pyrex...which 
<br>
is an extended subset of Python that compiles to C.  [But don't use it 
<br>
for large chunks.  That's not what it was designed for.])
