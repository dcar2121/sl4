You are assuming that an AGI will be modeled on human motivations, etc.  
<br>
I find this highly suspect.  My expectation is that it will model human 
<br>
motivations only sufficiently to understand us, and to explain itself to 
<br>
us in terms that we can accept.  As for resources... the surface of a 
<br>
planet is not an optimal location for machines.  Not unless they are 
<br>
designed to use liquid water as an essential component.  Asteroids have 
<br>
a lot to reccommend themselves, including constant access to sunlight 
<br>
for power.  Other moons without atmospheres also have potential.  
<br>
Mercury has lots of power available, just not continually unless you 
<br>
transfer it down from orbit.  Etc.  Luna isn't a very good choice, as it 
<br>
doesn't have any real advantages except a lack of air, and the rocks are 
<br>
rather low in mass, which indicates that metals will be hard to come 
<br>
by.  (People have come up with all sorts of schemes to extract them, but 
<br>
mainly because Luna is close to Earth.)
<br>
<p>My expectation is that an AGI will stick around Earth only if it really 
<br>
likes being around people.  (Of course, it might leave, and then return 
<br>
after it had mined out the rest of the more easily accessible solar system.)
<br>
<p>One could, of course, design an AGI to want to kill people, but I think 
<br>
only a person would come up with that as a goal.
