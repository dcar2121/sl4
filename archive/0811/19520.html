<p><p>It really depends on what, specifically, you want to make the language  
<br>
do. Using LISP or Java or whatever is making a lot of assumptions  
<br>
about what the problem will actually look like in implementation.   
<br>
LISP has always been considered a classical AI language, but the  
<br>
language is relatively poor for solving certain types of computational  
<br>
problems and so by selecting LISP on the basis that it is ideal in  
<br>
some fashion, one is make an assertion about the underlying nature of  
<br>
AGI implementation itself.  Those assumptions seem to never be backed  
<br>
up by strong evidence.  One could make an argument that the lack of a  
<br>
very well-defined computational model for a complete AGI prescribes a  
<br>
more generalist language like C++ that is capable of doing everything  
<br>
quite well (while making nothing particularly easy).
<br>
<p><p>Most AGI people seem to pick languages they like, and then rationalize  
<br>
the choice with respect to its AGI optimality. In my opinion, it is  
<br>
sufficient justification that one selects a programming language for  
<br>
purely pragmatic and aesthetic reasons without any regard for its  
<br>
nominal AGI optimality.
<br>
<p>Most AI programming language arguments are little more than jousting  
<br>
matches between incompatible self-deceptions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Developing the right language is just another subproblem of the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole AI business. When the theory is done you have a far better  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding what your language should be able to do.
</em><br>
<p><p>There are many possible language and computational models, only a tiny  
<br>
number of which ever show up as first-class models in a major  
<br>
programming language.  Therefore it is likely that AGI will not  
<br>
directly map to any extant popular programming language, and the  
<br>
syntactic sugar of an AGI optimal language will only be developed  
<br>
after the fact -- when it will be largely irrelevant.
