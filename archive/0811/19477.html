<p>
I´ve been reading through the archives and hope you are interested in
<br>
reanimating an old subject here.
<br>
&nbsp;I believe that its vitally important for an AI to have some engineered
<br>
personality traits to be functional.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Biological life as an example:
<br>
<p>Some of the first macromolecules didnt replicate, some did. Some did
<br>
catalyze reactions and some didnt. The ones that expanded their territory
<br>
were the ones that could replicate and did so. This principle has been
<br>
ongoing since then.
<br>
Although we as organisms are a lot more complex I'd say this is exactly the
<br>
same as &quot;will to live&quot; and fertility. These traits have been inherited all
<br>
through evolution and I cant see any of them necessarily correlate to
<br>
intelligence level.
<br>
In other words, an AI, no matter how intelligent, might still be
<br>
self-destructive, passive or unwilling to improve itself.
<br>
<p>The same argument holds true for a lot of other traits imho.
<br>
<p>Altruism for example: The program
<br>
Tit-for-tat&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat</a>&gt;showed that
<br>
altruism might be an evolutionary beneficial trait. As we grow
<br>
more intelligent we show these traits in more complex ways, but that doesnt
<br>
mean the initial driving force behind them are any different.
<br>
<p>An intelligent person that like to think of himself as good, might argue
<br>
that he is good because he is intelligent. I believe he is strongly biased,
<br>
just as I belive that I - that regard myself as somewhat nihilistic - is
<br>
biased towards thinking intelligence doesnt change anything by itself.
<br>
<p>Altruism is just an example here, insert any personality trait that you want
<br>
an AI to have and I think the argument still holds.
<br>
<p>My conclusion: We cant know what, if any, traits an Ai with superhuman
<br>
intelligence will have inherent. Several, maybe all, of the traits we want
<br>
AIs to have can be gained through evolution. Can we afford the risk of
<br>
developing AIs of this level without applying evolutionary pressure?
