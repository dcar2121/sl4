</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; failure. I am assuming it would be best to implement the

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; I think this emphasis on programming languages is leading us astray

<p>I have to second that. Sun has done a very good propaganda job with Java
<br>
vs. C++. Java isn't inherently safer than C++ consistently used with the 
<br>
STL containers and boost smart pointers. Its only inherently safer than C++ 
<br>
used to compile 1970s style C code with a few objects thrown in. Forget 
<br>
the Sun marketing message, learn and use modern C++. Unlike Java you 
<br>
won't find yourself in a straight jacket when it matters. Most C++ 
<br>
compilers also allow for inline assembly, want to use some odd processor
<br>
feature? Not a problem.
