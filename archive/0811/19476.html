Dear Tim,
<br>
<p>I agree with your point, but I think your rebutal is flawed. Your
<br>
assumptions can be questioned for human-AI interactions, new, similar
<br>
models can be generated (maybe with the assumption that the humans who
<br>
control the food supply themselves won't starve), etc...
<br>
<p>The core critique of comparative advantage is the ressources needed.
<br>
Put simply, comparative advantage does not work with ressources that
<br>
are scarce. If there are two men on a desert island, and only enough
<br>
food for one, then there is no incentive for the stronger to trade
<br>
(and reduce them both to walking skeletons). If there is only one
<br>
tree, and one man wants to build a canoe, the other a house, then an
<br>
equitable division is not going to happen if there is not enough wood
<br>
for both of them.
<br>
<p>One idea about an out-of-control AI is that it will try to maximise
<br>
its control, and use of, ressources. The fact that the AI can generate
<br>
a widget or a potato for 1 energy ressource, while humans require 1
<br>
000 000 and 10 000 000 respectively, is not an incentive to trade
<br>
potatoes for widgets. Instead, it is an incentive to take over those
<br>
millions of energy ressources that humans are so crassly wasting
<br>
(coercice versus non-coercive arguments don't get into it - such an AI
<br>
would be sufficiently smart to take over the entire economy through
<br>
what we'd deem non-coercive methods, if it wanted to).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I came across a section in &quot;Beyond AI&quot; by J. Storrs Hall saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the economic law of comparative advantage implies that we can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out-competed by AI's.  I have also seen other people making the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim.  The argument seems invalid to me, and I wrote a rebuttal at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.fungible.com/comparative-advantage.html">http://www.fungible.com/comparative-advantage.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to be wrong here.  If anyone sees a counter to the rebuttal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please let me know.
