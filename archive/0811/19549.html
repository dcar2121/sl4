<em>&gt; Sounds like you're assuming human motivations, namely, satisficing as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to maximizing. I would expect all matter and energy to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximally exploited under most simple goal systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     One could, of course, design an AGI to want to kill people, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     think only a person would come up with that as a goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Resources aside, killing agents that might compete with you (including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by building another AGI with different goals) is a convergent subgoal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/">http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/</a>
</em><br>

Certainly it would be possible to design AIs with such goals.  I think 
<br>
it would be rather silly to do so, however.
<br>
<p>Also, there are excellent reasons to suspect than any successful AI 
<br>
would choose satisficing over maximizing.  The maximal condition, e.g., 
<br>
is excessively difficult to achieve, so one would spend all ones effort 
<br>
controlling resources rather than achieving ones more central goals.
