<br>
<p>The Rathenau Institute is an independent organization that concerns
<br>
itself with issues on the interface between science, technology and
<br>
society, and that provides politicians with timely and well-considered
<br>
information. The first issue of their print magazine Flux is now out,
<br>
and PDF versions in Dutch and English of this and other publications
<br>
are online and available for download - DIRECT DOWNLOAD LINK TO THE
<br>
PDF IN ENGLISH. The term 'Flux' represents a flow of inspiring ideas
<br>
originating from science, technology, industry and society.
<br>
<p>The first issue has a technology assessment section and three dossiers
<br>
about climate, nanotechnology and human enhancement. It is always good
<br>
to see our ideas on human enhancement discussed, and in positive
<br>
terms, on a high profile science magazine. In 'The lure of human
<br>
enhancement', the authors argue that as a result of developments in
<br>
nano, bio, info and cognitive technology, human enhancement is no
<br>
longer science fiction. The British author Nikolas Rose, a sociologist
<br>
and Director of the bios centre (study of bioscience, biomedicine,
<br>
biotechnology and society) at the London school of economics and
<br>
Political science, who serves on the national council of bioethics and
<br>
is head of the neuroscience and society network, contends that new
<br>
biomedical technology is not only bringing about a change in our
<br>
relationship with our own bodies, but also a change on the political
<br>
scene. Fragments from the book 'Reshaping the Human
<br>
Condition'—Exploring Human Enhancement' show that some scientists are
<br>
of the opinion that our current medical thinking model—based on
<br>
illness—is no longer adequate. Tech-nomad and Transhumanist Philippe
<br>
van Nedervelde reveals that we have a long, dark road to follow before
<br>
we definitively liberate ourselves from our biological limitations.
<br>
<p>The book 'Reshaping the Human Condition'—Exploring Human Enhancement'
<br>
with interviews and essays by leading Dutch and British scientists,
<br>
gives an overview of the key directions in which modern science is
<br>
pushing out the boundaries of what is possible in the field of human
<br>
enhancement. The British ambassador to the Netherlands says about the
<br>
book: 'The human drive to better ourselves is nothing new. But what is
<br>
new today is the rapidly expanding range of possibilities for human
<br>
enhancement that contemporary science now offers'. This is basic
<br>
common sense for transhumanists, and it is good to see our ideas
<br>
echoed and discussed in the political scene.
<br>
<p>Our friend Philippe van Nedervelde says 'We will become managers of
<br>
the mixing console of our brains… We will liberate ourselves from our
<br>
biological limitations more and more' and defines Transhumanism: 'is
<br>
based on the idea that we humans can enhance ourselves both in body
<br>
and mind using science and technology. Ultimately we will be able to
<br>
free ourselves from our biological limitations. Transhumanism is not a
<br>
doctrine or religion. It is a rational vision on human development'.
<br>
As one of the founders of the Order of Cosmic Engineers, 'a new
<br>
transhumanistic organization that (amongst other things) aims to give
<br>
people a scientifically sound 'warm, accessible' alternative to the
<br>
'emotional chill' that has arisen due to the disappearance of
<br>
religion', Philippe offers a mind boggling cosmic vision:
<br>
<p>Transhumanists think that humanity is destined for the universe. We
<br>
will be able to leave our biological substrate within the foreseeable
<br>
future. We will then transfer our consciousness and intelligence to
<br>
other matter. Compare it with buying a new car when your old one
<br>
begins to rattle. Our transhuman matter will be intelligent and
<br>
conscious and will spread by degrees throughout the universe. Perhaps
<br>
civilizations elsewhere in this universe will go the same way.
<br>
Ultimately, after a long, long time, all the matter in the cosmos will
<br>
be intelligent and conscious. A metaconsciousness or new universal
<br>
entity will gradually reach maturity. Christians would deem this being
<br>
God. It could indeed be a natural god, but not a supernatural one.
<br>
What will happen then? We may become part of a gigantic cosmic
<br>
merry-go-round, possibly even a simulation, and then everything will
<br>
start all over again either on the same level or a higher one each
<br>
time around.
<br>
<p>A great launch for a new science magazine, interesting and useful for
<br>
scientists, engineers, policy makers and citizens, which now has at
<br>
least one more and I hope many more regular readers.
