that AGI might be a MapReduce-optimal problem, and so using MapReduce  
<br>
would probably be a bad idea since it generalizes poorly.

<p><p>Even if I accepted that there was a quasi-objective &quot;best&quot; language,

<br>
can't simply assert &quot;best&quot;-ness, so what are the specific metrics that  
<br>
prove optimality of a language for AGI purposes that we can use to  
<br>
evaluate the claim?

<p><p>This is a programmer problem, not a language problem.
<br>
<p>What language do you think these &quot;rock-solid language(s)&quot;, libraries,  
<br>
and operating systems were implemented in by mortal programmers?   
<br>
Throwing problems over walls do not make problems go away.  Not taking  
<br>
responsibility for a problem is not the same as solving the problem.
