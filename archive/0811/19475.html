<p><p>Ricardian comparative advantage is predicated on assumptions, both  
<br>
explicit and implicit, that are not applicable to an economy with  
<br>
human-level AI in it, never mind smarter-than-human AI.  Comparative  
<br>
advantage is not an &quot;economic law&quot; in the sense that it is universal  
<br>
in any meaningful way, merely a necessary mathematical consequence of  
<br>
certain simple models of an economy with a laundry list of caveats  
<br>
that restrict application.
<br>
<p>This is probably one of those cases that abound in economics where  
<br>
many people do not understand the nature and scope of the model that  
<br>
underlies a well-known simple rule and consequently attempt to  
<br>
improperly apply that rule outside of its legitimate scope. Most  
<br>
people, both proponents and opponents, have a similarly broken  
<br>
understanding of the optimality of free markets.
