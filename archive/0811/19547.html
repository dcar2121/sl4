<p><p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;going to the trouble&quot;, though LISP  
<br>
does excel at this in many cases.  For well-defined simple/elegant  
<br>
language/model implementations, there are a number of programming  
<br>
languages that can do most implementations in a trivial amount of  
<br>
code.  I don't consider a complete language implementation in less  
<br>
than a hundred lines of code to be particularly onerous.  However, the  
<br>
really small, &quot;pure&quot; languages usually require ugly hacks to implement  
<br>
some constructs in other small, &quot;pure&quot; computational models. Or at  
<br>
least I cannot think of one that does not, and that was my main  
<br>
point.  You could find yourself trying to implement something in your  
<br>
chosen language that is all &quot;ugly hack&quot;.
<br>
<p>I would guess that one of the pragmatic reasons for designing impure  
<br>
languages in the first place is to create idiomatic shortcuts that  
<br>
bypass necessarily ugly hacks in purer languages.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; When you talk of implementing a Forth-like language in Python, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume you mean something like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forthlikeProgram = [3, 4, '+']   # adds 3 and 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runForth(forthlikeProgram)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; def runForth(program):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   #... runs 'program' in a stack-based language
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now obviously the same thing could be done in Lisp. However, Lisp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; s-expressions are a less verbose encoding than Python lists, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth program would look like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (3 4 +)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This isn't a big deal when the program only has 3 elements, but if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was bigger, it would be an issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I would say that Lisp is better than Python at working in the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forth idiom.
</em><br>
<p><p>The semantics and dynamics of compositional and applicative languages  
<br>
can be pretty different, that they both have superficially similar  
<br>
list-like structure was not really the point.  You can do things in  
<br>
the former that are kind of ugly in applicative languages even when  
<br>
using LISP macros and similar since they bury their abstractions in  
<br>
different places and ways. Python's notion of lists is sufficiently  
<br>
general and featured (read: &quot;impure&quot;) that it can do both applicative  
<br>
and compositional semantics pretty easily, though Python's native  
<br>
dictionaries are somewhat inadequate for the latter purpose (so it is  
<br>
only a half-win). Python was just an easy example.
<br>
<p>For many vanilla language implementations you will not exercise the  
<br>
differences between compositional and applicative computational models  
<br>
-- a lot of common computer science works very well with applicative  
<br>
models. On the other hand, there are interesting computational models  
<br>
that make the theoretical differences obvious and have a preference  
<br>
for expression on one implementation language over the either i.e.  
<br>
implementation on a FORTH-like language and a LISP-like language would  
<br>
have substantially differing complexity, not always in favor of LISP.   
<br>
LISP macros are slick indeed if you know you probably won't be better  
<br>
off with something different.
<br>
<p><p>My original point on this thread is that we have no idea what we  
<br>
really need, at least not well enough to declare a particular  
<br>
implementation language to be optimal for AGI. I have a subjective  
<br>
preference for applicative models when doing implementations, but back  
<br>
when I was prototyping computational models there were a few  
<br>
interesting ones that were not a natural fit for LISP-like languages  
<br>
and I got a lot of mileage out of the fact that Python could support  
<br>
other abstract models with a minimum of fuss. A reasonable argument  
<br>
could be made that a more generally expressive language rather than a  
<br>
small, pure language is a conservative choice.
<br>
<p>And if you are implementing in C/C++ for speed and scalability, it  
<br>
will be moot anyway.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Which for hard problems will often be the case. AI programming vcan be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought of as a special case of explotratory programming, where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know what the solution will be when you shart coding. Therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it helps if the language is flexible, e.g. if a variable's type is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined at run time not compile time.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yet another pragmatic tradeoff. The extent to which different typing  
<br>
model will help you depends on the nature of the code that is being  
<br>
written.  Some times code is ugly and evil without dynamic typing  
<br>
other times there are no significant costs with static typing (and  
<br>
obvious benefits). I think the argument for strong typing is a bit  
<br>
more biased though.
<br>
<p>Choosing the best tool for the job is dependent on rigorously defining  
<br>
&quot;the job&quot;.  Absent that, you are left with a bunch of pragmatic  
<br>
concerns like comfort using the language and flexibility.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
