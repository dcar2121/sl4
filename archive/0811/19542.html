<p><em>&gt; You are assuming that an AGI will be modeled on human motivations, etc.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find this highly suspect.  My expectation is that it will model human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations only sufficiently to understand us, and to explain itself to us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms that we can accept.  As for resources... the surface of a planet is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an optimal location for machines.  Not unless they are designed to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquid water as an essential component.  Asteroids have a lot to reccommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, including constant access to sunlight for power.  Other moons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without atmospheres also have potential.  Mercury has lots of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available, just not continually unless you transfer it down from orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Etc.  Luna isn't a very good choice, as it doesn't have any real advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except a lack of air, and the rocks are rather low in mass, which indicates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that metals will be hard to come by.  (People have come up with all sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schemes to extract them, but mainly because Luna is close to Earth.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My expectation is that an AGI will stick around Earth only if it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likes being around people.  (Of course, it might leave, and then return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after it had mined out the rest of the more easily accessible solar system.)
</em><br>
<p><p>Sounds like you're assuming human motivations, namely, satisficing as
<br>
opposed to maximizing. I would expect all matter and energy to be maximally
<br>
exploited under most simple goal systems.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One could, of course, design an AGI to want to kill people, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a person would come up with that as a goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Resources aside, killing agents that might compete with you (including by
<br>
building another AGI with different goals) is a convergent subgoal.
