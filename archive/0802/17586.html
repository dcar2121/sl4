<p>Now _that's_ fun!
<br>
<p>Here's some brainstorming. An asterisk marks projects which I found  on
<br>
intelligence.org.
<br>
<p>* Research grants on all levels
<br>
- With a boatload of money: Much wider support of university research,
<br>
including funding professorial chairs. [Comment: Good and intelligent people
<br>
may follow the money, and the best can be chosen. Even if they are not on
<br>
the level described in the SIAI's researcher job-description, they can still
<br>
contribute smaller pieces of the FAI solution. Feynman et al. didn't choose
<br>
the goals of the Manhattan project, yet did stellar work once recruited.]
<br>
- Undergraduate/graduate tuition fellowships
<br>
- Research prizes a la X-Prize for major milestones
<br>
- Prizes for smaller accomplishments, like for best essay explaining FAI
<br>
targeted at a popular audience, or at specific scientific audiences;  best
<br>
student essay on FAI; best scientific article making some progress, even
<br>
minor, on FAI
<br>
* Professional-quality slideshow
<br>
- Other high-quality publicity materials, whether web, print, video, or
<br>
lecture tours. These can be directed to various purposes,  including
<br>
convincing university students and cog-sci researchers to explore and adopt
<br>
a new paradigm; or Silicon Valley millionaires to form a self-reinforcing
<br>
donor community.
<br>
- Research and preparation for handling public relations, whether to garner
<br>
support or to counter-act future  political meddling.
<br>
* More Singularity Summits
<br>
- Scientific workshops, seminars, and conferences
<br>
* OpenCog
<br>
- A part-time stipend for  team members who now volunteer, or a full-time
<br>
stipend to team members who are now part-time, to allow them to devote more
<br>
of their time to SIAI
<br>
* More in-house research fellows
<br>
- A good professional fund-raiser
<br>
* An endowment. Harvard has $35 billion in the bank; SIAI can start catching
<br>
up!
<br>
- SIAI can build an in-house dev team once the research has prepared the
<br>
ground for  FAI development. Even before then, it may be useful: Researchers
<br>
often hire developers to build software for experimentation with  parts of
<br>
a  theory.
<br>
- Once SIAI gets the aforementioned  boatload of money, perhaps it can
<br>
sponsor Novamente, which seems like the most likely dev team for FAI.
<br>
Depending on legalities and the desires of Novamente stockholders, SIAI
<br>
could invest in Novamente or hire on the whole team.
<br>
<p>I'm rooting for you!
<br>
<p>Joshua
