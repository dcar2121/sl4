Lucas,
<br>
<p><p>i think your quote is not by John Smart, but a paraphrase of his  
<br>
ideas which refers to the quote just before.
<br>
<p>It doesn't say that true AI would bypass 'problems of biological  
<br>
complexity and ethics' in any general way, I think it contrasts a  
<br>
'Wetware' approach to AI (which entails 'ethical problems and  
<br>
problems of biological complexity') to a 'True' approach to AI (which  
<br>
is apparently based on some other 'dry' technology still unknown to us).
<br>
That at least is how I understand it.
<br>
<p><p>On that page I do find there is a curious contradiction between on  
<br>
the one hand a view of intelligence as having 'central algorithms',  
<br>
which I interpret as a kind of computationalist view on intelligence  
<br>
which seems to be rather common amongst computer people. But on the  
<br>
other hand it does seem to suggest that ultimately a sufficiently  
<br>
intelligent entity can only start a recursive, accelerating explosion  
<br>
of self-improvement by tweaking its own hardware.
<br>
<p>Am I the only one to see a glaring contradiction there ?
<br>
<p>My (not very informed, mind you !) hunch is that once we get into the  
<br>
realm of 'fully programmable', nanotech-like, totally reconfigurable  
<br>
hardware, we can only deal with any extra possibillities that gives  
<br>
us by forgetting about ideal Turing machines with infinite tape and  
<br>
by starting to worry about the complex and reconfigurable bodies that  
<br>
enable this truly artificial intelligence.  Ultimately this means  
<br>
worrying about the real world, real molecules, real interactions, not  
<br>
about virtual ones. Otherwise I don't think we'll get much beyond the  
<br>
idea that you can simulate anything on anything that can calculate.  
<br>
Why would we then need any reconfigurable hardware when all we need  
<br>
is more speed and more storage ?
<br>
<p>I am painfully aware that I'm making sweeping suggestions on a list  
<br>
that is teeming with specialists who know infinitely more about these  
<br>
issues than I do. My sincere apologies if what I say is complete  
<br>
gibberish, I am happy to learn, just point me some books.
<br>
<p><p>with kind regards,
<br>
<p><p>Joost Rekveld.
