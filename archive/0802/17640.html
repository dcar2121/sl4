&quot;If you don’t want to do something then you cannot, and I don’t find that
<br>
very confusing.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this sentence confusing, and questionably relevant. An AI will not automatically want to overthrow its initial goal unless a dominant overthrow-initial-goal goal is already in place - which we will not be including in the AI, of course.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently I have to point out yet again that there is no goal that
<br>
universally motivates human behavior, not even the goal of self
<br>
preservation.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a valid argument regarding humans, but it is by no means insurmountable. AI's don't need to have a human-like architecture (and they won't anyway). For example, the AI's super-goal can be made permanently dominant by favorably weighting the concept representation (procedurally); and by favorably weighting the attention allocation. One of the major reasons that human goals change all the time is because our attention is always shifting dramatically (we don't have a dynamically permanent (dominant) weighting attached to a particular concept/thought/episodic-memory - like an AI can be designed to have).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps not perhaps my actions were random, but even if they were not
<br>
and they could be derived directly from Dirac's equation you could never
<br>
hope to perform such a calculation, much less do so for an AI with a
<br>
mind thousands of times as powerful as your own.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That calculation is not necessary for constructing a Friendly or Unfriendly AI. And minds can't work by randomness.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an extremely irrational belief.

<p>Yes.
