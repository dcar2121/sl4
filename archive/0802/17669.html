<p><em>&gt; I described one possible design in <a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html">http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html</a> and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did my thesis work to show that a very abstract model of this architecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is robust and scalable.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a nice idea - I hope you pursue it further.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The idea that AI could fall into the &quot;wrong hands&quot; is like the Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falling  into the wrong hands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Consider the following scenario. A pseudo-AI capable of high performance
<br>
computer vision understanding, speech recognition, and natural language
<br>
comprehension is developed and made widely available (perhaps a descendant
<br>
of PAQ).
<br>
<p>Individuals with the semi-intelligent system can do all kinds of neat
<br>
things. They can build robots to fetch them coffee. They can teach their
<br>
cars how to drive. They can program face-recognition security systems that
<br>
protect their houses from burglars.
<br>
<p>The government can do all of these little tricks too. However, the
<br>
government also has access to the following physical infrastructure:
<br>
1) visual surveillance systems in all public places
<br>
2) apparatus to monitor electronic communications across the globe
<br>
3) robotic soldiers
<br>
<p>It seems to me that:
<br>
P(semi-intelligence) &lt;&lt; P(semi-intelligence + physical infrastructure)
<br>
<p>where P(..) is the &quot;power function&quot; - the amount of power/capability/utility
<br>
that a technological system makes available to its controller.
<br>
<p>In our current system, there is a delicate balance of power between
<br>
individuals and the state. Many people would argue that the balance is
<br>
currently tilted too far towards the state. Regardless, the introduction of
<br>
semi-intelligence would seem to dramatically upset the balance of power,
<br>
even if it is made widely available, because of the way semi-intelligence
<br>
interacts with the pre-existing physical infrastructure the government has.
<br>
<p>If you basically trust the government, then the above scenario shouldn't
<br>
worry you too much. I do not trust the government. We have no foolproof way
<br>
to guarantee that the reins of government power do not fall into the hands
<br>
of evil men. Tyranny has plagued humanity since the beginning of
<br>
civilization.
<br>
