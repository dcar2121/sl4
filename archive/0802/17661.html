<em>&gt; &gt;  If you accept that the rate of improvement of a learning system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  bounded by the information bandwidth into it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't see why this would be the case. Processing limitations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (including memory bandwidth) and algorithm efficiency seem much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm going to taboo* myself from using learning, I would appreciate if
<br>
you attempted the same. Instead I will say system evolution
<br>
bifurcation, or bifurcating for short.
<br>
<p>What do I mean by this. Imagine a deterministic computer shut in a
<br>
box, it will only go down one path. If you had a bunch of them the
<br>
same and pre-programmed it to answer a question at set time, they
<br>
would all answer the same. Such a system cannot increase its
<br>
predictive power of the outside world. That is not to say that it
<br>
cannot answer a question wrongly at one point, and correctly later,
<br>
just that the predictive power is limited to what is already there.
<br>
<p>Now imagine you added a link to the outside, through which one bit
<br>
could enter. Now depending upon that bit the system, the systems
<br>
evolution could bifurcate, or it could ignore it and stay singular.
<br>
Bifurcation leads to the potential for growing of the ability to
<br>
predict the world, if parts of the world happen to correlate with the
<br>
bit that was bifurcated on.
<br>
<p>More bits given to the system lead to more possible bifurcations.
<br>
Exponentially increasing numbers of bifurcations are needed for
<br>
exponential increases in predictive power.
<br>
<p>A concrete example, let us say we are trying to get an AI to evolve to
<br>
a state where it can consistently use my IP number to reach my
<br>
computer. It follows its programming, let us say by incrementing a
<br>
counter and using that in  the IP field of TCP/IP packets. I give it
<br>
no feedback nor any other bits of information about the world. It will
<br>
never be able to bifurcate to a state where it always uses the correct
<br>
IP address, it is just throwing out packets into the void. At some
<br>
points it would even get the IP address right, but it wouldn't know
<br>
that it had.
<br>
<p>Now say I give it a bit per second bandwidth input. If it has used the
<br>
correct IP address in the previous second it gets a 1, otherwise a 0.
<br>
Now it might guess the correct IP address first time (and only guess
<br>
one IP address) and get a 1, and therefore get 4 bytes of information.
<br>
But as we said the AI is deterministic and the IP address is fixed, so
<br>
we might be forgiven in thinking that the game is rigged and the
<br>
system already had that information. If we randomise the IP and set it
<br>
off again, on average, no matter the computing power the system had,
<br>
it would get only 7.45x10^-9 bits per second of the IP address. This
<br>
isn't the most efficient coding of  our input to it. We could simply
<br>
give it the IP address, one bit per second. The system would still be
<br>
limited to bifurcating once per second.
<br>
<p>See section 5.2 of <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs.AI/0701125">http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs.AI/0701125</a> on AIXI for some
<br>
discussion of the importance of giving more information to the system
<br>
to get it to learn, sorry bifurcate quickly.
<br>
<p>Since these two situations are impossible for us to distinguish
<br>
between, in a running AI, we shall assume the higher bound and count
<br>
the number of potential bifurcations and thus the number of input bits
<br>
when determining the potential rate of change of the system.
<br>
<p>Do not get confused between the number of bits of the state changed
<br>
and the number of input bits. It is possible for the system to change
<br>
terrabytes of state without bifurcating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  When people start positing new physics that they tend to lose me. Yep,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  I know our physics isn't perfect. But reasoning using the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  of new physics is a bit too much of a leap of faith for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Positing any *specific* new physics is a bad idea, but it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  unlikely that our physics is incomplete in *some* significant way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  perhaps even one relevant to a hard takeoff.
</em><br>
<p>Physics may be incomplete in a way relevant to the changing of
<br>
Eliezer's arm into a blue tentacle. He would argue that he shouldn't
<br>
expect it. And similarly if we can get some science behind the
<br>
possibility of hard take off we would be in a better position to
<br>
determine whether we should expect it or not.
