<p>Bad science fiction.  AI will evolve as a collective intelligence distributed

over the internet, not in some lab.  It will be in everybody's hands.
<br>
<p>The scenario I'm most afraid of is our own stupidity.  CEV is a good idea, but
<br>
it won't be implemented because people want their immediate wishes granted
<br>
right now, not their extrapolated wishes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, an intelligent system need not be fully general in order to

</em><br>
<p>Orwell did not predict that we would want surveillance.  Nor is it necessary
<br>
to enslave humans by force.  The pleasure of a thousand permanent orgasms is
<br>
just a matter of changing a few lines of code in your brain.
