I really don't want to get emotionally involved with this again; so I'll try to keep this dry. You are confusing the *ability* to overthrow its initial goals, with the *desire/motivation* to overthrow its initial goals. Believe it or not, there exists somewhere a scientific explanation for why humans behave in the strange goal-oriented way that they do. And there exists somewhere within science a description why an AGI would behave in the goal-oriented way that it will. Even your particular desire at this very moment, did not simply pop out of thin air; it was *caused* by something. Behavior is not based on magic. There is a rational explanation for it based on physical reality. I don't have a complete grasp on why you can't stop implying that all Friendly-AI advocates are blood-thirsty idiots. A much more likely explanation is that *you* simply don't know what you are talking about. Do you honestly believe that you understand the intricacies of AI better than Dr. Ben
<br>
&nbsp;Goertzel for example (who also believes that AI can be made Friendly/Safe, among many others)?

me that otherwise intelligent people think this is a point worthy of

debate. They actually think they can enslave a mind astronomically more

powerful than their own for eternity. I fully admit I just don’t get it,

I don’t understand what the hell they are thinking.
