<em>&gt;&gt;  If you're very confident that that humanity is doomed without FAI, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conclusion is reasonable. But I see no reason for that confidence. Models
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; where a number of different types of AI cooperate to prevent any one AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from conquering the world seem at least as plausible as those that imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we're doomed without FAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is there a specific model you're talking about? It doesn't matter whether
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;JoSH has talked about this kind of model somewhat in Beyond AI, and I've
<br>
heard Steve Omohundro mention it. I don't know of anything I'd call a
<br>
specific model (but then I haven't seen anything that I'd call a specific
<br>
model of FAI).
<br>
&nbsp;There appears to be a serious lack of communication between people who
<br>
think we're doomed without FAI and the people who expect a diverse society
<br>
of AIs. It appears that the leading advocates of one outcome can't imagine
<br>
how anyone could believe the other outcome is possible. This appears to be
<br>
a symptom of a serious failure of rationality somewhere. I wish I could
<br>
lock the leaders of each side of this schism into a room and not let them
<br>
out until they either reached agreement or came up with a clear explanation
<br>
of why they disagreed. Presumably part of the disagreement is over the
<br>
speed at which AI will take off, but that can't explain the certainty with
<br>
which each side appears to dismiss the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the architecture is diverse or monolithic as long as it works, so are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bringing this up because you believe a friendly outcome will somehow emerge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;naturally, without anyone have to lift a finger to design friendliness into
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Not necessarily &quot;emerge naturally&quot;, and friendly only in a very weak sense
<br>
such as not causing human extinction.
