<p>
This is an excellent argument and one that has been neglected, IMO in much
<br>
discussion of hard takeoff.
<br>
<p>I think a great deal of the 'fear' surrounding such a scenario is in the
<br>
prototypical 'skynet' scenario whereby an AI is networked and has a much
<br>
less limited architectural base with which to self-improve.
<br>
<p>I would also probably add though that we should distinguish between a lab
<br>
type AI taking off, where the above constraint is quite a realistic one
<br>
since it exists in a more or less isolated environment, and a hypothetical
<br>
bot-net type AI, which is admittedly much further off but would be less
<br>
bound by such constraints.
<br>
<p>I also tend to agree with the confusion surrounding 'new physics' we need to
<br>
define the discussion a bit more succinctly.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
