<em>&gt;  The 0.01 to 0.0001 probability that I gave was my estimate of what we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell from the failure of projects whose approach was understood and taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously by a number of people with credentials as serious AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  My impression is that SIAI hasn't described enough of a plan for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to form an opinion on whether it should be considered a serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to build an AGI.
</em><br>
<p><p>So the mean probability of success for a current AGI project that other
<br>
people are funding, but that doesn't claim to be understood by at least
<br>
three academic AI professors, is even less than the range you gave (that is,
<br>
orders of magnitude less than even one-in-ten-thousand?) That's probably
<br>
where the main area where we disagree, then.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If you're very confident that that humanity is doomed without FAI, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion is reasonable. But I see no reason for that confidence. Models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where a number of different types of AI cooperate to prevent any one AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from conquering the world seem at least as plausible as those that imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're doomed without FAI.
</em><br>
<p><p>Is there a specific model you're talking about? It doesn't matter whether
<br>
the architecture is diverse or monolithic as long as it works, so are you
<br>
bringing this up because you believe a friendly outcome will somehow emerge
<br>
naturally, without anyone have to lift a finger to design friendliness into
<br>
the total system? In that case, that may be another core area of
<br>
disagreement between you and me.
<br>
<p>-Rolf
