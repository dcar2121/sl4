</em><br>
<p>The bound is real but INSANELY HIGH - it's like saying, &quot;Let's begin 
<br>
by accepting that computational processing has to obey the laws of 
<br>
physics.&quot;  There are physical bounds, if we assume our laws are 
<br>
correct; but they're insanely far above the world we know, billions of 
<br>
trillions of quintillions times better than modern technology or 
<br>
biology, using the power output of just one star.
<br>
<p>Similarly, there are bounds on what you can deduce about the outside 
<br>
universe, and how much you can manipulate it, based on bits coming in 
<br>
or going out - but the bounds are based on Solomonoff induction and 
<br>
the second law of thermodynamics.  Meaning that so far as principle 
<br>
goes, you can use sensory and manipulative bandwith orders and orders 
<br>
and orders of magnitude more efficiently than humans do.
<br>
<p>And worse, unlike the case of setting implied physical bounds on 
<br>
processing power, there's no practical way for us humans to compute 
<br>
what the real bounds are.  We have no idea how much an ideal 
<br>
Solomonoff inductor could deduce by reading a single copy of 
<br>
Shakespeare's Hamlet, because we can't run all possible computations 
<br>
to determine how much remaining internal variance there is within 
<br>
simple computations that produce a copy of the SI reading a copy of 
<br>
Hamlet.
<br>
<p>What it ends up working out to is, &quot;A superintelligence can deduce an 
<br>
unknown amount about humanity from reading a single book, and we have 
<br>
no way of guessing how much.&quot;  Likewise, &quot;A superintelligence can 
<br>
shape its outside world an unknown amount by emitting a 100-character 
<br>
text message, and we have no way of guessing how much, because we 
<br>
can't examine all possible 100-character text messages and their 
<br>
consequences.&quot;
<br>
<p>And don't forget that not all interactions with the universe carry the 
<br>
neat label &quot;interaction&quot; - can the SI look at its own source code? 
<br>
Are *you* going to look at its source code?  That's an out-of-band 
<br>
sense impression and manipulation right there.
<br>
<p>See also the demonstrated ability of a reasonably smart intelligence 
<br>
to shape humans in ways they claimed to be impossible, through 
<br>
bandwidth limited to a few baud in a text-only IRC channel, aka &quot;The 
<br>
AI-Box Experiment&quot;.
