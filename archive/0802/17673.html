<p>*Killer robots 'a threat to humanity'*
<br>
<p>Increasingly autonomous, gun-toting robots developed for warfare could
<br>
easily fall into the hands of terrorists and may one day unleash a robot
<br>
arms race, a top expert on artificial intelligence says.
<br>
<p>&quot;They pose a threat to humanity,&quot; University of Sheffield professor Noel
<br>
Sharkey said, ahead of a keynote address before Britain's Royal United
<br>
Services Institute.
<br>
<p>Intelligent machines deployed on battlefields around the world - from
<br>
mobile grenade launchers to rocket-firing drones - can already identify
<br>
and lock onto targets without human help.
<br>
<p>There are more than 4,000 US military robots on the ground in Iraq, as
<br>
well as unmanned aircraft that have clocked hundreds of thousands of
<br>
flight hours.
<br>
<p>The first three armed combat robots fitted with large-calibre machine guns
<br>
deployed to Iraq last summer, manufactured by US arms maker Foster-Miller,
<br>
proved so successful that 80 more are on order, Professor Sharkey said.
<br>
<p>But up to now, a human hand has always been required to push the button or
<br>
pull the trigger. 
<br>
<p>It we are not careful, he said, that could change.
<br>
<p>&quot;[Military leaders] are quite clear that they want autonomous robots as
<br>
soon as possible, because they are more cost-effective and give a
<br>
risk-free war,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Several countries, led by the United States, have already invested heavily
<br>
in robot warriors developed for use on the battlefield.
<br>
<p>South Korea and Israel both deploy armed robot border guards, while China,
<br>
India, Russia and Britain have all increased the use of military robots. 
<br>
<p>The US Government plans to spend $4.28 billion by 2010 on unmanned
<br>
technology systems, with total spending expected rise to $25.7 billion,
<br>
according to the Department of Defence's Unmanned Systems Roadmap
<br>
2007-2032, released in December.
<br>
<p>Human-robot ratio
<br>
<p>James Canton, an expert on technology innovation and chief executive of
<br>
the Institute for Global Futures, predicts that deployment within a decade
<br>
of detachments that will include 150 soldiers and 2,000 robots.
<br>
<p>The use of such devices by terrorists should be a serious concern,
<br>
Professor Sharkey said. 
<br>
<p>Captured robots would not be difficult to reverse engineer, and could
<br>
easily replace suicide bombers as the weapon-of-choice. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't know why that has not happened already,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>But even more worrisome, he continued, is the subtle progression from the
<br>
semi-autonomous military robots deployed today to fully independent
<br>
killing machines.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have worked in artificial intelligence for decades, and the idea of a
<br>
robot making decisions about human termination terrifies me,&quot; he said.
