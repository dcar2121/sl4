<p>I agree. So would it be worthwhile to the debate to be try and
<br>
formalise what we mean by hard-takeoff or self-improvement and seeing
<br>
what the physics has to say about it?
<br>
<p>If you accept that the rate of improvement of a learning system is
<br>
bounded by the information bandwidth into it, then we can start to put
<br>
bounds on the rates of improvement of different systems based on
<br>
energy usage and hardware (e.g. a PC with two DDR2-800 modules, each
<br>
running at 400 MHz will limit the software running on it to improving
<br>
itself to 12.8 GB/s, it's memory bandwidth, or less if you just count
<br>
the connection to the web and keyboard/mouse).
<br>
<p>What do people think about the fruitfulness of developing this line of
<br>
thought further?
<br>
<p>When people start positing new physics that they tend to lose me. Yep,
<br>
I know our physics isn't perfect. But reasoning using the possibility
<br>
of new physics is a bit too much of a leap of faith for me.
