<p><em>&gt; There appears to be a serious lack of communication between people who

<p><p>The scenario I'm most afraid of is not a hard take-off leading to unfriendly
<br>
AGI, but a pseudo-AI falling into the hands of evil men.
<br>
<p>I fear most people dramatically underestimate the impact of evil on the
<br>
world. Evil is a Black Swan: a rare event (the majority of people are not
<br>
evil) that has huge impact. It is not unreasonable to say that history is
<br>
dominated by evil, in spite of its empirical rarity.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, an intelligent system need not be fully general in order to
<br>
give a small group of people the ability to dominate/enslave humanity. Think
<br>
1984, except Big Brother is equipped with a sophisticated computer vision
<br>
and speech recognition system, so that the Ministry of Truth instantly knows
<br>
if you've spoken anything ungrammatical (that is, your sentence was invalid
<br>
under the grammar of NewSpeak). The Microsoft Office grammar checker becomes
<br>
rather more sinister in this light.
<br>
<p>I also fear that discussion of this point is strongly hindered by the
<br>
difficulty we have in talking about politics.
