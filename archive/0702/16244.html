<em>&gt; What's wrong with this argument?!!! If it's true, making a (supper)human is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minds, Machines and GÃ¶del is J. R. Lucas's 1959 philosophical paper in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he argues that a human mathematician cannot be accurately represented by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic automaton. Appealing to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argues that for any such automaton, there would be some mathematical formula
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it could not prove, but which the human mathematician could both see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and show, to be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The paper is a GÃ¶delian argument over mechanism.
</em><br>
<p>As it seems I'm always saying, it's a matter of context.
<br>
<p>Lucas applies different standards to the machine and the human,
<br>
apparently with the implicit assumption that while machines, by
<br>
definition, must be consistent, humans are somehow exempt (else how
<br>
could they have &quot;free-will&quot; which is &quot;obvious&quot; beyond dispute?)
<br>
<p>Lucas argues
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godel's theorem states that in any consistent system which is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong enough to produce simple arithmetic there are formulae
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cannot be proved-in-the- system, but which we [standing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside the system] can see to be true.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godel's theorem must apply to cybernetical machines, because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is of the essence of being a machine, that it should be a concrete
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instantiation of a formal system. It follows that given any machine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is consistent and capable of doing simple arithmetic, there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a formula which it is incapable of producing as being true -- but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which we can see to be true. It follows that no machine can be a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete or adequate model of the mind, that minds are essentially
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different from machines.
<br>
<p>Lucas is correct in pointing out that the consistency of a system can
<br>
be proved only from within a context greater than and encompassing the
<br>
system of interest, but he fails to apply the same principle to the
<br>
human system.  On what basis does he think human knowledge and
<br>
certainty of &quot;truth&quot; is warranted, given that both machines and humans
<br>
are similarly context-limited?
<br>
<p>Another way to look at this is to agree with his statement that &quot;given
<br>
any machine which is consistent and capable of doing simple
<br>
arithmetic, there is a formula which it is incapable of producing as
<br>
being true -- but which we [humans] can see to be true&quot; and extend the
<br>
argument by applying a slightly more advanced machine that can prove
<br>
the more limited statements that stumped its predecessor, and imagine
<br>
doing this recursively as far as desired.  It might then become clear
<br>
that that this hypothetical machine could in fact surpass the human in
<br>
context of understanding while remaining consistent but limited, and
<br>
that the provability of any statement, by human or machine, is a
<br>
matter of context.
<br>
<p>Of course, given that your context and mine are necessarily disjoint
<br>
to some extent, the foregoing &quot;proves&quot; nothing.  ;-)
