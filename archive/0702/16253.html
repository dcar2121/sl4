<p>Great story, I was just thinking along similar lines in the context of
<br>
<em>&gt; infinite regress, namely:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If rather than pulling some kind of bootstrapping first cause or looped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time thing, the universe is infinitely nested, it seems likely-to-inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some of the nestings would be artificial rather than natural, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given an infinite number of artificial nestings it seems again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely-to-inevitable that some percentage of them would not be pure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hermetic simulations, but would have errors or back doors or just easter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eggs where the programmers' names scroll upwards accompanied by an upbeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orchestral soundtrack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently infinite layers of messing around somehow adds up to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely natural seeming world, assuming any of what I said is true to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begin with, which seems unlikely but plausible.
</em><br>
<p><p>If an infinite computer is is possible hand-coding of individual universes
<br>
is not necessary: a simple program such as a universal dovetailer will
<br>
compute all possible worlds, including an infinitely nested set of
<br>
emulations. This means that if an infinite computer exists anywhere, almost
<br>
certainly we are being emulated on it now. The idea is related to to the
<br>
theory that all mathematical structures exist, explored by people such as
<br>
Max Tegmark, Jurgen Schmidhuber and Bruno Marchal.
