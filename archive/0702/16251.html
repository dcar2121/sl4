<p>
Great story, I was just thinking along similar lines in the context of
<br>
infinite regress, namely:
<br>
<p>If rather than pulling some kind of bootstrapping first cause or looped time
<br>
thing, the universe is infinitely nested, it seems likely-to-inevitable that
<br>
some of the nestings would be artificial rather than natural, and that given
<br>
an infinite number of artificial nestings it seems again
<br>
likely-to-inevitable that some percentage of them would not be pure,
<br>
hermetic simulations, but would have errors or back doors or just easter
<br>
eggs where the programmers' names scroll upwards accompanied by an upbeat
<br>
orchestral soundtrack.
<br>
<p>Apparently infinite layers of messing around somehow adds up to a completely
<br>
natural seeming world, assuming any of what I said is true to begin with,
<br>
which seems unlikely but plausible.
<br>
<p>I don't understand what you mean about N-cycles though, if the universes all
<br>
start the same and changes propagate down from the top, how do the cycles
<br>
ever reach the lower floors? Or are you talking about something totally
<br>
different?
