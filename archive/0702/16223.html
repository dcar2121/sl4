Not sure if these pointers are mathematical enough.
<br>
But I am currently looking into cognitive psychology as part of my study.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In &quot;The Architecture of Cognition&quot;, Anderson, there are two chapters called
<br>
Spread of Activation and Control of Cognition and there seems to be some
<br>
differential equations in it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And I am having a look at this interesting book called &quot;Cognitive
<br>
Psychology:
<br>
A Neural-Network Approach&quot;, Martindale. Even though it does not seem to
<br>
contains any mathematical equations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sorry, I can't give much details yet as I haven't gone through them yet :)
<br>

<br>
(I am a phd student in ANU working on hybridization of machine learning and
<br>
automated reasoning methods)

Subject: Definitions of cognitive functions - Any pointers?
<br>
<p><p>Hello all,
<br>
I've been reading this list for the last couple of months, and I enjoyed
<br>
reading about novel (and new to me) ideas in fields that I consider as the
<br>
frontiers of the human intellect.
<br>
<p>For some time now, I've been considering the idea of defining many
<br>
-typically hard to define- cognitive functions (such as though,  memory
<br>
recollection, consiousness, pain, desire) using a rationally concrete
<br>
mathematical model. That is, defining the above functions as states,
<br>
transformations or relations within this mathematical model. 
<br>
<p>For example defining thought as a state of a neural state machine with
<br>
particular properties. Memory recollection as a state change and a slight
<br>
transformation of the underlying state machine structure. Concious thoughts
<br>
as a subset of thoughts with certain properties etc
<br>
<p>I find it a bit hard to believe that noone has ever thought this way before,
<br>
but I have found nothing similar at any of the resources I've read so far
<br>
(which is not much).
<br>
Do you know of any work that has been done in this field? Or any arguments
<br>
supporting that this is just as useless way of thinking? :-)
<br>
<p>Any pointers will be greatly appreciated.
<br>
<p>I'm currently doing the first year of a &quot;Computer Science&quot; BSc at the
<br>
University of Sheffield, UK.
