<br>
For some time now, I've been considering the idea of defining many 
<br>
-typically hard to define- cognitive functions (such as though,  memory 
<br>
recollection, consiousness, pain, desire) using a rationally concrete 
<br>
mathematical model. That is, defining the above functions as states, 
<br>
transformations or relations within this mathematical model.
<br>
****
<br>
<p>I have attempted such a thing in a series of book written over the last 
<br>
15 years.
<br>
<p>For a summary of my perspective see my recent book &quot;The Hidden 
<br>
Pattern.&quot;  Most of the book is nonmathematical, but there are two 
<br>
Appendices that put some of the foundational concepts in the book in 
<br>
mathematical form.  Then, if you're still curious, you can dip back into 
<br>
earlier works such as The Structure of Intelligence, The Evolving Mind 
<br>
and Chaotic Logic (which alas are more riddled with typos as I was an 
<br>
even messier copy-editor back then...) for more detailed models of 
<br>
things like different types of memory and different kinds of learning.
<br>
<p>I spent a long time trying to mathematize different aspects of 
<br>
cognition.  What I arrived at was a bunch of mathematical equations that 
<br>
represented my intuitive understanding of how mind works, but were not 
<br>
tractable or solvable using contemporary mathematical tools!  So, the 
<br>
formalizations so far have not been much use for anything except 
<br>
refining and guiding my intuitive understanding.  Of course, that is a 
<br>
significant use and I think if I hadn't gone through this extended 
<br>
mental exercise of cognitive formalization, I would not have been able 
<br>
to come up with a workable AGI design (although that also took me many 
<br>
years of effort ... the challenge being that the first AGI design my 
<br>
formalizations led me to, the Webmind design, was workable-in-principle 
<br>
but overly complex from a practical implementation standpoint...)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Hello all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I've been reading this list for the last couple of months, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     enjoyed reading about novel (and new to me) ideas in fields that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     consider as the frontiers of the human intellect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     For some time now, I've been considering the idea of defining many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     -typically hard to define- cognitive functions (such as though, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     memory recollection, consiousness, pain, desire) using a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     rationally concrete mathematical model. That is, defining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     above functions as states, transformations or relations within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     this mathematical model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     For example defining thought as a state of a neural state machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     with particular properties. Memory recollection as a state change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and a slight transformation of the underlying state machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     structure. Concious thoughts as a subset of thoughts with certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     properties etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I find it a bit hard to believe that noone has ever thought this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     way before, but I have found nothing similar at any of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     resources I've read so far (which is not much).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Do you know of any work that has been done in this field? Or any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     arguments supporting that this is just as useless way of thinking? :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Any pointers will be greatly appreciated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I'm currently doing the first year of a &quot;Computer Science&quot; BSc at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the University of Sheffield, UK.
