<p>
This question interests me too.  Anyone know of a standard list of 
<br>
inductive biases?

<p>Hi,
<br>
<p>In a recent offlist email dialogue with an AI researcher, he made the
<br>
following suggestion regarding the &quot;inductive bias&quot; that DNA supplies
<br>
to the human brain to aid it in learning:
<br>
<p>*****
<br>
What is encoded in the DNA may include a starting ontology (as proposed,
<br>
with exasperating vaguess, by developmental psychologists, though much
<br>
more complex than anything they have thought of) but the more important
<br>
thing is an implicit set of constraints on ontologies that can be
<br>
discovered by systematic 'scientific' investigation. So it might not
<br>
work in an arbitrary universe, including some simulated universes,e.g.
<br>
'tileworld' universes.
<br>
<p>One such constraint (as Kant pointed out in 1780) is the
<br>
assumption that everything physical happens in 3-D space and
<br>
time. Another is the requirement for causal determinism (for most
<br>
processes).
<br>
<p>There may also be constraints on kinds of information-processing
<br>
entities that can be learnt about in the environment, e.g. other humans,
<br>
other animals, dead-ancestors, gods, spirits, computer games, ....
<br>
<p>The major, substantive, ontology extensions have to happen in (partially
<br>
ordered) stages, each stage building on previous stages, and brain
<br>
development is staggered accordingly.
<br>
******
<br>
<p><p>My response to him was that these &quot;genetic biases&quot; are indeed encoded
<br>
in the Novamente design, but in a somewhat unsystematic and scattered way.
<br>
<p><p>For instance, in the Novamente system,
<br>
<p>-- the restriction to 3D space is implicit in the set of elementary
<br>
predicates and procedures supplied
<br>
to the system for preprocessing perceptual data on its way to abstract
<br>
cognition
<br>
<p>-- the bias toward causal determinism is implicit in an inference
<br>
control mechanism that specifically
<br>
tries to build &quot;PredictiveAttractionLink&quot; relationships that embody
<br>
likely causal relationships
<br>
<p>etc.
<br>
<p>I have actually never gone through the design with an eye towards
<br>
identifying exactly how each
<br>
important &quot;genetic bias&quot; of cognition is encoded in the system.
<br>
However, this would be an interesting
<br>
and worthwhile thing to do.
<br>
<p>Toward that end, it would be interesting to have a systematic list
<br>
somewhere of the genetic biases
<br>
that are thought to be most important for structuring human cognition.
<br>
<p>Does anyone know of a well-thought-out list of this sort.  Of course I
<br>
could make one by surveying
<br>
the cognitive psych literature, but why reinvent the wheel?
<br>
