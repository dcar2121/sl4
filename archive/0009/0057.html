I doubt I can bring any other sentiments into a reply that Eliezer hasn't 
<br>
already, but I will nonetheless donate my two cents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've read most of the stuff at sysopmind.com over the last day or two. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am of two (at least) minds about this work of bringing Singularity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fruition quickly.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that we as singularitarians have the option of being &quot;of 
<br>
two minds&quot;. It is wise to have a perspective on all things you encounter in 
<br>
your life, but this is far beyond the pale of ordinary things. Plus, we 
<br>
can't afford the time or divisive mindset this might bring about. If we 
<br>
doubt the work in front of us, the Singularity might not be reached before 
<br>
we as a race destroy ourselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Even granted that this Power is a much higher sentience, I still feel as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if I am betraying humankind, betraying my own primary motives in working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to bring it about sometimes.  How do the rest of you deal with this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What am I missing?
</em><br>
<p>see below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know that the Singularity is eventually inevitable for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent species and inevitable for us barring major disaster or some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;totally unforeseen bottleneck.  But how can I be in a hurry to bring it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about and still claim I work for the good of humanity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- samantha
</em><br>
<p>What are you missing? The same thing we all are. The lack of sight beyond 
<br>
the wall of super-evolution that is the Singularity. How do we deal with it? 
<br>
I can't claim knowledge of how anyone else on this list sleeps at night with 
<br>
the knowledge we have, but i go forward knowing that I must work for it with 
<br>
all available resources because there is no other choice. It IS inevitable, 
<br>
as you said, and while there is the chance of the loss of the human race, 
<br>
well, there are myriad threats to our species. The Singularity, while itself 
<br>
a possible threat, is the ONLY way we can stop the other inevitability: 
<br>
global self-genocide. We must not second guess ourselves.
<br>
