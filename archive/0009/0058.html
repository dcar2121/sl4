<p>
Reasons for us to be personally going all out to make SI happen (in spite of
<br>
the real dangers):
<br>
- The huge benefits that better AI will provide before singularity (SI may
<br>
take much longer than we think, or there may be some upper theoretical limit
<br>
to intelligence that will dramatically slow the singularity)
<br>
- Eli's reason: our best hope to avert another technological catastrophe
<br>
that has *no* chance of good outcome
<br>
- Some (all?) of us feel that whatever limited control we *may* have over
<br>
AI's development path, *we* - the good guys - would rather be right there at
<br>
the developmental edge to help guide the best possible outcome.
<br>
- Any other major reasons?
<br>
<p>I want to expand a little on the issue of developmental path: Even if we are
<br>
right, and SI is an 'inevitable' result of the technology that we now have
<br>
(provided that we don't 'blow ourselves up' first), there may still be
<br>
several *developmental* options - some of which may include us, while other
<br>
may not. And specifically, initial design parameters may (chaotically)
<br>
affect what the SI does 'in its youth'. I'd like to hear any good arguments
<br>
against this possibility.
<br>
<p>This bring me to the issue of machine ethics: What will an SI value? What
<br>
major goals will it have? I have not abandoned the hope that we might be
<br>
able to predict this to some degree. We may be able to predict its goals
<br>
(with some degree of certainty) during its early stages; that would help.
<br>
Note that I'm only suggesting that we may be smart enough to foresee its
<br>
major goals, not what it will do to achieve them.
<br>
<p>The way I'm pursuing this idea, is by developing a rational approach to
<br>
(prescriptive) ethics. If we can discover (perhaps with the help of early
<br>
AI) what moral values a more rational (trans-) human - who can actually
<br>
reprogram his emotional evolutionary baggage - would choose, that might give
<br>
us clues to the values of an AI/ SI. (I have a number of papers on this
<br>
subject at www.optimal.org.) Any comments?
