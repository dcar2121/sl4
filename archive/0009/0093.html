<p>Don't worry, you're among friends.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>

<p>More like two years, tops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; software\communications do we currently have to make something like this

<p>Micropayments, pseudonymous identities that each have a reputation
<br>
associated with them, collaborative filtering, improved searching,
<br>
smart contracts, and a really intuitive but powerful interface for
<br>
discussion/collaboration and you pretty much have it.
<br>
<p>Economics is important, because an economy already *is* a transhuman
<br>
decision making system. A group mind. The challenge is just to make it
<br>
smarter, remove more friction, allow it to expand into domains that up
<br>
till now have been reserved to individual intelligences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; point...the technical basis is what is most important at such an early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage.  Is there any work currently being done on such a project?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, from several directions. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Again, my apologies for sounding a bit awestruck, but this concept (on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible scale) has received little discussion in any circles I am familiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that everybody who's working on the effort is fully aware
<br>
of its implications. Foresight Institute, for example, calls it 'social
<br>
software'. The trade press calls it 'online communities'. It definitely
<br>
needs more discussion, and that's why I want to round up all the
<br>
Transhumanist web developers et. al.  and start a new forum on how to
<br>
design-ahead for this. That, by the way, is why I see the
<br>
weblog-on-every-desktop scenario as a desirable one, Eliezer-- it's an
<br>
intermediate step to EarthWeb (cf. our eGroups debate in front of Nick
<br>
Bostrom). Of course, competitive pressures will eventually force some
<br>
company someplace to develop the software, and then all web developers
<br>
everywhere to adopt it. However, I want Transhumanist-run companies
<br>
and Transhumanist web developers to have the founder advantage.
<br>
<p>So, why should a Singularitarian care about EarthWeb?
<br>
<p>1. Any new technology may face unforseen obstacles. That's why they're
<br>
called unforseen. Two semi-redundant technologies aiming for the same
<br>
goal are a safer bet.
<br>
<p>2. EarthWeb will drive economic, engineering, and intellectual
<br>
developments that may make the job of SingInst easier. Correct me
<br>
if I'm wrong, but the optimistic time scale for &gt;AI is 10-15 years.
<br>
The very pessimistic timescale for EarthWeb is 5 years. The large
<br>
scale behavior of EarthWeb itself may also inspire shortcuts and 
<br>
warn of potential pitfalls that await Transhuman intelligences as
<br>
a class, whether individual or collective.
<br>
<p>3. One way to think of EarthWeb is as an upload of human society...
<br>
laws, markets, reputations, relationships, institutions, factual
<br>
knowledge, creative works... pretty much everything except the actual
<br>
humans. Having such an infrastructure in place is a necessary
<br>
prerequisite to the uploading of humans... when uploading comes there
<br>
will be too many other things to worry about to be writing the rules of
<br>
human interaction from scratch at the same time.
