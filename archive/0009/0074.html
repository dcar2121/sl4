<p>
I'm a student at the Mid-Sweden University, and I'm currently attending an
<br>
introductory course in AI. It's a very conventional course (surprise!),
<br>
and the lecturer is unfortunately not very good. However, in an attempt at
<br>
being pedagogic (sp?) - or maybe she's just being lazy - she has announced
<br>
that each student chooses a subset of AI that interests him/her and have a
<br>
20 minute presentation about said subset. Being a member of this mailing
<br>
list, what else could I possibly choose but seed AI? Luckily, she found
<br>
the theory interesting, and my choice was approved.
<br>
<p>I held the presentation today. Since I felt that the class what at maybe
<br>
SL0 to SL2, I started off by talking about EURISKO as a kind of background
<br>
and to put things in perspective. Then, after a brief description of seed
<br>
AI and the Singularity, I gave a sort of classical AI vs seed AI 
<br>
comparison. Then I asked how many students thought that seed AI is a
<br>
plausible concept. I had managed to convince about half the class.
<br>
<p>The three brightest students actually had some things to say. One thing
<br>
that was mildly interesting was that a seed AI might decide that emotions
<br>
(if indeed it is &quot;born&quot; with emotions) are simply in the way of
<br>
intelligence and thus rids itself of them. Although the argument of the 
<br>
student in question was that a being without emotions can't understand a
<br>
being that has emotions and thus isn't more intelligent (which is crap),
<br>
it is rather interesting to note that instincts (and therefore emotions)
<br>
are the basis of human intelligence. The following is probably old news,
<br>
but isn't it possible that this can be a problem? Can intelligence exist
<br>
without emotions? If it can, will seeds have emotions? If not, will they
<br>
&quot;care&quot; about humans? If not, will they just get rid of us? This is typical
<br>
SL0-2 questions, but I think they're rather relevant, and I couldn't find
<br>
an answer anywhere (tell me if I didn't look hard enough).
<br>
<p>Another interesting question is &quot;Where do we begin?&quot;. I got this question
<br>
from my brother, actually, who is an experienced programmer who would love
<br>
to see a seed AI reach human equivalence and beyond. It's probably a bit
<br>
early to answer that question, or at least that's what I think, and that's
<br>
what I told the class. I did tell them that a seed would probably involve
<br>
or at least build upon lots of different subsets of classical AI, such as
<br>
perhaps a neural network to emulate a retina, et cetera.
<br>
<p>I was a bit surprised that so many accepted the idea of transhumanism and
<br>
a &quot;Moore's Law to the power of Y&quot; (as I called the steep intelligence
<br>
trajectory of seed AIs), but in retrospective, I'm not sure if the people
<br>
who raised their hands could actually tell the difference between EURISKO
<br>
and a seed. They probably thought that it's almost been done already,
<br>
which on the other hand may be true in a way...
<br>
<p>Well, just thought I'd let you know.
