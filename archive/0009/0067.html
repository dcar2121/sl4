<p>There are some people who you will just never ever be able to convert, because
<br>
they are too damn stubborn and they just don't want to listen to you.  Like,
<br>
say, the rulers of China.  And when it comes to military nanotechnology, that
<br>
handful is enough to mess up the planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And why should I believe that it is even possible for a hand full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarians to birth this godling?  I would generally think such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievement could only be a capstone on the work of a the best minds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entire race.
</em><br>
<p>I used to think so to back when I wrote CaTAI 1.0.  By the time I got to PtS,
<br>
it was an open-sourced industry.  By the time I got to CaTAI 2.0, I was
<br>
thinking in terms of a private research project, say fifty to a hundred people
<br>
tops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But a part of me thinks that if the race cannot get itself together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to avoid destruction then it is no fit parent of a Power.  We,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sound just a bit like a form of escapism and the height of wishful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking?
</em><br>
<p>This sounds to me like romantic defeatism.  Humanity is up against a problem
<br>
that it has no a-priori reason to be capable of solving, a problem where a few
<br>
bad guys can mess up a planetful of good guys.  As for the Sysop being
<br>
designed by us, so what?  Clocks are designed by us but they don't war amongst
<br>
themselves.
