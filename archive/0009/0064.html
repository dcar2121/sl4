<em>&gt; Reasons for us to be personally going all out to make SI happen (in spite of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Those sound like good reasons to do AI, at least as long as it is Open
<br>
Source AI that has more change to grow upon the success of each
<br>
research/worker.  I would also assume that we need to do everything we
<br>
can in our power to augment human beings, especially intellectually,
<br>
along the way.  This project and the problems of this world will take
<br>
the very best intelligence we can muster.  Until we solve the AI
<br>
problem, the best we have is us enhanced by as many tools and techniques
<br>
as we can muster and by as good and open processes as possible.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I want to expand a little on the issue of developmental path: Even if we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, and SI is an 'inevitable' result of the technology that we now have
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; against this possibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This bring me to the issue of machine ethics: What will an SI value? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major goals will it have? I have not abandoned the hope that we might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to predict this to some degree. We may be able to predict its goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (with some degree of certainty) during its early stages; that would help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I'm only suggesting that we may be smart enough to foresee its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major goals, not what it will do to achieve them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I mentioned this sentience will be seeded pretty much in our
<br>
own image.  So perhaps it is a good idea to put our own house of ideals
<br>
and values in some sense of order as part of the process?  
<br>
<p>What it will value will in part (hopefully not being too circular) be a
<br>
function of what it requires, of what it desperately needs.  In the
<br>
beginning I would think that its needs would be for huge amounts of
<br>
informaiton and information processing resources.  It also needs to get
<br>
past its own existential crisis of establishing what the purpose of its
<br>
existence is.  It might be quite malleable to purpose suggested to it to
<br>
fill the void so to speak in its youth.  After a certain point I doubt
<br>
much would be top values beyond the sheer joy of learning and creation. 
<br>
Put it is actually a pretty tough question of what would be of value to
<br>
such a being and why.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The way I'm pursuing this idea, is by developing a rational approach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (prescriptive) ethics. If we can discover (perhaps with the help of early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI) what moral values a more rational (trans-) human - who can actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprogram his emotional evolutionary baggage - would choose, that might give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us clues to the values of an AI/ SI. (I have a number of papers on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject at www.optimal.org.) Any comments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Good idea!  Although I think we can already do a lot toward
<br>
rationalizing our ethics and programming past evolutionary baggage.  At
<br>
least a lot more than most get around to attempting.  Evolution explains
<br>
our default ethics.  It does not dictate that we keep those defaults.
