<p>
Many people have expressed fear of AI, particularly of Singularity-class
<br>
Superintelligent AI. This fear threads through much of science fiction in
<br>
one form or another. Even Vernor Vinge, the man who invented the techno
<br>
Singularity idea, does not express faith that this event will be necessarily
<br>
benign for humanity. He merely claims that it is inevitable and the outcome
<br>
*could be* positive.
<br>
<p>If this Singularity event is inevitable, but its precise nature and effect
<br>
upon humanity can be influenced by humanity during the time leading up to
<br>
the event, then I would call such an influence &quot;spinning the Singularity.&quot;
<br>
By way of analogy, I would compare the Singularity to a black hole. Like a
<br>
black hole, the Singularity presents an event horizon that we cannot peer
<br>
beyond. A black hole can be very useful for energy generation and even for
<br>
the operation of devices for travel via wormholes and perhaps even time
<br>
travel. But one needs to have some control over the black hole in order to
<br>
use it for these purposes. Such control can be exercised if the black hole
<br>
is a) rotating and b) electrically charged. So far as current physics goes,
<br>
it does not seem possible to make an existing black hole rotate or to give
<br>
it charge, but it does seem possible to induce these properties in an
<br>
incipient black hole (i.e., a mass contracting toward a singularity). As the
<br>
&quot;seed&quot; of the black hole is nurtured, so shall it go.
<br>
<p>Similarly, I would argue that a &quot;seed&quot; AI can be influenced - one might say,
<br>
given it a morally positive charge - so that it will grow into a benevolent
<br>
Superintelligence. Like a black hole during its formative phase, the
<br>
Superintelligence at the heart of the Singularity can be affected so that it
<br>
becomes not only benign for humanity but a positive boon beyond all
<br>
imagining.
<br>
<p>This seems to be what Eliezer has conceived and is working to implement. It
<br>
is a goal well worth supporting via his Institute. (Eliezer, when can we
<br>
start making donations?)
<br>

Do we need to fear the AI, especially a singularity class AI?  I'm not
<br>
sure. Eliezer argues that those fears are unfounded.  I am not yet
<br>
persuaded but I grant the possibility that the AI will be friendly at
<br>
least by the time it comes into human or greater intelligence.  If it
<br>
isn't friendly I doubt we could successfully stop it in any case.  So I
<br>
think we need to put quite a bit of work into doing what we can to
<br>
insure that the AI is friendly and trustworthy.
