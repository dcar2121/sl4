<p>
I've read most of the stuff at sysopmind.com over the last day or two. I
<br>
am of two (at least) minds about this work of bringing Singularity to
<br>
fruition quickly.  
<br>
<p>On the one had I fervently wish to be part of the creation of that much
<br>
Mind and, if possible, to join/upload into it and all of humanity with
<br>
me.  On the other hand none of us can in any way guarantee that that
<br>
outcome occurs even if we create the Singularity.  It could just as
<br>
likely be, &quot;The OverMind has decided that humans are hopelessly
<br>
miserable lifeforms and that they cannot be successfully uploaded into
<br>
an state that is much better.  Therefore the OverMind has decided to
<br>
terminate the species.  All praise to the OverMind!&quot; Or some such
<br>
equivalent.  
<br>
<p>In the plans and ideas I have seen thus far we cannot for certain rule
<br>
out this possibility.  This bothers me.  A lot.  Up to now my work has
<br>
been dedicated to improving the abilities and options of the human
<br>
species.  This includes possibly transforming it beyond any current
<br>
definition of &quot;human&quot;.  But it is a different thing altogether to be
<br>
working for the creation of what will become a Power that may or may not
<br>
include or be tolerant to humanity - that may actually destroy
<br>
humanity.  
<br>
<p>Even granted that this Power is a much higher sentience, I still feel as
<br>
if I am betraying humankind, betraying my own primary motives in working
<br>
to bring it about sometimes.  How do the rest of you deal with this? 
<br>
What am I missing? 
<br>
<p>I know that the Singularity is eventually inevitable for some
<br>
intelligent species and inevitable for us barring major disaster or some
<br>
totally unforeseen bottleneck.  But how can I be in a hurry to bring it
<br>
about and still claim I work for the good of humanity?
<br>
