<p>
Thanks to all for some interesting and helpful replies to my questions. 
<br>
I will give in turn my reactions, thoughts and resultants. It may be a
<br>
piece at a time.  Especially this one as I have to run back to the day
<br>
job.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; we as a race destroy ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>This is not understandable to me.  We are planning the creation of a
<br>
god, literally.  And our efforts may succeed or fail.  In our failure or
<br>
success we may still create something that destroys all of humanity and
<br>
may or not be whole or sane enough or self-healing enough to be any
<br>
great improvement over same.  We need to second guess ourselves quite a
<br>
lot I would think about whether what we are doing is the right thing,
<br>
about whether our methods lead to the right results, about our abilities
<br>
and about our reasons for being on this quest.  Even assuming all the
<br>
arguments for doing this are exactly correct, we, as the type of beings
<br>
we are, still need to question. If for nothing else than to self-check
<br>
periodically and to remind ourselves of what is the goal and why and to
<br>
be able to pull others into the work.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are you missing? The same thing we all are. The lack of sight beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wall of super-evolution that is the Singularity. How do we deal with it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't claim knowledge of how anyone else on this list sleeps at night with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the knowledge we have, but i go forward knowing that I must work for it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all available resources because there is no other choice. It IS inevitable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you said, and while there is the chance of the loss of the human race,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, there are myriad threats to our species. The Singularity, while itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a possible threat, is the ONLY way we can stop the other inevitability:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global self-genocide. We must not second guess ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I do not see yet that the Singularity is the ONLY way or alternately
<br>
that global self-genocide is inevitable UNLESS we create the
<br>
Singularity.  Another possible way is to condition, evangelize, teach
<br>
enough of humanity at least at enough of the key positions a different
<br>
way of seeing life and what they are doing such that the threat of
<br>
self-inflicted global catastrophe goes down.  Look where we are.  Used
<br>
rightly the technology within our grasp can literally turn this world
<br>
into a paradise beyond the dreams of mystics.  What stands in our way is
<br>
a lot of conditioning of tooth and claw, endless competition, endless
<br>
us/them and the quite limited general intelligence of the majority of
<br>
human beings and even of those of us who are the exceptions.  Technology
<br>
that increases effective intelligence (and I disagree all such is ruled
<br>
by the Law of Algernon) and that starts humans on self-growth toward a
<br>
attitude conducive to the wiser use of these tools, may well keep us
<br>
from self-destruction.  Some such technology is the growing list of
<br>
computer aids external and increasingly internal.  It is part of the
<br>
Transhuman/Extropian dream of evolving the race.  It is not a bad
<br>
dream.  Or at least I don't see why it is necessarily impossible.  And
<br>
it has the advantage of being quite inline with many current trends.
<br>
<p>Of course, the reasons to doubt that scenario are also many.  Mature
<br>
human minds are difficult to capture and difficult to reform.  There is
<br>
some evidence that something on the order of 50% of the population never
<br>
reached the mental development state of formal operations.  Due to
<br>
aspects of brain physiology there is reason to believe that if they
<br>
matured without reaching that stage then they never will unless and
<br>
until we can rewire brains at a pretty extreme level.  Yet these people
<br>
have just as much of a vote as you and I.   And of course, existing
<br>
centers of power will not all convert to a new way of thinking and
<br>
being.  Some of them will fight with great ferocity. If they lay hands
<br>
on some of the &quot;weapons of the gods&quot; then destruction may well ensue.  
<br>
<p>Dunno.  It just goes against my programming, it seems a bit like walking
<br>
away from the human race to do the alchemistic thing of huddling
<br>
together with a some like minded folks in front of our supercomputers
<br>
attempting to give birth to a god.  It both draws and repels me.  If I
<br>
become convinced it is in fact the ONLY way then my full energies will
<br>
go into the work.  If not then I must consider other options.  I
<br>
generally don't like putting all the eggs in one basket.
