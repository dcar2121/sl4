<p>
The answer is obvious after one reads the item below that I'm re-posting
<br>
from the Extropians list.
<br>
<p>The enemies of AI/SI (and even, I would daresay, augmented human
<br>
intelligence) are willing to do anything to stop us.
<br>
<p>I can only compare this scenario to the Biblical myth of King Herod ordering
<br>
all male children under 2 years old to be killed because he feared that one
<br>
of them was the Messiah who had been prophesied to rule all Israel.
<br>
<p>I wonder how many men, women and machines the anti-AI/SI people would be
<br>
willing to destroy in order to try to prevent the inevitable?
<br>
<p>I can imagine these anti-progressives standing among the radioactive ruins
<br>
of the new civilization that they stopped aborning (temporarily, at least).
<br>
I can hear them paraphrasing the US Army lieutenant in Vietnam who said &quot;We
<br>
had to destroy the village in order to save it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>

Subject: Re: Why would AI want to be friendly?
<br>
<p>EUGENE SAID: &quot;...AI@home type of projects using above technologies
<br>
should be outlawed....&quot;
<br>
<p>CYMM SAYS: Eugene it won't work. Betcha writing hyperintelligent AI is more
<br>
addictive than heroin. If you can't stop people from writing klutzy computer
<br>
viruses - how are you going to stop them from writing AI?
<br>
<p>And ...AI doesn't have to be very smart to be ultra destructive. The human
<br>
authour just has to be a psychopath, is all.
<br>
<p>EUGENE SAID: &quot;...If I knew someone is about to succeed in building a &gt;H AI
<br>
or a gray goo autoreplicator before we're ready for it, despite an universal
<br>
moratorium I would nuke him without a second thought.
<br>
<p>CYMM SAYS: If he were a physical &amp; sovereign state, maybe. But such a
<br>
strategy hasn't been deployed with the drug production of Andean South
<br>
America... and I daresay it never will. Far less for, say, 20,000 or so 21
<br>
year olds scattered through university dorms and living rooms the world
<br>
over.
<br>
<p>If it's possible - then humans may have to live with its inevitability.
<br>
<p>You may even see a whole cult of mind hackers by 2010. Whole multi terabyte
<br>
hard drives (...or whatever...) with seriously camouflage-encrypted binaries
<br>
that are decrypted on the fly. The cult of superhuman intelligence is
<br>
enthralling... once it is practically realizeable - it will become a
<br>
religion.
<br>
<p>Do you think you can fight religion? And win?
<br>
<p>You're talking about the &quot;Artilect Wars&quot; all over again. But this is a
<br>
dirty, Vietnam-style war.... where people defend their God-given &quot;right&quot; to
<br>
create God with a seething, righteous passion. Should be fun if you're into
<br>
war.
