<em>&gt; &gt; I do not believe that we as singularitarians have the option of being &quot;of

<em>&gt; &gt; can't afford the time or divisive mindset this might bring about. If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doubt the work in front of us, the Singularity might not be reached before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we as a race destroy ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need to second guess ourselves quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot I would think about whether what we are doing is the right thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about whether our methods lead to the right results, about our abilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and about our reasons for being on this quest.
</em><br>
<p>I also have to disagree, at least with Gabriel's phrasing.  That what we do is
<br>
so incredibly important does not excuse us from critical thinking; rather, it
<br>
makes self-questioning mandatory.  But only on the level of beliefs, not of
<br>
actions.  We cannot afford to be certain, or to blunt our own perceptions, but
<br>
we cannot afford to be hesitant either.  We certainly cannot afford to
<br>
ostentatiously pretend to be more uncertain then we really are, for the sake
<br>
of transhumanist correctness.
<br>
<p>I find that it is possible to easily blend fanaticism and uncertainty - the
<br>
fact that the probability of an assertion is not 100% doesn't have to
<br>
automatically sequit to lessened enthusiasm, so long as the particular course
<br>
of action is still rationally the best available.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another possible way is to condition, evangelize, teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough of humanity at least at enough of the key positions a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of seeing life and what they are doing such that the threat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-inflicted global catastrophe goes down.
</em><br>
<p>This is improbable to the point of vanishment.  At least AI is an engineering
<br>
project.  You're talking about bringing about a basic change in the nature of
<br>
all humanity, enough so that NOBODY starts a nanowar, and doing it without
<br>
ultratechnology and without violating ethics.  I just don't see this
<br>
happening.  It looks to me like if you started a massive project with a
<br>
hundred billion dollars worth of funding, intended to educate humanity, you
<br>
might become a big media sensation but you would not accomplish enough to save
<br>
the world.  Not even close.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It just goes against my programming, it seems a bit like walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from the human race to do the alchemistic thing of huddling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together with a some like minded folks in front of our supercomputers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to give birth to a god.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is pretty much what we're doing.  Humanity can sort itself out
<br>
afterwards, after we're no longer tap-dancing across a minefield and we have
<br>
some decent tools.
<br>
<p>The Universe would be a great place if there was a human way to solve this
<br>
human problem.  There isn't, and we have to resort to AI.  That's pretty much
<br>
all there is to it.
