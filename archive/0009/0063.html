<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I also have to disagree, at least with Gabriel's phrasing.  That what we do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so incredibly important does not excuse us from critical thinking; rather, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes self-questioning mandatory.  But only on the level of beliefs, not of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions.  We cannot afford to be certain, or to blunt our own perceptions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot afford to be hesitant either.  We certainly cannot afford to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ostentatiously pretend to be more uncertain then we really are, for the sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transhumanist correctness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What does &quot;correctness&quot; have to do with any of the positions expressed? 
<br>
I think we are basically in agreement that simply staying honest is
<br>
important.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I find that it is possible to easily blend fanaticism and uncertainty - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that the probability of an assertion is not 100% doesn't have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically sequit to lessened enthusiasm, so long as the particular course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of action is still rationally the best available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  My brand of fanaticism is a pretty scary thing.  I am one of
<br>
those rare people who can turn my life inside out and work 16 hours a
<br>
day for long stetches when I am truly fanatic about something.  But it
<br>
burns me out pretty badly, especially as I get older.  So I tend to
<br>
avoid it except for things I am really certain are that pressing.  I am
<br>
not yet  convinced going full tilt for Singularity is the best course.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Another possible way is to condition, evangelize, teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough of humanity at least at enough of the key positions a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way of seeing life and what they are doing such that the threat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-inflicted global catastrophe goes down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is improbable to the point of vanishment.  At least AI is an engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project.  You're talking about bringing about a basic change in the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all humanity, enough so that NOBODY starts a nanowar, and doing it without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultratechnology and without violating ethics.  I just don't see this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening.  It looks to me like if you started a massive project with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred billion dollars worth of funding, intended to educate humanity, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might become a big media sensation but you would not accomplish enough to save
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world.  Not even close.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually I was talking about an engineering project also, memetic
<br>
engineering.  You would not have to convert all of humanity.  Just a
<br>
high enough percentage of the most powerful and influential.  The meme
<br>
system I would try to inculcate is that humanity can have pretty much
<br>
all of the things promised by all the pie in the sky there ever was, if
<br>
it can embrace the science and technology that will make it so and put
<br>
aside the old-style conditioning that prevents it from make this world a
<br>
place of plenty and of peace for all people.  Right now, very few voices
<br>
are putting out such a message.  Whether or not it is enough, and I
<br>
doubt it is, I think it is very important that those memes become well
<br>
planted for what is to come.  For that matter I am not sure if it is
<br>
possible for people seeding and laying the foundational basis for a
<br>
Singularity to do a decent job without having pretty much that memetic
<br>
imprint and passing it on.   Just a thought.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It just goes against my programming, it seems a bit like walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; away from the human race to do the alchemistic thing of huddling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; together with a some like minded folks in front of our supercomputers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attempting to give birth to a god.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, this is pretty much what we're doing.  Humanity can sort itself out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards, after we're no longer tap-dancing across a minefield and we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some decent tools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Universe would be a great place if there was a human way to solve this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human problem.  There isn't, and we have to resort to AI.  That's pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all there is to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Show me.  You are making a level of assertion that I assume has very
<br>
well
<br>
thought through logic behind it.  I need more of the logic.  The
<br>
assertion
<br>
by itself is not enough.
<br>
<p>And why should I believe that it is even possible for a hand full of
<br>
Singularitarians to birth this godling?  I would generally think such an
<br>
achievement could only be a capstone on the work of a the best minds of
<br>
the entire race.  It is not the type of project I would expect a small
<br>
cabal to 
<br>
succeed at.  This AI is going to be starving for input, for information,
<br>
for tools.  It will take more than this cabal to feed and nourish it
<br>
until it can feed itself.  Yes, that is a ways down the road.  
<br>
<p>But a part of me thinks that if the race cannot get itself together
<br>
enough to avoid destruction then it is no fit parent of a Power.  We,
<br>
who cannot deal with and take care of one another, dream of creating a
<br>
magic Genie who will, despite being originally designed by us and in our
<br>
image, care for us and fix all of our problems and brokenness?  Doesn't
<br>
that sound just a bit like a form of escapism and the height of wishful
<br>
thinking?  
<br>
<p>If my 20 years of being a software goddess has taught me anything it has
<br>
taught me that regardless of how bright you are and how dedicated you
<br>
are, that one or a few people can only do so much in so much time.  Even
<br>
goddesses have their limits.  Yet here we are acting as if a relatively
<br>
closed cabal (not even Open Source for instance) can hack together the
<br>
very philsopher's stone of Computer Science and far beyond.  I believe
<br>
several near-impossibilities before breakfast but it is hard for me to
<br>
make this project fully real and doable in my mind.  And if I get fully
<br>
involved I must make it real.  It is my nature.  If I get involved I
<br>
will see this thing succeed or die (well. maybe except for my head)
<br>
trying.  I don't for a minute think this is a project that has a prayer
<br>
of succeeding without that level of dedication.    The question is
<br>
whether it has a prayer even with it and whether it is, as Eliezer says,
<br>
simply the only reasonable thing to do.
