</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the characterization  is actually incomplete but nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admits this methinks).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's wrong with me *wanting* or finding desirable an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI that does respect property rights?  Or at least---this is
</em><br>
<p>Nothing is wrong with wanting that. I was talking about the actual task 
<br>
of figuring out what intelligence is and building that; property rights 
<br>
and such are secondary, they are not properties of being intelligent as 
<br>
far as we know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; All of these layers -- ai domination, property rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; governments, these are just  layers on top of the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agents, and these layers are by no means 'magical', they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be created, recreated, destroyed, and most importantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; redesigned, and they tend to show up on their own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The way we always talk past each other is like this:  you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue on one &quot;level of practicality&quot; and I argue on another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't seem to see traditions and societal inertia as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a real force to be reckoned with and against which only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *so much really is possible*!   You always say, well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;we could do  this&quot; or &quot;we could do that&quot; or &quot;what's to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep us from DIO&quot;  (the plural, I guess of DIY).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I always argue on a different level, namely, that there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *definitely* be no overnight change in people's attitudes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor in those who are in charge (say in America, for instance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see that as a constraint, and you never do.  So we talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past each other.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you illustrate this talking-past phenomena when you're more or less 
<br>
pairing DOI against &quot;overnight change&quot;. One does not need overnight 
<br>
change for DOI. Who else is going to do it? Santa? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Look at all the random micronations, perhaps. Anyway, these layers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can be likened to onion layers, which are wrapped around the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing that we are all interested in here -- intelligence, i.e. that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person walking around with a skull and all of those silly social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dynamics issues that we don't really care about. We're here for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever the hell that intelligence is. All of the hypotheticals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about implementation of an ai dominated society are ridiculous --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it doesn't actually have anything to do with intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since this has to be about the Nth time around here, give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me a hand.  Why do we keep talking past each other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you dismiss entirely *out of hand*  the *possibility*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an adverse AI takeover?  In other words, when I ask again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I always do, WHY IS IT RIDICULOUS, for some reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your answer just goes right by me. Look deeper.  What am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failing to see?  What about my position are you failing to see?
</em><br>
<p>No, it's not that it's impossible, I'm disagreeing that it's such a big 
<br>
issue. Yes, I am aware of the arguments for computronium conversion, 
<br>
malicious ai, and so on, and I've mentioned various solutions to the 
<br>
problems that we are worrying about, like people and them dying. So, 
<br>
what's so ridiculous is that we have to consider those things when 
<br>
building intelligence. Yes, I am aware of 'byproducts', and that's 
<br>
certainly a worthwhile consideration, but we can solve those problems 
<br>
anyway, so why is everyone still debating ai within the context of 
<br>
dominiator scnearios when we know that there are solutions swimming 
<br>
about in our minds? So instead of focusing on those issues, let's get 
<br>
to work, eh? <a href="http://heybryan.org/buildingbrains.html">http://heybryan.org/buildingbrains.html</a> 
<br>
<a href="http://heybryan.org/humancortex.html">http://heybryan.org/humancortex.html</a> (I just added this one today), and 
<br>
<a href="http://heybryan.org/recursion">http://heybryan.org/recursion</a> (the classic).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Whether or not people happen to not know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to live isn't the issue (in truth, nobody does anyway); if you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; afraid people will die, fine, let's go engineer solutions to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems, but let's not mix it up with the task of ai engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and design. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There you go again.  &quot;Let's go engineer solutions.&quot;  When, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afternoon?  Later this evening?  Actually, my next two weekends
</em><br>
<p>Next few seconds. What's your number again? Nevermind, I have it. I'll 
<br>
call you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; are booked, so I'll have to put off supplying myself and everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else an immortality drug until late August.  What the devil do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think De Grey and many, many others like him---far, far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable than I am of &quot;let's go engineer solutions to aging&quot;---are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing?  They *are* trying.  And I cannot believe that you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;we&quot;---whoever that is---can do it for them.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I've read all of Aubrey's papers*, all the ones that I could find 
<br>
at least, and I'm completely supporting his efforts, but that's not 
<br>
everything that we could be doing. If you'll remember, one of his 
<br>
visions is to eventually have these immortality take-off velocity farms 
<br>
where we have animals that are slightly older than ourselves (always) 
<br>
to make sure we're testing the next generation don't-die-tech on 
<br>
them :-). So, that's an interesting idea, yes, but there's also some 
<br>
other options that can help out when we're exploring the chemical 
<br>
possibility space, such as mentioned on <a href="http://biohack.sf.net/">http://biohack.sf.net/</a> and 
<br>
<a href="http://heybryan.org/new_exp.html">http://heybryan.org/new_exp.html</a> -- such as having the biotechnology 
<br>
equipment distributed to whoever wants to try it out themselves and 
<br>
maybe manage a few projects of their own, which makes for this very 
<br>
giant filter as more people start checking it out and what they might 
<br>
be able to do (it also has other important benefits, like the potential 
<br>
benefit of homebrew (prescription!) drugs (insulin? :-))). 
<br>
<p>* <a href="http://heybryan.org/transhuman/">http://heybryan.org/transhuman/</a> has my notes on Aubrey's papers,
<br>
<a href="http://heybryan.org/transhuman/Aubrey.zip">http://heybryan.org/transhuman/Aubrey.zip</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; doing?  They *are* trying.  And I cannot believe that you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;we&quot;---whoever that is---can do it for them.
</em><br>
<p>Do you know Aubrey's story? He started off as a computer science guy, 
<br>
somewhere in Silicon Valley. To my knowledge, the story goes that he 
<br>
became unsatisfied with the prospects of death, and decided to look 
<br>
into it, so he has his map and engineering plans, yeah. So he's a 
<br>
person too, he's not magical (OR IS HE?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm surprised that by now you aren't starting to be just a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; frustrated by how your own impeccably logical ideas don't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; be affecting thousands, yet alone millions, of fellow Americans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; They just look at things differently. Evolution takes a long, long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am not confused.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry.  I really wasn't being satirical, even though it probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounded like it.  No, I mean that if there were 10^5 people just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you on Mars, then indeed you all would very shortly bring to fruition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your various good ideas and schemes.  But you're living in a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 300 million rather relatively conservative folk who just aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to let you do whatever you want, and who aren't going to listen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;good sense&quot; (as defined by Bryan and Lee).
</em><br>
<p>I am not counting on 300 million people listening to &quot;good sense&quot;. I 
<br>
still don't get what you are saying though.
<br>
<p>- Bryan
