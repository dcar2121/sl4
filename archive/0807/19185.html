<em>&gt; &gt;  ...

<em>&gt; &gt; Believe me, entities from the future will want more, and more that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot quite conceive of.  Even someone from 1750,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given a tedious job at McDonald's today would want to ask,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;what need is there of anything else---life would be perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in such a society with such an easy job&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We or our replacements may still have the human urge to never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be satisfied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is true because our brains, alas, have not changed one bit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cave man days. Even if we all had Santa Claus machines we might still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covet our neighbour's unique objects, land and raw materials. But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial change will come when we are able to rewrite our own source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code. If you can see that the attempt to satisfy a desire will lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble, then change the desire or declare it satisfied by fiat.
</em><br>
<p>This is true not because there aren't currently ways to be satisfied, but 
<br>
because people don't choose to be satisfied.  (Not true for all people, but 
<br>
it doesn't *need* to be true for all people.)
<br>
<p>The problem is real because a small minority who choose to never be satisfied 
<br>
without *more* is sufficient to use any finite quantity of resources, 
<br>
provided only that they have some means of acquisition.  Desire for control 
<br>
and property doesn't have the same built-in limitation that desire for food 
<br>
does (and I say this as someone who needs to lose weight).  One can only eat 
<br>
so much food in a day.  Even so, some people hoard, but generally even 
<br>
hoarders have limits as to how much they want to hoard.  (Not necessarily.  I 
<br>
recall reading about a pair of hamsters found in Belgium a few years ago with 
<br>
a hoard of over a ton of grain.  I suspect that their family had been living 
<br>
in the same place for a long time...but I don't know.)
<br>
<p>The thing is, just because YOU can see that someone is thinking incorrectly 
<br>
doesn't mean that THEY will see the same thing.  Perhaps they will.  I can 
<br>
tell that I need to lose weight, and so I must be thinking incorrectly about 
<br>
food, at least some of the time.  Don't seem to be able to do anything about 
<br>
it.  But if I could, and it was reasonably easy, I would.  But an anorexic 
<br>
doesn't see that they have invalid values.  Sometimes it's possible to teach 
<br>
them that they do, but they actually see themselves as fat while starving to 
<br>
death, so they don't WANT to change their minds.
