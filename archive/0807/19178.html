<em>&gt;&gt; The thing hardly qualifies as an AI if it doesn't have the ontology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of a three year old. And if an AI can understand what trees, cars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tablespoons, and about twenty thousand other items are---that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can reliably classify them from either sight (pictures) or feel---then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it's going to know what a human being is, though (just as with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any of us) it will be undecided about some borderline cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One doesn't start out knowing about the world.  One learns about it.  A three 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year old may have ontologies and know about object persistence, but a new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born doesn't, and presumably you aren't doing basic restructuring after it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes intelligent (i.e., when you're through writing it), only before hand.
</em><br>
<p>Babies are really complicated. We have to be careful not to 
<br>
extrapolate too much.  But the baby brain is still growing
<br>
very quickly, and for a long time. It could be that it acquires
<br>
its ontological beliefs *as* it's getting smarter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So that nascent AI has the capability to learn about cars, trees, people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc., but that knowledge isn't built in.  Therefore the goals that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built-in need to be created without reference to such things...except to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend that you rely on &quot;imprinting&quot; (which can produce results that are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit iffy).
</em><br>
<p>Here, I don't know what the general received wisdom on this list
<br>
is about this issue, and I'll gladly defer to it.  But I *thought* that
<br>
there really isn't so much to the idea of high intelligence in the 
<br>
complete absence of knowledge (and I do mean *complete*).
<br>
Okay, I may have to concede (but am not doing so yet) that
<br>
a nascent AI may know nothing but has a fantastic ability to
<br>
learn, and so by that measure is already intelligent.
<br>
<p>But the way *I* use the term, it's not intelligent yet, and it certainly
<br>
is not the subject of our &quot;AI domination&quot; scenarios, as Bryan likes
<br>
to call them.  The only AIs we have to worry about are those who
<br>
have learned enough about the world to be dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This makes creating a set of goals that will result in an AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's both friendly and useful a bit tricky...and I say this without even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having tried it once.
</em><br>
<p>What?  You haven't created any AI's yet?  Funny, I thought 
<br>
everyone here had at least a couple of successfully completed 
<br>
superhuman intelligences to his credit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Partially because the exact form that such goals would take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are highly dependent upon the exact internal structure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind  of the nascent AI.)
</em><br>
<p>My most likely guess---again I defer to the old hands here and
<br>
invite even their one-line opinions---is that a program, or an
<br>
evolving set of AI programs, rather---begins by being extremely
<br>
&quot;stupid&quot;, and only gradually over time evolve high intelligence.
<br>
This is done---and to me, mostly likely---has to be done 
<br>
concurrently with knowledge acquisition.
