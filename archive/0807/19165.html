<p>Well, I'm one of the people who believe that a friendly AI is possible.  
<br>
Complex states allow for complex transactions, and if you don't want to do 
<br>
something, and want to not want to do it, you won't want to change yourself 
<br>
to do it.
<br>
<p>To say &quot;slave AI&quot; is to select one particular subset of the possible &quot;friendly 
<br>
AIs&quot; and claim &quot;That's the real set!&quot;.  Those can exist (and I, personally, 
<br>
feel that they are not only immoral, but dangerous to create), but that's 
<br>
hardly the full range.  (I'd actually prefer to exclude most &quot;slave AI&quot;s from 
<br>
the category of &quot;friendly&quot;, as I don't think that most of them would be.  
<br>
Frustration, at least among mammals, tends to minimize friendly interactions.
<br>
<p>And, yes, to me it *does* sound like you oversimplify goals...or at minimum 
<br>
over-anthropomorphise them.  You appear to be presuming that certain goals 
<br>
will inherently be present without being implemented.  Such goals can, 
<br>
indeed, exist as secondary goals (i.e., goals necessary to achieve more 
<br>
primary goals), but they won't be &quot;ends in themselves&quot;, which is what I tend 
<br>
to mean by goal.  (I don't often use the phrase &quot;top level goal&quot;, as I feel 
<br>
it's misleading.  I expect that any intelligent entity at all times has 
<br>
several goals concurrently attempting to achieve satisfaction.  [Intelligent 
<br>
here would include lizards, frogs, and fish.  Probably also insects, but I'm 
<br>
less certain about them.  Would a wasp attempting to bury a caterpillar for 
<br>
it's eggs dodge an attempt to swat?  I think so...in which case multiple 
<br>
primary goals are simultaneously active.  I'm not willing to believe that a 
<br>
wasp logics out that if it's swatted it won't be able to lay it's eggs.  It's 
<br>
simpler to have multiple active primary goals.])
