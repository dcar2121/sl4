2008/7/8 BillK &lt;<a href="mailto:pharos@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Property%20rights">pharos@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is not 'deriving satisfaction'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that was the problem, let's just derive satisfaction by itself and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget about the 'doing stuff' bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is competitive gaining of power and resources.
</em><br>
<p>A person engages in some behaviour such as the pursuit of power and
<br>
resources because he expects to get some reward from it. This reward
<br>
may have several components: a warm inner glow from being top dog, a
<br>
feeling of security, the opportunity to torture his enemies, whatever.
<br>
Some components of the reward relate to the goal being considered
<br>
intrinsically worthwhile while others are simply ends in themselves.
<br>
The point of using drugs of dependence is usually just to get the
<br>
pleasant feeling, and the behaviour itself has no intrinsic value. The
<br>
point of going to the dentist is that it is considered desirable to
<br>
have good teeth, and the experience of having a filling is usually not
<br>
in itself enjoyable.
<br>
<p>If the person pursuing power and resources considers that
<br>
intrinsically worthwhile, he won't modify his mind to get the same
<br>
reward for nothing, since that would lead him away from his goal. If
<br>
he considers another activity even more intrinsically worthwhile, but
<br>
would in his natural state rather not pursue it because its net reward
<br>
is less, then he would modify his mind to make that activity more
<br>
rewarding. For example, if he thinks using his acquired wealth for
<br>
philanthropic purposes would be better than than using it for
<br>
self-indulgent sensual pleasure, but philanthropy isn't as much fun,
<br>
then he could modify his mind so that philanthropy is *more* fun.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I am overly optimistic, but I like to think that if mind
<br>
modification were freely available the net effect from people choosing
<br>
to make themselves better would outweigh the effect from people
<br>
choosing to make themselves worse. There might still be a hard core of
<br>
bad people, but there would be fewer of them, and they would be easier
<br>
to resist.
