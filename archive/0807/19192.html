<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, very good.  Exactly.  However, I wonder if those who won't change, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so will still want to covet their neighbor's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; status, unique possessions, or resources  will gain the upper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hand evolutionarily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Another form of saying the same thing might be that the urge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to dominate is probably an ESS.  I don't like this, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have any idea of what to do about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same sense of fairness that leads you to remove your desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominate others may also lead you to bolster your resolve not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated yourself and to help others who under threat of domination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a third party. Thus if everyone has the ability to self-modify it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be both easier to resist and harder to indulge your wicked urges,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making for a salubrious equilibrium where everyone is nice to everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, and everyone is happy being nice to everyone else.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like an individual solution to a collective action problem -
<br>
i.e. don't count on it. There's far too many ways it can go wrong,
<br>
especially if we add evolution to the mix.
<br>
<p>Lee mentioned governments a few posts ago. The only justification of
<br>
governments is to solve collective action problems (violence being the
<br>
king of these problems so far in human history; out of control
<br>
evolutionary arms races might be the king issue after a singularity).
<br>
I feel we underestimate the importance of this, because we live in a
<br>
world saturated by governments (certainly in terms of GDP), so most of
<br>
the collective action problems that can be solved have been solved.
<br>
And a solved problem does not attract attention.
<br>
<p>So purely individual solutions to these sort of problems strike me as
<br>
very unlikely. It seems that people's desciptions of a post
<br>
singularity world always boost the aspects that make individuals more
<br>
autonomous (total information, extreme mobility, etc...) while
<br>
minimising those that would make them more dependent (advances in
<br>
offensive weaponry, viral invarsions and the need to defend against
<br>
them, finiteness of ressources, fast evolution filling the world with
<br>
competing copies, hacks to make other minds more malleable, etc...)
<br>
<p>So, despite the arguments here, a society of humans able to modify
<br>
their minds at will is probably not going to gravitate to something
<br>
pleasant. On the other hand, it might not take much in terms of
<br>
coercive interventions to allow such things to happen. In fact, it may
<br>
be enough for the AI to gift humans with many technologies, push them
<br>
in certain self-modifying directions, and then turn itself off, to
<br>
create a positive dynamic equilibirum.
