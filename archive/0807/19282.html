<em>&gt; &gt; Another possible scenario is that once we have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology to reprogram
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our brains (either in-place or uploaded), that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fraction of humans won't go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; along. The brain is programmed to find the state x
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that maximizes utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; U(x). In this state, any perception or thought will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unpleasant because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would result in a different mental state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To say the brain is &quot;programmed&quot; to do anything really stretches the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphor; and more importantly, the fact that this is intuitively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undesirable suggests that the human utility function, to the extent such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing exists, is over histories rather than timeslices. (At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least the 'utility function' of the subself writing this -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other subselves might have preferences over timeslices.)
</em><br>
<p>You're right, utility = accumulated reward. Substitute happiness = dU/dt and my argument is the same. My point is that having a magic genie that will grant all you wishes (1) won't make you any happier and (2) will result in a degenerate mental state. Evolution will favor those who don't succumb to the temptation, if not everyone does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The fraction that realizes utopia = death, who realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that evolution is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smarter than you are, will be the ones that pass on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their genes. There is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good reason that humans fear death and then die, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not all of us realize it (including SIAI, it seems).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ?
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with SIAI that we should be &quot;working toward&quot; a singularity, with their tempting but false utopian view of uploading and immortality. It confuses what is best in our ethical system with what is best for the species (e.g. <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/16/transhumanism-as-simplified-humanism/">http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/16/transhumanism-as-simplified-humanism/</a> )
<br>
<p>Agents that can reprogram themselves cannot be the dominant intelligence for two reasons. I just gave one. The other is the lack of non-evolutionary models of RSI. It would be an important advance if we could discover such a model, for example, a proof that P != NP or a provably secure cryptosystem with short keys (so that agents could test their offspring). But I think such a model is unlikely and we should prepare for that outcome.
