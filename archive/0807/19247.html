If the intelligence of an selfimproving AI is on the rise, exponentially,
<br>
why would it ever wanna 'merge' with another AI?
<br>
Or are we imagining that there's an upper limit to the capacity of an AI
<br>
where it makes a case of diminishing returns to throw more hardware at it,
<br>
that the design simply cannot(even hand crafted by an uber AI) scale beyond
<br>
some level. In extension of that we imagine that it might make sense to
<br>
cluster these things to go beyond the single-ai instance performance.
<br>
Is that what we're talking about here? :-)

<p><em>&gt; Consider two (contemporary) corporations that want to cooperate with each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other for mutual gain. They have two general options, trade or merge, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the choice can be seen as a tradeoff between different kinds of overhead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs. For trading, these include bargaining, contract enforcement, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missed opportunities due to asymmetric information. Merging avoids some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these, but increases agency costs (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It occurs to me that two AIs who want to cooperate with each other face the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same choices, but merging might be a much more attractive option for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In case it's not obvious, &quot;merging&quot; here means something like creating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third AI that will try to optimize a weighted average of the two AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility functions, and then transferring all information and physical assets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this new AI. The reason that merging is more attractive is that trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still retains the same transaction costs, but merging doesn't incurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetual agency costs. Instead, each of the original AIs only need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verify during initial construction of the new AI that it will in fact try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimize the agreed upon utility function. (This seems much easier than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proving or verifying what source code an existing AI is running.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this analysis is correct, it may be that any society of AIs will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntarily merge into a singleton, in order to maximize gains from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperation. This singleton will then try to maximize a weighted average of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of the original AIs' utility functions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about other kinds of minds, for whom merging may not be possible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if they are capable of self-modification, a group of such minds can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree to modify themselves to each maximize a common combined utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function, and that should work just as well as merging, as long as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement can be enforced and verified (say with the help of a trusted third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party). This seems to imply that the ability to self-modify will lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntary borgification, but this process may stop short of a singleton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (because when there are only two such &quot;borgs&quot; left, who will act as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusted third party?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This line of argument may seem to depend on the assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence==optimization process, which is something I've previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argued against [1]. However, it may be that an intelligence, once it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfies all of its goals that can not be modeled as an optimization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process (such as finding answers to the philosophical questions in [1]), the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on remaining goals can be seen as an optimization process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (For nit-picking decision theorists, please take &quot;maximize combined utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function&quot; to mean &quot;maximize expected utility under a linear combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual priors and a linear combination of the individual utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions.)
