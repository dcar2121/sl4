2008/7/9 Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@rawbw.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Property%20rights">lcorbin@rawbw.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I agree with this appraisal, but I think the problem is at bottom due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to human psychology rather than particular cultural and historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; factors. Utopian projects will fail because they don't take into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; account the fact that people are greedy, lazy, dishonest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inconsiderate. Few people *want* to be this way, but they can't help
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it. Like drug addiction, they know that it's bad and they keep doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it anyway because it makes them feel good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not only that, but it's in their *immediate* (if not long term)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest to continue to &quot;be practical&quot;.  If everyone else around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you is taking bribes, and those who do not get beaten up, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just easier to go with the flow.  My own martyrdom capacity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, is extremely limited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but if they could feel just as good doing something that in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ideal world they consider positive, why wouldn't they? There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is huge pressure for people to be good even now that being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; good is often difficult and being bad can be so tempting: how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much greater would the pressure be if it were just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; trivial exercise to make good more attractive than bad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But take even very honest, good, and idealistic politicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today in some country with a long history.  (Italian history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is twice as long as American history, for one example, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New York history is twice as long as California history.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those new politicians *must* learn the system, *must*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn to compromise their principles, and *must* learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exchange morally dubious favors.
</em><br>
<p>But everyone can see that it's morally dubious, even those who profit
<br>
from it. If this weren't so then no-one would make efforts to conceal
<br>
it and, by definition, it wouldn't be corruption. So there is a core
<br>
of ethical principles common to almost everyone, even those who
<br>
routinely flout them. I speculate that given this, the free
<br>
availability of mind modification (changing one's own desires,
<br>
including second and higher order desires) would bring about a
<br>
fundamental change in society even if all else remained equal, and
<br>
that this would be a change for the better. We can't be certain what
<br>
would happen: that would be like trying to foresee modern financial
<br>
markets before the concept of money had ever been tried. In any case,
<br>
it is a very interesting and important idea which as far as I am aware
<br>
has received no more than passing consideration in either fiction or
<br>
non-fiction.
