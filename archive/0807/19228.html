<p>
I have two concerns-- one is one that I've voiced before--- simply,
<br>
can any machine emulate itself perfectly? The concern I have is that
<br>
if a machine can apparently emulate itself, then it has free capacity
<br>
and is not completely emulating itself (i.e. it would have to emulate
<br>
itself emulating itself, which of course eventually runs into
<br>
problems.) It is important here to keep in mind the question of
<br>
whether a machine with spare capacity would behave in the same way as
<br>
a machine running at close to maximum capacity or not.  I suspect that
<br>
two machines of similar complexity and capacity would run into a
<br>
parallel concern.
<br>
<p>Secondly, if the first concern turns out not to be a problem, then
<br>
there is the obvious concern of, well, the source code contributes a
<br>
fairly negligible component of overall complexity to the SI in
<br>
question (analogous to our DNA's contribution), and sharing the source
<br>
code would perhaps yield some insight to the behaviour of that
<br>
particular machine, but would not lead to superrationality. We would
<br>
need to also convey the sum total of all input that the machine has
<br>
received since activation. Perhaps we could consider this to be part
<br>
of the 'source code' but then of course its not really source code in
<br>
the way that we normally construe it to be-- again, this is a
<br>
distinction I've raised here before-- are our common metaphors
<br>
'memory' 'processing' 'storage' 'code' even suitable here?
