2008/7/8 Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@rawbw.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Property%20rights">lcorbin@rawbw.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely, you must admit, it depends on the capabilities of the individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who emerge from the history at a particular point.  Probably even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural aspects of their historical situation determine just as much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I posit that in many cases the people simply are not capable of self-rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or are absolutely too unprepared for it by their own cultural history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We also can surely judge that this was the case in many historical societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're aware of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even today in the United States, I see many shortcomings on the part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of so many individuals that it precludes a completely libertarian form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of government from functioning here.  Americans (and many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descendants of western civilization around the globe) are indeed capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quite a bit, but a strict anarchy, minarchy, or perhaps even mild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society is presently beyond them, I sadly conclude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For in too many cases in such a completely free society, collectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would simply naturally evolve, and pretty soon any prudent person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would find it necessary to suck up to the local gang lord or protector.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In America, we saw exactly what happens in large cities filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent immigrants (e.g. Chicago in the 1920s) or with people whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small town experiences of democracy were insufficient to meet the challenges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of urban life. It became very easy for criminal elements to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infiltrate the local law establishment, and even coerce newspapers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others into seeing things their way.  And today in Los Angeles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you want to really know who controls a neighborhood or controls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the streets, very often it's by no means the police or any lawfully set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this appraisal, but I think the problem is at bottom due
<br>
to human psychology rather than particular cultural and historical
<br>
factors. Utopian projects will fail because they don't take into
<br>
account the fact that people are greedy, lazy, dishonest and
<br>
inconsiderate. Few people *want* to be this way, but they can't help
<br>
it. Like drug addiction, they know that it's bad and they keep doing
<br>
it anyway because it makes them feel good. But if they could feel just
<br>
as good doing something that in their ideal world they consider
<br>
positive, why wouldn't they? There is huge pressure for people to be
<br>
good even now that being good is often difficult and being bad can be
<br>
so tempting: how much greater would the pressure be if it were just a
<br>
trivial exercise to make good more attractive than bad?
<br>
<p>To take your particular example, how would the gangsters have managed
<br>
to corrupt police if the police had been able to render themselves
<br>
immune any temptations they might have been offered? How would they
<br>
have been able to keep the local population cowered if cowering could
<br>
be turned off at will? How would they have been able to recruit
<br>
employees, or indeed how would they have got into the profession
<br>
themselves, if it were possible to *just decide* to derive as much
<br>
satisfaction from doing something more socially acceptable and less
<br>
risky?
