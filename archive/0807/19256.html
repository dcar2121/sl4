<em>&gt; &gt;If one SI had the details of how the

<em>&gt; &gt;other was historically constructed; if she has access to the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;memory of the other, the physical makeup, follows her subroutines, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is convinced that the source code is robust against being overthrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by a secret command of the type above, then trust may be possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Entity A could prove to entity B that it has source code S by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consenting to be replaced by a new entity A' that was constructed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing process jointly monitored by A and B.  During this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, both A and B observe that A' is constructed to run source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code S.  After A' is constructed, A shuts down and gives all of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to A'.
</em><br>
<p>But A cannot know if S is its own source code. (I assume that S includes current state information needed to make a copy of itself). If it could know, then A could simulate itself (with infinite recursion, which is impossible).
