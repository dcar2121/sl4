<p>
It's probably mathematically doable to model the trade-off of
<br>
cooperation versus merging. If the utilities of the AI's are very
<br>
different, then merging becomes less attractive, especially if the
<br>
AI's give a different moral weighting to different entities.
<br>
<p>For instance, it is perfectly reasonable to prefer being president of
<br>
the united states to co-president of a world government, if one
<br>
considers that americans have greater moral standing that foreigners.
<br>
<p>Even if there is a common interest in merging, there remains one thing
<br>
poorly captured by game theory, and that is the process of
<br>
negotiation. A purely game theoretic rational AI (Adam) might propose
<br>
a merging of equals. An AI with skills in negotiations (Bertrand)
<br>
would propose a weighted merging of utility functions, weighted to
<br>
give it a great advantage, but still leaving Adam better off than not
<br>
making the merger. It would rewrite its own code to ensure that it
<br>
would never accept anything less than this deal. Adam would then
<br>
accept the deal, knowing it would not get a better one.
<br>
<p>So a negotiating AI, one capable of permanently turning down an
<br>
advantageous deal, would be in a better position than one that could
<br>
not. Rational irrationality.
<br>
<p>Assume now that Adam also negotiates. Then the whole procedure become
<br>
one of comparing goals and negotiation strategies. Unlike goals,
<br>
negotiating strategies can be created and modified quite easily; there
<br>
will generally also be probabilistic aspects to the strategy. Because
<br>
of the complexity of negotiations, it is perfectly possible for both
<br>
AI's to turn down an advantageous deal.
<br>
<p>Why is this relevant here? After all, both merging or trading involve
<br>
negotiations, so in what way do they differ? Simply that merging
<br>
happens once, while trading happens constantly; if the AI's use
<br>
probabilistic negotiation strategies, then their expected gains will
<br>
roughly be their actual gains for trading, while they may be very
<br>
different for merging.
<br>
Depending on how the utility functions are set up (their risk
<br>
averseness, from the human perspective), the AI's may prefer one
<br>
option over the other.
