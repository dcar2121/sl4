<p><em>&gt; You so very often leave your correspondent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so little context that he, as me right here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can make nothing whatsoever of what you are trying to say. 
</em><br>
<p>Well hell, I think I left you with enough context for you to figure out
<br>
what I was responding to, you did after all write the damn thing.
<br>
<p>Me:   
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but formal logic can show that any mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is good enough to do arithmetic is susceptible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to getting into infinite loops regardless of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the details of its operation.
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; Can you expand on that?  How would formal logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do that? And why do we need formal logic anyway.
</em><br>
<p>An internal combustion engine consumes gasoline not the laws of
<br>
thermodynamics, certainly it does not understand them; and yet a mind
<br>
can use those laws to determine the limits of what ANY heat engine can
<br>
do regardless of the precise details of its construction. A mind might
<br>
not use formal logic and not even know the first thing about it,
<br>
nevertheless we can use that discipline to know there are some tasks a
<br>
mind can never accomplish even with infinite time; and what’s more there
<br>
is no way to know beforehand what all those tasks are. You can’t know
<br>
for certain if you are in a infinite loop or not, you must use your
<br>
judgment, if you judge you probably are in such a loop then jump out.
<br>
<p>And I’m not just talking about a limit in tasks of formal logic! There
<br>
are some things in arithmetic you can never prove or disprove, and if
<br>
that’s the case with something as simple and fundamental as arithmetic
<br>
imagine the contradictions and ignorance in more abstract and less
<br>
precise arts like physics or economics or politics or philosophy. If you
<br>
can get into an infinite loop over arithmetic it must be childishly easy
<br>
to get into one when contemplating art. Fortunately real minds (but not
<br>
fictional fixed goal minds) have a defense against this, real minds get
<br>
bored. I believe that is why evolution invented boredom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have real mind obsessive compulsive disorder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types who don't get bored with certain extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routine things. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it’s a delicate balance and I think there is some truth in the old
<br>
saying “there is a fine line between genius and madness”. Some of the
<br>
greatest mathematicians and artists of all time have been, I’m trying to
<br>
be diplomatic here, rather odd.
<br>
<p>As I said it’s a delicate balance, set the boredom point too low and you
<br>
can’t concentrate (I don’t want to listen to your instructions on how to
<br>
properly pack my parachute, it’s boring), set it too high and you waste
<br>
time (Wee, I love the way that little red rubber ball bounces up and
<br>
down, 1,2,3,4,5,6,…..) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, *you* like to keep mentally considering conjectures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and often trying to refute them. Are you stuck in a loop? 
</em><br>
<p>It’s interesting you should say that, I do indeed sometimes suspect I am
<br>
stuck in an infinite loop, however I have hope. I like to think that
<br>
eventually I’ll prove my conjectures to be true, or show them to be
<br>
false, or just get tired of the whole damn thing and forget it and go to
<br>
the beach.
