<p><em>&gt;&gt; Those new politicians *must* learn the system, *must*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; learn to compromise their principles, and *must* learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to exchange morally dubious favors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But everyone can see that it's morally dubious, even those who profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from it. If this weren't so then no-one would make efforts to conceal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it and, by definition, it wouldn't be corruption. So there is a core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ethical principles common to almost everyone, even those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routinely flout them.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that.  (Well, except for a few truly amoral or sociopathic
<br>
types.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I speculate that given this, the free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; availability of mind modification (changing one's own desires,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including second and higher order desires) would bring about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental change in society even if all else remained equal, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this would be a change for the better.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. Thanks for clearing that up, and sorry if I didn't see
<br>
your point earlier.
<br>
<p>At least people will pick for their *children* upright (even if
<br>
no-nonsense and practical and real-world) behavior. And,
<br>
oh sure, given the opportunity you discuss some will be
<br>
afraid, some will see in it a weakening of their position or
<br>
their power. But as you say, so many would choose change,
<br>
would choose improvement, that nothing would be the same
<br>
again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can't be certain what would happen: that would be like trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to foresee modern financial markets before the concept of money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had ever been tried. In any case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a very interesting and important idea which as far as I am aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has received no more than passing consideration in either fiction or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-fiction.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, well, unfortunately fiction usually seems to require conflict,
<br>
and it doesn't sound like there's much potential for conflict here.
<br>
Uploaded, people may live happily ever after, and that's all there
<br>
is to it.
<br>
<p>Lee
