<p><em>&gt;&gt; In America, we saw exactly what happens in large cities filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; recent immigrants (e.g. Chicago in the 1920s) or with people whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; small town experiences of democracy were insufficient to meet the challenges
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of urban life. It became very easy for criminal elements to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; infiltrate the local law establishment, and even coerce newspapers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and others into seeing things their way.  And today in Los Angeles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if you want to really know who controls a neighborhood or controls
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the streets, very often it's by no means the police or any lawfully set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; organization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with this appraisal, but I think the problem is at bottom due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to human psychology rather than particular cultural and historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors. Utopian projects will fail because they don't take into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account the fact that people are greedy, lazy, dishonest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsiderate. Few people *want* to be this way, but they can't help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Like drug addiction, they know that it's bad and they keep doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it anyway because it makes them feel good.
</em><br>
<p>Not only that, but it's in their *immediate* (if not long term)
<br>
interest to continue to &quot;be practical&quot;.  If everyone else around
<br>
you is taking bribes, and those who do not get beaten up, it's
<br>
just easier to go with the flow.  My own martyrdom capacity,
<br>
for example, is extremely limited.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but if they could feel just as good doing something that in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal world they consider positive, why wouldn't they? There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is huge pressure for people to be good even now that being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good is often difficult and being bad can be so tempting: how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much greater would the pressure be if it were just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivial exercise to make good more attractive than bad?
</em><br>
<p>But take even very honest, good, and idealistic politicians
<br>
today in some country with a long history.  (Italian history
<br>
is twice as long as American history, for one example, and
<br>
New York history is twice as long as California history.)
<br>
Those new politicians *must* learn the system, *must*
<br>
learn to compromise their principles, and *must* learn
<br>
to exchange morally dubious favors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To take your particular example, how would the gangsters have managed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to corrupt police if the police had been able to render themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immune any temptations they might have been offered?
</em><br>
<p>And just how would your ordinary Chicago cop in 1926 have done
<br>
that? Take a magic pill?  Be brave and not worry about repercussions?
<br>
Suddenly find the allure of a few hundred to a few thousand completely
<br>
*resistible*?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would they have been able to keep the local population cowered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if cowering could be turned off at will?
</em><br>
<p>If I had a pill that would turn off my cowering in such a situation,
<br>
I would not take it, for very likely the result would be my own death
<br>
or maiming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would they have been able to recruit employees, or indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how would they have got into the profession themselves, if it were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to *just decide* to derive as much satisfaction from doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something more socially acceptable and less risky?
</em><br>
<p>What do you have in mind?
<br>
<p>Lee
