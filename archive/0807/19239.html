<p>
Working from the source code, and the current state (or a recent
<br>
state), up to the result &quot;this entity would not defect in most
<br>
reasonably expected circumstance&quot; seems to be a highly non-trivial
<br>
procedure.
<br>
<p>Unless the SI's are for some reason running at a tiny fraction of
<br>
capacity, they would not be able to do the simulations needed to check
<br>
such a thing; and the quantity of simulations needed increases if you
<br>
need to be certain for a long time, or even in usual circumstances.
<br>
The &quot;reasonably expected circumstances&quot; is another problem.
<br>
<p>Unless, of course, there are mathematical shortcuts, theorems that
<br>
could obliviate the need to match every possible input with the
<br>
outcome &quot;defects-doesn't defect&quot;. Some source codes could allow an
<br>
outside SI to figure out, with great confidence, whether the SI would
<br>
defect or not. Call such SI's predictable. It may become an advantage
<br>
to be a predictable SI, even if the source code is otherwise inferior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, the difficulty I had in mind was the seeming impossibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *proving* one's source code to another. Sure, one SI can just send her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code to another, but how does the other SI know that it's not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some source code that she wants him to think she's running?
</em><br>
<p>In principle, this problem seems insolveable; there is nothing to stop
<br>
an SI having a source code that says: &quot;behave like this for ten
<br>
thousand years, then switch to this other, secret source code&quot;.
<br>
<p>In practice, there might be hope. If one SI had the details of how the
<br>
other was historically constructed; if she has access to the full
<br>
memory of the other, the physical makeup, follows her subroutines, and
<br>
is convinced that the source code is robust against being overthrown
<br>
by a secret command of the type above, then trust may be possible.
<br>
Again, having a mathematically predictable source code may be an
<br>
advantage here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that if it *were* possible to prove one's source code to another,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting things besides superrationality, like for example self-enforcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts, would be possible. (One simply modifies one's source code to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarantee attempts to fulfill the contract terms and then prove the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code to the counterparties.)
</em><br>
<p>In principle, impossible, in practice possible (and then, finally,
<br>
possible in principle). The reason is that unless they are willing to
<br>
put enforcing the contract as their only goal, then the same problem
<br>
of matching possible circumstances to behaviour becomes apparent. You
<br>
don't know what inputs would cause the other to break the contract;
<br>
therefore you can never be certain they won't appear during the
<br>
carrying out of the contract.
<br>
<p>However, in practice it should be quite doable. Given access to the
<br>
other's code under reasonable circumstances, getting a certain
<br>
expectation of trust seems plausible.
<br>
<p>Then once the &quot;reasonable circumstances&quot;, &quot;expectation of trust&quot; and
<br>
the potential error are expressed in mathematical form, they could be
<br>
incoporated into the contract, and then get a rigourously self
<br>
enforcing contract.
