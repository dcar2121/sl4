&quot;Also, &quot;merge&quot; is not well defined. If by &quot;merge&quot; you mean that the agents
<br>
cooperate to the greatest extent possible, then this is still a form of
<br>
trade. If their utility functions differ, then some negotiation is required
<br>
to reach an agreement on their combination. Even if the agents are
<br>
identical, then their utility functions will differ if both agents are
<br>
motivated by self interest, for different selves.&quot;
<br>
<p>- Imagine merge. Okai this is how I think about it. With lack of better
<br>
understanding and absence of a true gai I imagine it to be something like
<br>
this
<br>
1. Fred Hoyles The Black Cloud.
<br>
It's reasonable to assume a future intelligence to be massively parralel and
<br>
that entire wholesome cognetive domains are processed independently from the
<br>
whole.
<br>
2. Splicing of neural nets.
<br>
You may have experience with practical AI of today or not, but lets take
<br>
neural nets for example basicly we're talking classification and function
<br>
approximation. It's viable that you have two seperate domains, two seperate
<br>
trained nets and now you find that you'd like to splice these together so
<br>
the resulting net is the sum of a and b (This is what i call neural
<br>
algebra(tm), wich could be of big help with future neural implants for
<br>
cognetive enhancements as well).
<br>
So that is how I imagine merge. A subset of logic circuits simply enriched
<br>
with a new knowledge domain.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is to the advantage of both agents to share and redistribute information
<br>
to avoid redundancy and allow specialization. I expect cooperation to happen
<br>
because cooperating groups will have a selective advantage over
<br>
non-cooperators. But is this trading or merging? Do the employees of a
<br>
company trade or merge? Do the cells in your body trade or merge, or
<br>
something in between?&quot;
<br>
<p>- But it sounds like someone has to agree to die! For the better good of
<br>
course and future generations of course. You're assuming that a prime
<br>
directive of an AI is to win this race &lt;I expect cooperation to happen
<br>
because cooperating groups will have a selective advantage over
<br>
non-cooperators&gt;,  is that it?
<br>
Why would an AI merge? It's better to be assimilated than to be wiped out?
<br>
Left Behind? Forgotten?
<br>
<p>/Cy.
