2008/7/10 Stuart Armstrong &lt;<a href="mailto:dragondreaming@googlemail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Property%20rights">dragondreaming@googlemail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The great risks to human kind are precisely people who believe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are behaving in a highly moral and ethical fashion; upgrading them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their road to higher morality will make the situation worse, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better. Corrupt politicians are better than rigid fanatics, unless we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are very lucky in our choice of rigid fanatics.
</em><br>
<p>Most people who act in a way that they consider completely moral won't
<br>
want to change anything. If they have a twinge of guilt about
<br>
something then they are more likely to modify their minds so that
<br>
their behaviour changes in a way that will diminish the guilt, or not
<br>
modify themselves at all, rather than the alternative solution of
<br>
simply removing the guilt. Guilt could be seen as a manifestation of a
<br>
higher order desire: the way we would like ourselves to be, or the way
<br>
we would like to like ourselves to be. And while it is easy enough to
<br>
think of situations where guilt can push someone in the direction of
<br>
greater evil, for example jihadist who feels guilty because he is
<br>
squeamish about killing infidels, I still think that in the majority
<br>
of cases guilt would tend to drive people to modify themselves in
<br>
order to behave better, not worse; &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; being loosely
<br>
defined as what the majority of people would undestand by those terms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; At least people will pick for their *children* upright (even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; no-nonsense and practical and real-world) behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Children who don't lie would be good, and, if thise were known,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't even be at a disadvantage. Children who will eternally cling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the same religion, or to the same set of political ideas, are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could live with some sort of mandated flexibility, though; as long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as modifications don't totally close the door to evolution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions, and as long as they remain realistically reversible, then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that self-modification wouldn't make the world any worse. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could make it a lot more interesting.
</em><br>
<p>I expect there would be great pressure for people to conform to some
<br>
general standard of moral behaviour. There is such pressure today, but
<br>
we all reluctantly acknowledge that there will be people who behave in
<br>
antisocial ways because, without getting into a whole discussion about
<br>
free will, they can't help it. This excuse won't count for much if
<br>
anyone can easily change their nature to whatever they want. I imagine
<br>
there will be a tension between those who want to force everyone to be
<br>
good and those who defend the right to be evil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, unfortunately fiction usually seems to require conflict,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and it doesn't sound like there's much potential for conflict here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Uploaded, people may live happily ever after, and that's all there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Culture novels take a good stab at describing a society where most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are happyish. Ok, admitedly most of the action takes place away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the Culture itself...
</em><br>
<p>Greg Bear in &quot;Queen of Angels&quot; is set in a society where undesirable
<br>
character traits can be easily removed, but dramatic tension is
<br>
created by considering the position of the &quot;untherapied&quot; in this
<br>
society.
