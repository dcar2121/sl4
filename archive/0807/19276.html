<p>fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I may be making

</em><br>
<p>True, but again, 5MB of complexity (actually less) is miniscule
<br>
compared to the amount being generated daily by any individual.
<br>
Granted if we were to abstract away the generated complexity of all of
<br>
humanity we may get some redundancy (I dont know, it depends on what
<br>
philosophical framework one draws upon) but certainly it should be
<br>
more than 5MB.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But beyond this, how much will our true successors resemble today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity? I think it's impossible to make a concrete guess, but that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower boundary of similarity is pretty far away.Uploaded humans will just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emulations of running on vastly superior hardware. As anyone who's ever run
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; power it takes is usually far larger than the processing power the hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being emulated had, and hence the process is very inefficient.
</em><br>
<p>I argued a similar point a few months ago--  If humans were to be
<br>
emulated perfectly, the hardware running the emulation would be
<br>
necessarily more complex (Kolmogorov) than the emulated reality, down
<br>
to the quantum level if any quantum effects have any effect on random
<br>
input available to individual humans (chaos theory applies, I'm not
<br>
talking about quantum effects in the brain, but the non-predictability
<br>
of, for example, the microdynamics of thermal systems). It would be
<br>
thus more efficient to observe, rather than emulate the system. A
<br>
vastly superior intelligence would certainly be aware of this fact,
<br>
and if it is at all interested in self-improvement (defined presumably
<br>
as an increase in complexity and cognitive capability since this type
<br>
of goal would most probably fall near to the target area the initial
<br>
designers aimed for) then it may very well wish to preserve humanity
<br>
(as broadly construed by this list) in some recognizable form simply
<br>
because it allows for a diversity of direction. I'm talking here about
<br>
direction in terms of the likely evolutionary paths of human systems
<br>
of thought that a preserved humankind would take as distinct from ones
<br>
an isolated AI would take-- it is an advantage to have a diversity of
<br>
intelligent systems if self-improvement is an end goal.
<br>
<p>Its somewhat analogous to the argument that biodiversity is a
<br>
scientific (and thus ethical, as well as economic) end to itself. The
<br>
only reason we harvest and exploit the biosphere to the extent we do
<br>
now is because we're tremendously short-sighted.
<br>
<p>At the very
<br>
<em>&gt; least the uploaded humans would modify themselves to execute more natively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on whatever hardware exists, and once the self-tampering starts, when will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it stop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes self modification is fine. But we don't really know how that'll
<br>
turn out yet. Kinda like chimps trying to predict the stock market.
