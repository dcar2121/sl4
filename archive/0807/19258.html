<p>From: Matt Mahoney &lt;<a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Proof%20by%20construction,%20again%20(was%20Re:%20[sl4]%20prove%20your%20source%20code)">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;But A cannot know if S is its own source code. (I assume that S
</em><br>
<em>&gt;includes current state information needed to make a copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself). If it could know, then A could simulate itself (with infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recursion, which is impossible).
</em><br>
<p>The above proof technique also leads to the conclusion that backing up
<br>
my computer is impossible.  My computer cannot possibly know all of
<br>
the bits it uses, since if it could, it could simulate itself, with
<br>
infinite recursion, which is impossible.
<br>
<p>The gap there is that knowing the bits does not imply having the
<br>
capacity to run them.  Simulating itself requires knowing what to
<br>
simulate, and also having the computational capacity to simulate.  
<br>
<p>Suppose my computer is configured to have 1GB of virtual memory.  It
<br>
can't simulate a full version of itself, but it can simulate itself
<br>
with 750MB of virtual memory.  The simulation overhead of 250MB of
<br>
memory might not be missed in everyday use, but it does stop the
<br>
infinite recursion after a fairly small number of levels, or maybe
<br>
after just one level depending on how brittle the definition of &quot;my
<br>
computer&quot; is.  None of that stops me from backing up my computer.
<br>
<p>Talk of &quot;current state information&quot; doesn't make a difference.  At one
<br>
time there were patches that let Linux hibernate to disk.  If I
<br>
successfully installed those, I could copy a machine-state to disk and
<br>
back that up, as it was before the start of the backup.
