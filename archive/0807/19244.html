<p>
Consider two (contemporary) corporations that want to cooperate with each 
<br>
other for mutual gain. They have two general options, trade or merge, and 
<br>
the choice can be seen as a tradeoff between different kinds of overhead 
<br>
costs. For trading, these include bargaining, contract enforcement, and 
<br>
missed opportunities due to asymmetric information. Merging avoids some of 
<br>
these, but increases agency costs (see 
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost</a>).
<br>
<p>It occurs to me that two AIs who want to cooperate with each other face the 
<br>
same choices, but merging might be a much more attractive option for them. 
<br>
In case it's not obvious, &quot;merging&quot; here means something like creating a 
<br>
third AI that will try to optimize a weighted average of the two AI's 
<br>
utility functions, and then transferring all information and physical assets 
<br>
to this new AI. The reason that merging is more attractive is that trading 
<br>
still retains the same transaction costs, but merging doesn't incurs 
<br>
perpetual agency costs. Instead, each of the original AIs only need to 
<br>
verify during initial construction of the new AI that it will in fact try to 
<br>
optimize the agreed upon utility function. (This seems much easier than 
<br>
proving or verifying what source code an existing AI is running.)
<br>
<p>If this analysis is correct, it may be that any society of AIs will 
<br>
voluntarily merge into a singleton, in order to maximize gains from 
<br>
cooperation. This singleton will then try to maximize a weighted average of 
<br>
all of the original AIs' utility functions.
<br>
<p>What about other kinds of minds, for whom merging may not be possible? Well, 
<br>
if they are capable of self-modification, a group of such minds can agree to 
<br>
modify themselves to each maximize a common combined utility function, and 
<br>
that should work just as well as merging, as long as the agreement can be 
<br>
enforced and verified (say with the help of a trusted third party). This 
<br>
seems to imply that the ability to self-modify will lead to voluntary 
<br>
borgification, but this process may stop short of a singleton (because when 
<br>
there are only two such &quot;borgs&quot; left, who will act as the trusted third 
<br>
party?)
<br>
<p>This line of argument may seem to depend on the assumption that 
<br>
intelligence==optimization process, which is something I've previously 
<br>
argued against [1]. However, it may be that an intelligence, once it 
<br>
satisfies all of its goals that can not be modeled as an optimization 
<br>
process (such as finding answers to the philosophical questions in [1]), the 
<br>
working on remaining goals can be seen as an optimization process.
<br>
<p>(For nit-picking decision theorists, please take &quot;maximize combined utility 
<br>
function&quot; to mean &quot;maximize expected utility under a linear combination of 
<br>
the individual priors and a linear combination of the individual utility 
<br>
functions.)
