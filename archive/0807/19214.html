<em>&gt;&gt; It has some aspects that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unquestionably smart (mostly in economics, and individual autonomy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but there are many cases throughout history when libertarian ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; were unquestionably stupid and harmful (dysentery and other disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; control, the Irish famine, market crashes (the tulip market in Holland
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and the south sea bubble chief among them), laissez-faire educational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; policies in underdeveloped countries, etc...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with your generality, but not with your specifics. &quot;Dysentery&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a libertarian idea, and as libertarian idealists point out, proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical prevention *could* be arranged by a free people who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both smart enough, well educated enough, and farsighted enough.
</em><br>
<p>I have no doubt about that; I've looked into some of those solutions
<br>
myself, and most of them look like complicated and risky methods to
<br>
construct an inefficient liberty-based version of something that could
<br>
be accomplished much easier by governmental fiat. I'm not saying its a
<br>
bad idea to do so, but it carries a large cost (that might be
<br>
compensated by an increase in liberty, but that's a philosophical
<br>
question).
<br>
<p>To put in economic terms, negative eternalities (it is to the
<br>
advantage of every parent to have every child immunized, except their
<br>
own). To solve these you need most people to be not only smart but
<br>
altrusistic, and to have some mechanism for them to organise their
<br>
altruistic impulses. If some people are not altruistic enough, and if
<br>
the externalities are sufficiently large, you need compulsion (maybe a
<br>
soft, financial version of compulsion, but some compulsion non the
<br>
less).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Irish famine was to a great extent produced by *government*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Had the free market, where those who produce goods get to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them and trade them freely both internally and externally, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never have happened.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to have an interpretation of the Irish famine at odds with
<br>
most - and certainly at odds with most Irish historians. Could we
<br>
continue the debate off the list? It seems interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;tulip market&quot;?  Well, yes, people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who like to gamble and have the freedom to do so sometimes lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their shirts. So what?  Take their freedoms away?  What about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government oversight committee today that would keep you from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing the stock market because you might do something stupid?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You surely don't want that too.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not. But interest rate setting, various central bank
<br>
interventions, mandatory circuit breakers, and a host of related
<br>
interventions, seem essential to make sure the pain doesn't spread.
<br>
The pain of market crashes are rarely confined to investors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And laissez-faire educational systems work fine in most Western,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced nations, and most countries are ready for them. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not impoverished third world countries who are hundreds if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of years behind culturally. They're not even ready for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rudimentary democracy.
</em><br>
<p>Laissez-faire educational systems to not exist in most Western nations
<br>
(at least not as the main stay of the pre-university educational
<br>
system). Even for private schools and universities, most are
<br>
established under laws that are very far from laissez-faire.
<br>
<p>But I don't want to turn this post into a debate on libertarianism
<br>
(Note from the editor: a bit late for that, isn't it? Note from
<br>
Stuart: shush! They might not have noticed it until you draw attention
<br>
to it!).
<br>
<p>I just want to make the point that we are living in a civilization
<br>
which is very very far from libertarian ideals; government and
<br>
regulations saturate the whole edifice. And it's not too bad a
<br>
civilization, on balance. Libertarian ideas sound tempting, and some
<br>
are undoutebly correct (partial-Futarchy is good). But communist ideas
<br>
sounded tempting in their day, and some were undoutably correct
<br>
(family law, a few aspects of educational policy, abolition of fedal
<br>
principles). Until we have a working, stable minarchy in a large
<br>
country (ie until demons can go ice-skating without leaving home), we
<br>
can't assume that the smartest idea for future government is likely to
<br>
be a minarchy.
<br>
<p>I personally think the ideal will be far more libertarian than I'm
<br>
comfortable with, but far less that Lee would like :-) But that's a
<br>
complete guess at the moment. Time, and the AI(s), will tell.
<br>
