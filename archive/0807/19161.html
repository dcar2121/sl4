<p>&lt;grin&gt;  Yes, it did literally say that the *cessation* of
<br>
human death on Earth would occur before a certain time.
<br>
But the intent was hopefully clear that he was going along
<br>
with the feelings of his interlocutor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't really think it could be accomplished in 7 days  (6 days?),

</em><br>
<p>Well, forgetting about the relatively uninteresting question of 
<br>
whether the result of a vast runaway AI scenario could be
<br>
*capable* of killing us all, it is entertaining to wonder just
<br>
how long a complete takeover would require that stopped
<br>
people from dying, no matter what violations it had to 
<br>
perpetrate.
<br>
<p>A nice question, thanks for bringing it up.  And thanks to me for
<br>
putting it in the story.  Let's investigate.  Suppose that by repeatedly
<br>
making phone calls using a variety of voices---authority figures,
<br>
ex-romatic partners or old friends---the AI could become an
<br>
intimate of almost any given person very quickly. While your
<br>
real old friends are not in the loop, you think that you hear from
<br>
several of them who're all supposedly talking to each other, and they
<br>
greatly influence your behavior. So how long would it take for the
<br>
program to talk to *everyone*?  Even the most remote hermit?
<br>
Okay, there may be a few really committed hermits in the world
<br>
that no one can get to, and it the AI is going to get to them it must
<br>
do so physically.
<br>
<p>So by contacting everyone it can simultaneously, it can probably
<br>
get messages even to deaf people, terminally busy people, and 
<br>
even imbeciles in institutions, and probably within a few hours,
<br>
I'd say.
<br>
<p>Suppose also that the AI does penetrate most computers one way
<br>
or another, and, as it says, takes over all broadcasting, urging 
<br>
people to avoid bathrooms and kitches, where, shall we say,
<br>
most deaths or injury occur indoors. Indeed, getting people to
<br>
believe that a horrible plague is on the loose might do it, no? 
<br>
<p>The literal question had been
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Say I wanted to stop all death in the world, how soon would it happen?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>and the thing responded &quot;T + 7 hours 35 minutes&quot; with probability .99.
<br>
But this meant it cut corners with abandon.   I admit that I hadn't been 
<br>
thinking of the hundreds of thousands of very old people who die 
<br>
every day, but who knows what ministrations it might be capable of?
<br>
<p>And the Six Day answer was in response to a gentler question.
