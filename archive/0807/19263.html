<em>&gt; &gt; So you stand by your bold assertion that backing up computers is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impossible.  The backup media are defined to be part of the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that's being backed up, so the loss of previous contents of the backup
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; media is a failure of the backup.  Odd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. I stand by my assertion that backing up a computer does not disprove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that an agent cannot know its own source code. How do you know the backup is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct? You could make a second backup and compare the results, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't prove the process is correct. You could reload your computer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the backup, but then how do you know nothing is changed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An agent making a copy of itself would have the same problem. It could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verify that the copy is exact. It has to trust the copy process.
</em><br>
<p><p>Isn't this just fully general skepticism?
<br>
<p>Being a bit more specific: If we define &quot;source code&quot; to mean the entire
<br>
system state, the mind can be very confident (based on examining the copy
<br>
process) that &quot;this hard drive [connected to, but defined to be outside, the
<br>
system] contains what my state was at time t&quot;. This isn't common usage of
<br>
&quot;source code&quot;, though; it would be considered very odd to say that two text
<br>
editors with different documents open have different source code simply by
<br>
virtue of that. Under the more common definition, a mind can be very
<br>
confident under some circumstances that some external hard drive contains
<br>
its current source.
<br>
<p>But this has little to do with Tim's original thought experiment, which is
<br>
more about making goals transparent and actions predictable than proving
<br>
specific code.
