<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; overnight change for DOI. Who else is going to do it? Santa? :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It will be done by well-funded groups, by corporations, with, I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this what your magic eight balls says?
</em><br>
<p>It's what I think. That is, the above are the most likely source
<br>
of breakthroughs in anti-aging, age reversal, advanced nanotech
<br>
and GAI, seems to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, let's say it's not &quot;my&quot; solution for not dying, and let's just call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it Aubrey's. I was only using it as a general reference to the fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people are working on it. People are -- not magical unicorns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if you really care about people not dying, go pursue that work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set up giant archives and impressive life support systems, deploy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better ambulatory capacities, whatever it might take.
</em><br>
<p>Like I said, I'm pretty busy with other stuff.  (I know my priorities
<br>
perhaps aren't what they should be, but that's how it is.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But please don't confuse that with the issues of the design,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction and feasibility issues of intelligence. You respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this same line below ..
</em><br>
<p>Here is how our *current* miscommunication evidently got started:
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I posit that in many cases the people simply are not capable of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-rule or are absolutely too unprepared for it by their own
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cultural history. We also can surely judge that this was the case
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in many historical societies we're aware of.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm wondering what makes you think that nations and governments
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; somehow magically (vitalism) makes it so that these same unprepared
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; people are able to come together and somehow make it so that they
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; &gt; are prepared. It's simply not true.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; Yes it is! Yes it is! :-) 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Oh, okay. How's that death thing working out for you? Kinda sucks, eh?
</em><br>
<p>and we got going on the problem of &quot;dying&quot;.  The property rights
<br>
issue that started this apparently arose from me suggesting that
<br>
&quot;in many cases the people simply are not capable of self-rule or
<br>
are absolutely too unprepared for it by their own cultural history&quot;
<br>
and that caused you to take off on some magic/vitalism accusation.
<br>
<p>My statement in this last paragraph inside the quotes still stands,
<br>
it seems to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There you go again.  &quot;Let's go engineer solutions.&quot;  When, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; afternoon?  Later this evening?  Actually, my next two weekends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Next few seconds. What's your number again? Nevermind, I have it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I'll call you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That is not an answer! You're deep in trouble friend, someone christ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; - king of the jews. You can someone in your state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be so cool about our fate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You asked when .. [and the reference is lost on me. I did my searching, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still can't get it. Are you Jesus?]
</em><br>
<p>Blasted Xian spammers!  Let's not allow them to
<br>
derail our discussion. But they did supply a link:
<br>
<a href="http://lib.ru/SONGS/jesus.txt">http://lib.ru/SONGS/jesus.txt</a> . So it evidently was
<br>
just a reference to an old rock opera song.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I'm saying that many people here consider it interesting or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fruitful to consider the logical possibilities inherent in a sudden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; AI takeoff. Okay, so you don't.  Then maybe you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consider not replying to posts like that, imploring, (the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you do) that the subject be changed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I'm digging in a dry well.
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't say.  But it looks as though perhaps it was I who 
<br>
started the thread &quot;Property Rights&quot; replying to Stathis.
<br>
(If someone else, started the thread, I'd appreciate knowing
<br>
who and when.)
<br>
<p>Martin then wrote &quot;My guess is that many think become really
<br>
really cheap under the singularity, but never completely free.
<br>
Just some cheap stuff might not be worth billing [for] it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Stathis then said: &quot;Even if we all had Santa Claus machines we might still
<br>
covet our neighbour's unique objects, land and raw materials. But the
<br>
crucial change will come when we are able to rewrite our own source
<br>
code...&quot;
<br>
<p>And you wrote

<p>Okay, okay.  You've changed the subject line to &quot;Shock level
<br>
confidence.&quot;  What do you think is the key issue now?
