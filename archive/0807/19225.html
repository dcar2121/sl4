From: &quot;Thomas McCabe&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:pphysics141@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Call%20for%20information:%20Moore's%20Law">pphysics141@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;...Currently, we're looking for information on what causes Moore's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Law-style exponentials in computer hardware, so we can predict what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will happen given conditions different from those of the past forty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years....Any links to other theories, or literature on the subject,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be greatly appreciated.
</em><br>
<p>I always assumed that a random innovation takes a random amount of
<br>
time and causes an improvement by a random small percentage, and
<br>
there's a probability distribution on those percentages and times.  If:
<br>
<p>* many small innovations happen, and
<br>
* there aren't any physical limits that skew your probabilities, 
<br>
<p>then the law of large numbers takes over, so you have predictable
<br>
exponential progress that depends only on the probability
<br>
distributions.
<br>
<p>I don't have a link for that.  It always seemed obvious.
<br>
<p>The above hypothesis does predict that spending more money so you get
<br>
more small innovations would give you a larger growth rate for the
<br>
exponential growth.  I haven't looked at the numbers.  If the research
<br>
spending has been fairly constant, and we got a constant exponential
<br>
growth rate, then that's consistent with my theory.  If the research
<br>
spending is growing exponentially, and we get a constant exponential
<br>
growth rate instead of something super-exponential, then that's
<br>
inconsistent with my theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1)., Moore's Law was a self-fulfilling prophecy because it was used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to set industry goals,
</em><br>
<p>That's a conspiracy theory.  Each competitor would benefit by beating the
<br>
prediction, and none of them do, for no particular reason.  Doesn't work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2)., most technological growth is exponential, because the rate at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which technology improves is proportional to the amount of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already in existence.
</em><br>
<p>That seems to me to predict super-exponential growth, since I'd expect
<br>
a random research result to give you a random percentage improvement,
<br>
and improved technology should help you get research results faster
<br>
from one year to the next.
<br>
<p>Maybe the research is inherently sequential?  If it is only possible
<br>
to discover small improvement  nubmer n+1 after completely understanding
<br>
small improvement number n, and there are humans in the loop with a
<br>
limited learning rate, then you could expect Moore's law to hold no
<br>
matter how much money you throw at the problem.
