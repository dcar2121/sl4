<p>
In the preceeding debate about governments, I often used phrases like
<br>
&quot;assuming human nature remains essentially identical&quot;, or words to
<br>
that effect. It was needed so that we could debate in a meaninful way,
<br>
but it is also a very stupid idea.
<br>
<p>Tiny changes could completely change human nature as we know it;
<br>
consider the modern attitudes, and compare with those of previous
<br>
ages. And a singularity in anything but a tiny change.
<br>
<p>So what are the most likely differences that could transform human
<br>
nature? For a simple comparaison, take everyone today, move them past
<br>
the singularity, and see what would be dramatically different even if
<br>
everyone is the same person.
<br>
<p>My best guesses are:
<br>
<p>1) A loss of the sense of self.
<br>
<p>With multiple backups, subroutines, interchangeable memory nodes,
<br>
better anlysis of other people's minds, maybe &quot;programs&quot; running on a
<br>
distributed network of post-humans, personal identity will be
<br>
dramatically weakned. How this is coped with will probably be the
<br>
philosophical and spiritual/religious opportunity of the post singular
<br>
world.
<br>
<p><p>2) The loss of human universals.
<br>
<p>It will be quite easy to copy or create beings that seem human in
<br>
every way, except for a few differences (cf my idea to solving the
<br>
problem of violence). If you add self modification, then we will be
<br>
able to assume a lot less about someone when we meet them, even if
<br>
they seem &quot;human&quot;. The &quot;values that every human shares&quot; will become a
<br>
thing of the past.
<br>
<p><p>3) Egalitarianism?
<br>
<p>What format will egalitarianism take in the new world? There is
<br>
tremendous potential for a world without any concept of egalitarianism
<br>
at all; there is also tremendous potential for a world with enforced
<br>
equality, precisely because the birth differences can be ironed out.
<br>
Most likely, the concept will mutate again, and there will be some
<br>
kernel of &quot;rights&quot; granted to all &quot;thinking entities of a certain
<br>
class&quot;. I feel that there will be some rights to reliable information,
<br>
and some rights to disseminate opinion in a way that reaches others;
<br>
and of course some right to life, and autonomy, and some
<br>
self-modification rights. Beyond that, I can't say; many potential
<br>
worlds imaginable out there, and the facts on the ground may preclude,
<br>
or demand, certain rights.
<br>
