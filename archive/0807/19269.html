<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is your current estimate of the probability that humanity will survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see a positive singularity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have been pondering, and discussing it with some people, and I have become
<br>
more and more personally convinced
<br>
that even though select groups of humans may experience benefit, for &quot;short
<br>
periods&quot; from a singularity, over all, a
<br>
singularity will be pretty damn traumatic for the vast majority of humans.
<br>
However... even that won't mean much.
<br>
The vast majority of humans may willingly endure the stress, or decide they
<br>
don't have any alternative than endure
<br>
the technological phase shift.
<br>
<p>Plus, it won't end. I regard pre-singularity existence as a placid reality.
<br>
When a singularity happens, all natural
<br>
balance is instantly gone and you'll have constant waves of change sweeping
<br>
the world. You'll see every definition
<br>
of what it means to be human dissolve into this cataclysm like ice cubes in
<br>
boiling water. There will be shock
<br>
fronts of change sweeping people who have no clue. It is like people in deep
<br>
Africa, their traditions already upset by
<br>
the &quot;recent&quot; introduction of Kalashnikovs and RPG's, suddenly confronted
<br>
with very rugged and miniaturized 3D
<br>
virtual reality wearables that allows all functions of a modern PC network,
<br>
with many times the software programs
<br>
we have today. There will be violent stress between non-adopters, partial
<br>
adopters, early adopters,  late adopters.
<br>
The flood of information, commerce, seduction, perversity, entertainment,
<br>
spam, raw insult, spirituality, dialogue
<br>
will overwhelm anyone, whether in the kalahari, or in Tokyo, on a nonstop
<br>
unabated pace.
<br>
<p>And after that the actual Singularity will come, and that will be even more
<br>
bewildering. This is all completely
<br>
insane by any standard, and yes, it will sometimes feel like being in a
<br>
storm of flying Piranha's, naked, fast forward.
<br>
<p>And yes, once it starts it just will not stop. It will take off and go on
<br>
and on. I cannot envision it, but I also can not
<br>
envision it attaining some sort of balance, status quo or tranquility. We
<br>
will long back for the age of innocence and
<br>
peace.
