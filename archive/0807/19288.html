<p>Thanks for the link, but I am already aware of Wikipedia.
<br>
<p>I prefer the graphics in &quot;The Lives and Death of Moore's Law&quot; 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html">http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html</a>&gt;.
<br>
These graphs look random, with no upward trend or exponential curve:

<br>
Figure 8: Average change in PC price indexes
<br>
<p>Quoted from the article:
<br>
<p>&quot;A simple test for the validity of the Moore's Law can be done by charting 
<br>
the number of transistors on microprocessor chips. This chart is, basically, 
<br>
the one that is usually shown with the claim that it proves that the number 
<br>
of transistors doubles roughly every 18 months. The results can be seen in 
<br>
Figure 3....&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html#fig3">http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html#fig3</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;As can be seen from Figure 3, the number of transistors has not doubled 
<br>
very regularly. During the first decade of microprocessors, the doubling 
<br>
rate was approximately 22 months but also very irregular. After the 
<br>
introduction of the 80386 processor family, the doubling speed was closer to 
<br>
33 months. During this period, the number of transistors jumped from 
<br>
275,000, on the Intel 80386 chips in 1988 to 1.4 million transistors on the 
<br>
80486 SL chips, at the end of 1992. In the Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium 
<br>
II processor families the transistor count doubled roughly at a rate of 54 
<br>
months. Strictly speaking, the transistor counts, however, have changed 
<br>
irregularly and the mentioned doubling times are based on statistical 
<br>
trends.  Since late 1999, Intel has not included transistor counts in its 
<br>
processor summaries. In October 1999, Intel Pentium III Xeon and Mobile 
<br>
Pentium III processors had some 28 million transistors. In July 2001, 
<br>
Pentium 4 had about 42 million transistors....&quot;
<br>
<p>Although technology is roughly getting faster all the time, it is doing so 
<br>
in fits and starts as new products emerge.  There is no predictable pattern 
<br>
or discernable rate at which this occurs.  Moore's Law is a rough trend, but 
<br>
not very accurate at all.
