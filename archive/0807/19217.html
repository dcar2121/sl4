<p><em>&gt;&gt; I always argue on a different level, namely, that there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *definitely* be no overnight change in people's attitudes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nor in those who are in charge (say in America, for instance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I see that as a constraint, and you never do.  So we talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; past each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you illustrate this talking-past phenomena when you're more or less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pairing DOI against &quot;overnight change&quot;. One does not need overnight 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change for DOI. Who else is going to do it? Santa? :-)
</em><br>
<p>It will be done by well-funded groups, by corporations, with, I
<br>
agree, some contributions from the merely enthusiastic. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; whatever the hell that intelligence is. All of the hypotheticals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; about implementation of an ai dominated society are ridiculous --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; it doesn't actually have anything to do with intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Since this has to be about the Nth time around here, give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me a hand.  Why do we keep talking past each other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why do you dismiss entirely *out of hand*  the *possibility*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of an adverse AI takeover?  In other words, when I ask again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as I always do, WHY IS IT RIDICULOUS, for some reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your answer just goes right by me. Look deeper.  What am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; failing to see?  What about my position are you failing to see?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's not that it's impossible, I'm disagreeing that it's such a big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue. Yes, I am aware of the arguments for computronium conversion, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malicious ai, and so on, and I've mentioned various solutions to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems that we are worrying about, like people and them dying.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry for interrupting, but what is your solution for dying again?
<br>
Have you checked it out with people who've been studying
<br>
anti-aging and age-reversal for decades? I'll bet your solutions
<br>
are all hand-wavy----and you can post twenty (or two thousand)
<br>
links to helpful information that &quot;we&quot; could indeed use
<br>
to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of aging, but you haven't solved it. And
<br>
no one else has.  Or will for a long time.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, what's so ridiculous is that we have to consider those things when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building intelligence. Yes, I am aware of 'byproducts', and that's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly a worthwhile consideration, but we can solve those problems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway, so why is everyone still debating ai within the context of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominator scenarios when we know that there are solutions swimming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about in our minds? So instead of focusing on those issues, let's get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work, eh? <a href="http://heybryan.org/buildingbrains.html">http://heybryan.org/buildingbrains.html</a> 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://heybryan.org/humancortex.html">http://heybryan.org/humancortex.html</a> (I just added this one today), and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://heybryan.org/recursion">http://heybryan.org/recursion</a> (the classic).
</em><br>
<p>That last link is bad.  The reason my response is so late is that I read
<br>
the first two links.  They do outline a lot of work.  Unfortunately, I'm
<br>
already fully employed, and don't expect to achieve much in the way
<br>
of doing some serious programming each time I see one of your links,
<br>
or each time I see a new model that that could really contribute towards
<br>
progress in brain mapping; and besides,  how would this be integrated
<br>
into the total world researcher dataset anyway? Any system administrator
<br>
of a brain or even of managing these transformations might be
<br>
interested in managing I/O, phenotypic feedback, biofeedback,
<br>
neurofeedback, acoustic feedback, or whatever. Our human cortex gene
<br>
expression data set---just what we already have here and what has been
<br>
linked to in our discussions here---could, I suppose,  be displayed over
<br>
the Google Maps API or something very similar to it, and then this could
<br>
indeed be used for neurotagging and the correlation of information to
<br>
specific regions of the map, while also giving users an interface for
<br>
managing that information, selection views... but what would this lead to? 
<br>
Search me! I have no idea, but it does sound like it could lead to something,
<br>
no?
<br>
<p>But as to the specific question you raise &quot;so why is everyone still
<br>
debating ai within the context of dominator scenarios when we
<br>
know that there are solutions swimming about in our minds?&quot;.
<br>
Entertainment? Because some of us lack confidence that we can
<br>
churn out lab-tested solutions before total senescence takes over?
<br>
Or maybe people here debate those ideas not just for entertainment,
<br>
but also because humankind's relations with future AI hinges on
<br>
every single word we say in a forum like this!  Yeah?  or Meh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether or not people happen to not know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; to live isn't the issue (in truth, nobody does anyway); if you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; afraid people will die, fine, let's go engineer solutions to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; problems, but let's not mix it up with the task of ai engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and design. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There you go again.  &quot;Let's go engineer solutions.&quot;  When, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; afternoon?  Later this evening?  Actually, my next two weekends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next few seconds. What's your number again? Nevermind, I have it. I'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call you.
</em><br>
<p>THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER.
<br>
<p>That is not an answer! You're deep in trouble friend, someone christ -
<br>
king of the jews. You can someone in your state
<br>
be so cool about our fate?

<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; your various good ideas and schemes.  But you're living in a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with 300 million rather relatively conservative folk who just aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; going to let you do whatever you want, and who aren't going to listen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to &quot;good sense&quot; (as defined by Bryan and Lee).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not counting on 300 million people listening to &quot;good sense&quot;. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still don't get what you are saying though.
</em><br>
<p>I'm saying that many people here consider it interesting or
<br>
fruitful to consider the logical possibilities inherent in a sudden
<br>
AI takeoff. Okay, so you don't.  Then maybe you might 
<br>
consider not replying to posts like that, imploring, (the way
<br>
you do) that the subject be changed.
