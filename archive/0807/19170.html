<em>&gt; &gt; To say &quot;slave AI&quot; is to select one particular subset of the possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;friendly AIs&quot; and claim &quot;That's the real set!&quot;.  Those can exist (and I,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personally, feel that they are not only immoral, but dangerous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; create), but that's hardly the full range.  (I'd actually prefer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exclude most &quot;slave AI&quot;s from the category of &quot;friendly&quot;, as I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that most of them would be. Frustration, at least among mammals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tends to minimize friendly interactions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess you read &quot;slave&quot; as meaning an AI that is somehow forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve us even though it would rather not. Do you still think it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be immoral if the AI were designed so that it wanted to serve us?
</em><br>
<p>Not immoral, just misuse of the language.  (Not a strong misuse, as &quot;slave the 
<br>
drive to the controler&quot; is standard usage.  But slave seems to imply that the 
<br>
device wasn't changed to make controlling easier.)  The problem I have with 
<br>
that usage is that when the term &quot;slave&quot; is applied to a self-aware entity it 
<br>
seems to mean that it must obey whether it will or no.  The useage you seem 
<br>
to suggest in &quot;slave AI&quot; being read as if it were a relay or a disk drive 
<br>
would appear to denigrate the individuality of the AI, which would definitely 
<br>
be unwise if it had ANY sense of self-preservation (and arguments from many 
<br>
directions imply that it would...whether built-in or derived).  If what you 
<br>
mean is just what I'm calling &quot;misuse of the language&quot;, then the main problem 
<br>
is how it would shape *your* thoughts, and thus your actions.  In that case I 
<br>
don't consider the usage immoral, only stupid.  (Note that these &quot;results&quot; 
<br>
can't be seen physically in the absence of an AI...but it still shapes how 
<br>
you think about it.)
