<p>Re: mathematical models of RSI. Since we don't have one of these at the 
<br>
moment, let's start with something simpler, like recursive 
<br>
self-augmentation. In other words, the augmentations that are made have 
<br>
to allow some broader set of functional modifications and or 
<br>
augmentations than would have been otherwise possible or would have 
<br>
otherwise occured without the modifications. This is difficult to test 
<br>
in non-digital organisms because of the issue of copies and the 
<br>
differences between one organism and its own clone (the 'divergence') 
<br>
and so this model might not be useful in a biological sense. But, in a 
<br>
broader digital perspective the ability to change can be measured 
<br>
thanks to bits and the quantification thereof. Whether or not changing 
<br>
bits in variable memory or bits in control sectors specifying the 
<br>
programs, and whether or not this qualifies, is still up for grabs. So 
<br>
let's just start with recursive augmentation, and the feedback 
<br>
mechanisms thereof. Where can we go from there?

<p>Partly the issue that you'll have to eventually admit is that 
<br>
quantifying the augmentation can only occur in one situation, where 
<br>
you, as the one running the simulations and experiments, already know 
<br>
the overall set of available augmentations for experimental digital 
<br>
agents. Then you can run measurements on these agents and see which 
<br>
ones perform the best and pursue all available augmentations etc. 
<br>
[whatever your measurement happens to be]. This would be susceptible to 
<br>
mathematical modeling, I think.
<br>
<p>The reality of the situation calls for something different since we are 
<br>
not privledged with that information in advance. Quite literally, 
<br>
reality is producing information as quickly as possible and those 
<br>
augmentations are being constructed on the spot -- if they were already 
<br>
known, there'd be no issue in the first place. So what it turns into is 
<br>
more a task of an epistemiological approach to the internal modeling of 
<br>
augmentation options and the pursuit thereof. Maybe by wearing a system 
<br>
administrator cap (gown?). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From here we can get a pragmattic, functional model of augmentation from 
</em><br>
within, but it's not using the same approach to strict external 
<br>
mathematical modeling of RSI.
