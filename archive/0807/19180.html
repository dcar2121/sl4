<p>Yes, babies are really complicated.  But object permanence is one of the 
<br>
things that they learn after they're born.  (I *suspect* that it's via 
<br>
Bayesian reasoning, and doesn't require any presumption of what nerve means 
<br>
what.)  OTOH, I'm certain that there are lots of complexities that I haven't 
<br>
yet considered that will turn out to be essential.  I'm not sure how to 
<br>
disentangle those which are essential from those that appear to be optional 
<br>
extras, but it sure would be nice to be able to do so before investing years 
<br>
in trying to teach it.  OTOH, one doesn't want to build in anything excessive 
<br>
for two reasons:
<br>
1) It's a lot of work on a project that's probably already more than I can 
<br>
handle, and
<br>
2) Anything you build in is a point of rigidity, which will render the system 
<br>
less flexible.  This is true even if the system has the ability to rewrite 
<br>
the original code (which I think should only be true to a limited degree).  
<br>
This is because in Bayesian logic your current beliefs bias the conclusions 
<br>
that you will draw for any information that you later experience.  And 
<br>
Bayesian probabilities seems the best way to draw conclusions when there is 
<br>
insufficient data.  OTOH, it's an expensive process computationally, and 
<br>
where good alternatives exist they should be employed.  E.g., once you know 
<br>
that you're dealing with an arithmetic series, guessing the next number via 
<br>
Bayesian prediction is foolish.  But to originally decide that it's an 
<br>
arithmetic series...  So you build in efficient ways to do things, but you 
<br>
are very careful about how insistent you are that any particular way be used 
<br>
at any particular time.
