I find it significantly more interesting, to add to this, that the
<br>
current fear around out of control AI parallels quite closely much of
<br>
the fear surrounding on one hand, likely ecological scenarios due to
<br>
overexploitation, and on the other hand, fears regarding the formation
<br>
of a big brother state marked by extremely one-sided power relations
<br>
and the loss of personal autonomy-- both quite contemporary fears
<br>
attributable to current events and the current paradigm of social
<br>
relations.
<br>
<p>One could, if one were so inclined, draw parallels to (not always pop)
<br>
science fiction in the 50's and how fears regarding alien
<br>
intelligences closely paralleled contemporary fears of communism.

<em>&gt;&gt; Physic humans with minimal upgrades or direct uploads: I'd say that if a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I may be making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a dangerous assumption here, but it seems unlikely that a logical being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would destroy something that may come in useful in the future in exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for a comparatively miniscule amount of storage space (heck at worst our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; genome is what, 5 MB? at least the plans to make a human would be seemingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; guaranteed to survive and singularity).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but again, 5MB of complexity (actually less) is miniscule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to the amount being generated daily by any individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted if we were to abstract away the generated complexity of all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity we may get some redundancy (I dont know, it depends on what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical framework one draws upon) but certainly it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 5MB.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But beyond this, how much will our true successors resemble today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humanity? I think it's impossible to make a concrete guess, but that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lower boundary of similarity is pretty far away.Uploaded humans will just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; emulations of running on vastly superior hardware. As anyone who's ever run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a hardware emulator on a modern computer knows, the amount of processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; power it takes is usually far larger than the processing power the hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; being emulated had, and hence the process is very inefficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I argued a similar point a few months ago--  If humans were to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emulated perfectly, the hardware running the emulation would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily more complex (Kolmogorov) than the emulated reality, down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the quantum level if any quantum effects have any effect on random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input available to individual humans (chaos theory applies, I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about quantum effects in the brain, but the non-predictability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of, for example, the microdynamics of thermal systems). It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus more efficient to observe, rather than emulate the system. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vastly superior intelligence would certainly be aware of this fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if it is at all interested in self-improvement (defined presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an increase in complexity and cognitive capability since this type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of goal would most probably fall near to the target area the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designers aimed for) then it may very well wish to preserve humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as broadly construed by this list) in some recognizable form simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it allows for a diversity of direction. I'm talking here about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction in terms of the likely evolutionary paths of human systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thought that a preserved humankind would take as distinct from ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an isolated AI would take-- it is an advantage to have a diversity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent systems if self-improvement is an end goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its somewhat analogous to the argument that biodiversity is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific (and thus ethical, as well as economic) end to itself. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only reason we harvest and exploit the biosphere to the extent we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now is because we're tremendously short-sighted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; least the uploaded humans would modify themselves to execute more natively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on whatever hardware exists, and once the self-tampering starts, when will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it stop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes self modification is fine. But we don't really know how that'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn out yet. Kinda like chimps trying to predict the stock market.
