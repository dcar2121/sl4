<em>&gt;&gt; But everyone can see that it's morally dubious, even those who profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from it. If this weren't so then no-one would make efforts to conceal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it and, by definition, it wouldn't be corruption. So there is a core
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of ethical principles common to almost everyone, even those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; routinely flout them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with that.  (Well, except for a few truly amoral or sociopathic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types.)
</em><br>
<p>I disagree (see my previous post on the subject). The mafia is not a
<br>
sociopathic institution (though it is degenerating into one). It used
<br>
to be a nationalistic organisation, with certain codes of honour, a
<br>
great respect for family values and religious ones, with certain
<br>
attributes of a government, and occasional bursts of benevolence. It
<br>
was all this, at the same time as it was a murder and extortion
<br>
racket.
<br>
<p>The great risks to human kind are precisely people who believe they
<br>
are behaving in a highly moral and ethical fashion; upgrading them on
<br>
their road to higher morality will make the situation worse, not
<br>
better. Corrupt politicians are better than rigid fanatics, unless we
<br>
are very lucky in our choice of rigid fanatics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I speculate that given this, the free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; availability of mind modification (changing one's own desires,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; including second and higher order desires) would bring about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fundamental change in society even if all else remained equal, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that this would be a change for the better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree. Thanks for clearing that up, and sorry if I didn't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your point earlier.
</em><br>
<p>I tend to disagree :-) Some people will get better, some will get
<br>
worse; and there will be less of the &quot;in-between types&quot; to link the
<br>
different groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At least people will pick for their *children* upright (even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no-nonsense and practical and real-world) behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Children who don't lie would be good, and, if thise were known,
<br>
wouldn't even be at a disadvantage. Children who will eternally cling
<br>
to the same religion, or to the same set of political ideas, are less
<br>
good.
<br>
<p>I could live with some sort of mandated flexibility, though; as long
<br>
as modifications don't totally close the door to evolution of
<br>
opinions, and as long as they remain realistically reversible, then I
<br>
think that self-modification wouldn't make the world any worse. But
<br>
could make it a lot more interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yeah, well, unfortunately fiction usually seems to require conflict,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it doesn't sound like there's much potential for conflict here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uploaded, people may live happily ever after, and that's all there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to it.
</em><br>
<p>The Culture novels take a good stab at describing a society where most
<br>
people are happyish. Ok, admitedly most of the action takes place away
<br>
from the Culture itself...
