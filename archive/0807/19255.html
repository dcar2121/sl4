Someone whose attribution was deleted allegedly said:
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, the difficulty I had in mind was the seeming impossibility of

<em>&gt; *proving* one's source code to another.

<em>&gt;If one SI had the details of how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other was historically constructed; if she has access to the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memory of the other, the physical makeup, follows her subroutines, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is convinced that the source code is robust against being overthrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by a secret command of the type above, then trust may be possible.
</em><br>
<p>Entity A could prove to entity B that it has source code S by
<br>
consenting to be replaced by a new entity A' that was constructed by a
<br>
manufacturing process jointly monitored by A and B.  During this
<br>
process, both A and B observe that A' is constructed to run source
<br>
code S.  After A' is constructed, A shuts down and gives all of its
<br>
resources to A'.
