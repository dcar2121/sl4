</em><br>
<p>Yes it is!  Yes it is!  :-)    In all the cases we know about, it 
<br>
took several hundred years for self rule of large powerful
<br>
nations to emerge.  Now it's no great trick for a small tribe.
<br>
Even Iceland has a very nice history to follow.  But---and
<br>
this is the key point---whenever population densities in human
<br>
history reach a certain level, a &quot;Great King&quot; or other autocrat
<br>
emerges.  Watch Babylon, Egypt, Rome, China, India, Greece
<br>
(fell to Alexander for *exactly* the usual reasons), and so on
<br>
and so on.
<br>
<p>England from 1215 to 1700 is the real case to study!  Just how
<br>
did the practices and institutions (that were so gleefully grabbed
<br>
and held on to by the American colonies by year 1730) ever
<br>
develop   *in spite of the power of the &quot;Great King&quot;*?  It
<br>
was unprecedented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We all have our favorite examples of  inefficiencies and ridiculousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's still the same fundamental  problems.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but millions of people (so far in history, given their own limitations
<br>
and their upbringing and their cultural baggage) simply NEVER spontaneously
<br>
go from domination of elites and a great King towards any sort of self rule.
<br>
<p>I'm surprised that by now you aren't starting to be just a bit frustrated
<br>
by how your own impeccably logical ideas don't seem to be affecting
<br>
thousands, yet alone millions, of fellow Americans.  They just look at
<br>
things differently.  Evolution takes a long, long time.
<br>
<p>It's fascinating to think what would happen if everyone woke up with
<br>
a minimal IQ of 140 tomorrow morning.  Would libertarianism and
<br>
minarchy and so on make more sense to them?  Would they be 
<br>
quicker to see what was in everyone's common interest?   I doubt it,
<br>
because how do you go from the status quo to there?  Yet I do think
<br>
that within 30 years, we would make great, great progress in the world
<br>
towards self rule.
