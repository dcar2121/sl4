<em>&gt; As for the original topic, I'd agree with X. It completely depends on how

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Also the most difficult to define.  Part of the process of developing a
<br>
positive singularity is to define what it means to be human, and which parts
<br>
are important and which are not; losing essential parts would be a negative
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we don't know enough to even begin to make probability statements on
<br>
such things with regards to a Singularity.  Whenever I try to rephrase the
<br>
question to coherently define what I meant by &quot;humanity,&quot; it becomes a far
<br>
murkier concept.
<br>
<p>In the interest of further discussion, I would ask that you define it
<br>
however you would like, and then assign a probability based on that
<br>
definition.  Possibly even multiple definitions with different
<br>
probabilities.
