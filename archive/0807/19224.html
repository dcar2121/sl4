<p>
Sorry, didn't want to get into another libertarian debate :-)
<br>
<p>My point was that trying to imagine what a post singularity world
<br>
would be like it hard, and that we needed to try and identify true
<br>
cultural universals that would still exist after a singularity,
<br>
assuming approximate humans are still around.
<br>
<p>One of those universals was the threat of violence, and the related
<br>
need for government.
<br>
<p>Then I went out on a limb, and took a guess at what the smartest
<br>
post-singluarity government would be like (in the practical sense, not
<br>
the philosphically ideal sense), assuming humans are allowed some say
<br>
in it. The main systems mentioned are AI dictatorship, and minarchies.
<br>
<p>The point I then made (but only implicitly) is that a choice of
<br>
government philosophy is a very complicated one, full of unexpected
<br>
consequences (communism, to cite but one; you can argue that the
<br>
excesses of communism were implicit from the beggining, but many
<br>
things were implicit in communism from the beggining, which never
<br>
happened). Knowing how a government system would work in practice is
<br>
very hard, based only on the theory.
<br>
<p>So the best guess we can make as to what the smartest government would
<br>
be like, is to take the smartest governments we have now (liberal
<br>
demoracies with large governments), and extrapolate SLIGHTLY. It won't
<br>
be a very good guess, but it'll probably be the best one we have.
<br>
<p>Hence my comments on creating a functioning minarchy in a large
<br>
developped country; if such an event comes to pass then that would be
<br>
strong evidence that a minarchy is a practical system of government,
<br>
rivaling liberal democracies, and thus an equal candidate for a
<br>
post-singularity government. But until then, we can't assume that a
<br>
minarchy would work; it is too far from systems that have worked to
<br>
have any confidence in that (as evidence of that distance, I point to
<br>
your own comment on US governmental GDP; and, if anything,
<br>
governmental interference is higher elsewhere in the developed world).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; THEN, if we have any say in the matter right now (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we probably won't have), would it be better or worse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Intelligence to allow complete freedom of resource usage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (up to, but, realistically, not including threats to itself)?
</em><br>
<p>I'd say that it probably is worse, simply because if there is an ideal
<br>
system of government (say a minarchy), then the AI should be imposing
<br>
it (at least initially), rather than letting humans struggle to figure
<br>
out what it is. (model for this: set down an amendable consitution).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, ought that Intelligence permit one to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; veridical historical reenactments?
</em><br>
<p>Ah! A call for a value judgement! :-) I'd be totally in favour, as
<br>
long as permanent death or severe torture is not a feature of these.
<br>
If they are features, then it gets more complicated, and depends on
<br>
the details of the society surrounding it.
<br>
