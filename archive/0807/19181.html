Pardon me for jumping in, but Bryan writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most of the ai scenarios that I remember reading in the literature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones that sounded like ai domnination takeover scenarios, involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer hacking and the 'illegal' downloading of information, and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here we see that it's supposed to obey such copyrights and property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights and individual rights and whatever else? That's a peculiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradiction, but I'm just pointing this out. It's not the big issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at stake here.
</em><br>
<p>An &quot;AI domination takeover scenario&quot; of the kind I think that
<br>
you have been reading about need be neither at one extreme
<br>
or the other. Indeed, it may hack into other computers in a
<br>
(Western technically illegal, or world immoral) fashion, and
<br>
maybe likewise &quot;illegally or immorally&quot; download certain
<br>
protected information, but that could be merely its means
<br>
to an end:   It *could* be, couldn't it, that after having taken
<br>
over, it institutes a near perfect system for various rights 
<br>
according to civilized standards, only exempting itself.
<br>
This is the very, very old idea of a benevolent dictatorship,
<br>
right?
<br>
<p>There need be nothing contradictory in that kind of scenario.
<br>
So what if we might consider it &quot;unprincipled&quot; at one point,
<br>
but then, after it's got power, &quot;very principled (but selfish
<br>
about control)&quot;.  Certain non-totalitarian dictators were like
<br>
that, e.g. Franco and Pinochet, who were all in favor of 
<br>
people having private property, good education, and total
<br>
freedom, with the sole exception that they got to imprison
<br>
and torture anyone who threatened their monopoly on
<br>
control (i.e. &quot;who was in charge&quot;).
