Call for Volunteers for SIAI Summer Research Project
<br>
<p>A goal of our SIAI Summer Research Project is to produce a probabilistic
<br>
model of future scenarios involving AGI growth and existential risk.
<br>
Ideally we would like to have a way of sharing such models with a broader
<br>
community, and inviting comments on our model, in a collaborative Web
<br>
application that combines the functionality of both a Bayesian net and a
<br>
wiki, and that allows end-users to tune model parameters and interactively
<br>
see the results of their tuning. Currently we know of no existing solution
<br>
that does what we need in this regard. We would like one or more programming
<br>
volunteers to assist with:
<br>
<p>1. Helping to research whether an existing solution exists; and,
<br>
<p>2. Helping to configure such a solution, if it exists, or
<br>
<p>3. Helping to implement a new solution, if no existing off-the-shelf
<br>
software meets
<br>
our needs.
<br>
<p>We would also like people with math/stats background to help us set up the
<br>
model: microeconomics, Bayesian time series modeling, or other math modeling
<br>
background would be particularly helpful.  People with background in social
<br>
sciences models and futurism, especially around AI, IA, MNT, or other
<br>
technologies would also be helpful.
<br>
<p><p>If you are willing to step forward and help, please send an email to
<br>
(address) and include:
<br>
<p>1. Your resume, or a brief description of your qualifications
<br>
<p>2. How many hours you have available to help during July and August of this
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>Much of the work is being done in Palo Alto, so you might also mention
<br>
whether you're in the Bay Area and whether you might be interested in
<br>
visiting.  We can buy plane tickets etc. for collaborators in some cases.
