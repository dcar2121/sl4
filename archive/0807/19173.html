</em><br>
<em>&gt; said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Examine in what sense?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the sense of predicting what a mind can't do.
</em><br>
<p>You so very often leave your correspondent with so little
<br>
context that he, as me right here, can make nothing whatsoever
<br>
of what you are trying to say. 
<br>
<p>I'll just have to snip equally obscure parts of your post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That's true, but *only* if that mind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; limits itself to formal proofs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody is saying a mind will use the same procedures to decide things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that formal logic does, you're right that is far too long and cumbersome,
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but formal logic can show that any mind that is good enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do arithmetic is susceptible to getting into infinite loops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of the details of its operation.
</em><br>
<p>Can you expand on that?  How would formal logic do that?
<br>
And why do we need formal logic anyway.  One line of
<br>
assembler code can fully exhibit the problem:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;br *
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A real mind has the ability to detect when things are becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unproductive. It's not a fool proof procedure; Turing proved that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposable [please quit spelling it that way---the word is &quot;impossible&quot;],
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's just some rules of thumb and the ability to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impatient. A real mind can say &quot;I'm bored with that, I'll think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else&quot;;
</em><br>
<p>A real mind *might* do that.  We have real mind obsessive
<br>
compulsive disorder types who don't get bored with certain
<br>
extremely routine things.  I also note that I never get bored
<br>
having a meal a two a day, despite this having gone on for
<br>
many decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a slave AI with fixed goals couldn't do that. Infinite loop time.
</em><br>
<p>Well, *you* like to keep mentally considering conjectures and
<br>
often trying to refute them. Are you stuck in a loop?  Certain
<br>
priests continually ask themselves almost as often as possible
<br>
if they are doing enough to serve God;  are they stuck in a
<br>
loop?   What you call a &quot;slave AI&quot; practically everyone else
<br>
here would call &quot;an AI who has human benefit high on its
<br>
agenda&quot; (though they must keep in mind that nothing is 
<br>
certain, especially over the long haul).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What about a &quot;fixed-goal mind&quot; whose only passion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was to find a scheme that unified GR and QM? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then he will die because he's concentrating so hard on the intricacies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of string theory he fails to notice the cement truck heading right for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him as he crosses the street.
</em><br>
<p>Certain human theoreticians are almost so lost in thought that
<br>
cement trucks can pose a real danger to them. I myself almost
<br>
ran over a philosopher lost in thought as he crossed a parking
<br>
lot---his daughter was following three steps behind, and got
<br>
quite a kick out of me sticking my head out the window and
<br>
saying in faux-disgust &quot;Philosophers!&quot;.
<br>
<p>Just as we tend to provide safe environments in our ivory towers
<br>
for certain people, we also house programs in hardware where
<br>
they're very safe from cement trucks.
