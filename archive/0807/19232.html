</em><br>
<p>Naturally, they may have each other's source code at hand,
<br>
and be able to study it at leisure. Doubtless they can even
<br>
make some general prognostications. But I'm sure that by
<br>
&quot;know&quot; you mean more than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If we assume that they start out without such knowledge, but each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wants the other gain it, what can they do? Can one SI prove to another what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; its source code is? Or, is there some other argument for why SIs might know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; each other's source code (beyond &quot;we don't know what SIs might be capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of, so we can't rule it out&quot;)?
</em><br>
<p>So perhaps you mean that each is actively altering his own
<br>
code in real time. It seems likely that each would be able
<br>
to desist from doing that for a little while, and just think 
<br>
about all the data they have. Let's further assume that they
<br>
do make available &quot;their data&quot; to each other, a whole yotta
<br>
data, to be sure.  Suddenly, then, they now have the same
<br>
data.

<p><em>&gt;I have two concerns-- one is one that I've voiced before--- simply,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can any machine emulate itself perfectly?
</em><br>
<p>It would seem necessary that the answer be &quot;no&quot;. Suppose that
<br>
a millisecond ago the machine was doing
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOV   AL,[SI]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOV   AX,[BX + DI]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INC     SI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INC     SI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEC    CX
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOV   SI,IOBUF
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>and it knows this, so it must load the first MOV instruction, 
<br>
execute it, store the result somewhere, load then second MOV
<br>
instruction, simulate it too, and continue.  Clearly, it will never
<br>
catch up with itself.           
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concern I have is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if a machine can apparently emulate itself, then it has free capacity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is not completely emulating itself (i.e. it would have to emulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself emulating itself, which of course eventually runs into problems.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, problems like the above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect that two machines of similar complexity and capacity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would run into a parallel concern.
</em><br>
<p>Seems clear to me too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Secondly, if the first concern turns out not to be a problem, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is the obvious concern of, well, the source code contributes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly negligible component of overall complexity to the SI in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question (analogous to our DNA's contribution), and sharing the source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code would perhaps yield some insight to the behaviour of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular machine....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would need to also convey the sum total of all input that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the machine has received since activation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I was calling that its data.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we could consider this to be part of the 'source code' but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then of course its not really source code in the way that we normally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construe it to be-- again, this is a distinction I've raised here before--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are our common metaphors 'memory' 'processing' 'storage' 'code'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even suitable here?
</em><br>
<p>I think that anyone familiar with computers will recognize the 
<br>
limitations of some of the metaphors.  On the whole, though,
<br>
I think that they work rather well.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I got the last word in when discussing it with
<br>
Eliezer (which is considerably easier to do than it is in
<br>
person).
<br>
<p>I wrote
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your AIs know each other's *code* but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not know each other's present *state*. Therefore
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cannot in confidence complete a model of the other's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behavior, unless &quot;always cooperate with an entity whose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source code I have read and whose source code contains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this statement or its equivalent&quot; is indeed part of the source
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code of each. But then, they would no longer have any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;option to be affected by other memes, such as the following:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What will happen if I Defect, [as] the a post *I* just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read on Extropians implies I could?&quot;
