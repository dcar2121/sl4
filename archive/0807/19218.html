<p><em>&gt;&gt; I agree with your generality, but not with your specifics. &quot;Dysentery&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not a libertarian idea, and as libertarian idealists point out, proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; medical prevention *could* be arranged by a free people who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; both smart enough, well educated enough, and farsighted enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no doubt about that; I've looked into some of those solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself, and most of them look like complicated and risky methods to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct an inefficient liberty-based version of something that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be accomplished much easier by governmental fiat.
</em><br>
<p>You speak as if arrogating to government the power to 
<br>
&quot;fiat this&quot; and &quot;fiat that&quot; is without grave risk.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not saying its a bad idea to do so, but it carries a large cos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (that might be compensated by an increase in liberty, but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a philosophical question).
</em><br>
<p>Well, don't forget the enormous costs of an unchecked government.
<br>
Currently some enormous fraction of United States GNP is 
<br>
absorbed by the government, with little result to point to except
<br>
interference in free market wealth creation, discouragement of
<br>
individual incentive, and various &quot;earmarks&quot; of corruption. What
<br>
day is it in June now that Americans can say that they're finally
<br>
working for themselves and not the government?  Or has it passed
<br>
into July?  In any case, the U.S. is emblematic of the problem
<br>
which in a number of European countries is already much in &quot;advance&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To put in economic terms, negative externalities (it is to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of every parent to have every child immunized, except their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own). To solve these you need most people to be not only smart but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruistic, and to have some mechanism for them to organise their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruistic impulses. If some people are not altruistic enough, and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the externalities are sufficiently large, you need compulsion (maybe a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soft, financial version of compulsion, but some compulsion non the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a certain, though quite limited, number of examples like
<br>
this are to my way of thinking correct. But returning to a
<br>
relevant angle.....
<br>
<p>Suppose (i) the entire solar system were to fall under the
<br>
sway of a single multifaceted intelligence vastly, vastly more
<br>
capable than its human creators, (ii) somehow humans as
<br>
presently  constituted (or equivalent uploads) are allowed
<br>
control of some small fraction of solar resources (iii) a certain
<br>
reader permits this discussion to proceed on these four
<br>
assumptions without interjecting that we should all drop
<br>
these ideas and get to work right now on concrete steps
<br>
for improving our lot, and (iv) the resources allocated to
<br>
each of some billions of humans are compute intensive
<br>
enough to allow for quite possibly very novel developments.
<br>
<p>THEN, if we have any say in the matter right now (which
<br>
we probably won't have), would it be better or worse for
<br>
that Intelligence to allow complete freedom of resource usage
<br>
(up to, but, realistically, not including threats to itself)?
<br>
For example, ought that Intelligence permit one to create
<br>
veridical historical reenactments?
