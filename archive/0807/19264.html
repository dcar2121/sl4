<em>&gt; Entity A could prove to entity B that it has source code S by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consenting to be replaced by a new entity A' that was constructed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing process jointly monitored by A and B.  During this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, both A and B observe that A' is constructed to run source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code S.  After A' is constructed, A shuts down and gives all of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to A'.
</em><br>
<p>Good idea. This should reduce the problem to a pure monitoring issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An agent making a copy of itself would have the same problem. It could not verify that the copy is exact. It has to trust the copy process.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes. Just as it has to trust that its code is not getting
<br>
rewritten day to day by large scale coherent quantum fluctuations.
<br>
<p>The copying process just needs to be accurate to within x%, with the
<br>
agent aware of this x% and in agreement with the risk. The agent
<br>
expects to gain from the process; depending on its utility (including
<br>
its attitude to risk), it will determine whether the x% is acceptable
<br>
or not.
<br>
<p>Perfection doesn't exist, and is not required.
<br>
