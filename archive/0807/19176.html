<p>One doesn't start out knowing about the world.  One learns about it.  A three 
<br>
year old may have ontologies and know about object persistence, but a new 
<br>
born doesn't, and presumably you aren't doing basic restructuring after it 
<br>
becomes intelligent (i.e., when you're through writing it), only before hand.
<br>
<p>So that nascent AI has the capability to learn about cars, trees, people, 
<br>
etc., but that knowledge isn't built in.  Therefore the goals that are 
<br>
built-in need to be created without reference to such things...except to the 
<br>
extend that you rely on &quot;imprinting&quot; (which can produce results that are a 
<br>
bit iffy).   This makes creating a set of goals that will result in an AI 
<br>
that's both friendly and useful a bit tricky...and I say this without even 
<br>
having tried it once.  (Partially because the exact form that such goals 
<br>
would take are highly dependent upon the exact internal structure of the mind 
<br>
of the nascent AI.)
