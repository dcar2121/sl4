<p>Oh, okay. How's that death thing working out for you? Kinda sucks, eh?

<p><em>&gt; Yes, but millions of people (so far in history, given their own

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>They already are able to behave in whatever way their brains come up 
<br>
with, to the extent that the implementation is available and so on, and 
<br>
whether or not they would survive a switch wasn't what I was hoping at 
<br>
getting at -- remember, we were talking about &quot;Solar System 
<br>
Governments&quot; (your words) and the general ai domination scenarios (my 
<br>
characterization) that are thrown around here, one ai to rule them all 
<br>
and such. Specifically we were talking about 'property rights' and I 
<br>
was wondering how it is that you want an ai to behave in some 
<br>
characterized manner with respect to them (hint: the characterization 
<br>
is actually incomplete but nobody admits this methinks). All of these 
<br>
layers -- ai domination, property rights, governments, these are just 
<br>
layers on top of the individual agents, and these layers are by no 
<br>
means 'magical', they can be created, recreated, destroyed, and most 
<br>
importantly redesigned, and they tend to show up on their own. Look at 
<br>
all the random micronations, perhaps. Anyway, these layers can be 
<br>
likened to onion layers, which are wrapped around the actual thing that 
<br>
we are all interested in here -- intelligence, i.e. that person walking 
<br>
around with a skull and all of those silly social dynamics issues that 
<br>
we don't really care about. We're here for whatever the hell that 
<br>
intelligence is. All of the hypotheticals about implementation of an ai 
<br>
dominated society are ridiculous -- it doesn't actually have anything 
<br>
to do with intelligence. Whether or not people happen to not know how 
<br>
to live isn't the issue (in truth, nobody does anyway); if you're 
<br>
afraid people will die, fine, let's go engineer solutions to those 
<br>
problems, but let's not mix it up with the task of ai engineering and 
<br>
design. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm surprised that by now you aren't starting to be just a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustrated by how your own impeccably logical ideas don't seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affecting thousands, yet alone millions, of fellow Americans.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just look at things differently.  Evolution takes a long, long time.
</em><br>
<p>I am not confused. What are these &quot;impeccably logical ideas&quot; that you 
<br>
neglect to mention ? In other words, just what is it that you are 
<br>
expecting of me?
