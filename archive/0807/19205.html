<p>
<em>&gt; So there is a core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ethical principles common to almost everyone, even those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routinely flout them.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is. The core principles are a liking for people similar to
<br>
yourself, a desire to punish others for violating common values, a
<br>
disdain of incest, a loose prohibition against killing in most
<br>
circumstances, and... and that's about it.
<br>
<p>People don't hide what they do because they feel it's imoral; they
<br>
hide it because there are costs to be seen doing something imoral. The
<br>
mafia sees itself as a very moral organisation. So did the communists,
<br>
and so did the suffragets, and so did those who thundered against
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can't know exactly how the availability of self-modification would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change society without doing the experiment, but I believe that even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without direction from above it would be for the better. I base this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the assumption that there are more bad people who wish they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good than good people who wish they were bad.
</em><br>
<p>Everyone in the world wishes they were good (or at least, better than
<br>
what they are). But that doesn't help if their values of &quot;good&quot; are
<br>
wrong! Osama bin Laben probably wishes he were more devout; the
<br>
tibetans pray that they be better able to contain their anger at the
<br>
chinese invasion; soldiers wish they could inflict violence without
<br>
sufferring mentaly for it; politicians want to overcome all their
<br>
personal weaknesses apart from ambition. Those going through a crisis
<br>
of faith wish they were not prone to doubts; the fat wish they could
<br>
eat less; so do the anorexic.
<br>
<p>Just take the tragectory of one life, going through lots of urges,
<br>
events, beliefs, causes, certainties and doubts, and imagine the
<br>
varrying consequences of giving that individual the possibility to
<br>
self-modify - at different stages of his life.
<br>
<p>The picture is all over the place! Some people will get better
<br>
according to our standards, some would get worse. I think society as a
<br>
whole would get worse, because groups would have greater difficulty
<br>
relating to one another, as the middle of the road individuals would
<br>
be in short supply.
<br>
