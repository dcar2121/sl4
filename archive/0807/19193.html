</em><br>
<p>I am not convinced that 'justification' makes sense when it comes to 
<br>
governments, or any generalized human organizational system. There's 
<br>
design decisions that could be justified, I suppose, but I don't know 
<br>
if justifying them and all that they do in one swoop is a useful action 
<br>
to take. So, collective action problems. Note that the emergence of 
<br>
peer-to-peer technology (pen, paper, computer, transceivers, ...) means 
<br>
that deploying simple algorithms on a personal level precludes the use 
<br>
of a centralized governing algorithm. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So purely individual solutions to these sort of problems strike me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very unlikely. It seems that people's desciptions of a post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity world always boost the aspects that make individuals more
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, finiteness of ressources, fast evolution filling the world with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing copies, hacks to make other minds more malleable, etc...)
</em><br>
<p>That's an interesting observation, but take, for instance, the 
<br>
distinction that you make between autonomous (extreme mobility) and 
<br>
dependencies (offensive weaponary). It's well known that the top of the 
<br>
line aircrafts are offensive weaponary in the militaries. The 
<br>
difference? ITER to try to keep information from leaking out (even 
<br>
though it doesn't work - I refer you to the build-your-own-missile-man, 
<br>
who has been MIA on the net for a few years now).
<br>
<p>In the case of immune system threats, consider the current methodology 
<br>
of fighting back infections via the transferance of immune defense 
<br>
mechanisms, antibodies, etc. So it's already on an individual level to 
<br>
a large degree, and sometimes the medical science behind vaccinations 
<br>
is just being exposed to a very strongly quantified amount of the 
<br>
harmful agents.
<br>
<p>There's also security measures to keep brains from blowing up, but a 
<br>
good system administrator would be employing multiple strategies at the 
<br>
same time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, despite the arguments here, a society of humans able to modify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their minds at will is probably not going to gravitate to something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasant. On the other hand, it might not take much in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercive interventions to allow such things to happen. In fact, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be enough for the AI to gift humans with many technologies, push
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them in certain self-modifying directions, and then turn itself off,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create a positive dynamic equilibirum.
</em><br>
<p>Why singular (the) AI?
