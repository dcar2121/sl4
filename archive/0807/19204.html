<em>&gt; England from 1215 to 1700 is the real case to study!  Just how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did the practices and institutions (that were so gleefully grabbed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and held on to by the American colonies by year 1730) ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop   *in spite of the power of the &quot;Great King&quot;*?  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was unprecedented.
</em><br>
<p>No, not unprecedented. It was the stability and endurance of these
<br>
practices that was unprecedented.
<br>
<p>Though I suspect that had germany been an island, something similar
<br>
might have developped there; possibly in arab spain as well, had it
<br>
endured.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It's fascinating to think what would happen if everyone woke up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a minimal IQ of 140 tomorrow morning.  Would libertarianism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minarchy and so on make more sense to them?  Would they be quicker to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what was in everyone's common interest?   I doubt it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because how do you go from the status quo to there?  Yet I do think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that within 30 years, we would make great, great progress in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards self rule.
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting to dig a little into this, because it reveals an idea
<br>
that pops up often on this list. The idea runs along the lines of &quot;a
<br>
lot of smart people are libertarians, so if more people were smart,
<br>
then more people would be libertarian&quot;. Sometimes the argument extends
<br>
as far as &quot;after a singularity, eveyone will be smart, so everyone
<br>
will be libertarian&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are lots of reasons that smart people are libertarian (a big one
<br>
is the fact that a libertarian society would benefit smart people a
<br>
lot more than stupid people). It does not mean that libertarianism is
<br>
automatically a smart idea. It has some aspects that are
<br>
unquestionably smart (mostly in economics, and individual autonomy)
<br>
but there are many cases throughout history when libertarian ideas
<br>
were unquestionally stupid and harmful (dysentery and other disease
<br>
control, the Irish famine, market crashes (the tulip market in Holland
<br>
and the south sea bubble chief among them), laissez-faire educational
<br>
policies in underdeveloped countries, etc...)
<br>
<p>So what sort of problem scream out emphatically for a non-libertarian
<br>
solution? They tend to be problems that have all the following
<br>
properties:
<br>
1) The problem is sizeable
<br>
2) The solution is pretty evident
<br>
3) The solution requires the cooperation of many different individuals
<br>
working seemlesly together
<br>
4) A small amount of defections can ruin the solution
<br>
5) The solution is not an equilibrium of individual self-interested actions
<br>
<p>There is also a non-necessary six: 6) Individuals do not have access
<br>
to reliable information
<br>
<p>Why do we assume that such problems will become rarer when everyone
<br>
becomes smarter?
<br>
In previous posts, I've focused on violence issues, because war is an
<br>
easy example of the above; but there are many others, and there will
<br>
be many more in future.
<br>
<p>I suspect a post-singularity civilisation will be more libertarian in
<br>
a lot of ways, but also less libertarian in a lot of other ways (some
<br>
of which we can't imagine today; there may come a time when there is a
<br>
strong governmental prohibition on certain types of abstract
<br>
mathematical thinking :-)
