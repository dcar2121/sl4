<em>&gt;&gt; It's fascinating to think what would happen if everyone woke up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a minimal IQ of 140 tomorrow morning.  Would libertarianism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; minarchy and so on make more sense to them?  Would they be quicker to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what was in everyone's common interest?   I doubt it, because how do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you go from the status quo to there?  Yet I do think that within 30 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we would make great, great progress in the world towards self rule.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are lots of reasons that smart people are libertarian (a big one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the fact that a libertarian society would benefit smart people a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot more than stupid people). It does not mean that libertarianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically a smart idea.
</em><br>
<p>You're right:  it does not automatically mean that libertarianism is
<br>
a &quot;smart idea&quot;. What is means is that a lot of what I'm calling &quot;self-rule&quot;,
<br>
closely related to libertarianism, is being held back by sheer economic
<br>
ignorance. Most people, even most people with economic degrees
<br>
pumped out to uncaring students who need a college degree, simply
<br>
don't understand how the free market works or what price signals are.
<br>
They *still* believe that central control is superior, though were they
<br>
to pick up *any* economics text book of the last decade they'd find
<br>
out that this is simply wrong.
<br>
<p>But, yes, we must keep my observation there distinct from the notion
<br>
that many people simply (and will always) *prefer* a certain amount
<br>
of what some of us might deride as &quot;nanny government&quot;.  But that
<br>
all depends on the individual.  I'm towards the &quot;free&quot; and &quot;self-responsibility&quot;
<br>
end of the spectrum, but not nearly so far as are many.  Given our
<br>
Western culture at its present level, there seem to me to be many
<br>
aspects of self-rule that we're simply not ready for.  So far as I can
<br>
see, we need government run centers of disease control, government
<br>
oversight of financial markets, government roads and infrastructure
<br>
and on and on.
<br>
<p>But I cannot refute the arguments of those who point out that all these
<br>
things could be supplied by freedom, by free activities of free people,
<br>
and by markets and price signals. I just think that Joe six-pack 
<br>
could not at present either comprehend these possibilities, nor 
<br>
react appropriately were they made available to him.  Now if his
<br>
level of education and his IQ were higher, *some* of that would
<br>
change. But only some. Many people just simply like communal
<br>
living and communal responsibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has some aspects that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquestionably smart (mostly in economics, and individual autonomy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but there are many cases throughout history when libertarian ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were unquestionably stupid and harmful (dysentery and other disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control, the Irish famine, market crashes (the tulip market in Holland
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the south sea bubble chief among them), laissez-faire educational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies in underdeveloped countries, etc...)
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your generality, but not with your specifics. &quot;Dysentery&quot; is
<br>
not a libertarian idea, and as libertarian idealists point out, proper
<br>
medical prevention *could* be arranged by a free people who were
<br>
both smart enough, well educated enough, and farsighted enough. I
<br>
only say that right now we don't have quite enough people like that,
<br>
although we have, say in Europe, about twenty times per capita the
<br>
number of people who *could* do it than we have in the Zaire.
<br>
<p>The Irish famine was to a great extent produced by *government*.
<br>
Had the free market, where those who produce goods get to keep
<br>
them and trade them freely both internally and externally, it would
<br>
never have happened.  The &quot;tulip market&quot;?  Well, yes, people who
<br>
who like to gamble and have the freedom to do so sometimes lose
<br>
their shirts. So what?  Take their freedoms away?  What about a
<br>
government oversight committee today that would keep you from
<br>
playing the stock market because you might do something stupid?
<br>
You surely don't want that too.
<br>
<p>And laissez-faire educational systems work fine in most Western,
<br>
advanced nations, and most countries are ready for them. But
<br>
not impoverished third world countries who are hundreds if not
<br>
thousands of years behind culturally. They're not even ready for
<br>
rudimentary democracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what sort of problem scream out emphatically for a non-libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution? They tend to be problems that have all the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) The problem is sizeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The solution is pretty evident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The solution requires the cooperation of many different individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working seamlessly together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) A small amount of defections can ruin the solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) The solution is not an equilibrium of individual self-interested actions
</em><br>
<p>Basically, I agree.  But for each *particular* question, unlike
<br>
your generalities, the question could be asked, &quot;are we ready
<br>
yet to do it ourselves, or do we still need rulers for that?&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is also a non-necessary six: 6) Individuals do not have access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reliable information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do we assume that such problems will become rarer when everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes smarter?
</em><br>
<p>I wager that if you give concrete examples, we can see that at some
<br>
level of education and some level of knowledge and familiarity with
<br>
liberty's potential, free solutions can and do exist.  But there will be
<br>
others, e.g. group or national defense, that perhaps don't exist, or
<br>
don't given any kind of humans that currently exist on Earth. 
<br>
<p>So what are the implications of all this for either AI domination
<br>
scenarios, human self-modification and enhancement, and other
<br>
trends and possibilities we foresee?
<br>

<p><em>&gt; In previous posts, I've focused on violence issues, because war is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy example of the above; but there are many others, and there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be many more in future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect a post-singularity civilisation will be more libertarian in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of ways, but also less libertarian in a lot of other ways (some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which we can't imagine today; there may come a time when there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong governmental prohibition on certain types of abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical thinking :-)
