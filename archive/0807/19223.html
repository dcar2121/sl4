The lack of bottlenecks is the extraordinary thing. When making things
<br>
bigger, or moving faster, extra strains are put on the structure;
<br>
pieces need to be reinforced, energy needs to be stored, and so there
<br>
are a host of problems you have to deal with, none directly helping
<br>
make the thing bigger or faster, but essential nonetheless.
<br>
<p>With Moore's law, all you need to do (simplifying) is to make
<br>
transistors smaller. The extraordinary thing is that all the attendant
<br>
changes you need to make (cooling, isolating components from each
<br>
other, etc...) seem to be minor and cheap; so designers can focus
<br>
almost entirely on making the transistors smaller. A single problem,
<br>
rather than a multitude.
<br>
<p>There are quantitative improvements as well, but these seem to come at
<br>
about the rate you'd expect for technological inovations. They
<br>
conveniently remove the bottlenecks from the &quot;make this smaller&quot;
<br>
process, though. I think the self-fulfilling property aspect of
<br>
Moore's law might explain these quantative improvements, but the
<br>
general pace of &quot;make it smaller&quot; is dictated by the fact that it is a
<br>
single problem.
<br>
<p>Lastly, the self-fullfilling aspect may provide an UPPER bound on the
<br>
rate of improvement. If software creators have certain expectations,
<br>
they will design their software to Moore's law; therefore any dramatic
<br>
improvement much faster than this is a commercial waste, especially
<br>
since design ideas are quickly copied.

<em>&gt; Me, Anna Salamon, and Steve Rayhawk are building a computer model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risks and what causes them. Currently, we're looking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information on what causes Moore's Law-style exponentials in computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware, so we can predict what will happen given conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from those of the past forty years. The current favorite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories seem to be that 1)., Moore's Law was a self-fulfilling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prophecy because it was used to set industry goals, and 2)., most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological growth is exponential, because the rate at which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology improves is proportional to the amount of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already in existence. Any links to other theories, or literature on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject, would be greatly appreciated.
