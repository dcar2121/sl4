<em>&gt; It will be done by well-funded groups, by corporations, with, I

<p>Is this what your magic eight balls says?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whatever the hell that intelligence is. All of the hypotheticals

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Since this has to be about the Nth time around here, give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; me a hand.  Why do we keep talking past each other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do you dismiss entirely *out of hand*  the *possibility*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; of an adverse AI takeover?  In other words, when I ask again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; as I always do, WHY IS IT RIDICULOUS, for some reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; your answer just goes right by me. Look deeper.  What am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; failing to see?  What about my position are you failing to see?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, it's not that it's impossible, I'm disagreeing that it's such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; big issue. Yes, I am aware of the arguments for computronium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conversion, malicious ai, and so on, and I've mentioned various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solutions to the problems that we are worrying about, like people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and them dying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry for interrupting, but what is your solution for dying again?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you checked it out with people who've been studying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging and age-reversal for decades? I'll bet your solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all hand-wavy----and you can post twenty (or two thousand)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; links to helpful information that &quot;we&quot; could indeed use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of aging, but you haven't solved it. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one else has.  Or will for a long time.
</em><br>
<p>So, let's say it's not &quot;my&quot; solution for not dying, and let's just call 
<br>
it Aubrey's. I was only using it as a general reference to the fact 
<br>
that people are working on it. People are -- not magical unicorns. So 
<br>
if you really care about people not dying, go pursue that work, set up 
<br>
giant archives and impressive life support systems, deploy better 
<br>
ambulantory capacities, whatever it might take. But please don't 
<br>
confuse that with the issues of the design, construction and 
<br>
feasability issues of intelligence. You respnod to this same line 
<br>
below ..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, what's so ridiculous is that we have to consider those things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when building intelligence. Yes, I am aware of 'byproducts', and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that's certainly a worthwhile consideration, but we can solve those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems anyway, so why is everyone still debating ai within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; context of dominator scenarios when we know that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solutions swimming about in our minds? So instead of focusing on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those issues, let's get to work, eh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://heybryan.org/buildingbrains.html">http://heybryan.org/buildingbrains.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://heybryan.org/humancortex.html">http://heybryan.org/humancortex.html</a> (I just added this one today),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and <a href="http://heybryan.org/recursion">http://heybryan.org/recursion</a> (the classic).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That last link is bad.  The reason my response is so late is that I
</em><br>
<p>The last link should have been <a href="http://heybryan.org/recursion.html">http://heybryan.org/recursion.html</a> .
<br>
<p><em>&gt; read the first two links.  They do outline a lot of work. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, I'm already fully employed, and don't expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve much in the way of doing some serious programming each time I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see one of your links, or each time I see a new model that that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really contribute towards progress in brain mapping; and besides, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how would this be integrated into the total world researcher dataset
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I know what you mean by integrated here, or really the 
<br>
world researcher dataset -- do you mean the user of the system that was 
<br>
mentioned from the brain mapping context / perspective of things? Like 
<br>
adding collected data to stuff that is internet-accessible? That's 
<br>
usually just a simple httpd server daemon, or some other protocol 
<br>
service, if that's what you mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; anyway? Any system administrator of a brain or even of managing these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformations might be interested in managing I/O, phenotypic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback, biofeedback, neurofeedback, acoustic feedback, or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our human cortex gene expression data set---just what we already have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here and what has been linked to in our discussions here---could, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose,  be displayed over the Google Maps API or something very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to it, and then this could indeed be used for neurotagging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the correlation of information to specific regions of the map,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while also giving users an interface for managing that information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection views... but what would this lead to? Search me! I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea, but it does sound like it could lead to something, no?
</em><br>
<p>Just as a network administrator manages a cluster of boxes, you can 
<br>
manage the brain. Even in your day to day interactions, like opting to 
<br>
partake in the consumption of coffee. Analogies to intensive care units 
<br>
would be appropriate, since that's what medical professionals are doing 
<br>
anyway -- just that this level of detail is hardly spent on situations 
<br>
not involving the large possibility of death. So if we have this 
<br>
computational system for this monitoring as well as augmentation, in a 
<br>
systematic, quantifiable manner we could work on all (well, most -- I 
<br>
wouldn't recommend self-trepanation) of these (personalized) transhuman 
<br>
technologies we're interested in. [This doesn't get us the replicators, 
<br>
for instance.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But as to the specific question you raise &quot;so why is everyone still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating ai within the context of dominator scenarios when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that there are solutions swimming about in our minds?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Entertainment? Because some of us lack confidence that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; churn out lab-tested solutions before total senescence takes over?
</em><br>
<p>But that's just the point -- if you isolate the basis of intelligence 
<br>
you can exploit it as it exists now to develop those technologies if 
<br>
you are so unconfident of just one brain doing it. How many brains 
<br>
until you feel confident? One? Two? Three? Thousands?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Whether or not people happen to not know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to live isn't the issue (in truth, nobody does anyway); if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you're afraid people will die, fine, let's go engineer solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to those problems, but let's not mix it up with the task of ai
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; engineering and design. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; There you go again.  &quot;Let's go engineer solutions.&quot;  When, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; afternoon?  Later this evening?  Actually, my next two weekends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Next few seconds. What's your number again? Nevermind, I have it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'll call you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is not an answer! You're deep in trouble friend, someone christ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - king of the jews. You can someone in your state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be so cool about our fate?
</em><br>
<p>You asked when .. [and the reference is lost on me. I did my searching, 
<br>
still can't get it. Are you Jesus?]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm saying that many people here consider it interesting or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruitful to consider the logical possibilities inherent in a sudden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI takeoff. Okay, so you don't.  Then maybe you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider not replying to posts like that, imploring, (the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do) that the subject be changed.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I'm digging in a dry well.
