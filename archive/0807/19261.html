<br>
<em>&gt;No. The backup disk is part of the computer. Its original contents are lost.
</em><br>
<p>So you stand by your bold assertion that backing up computers is
<br>
impossible.  The backup media are defined to be part of the computer
<br>
that's being backed up, so the loss of previous contents of the backup
<br>
media is a failure of the backup.  Odd.  
<br>
<p>I back up to blank CD's that are not part of the computer.  Offsite
<br>
backups are both important and possible.  If you don't have a regular
<br>
and personal reminder that the backup media aren't part of the
<br>
computer being backed up, you should improve your backup processes.
<br>
<p>The analogy with the original problem is valid -- if raw materials
<br>
cannot be found to construct a new A', then there's no analogue of
<br>
blank backup media available.  Someone would have to reduce their
<br>
scope to make room to construct a new A'.  This implies that the
<br>
process is not free, but it doesn't imply that the process is
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;More generally, two machines cannot know each other's states because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then each machine would have more information than the other (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measured by Kolmogorov complexity).
</em><br>
<p>The state of a machine is a function of the machine and the
<br>
observation time.  Your statement is incoherent because you're
<br>
omitting the observation times.
<br>
<p>I do not intend to reply to you on this thread any more unless the
<br>
quality of your arguments dramatically improves.
