<p><em>&gt; I don't think that it's &quot;natural&quot; for a created entity to have any particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal structure.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; derived goal from almost any other goal.  OTOH, I do think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's probably desirable.
</em><br>
<p>You and Isaac Asimov both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Derived goals all refer back to either primary or secondary goals for their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, almost all conversation about goals presumes extensive knowledge of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external world.  I don't see how this could be possible for either the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary or the secondary goals.  E.g., how are you going to define &quot;human&quot; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an entity that has never interacted with one, either directly or indirectly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that that probably only has a vague idea of object persistence?
</em><br>
<p>The thing hardly qualifies as an AI if it doesn't have the ontology
<br>
of a three year old. And if an AI can understand what trees, cars,
<br>
tablespoons, and about twenty thousand other items are---that is,
<br>
can reliably classify them from either sight (pictures) or feel---then
<br>
it's going to know what a human being is, though (just as with 
<br>
any of us) it will be undecided about some borderline cases.

<p><em>&gt;  The only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach that occurs to me is via imprinting, and that is notorious for its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drawbacks.  This could probably be dealt with via a large number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;micro-imprints&quot;, but then one encounters the problem of sensory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-constancy.  I'm sure this can be dealt with...but just how I'm not sure.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Possibly it would be desirable to have AIs practice Ahimsa, but I'm not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really sure that's logically possible.  Still, a strong desire to cause the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimal amount of damage coupled with a weaker desire to help entities might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get us through this.  True, this means that somehow the concepts of &quot;damage&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;helpful&quot; need to be communicated to an entity that doesn't have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of object-permanence...and I don't see just how to do THAT, but it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks like a much simpler problem than defining &quot;human&quot; to such an entity.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (But you'd need to balance things carefully, or you'd end up with an AI that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did nothing but &quot;meditate&quot;, which wouldn't be particularly useful.
