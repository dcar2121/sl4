Stuart, Bryan, and Stathis and probably others earlier write like this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2008/7/8 Stuart Armstrong &lt;<a href="mailto:dragondreaming@googlemail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Property%20rights">dragondreaming@googlemail.com</a>&gt;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So, despite the arguments here, a society of humans able to modify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their minds at will is probably not going to gravitate to something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pleasant. On the other hand, it might not take much in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; coercive interventions to allow such things to happen. In fact, it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be enough for the AI to gift humans with many technologies, push them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in certain self-modifying directions, and then turn itself off, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; create a positive dynamic equilibrium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can't know exactly how the availability of self-modification would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change society without doing the experiment, but I believe that even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without direction from above it would be for the better. I base this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the assumption that there are more bad people who wish they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good than good people who wish they were bad.
</em><br>
<p>and it seems to me a very crucial point is going unaddressed:
<br>
<p>Surely, you must admit, it depends on the capabilities of the individuals
<br>
who emerge from the history at a particular point.  Probably even
<br>
cultural aspects of their historical situation determine just as much. 
<br>
<p>I posit that in many cases the people simply are not capable of self-rule
<br>
or are absolutely too unprepared for it by their own cultural history.
<br>
We also can surely judge that this was the case in many historical societies
<br>
we're aware of.
<br>
<p>Even today in the United States, I see many shortcomings on the part
<br>
of so many individuals that it precludes a completely libertarian form
<br>
of government from functioning here.  Americans (and many other
<br>
descendants of western civilization around the globe) are indeed capable
<br>
of quite a bit, but a strict anarchy, minarchy, or perhaps even mild libertarian
<br>
society is presently beyond them, I sadly conclude.  
<br>
<p>For in too many cases in such a completely free society, collectives
<br>
would simply naturally evolve, and pretty soon any prudent person
<br>
would find it necessary to suck up to the local gang lord or protector.
<br>
In America, we saw exactly what happens in large cities filled with
<br>
recent immigrants (e.g. Chicago in the 1920s) or with people whose
<br>
small town experiences of democracy were insufficient to meet the 
<br>
challenges of urban life. It became very easy for criminal elements to
<br>
infiltrate the local law establishment, and even coerce newspapers
<br>
and others into seeing things their way.  And today in Los Angeles,
<br>
if you want to really know who controls a neighborhood or controls
<br>
the streets, very often it's by no means the police or any lawfully set up
<br>
organization.
<br>
<p>Lee
