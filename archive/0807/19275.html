<p>
In that case I'll break it down, all in the case that a positive singularity
<br>
does, in fact, occur:
<br>
<p>Physic humans with minimal upgrades or direct uploads: I'd say that if a
<br>
singularity of any kind does occur there will be some intelligences left
<br>
which are regonizable in cognizance. Whether existing in a sandbox
<br>
simulating the current world or fleeing the inner system, who knows, but I
<br>
find it extremely unlikely that any AI wouldn't want to keep at least a few
<br>
of its creators around, at least in a stored form for study.I may be making
<br>
a dangerous assumption here, but it seems unlikely that a logical being
<br>
would destroy something that may come in useful in the future in exchange
<br>
for a comparatively miniscule amount of storage space (heck at worst our
<br>
genome is what, 5 MB? at least the plans to make a human would be seemingly
<br>
guaranteed to survive and singularity).
<br>
<p>But beyond this, how much will our true successors resemble today's
<br>
humanity? I think it's impossible to make a concrete guess, but that the
<br>
lower boundary of similarity is pretty far away.Uploaded humans will just be
<br>
emulations of running on vastly superior hardware. As anyone who's ever run
<br>
a hardware emulator on a modern computer knows, the amount of processing
<br>
power it takes is usually far larger than the processing power the hardware
<br>
being emulated had, and hence the process is very inefficient. At the very
<br>
least the uploaded humans would modify themselves to execute more natively
<br>
on whatever hardware exists, and once the self-tampering starts, when will
<br>
it stop?
