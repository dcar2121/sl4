<p>
<em>&gt; Most people who act in a way that they consider completely moral won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to change anything. If they have a twinge of guilt about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something then they are more likely to modify their minds so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their behaviour changes in a way that will diminish the guilt, or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modify themselves at all, rather than the alternative solution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply removing the guilt.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And while it is easy enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of situations where guilt can push someone in the direction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater evil, for example jihadist who feels guilty because he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squeamish about killing infidels, I still think that in the majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cases guilt would tend to drive people to modify themselves in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to behave better, not worse; &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; being loosely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined as what the majority of people would undestand by those terms.
</em><br>
<p>The vatican would make itself more dogmatic on the condom issue...
<br>
Anti-free traders would live up to their beliefs and become more vocal
<br>
about them... anyone in a semi-repressive environment (even a
<br>
repressive family environment) would be pressured to make the &quot;right&quot;
<br>
modification to their mental make-ups... companies would only offer
<br>
jobs to those who can prove they have modified to unswerving
<br>
loyalty...
<br>
<p>The &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; of the individual is practically irrelevant
<br>
compared with the format they express that feeling. A psychopathic
<br>
killer serving his country loyaly on the battlefield is much better
<br>
than the devout, considerate, kindly, compassionate bishop denying
<br>
condoms to africans, or the aid worker pushing well-meaning but
<br>
erroneous solutions on the populations.
<br>
<p>The biger problem is that people's beliefs in how the world works is
<br>
only tangentially related to reality. Self modification will increase
<br>
this gap, not diminish it; we may soon see the rise of the dogmatisms,
<br>
in a much more potent form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I expect there would be great pressure for people to conform to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general standard of moral behaviour. There is such pressure today, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we all reluctantly acknowledge that there will be people who behave in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antisocial ways because, without getting into a whole discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free will, they can't help it. This excuse won't count for much if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone can easily change their nature to whatever they want.
</em><br>
<p>But based on what most people think today, once of the first things
<br>
they'll do is make themselves less worried about the opinions of
<br>
others. Few people value conformity to &quot;whole human population&quot;, so
<br>
conformity impulses will be the first ones out the window, replaced by
<br>
rabbid individuals or tightly knit opposing groups.
<br>
<p>The more I think about it, the less attractive uncontrolled
<br>
self-modification sounds :-)
<br>
<p>Stuart
