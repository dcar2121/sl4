<p>Now what's the probability of humanity surviving if a positive singularity 
<br>
does *not* occur?  There's already been documented one case where we were 
<br>
within 30 seconds of full-scale thermonuclear war.  I doubt that humanity 
<br>
would survive that.  Even without a singularity that number of people who 
<br>
have their finger on one trigger or another has been increasing.  More slowly 
<br>
than I expected, I admit, but still increasing.
<br>
<p>I rate the probability of humanity surviving in it's current form as extremely 
<br>
close to zero.  It requires an extremely destructive war that wipes out 
<br>
civilization without quite killing off all people.  Of the paths through the 
<br>
future that I see as continuing to contain something that could reasonably be 
<br>
called civilized humanity, they all lead through a positive singularity.  
<br>
Nearly all of them include uploads and most of the include aggressive 
<br>
intelligence amplification.  (In the ones that don't include either, people 
<br>
are merely pets.  Few of those continue to contain people in the long run.)
<br>
<p>For most of these projected futures I can't assign even a guesstimated 
<br>
probability.
