2008/7/11 Stuart Armstrong &lt;<a href="mailto:dragondreaming@googlemail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Property%20rights">dragondreaming@googlemail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The vatican would make itself more dogmatic on the condom issue...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anti-free traders would live up to their beliefs and become more vocal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them...
</em><br>
<p>You're assuming they feel there is something wrong with their beliefs
<br>
and would try to remove this feeling. But they might be equally likely
<br>
to modify themselves for the opposite result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; anyone in a semi-repressive environment (even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repressive family environment) would be pressured to make the &quot;right&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modification to their mental make-ups... companies would only offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs to those who can prove they have modified to unswerving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loyalty...
</em><br>
<p>Or those people who think this would be a bad thing might modify
<br>
themselves so that they are not susceptible to such pressure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; of the individual is practically irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared with the format they express that feeling. A psychopathic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killer serving his country loyaly on the battlefield is much better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the devout, considerate, kindly, compassionate bishop denying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condoms to africans, or the aid worker pushing well-meaning but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; erroneous solutions on the populations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but all else equal we are better off with people who are good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The biger problem is that people's beliefs in how the world works is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only tangentially related to reality. Self modification will increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this gap, not diminish it; we may soon see the rise of the dogmatisms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a much more potent form.
</em><br>
<p>I think the more dogmatic you are, the less you are likely to think
<br>
that your mind needs modifying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I expect there would be great pressure for people to conform to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; general standard of moral behaviour. There is such pressure today, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we all reluctantly acknowledge that there will be people who behave in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; antisocial ways because, without getting into a whole discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; free will, they can't help it. This excuse won't count for much if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anyone can easily change their nature to whatever they want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But based on what most people think today, once of the first things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll do is make themselves less worried about the opinions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others. Few people value conformity to &quot;whole human population&quot;, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conformity impulses will be the first ones out the window, replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rabbid individuals or tightly knit opposing groups.
</em><br>
<p>Being overly sensitive to the opinions of others can be a problem, but
<br>
in most cases people won't wish they can throw off the values they
<br>
have already acquired through living in their community. If they think
<br>
the values are wrong then ipso facto they are already negated, without
<br>
recourse to direct mind modification.
