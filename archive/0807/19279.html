<em>&gt; True, but again, 5MB of complexity (actually less) is miniscule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to the amount being generated daily by any individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted if we were to abstract away the generated complexity of all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity we may get some redundancy (I dont know, it depends on what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical framework one draws upon) but certainly it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 5MB.
</em><br>
<p><p>But if one has the necessary tools to create a human population and raise it
<br>
in a simulated environment to avoid the uncertainty caused by a possible
<br>
different quantum environment, say within a computing core for example, one
<br>
would only NEED to store the genome and perhaps enough cultural data to
<br>
extrapolate a feasible simulation to stick the beings in. The whole of the
<br>
&quot;light internet&quot; won't seem like that much data after a few more storage
<br>
doublings, and heck you could probably create a person we would construe as
<br>
sane based only on data available in wikipedia (minus talk pages, of
<br>
course). Basically, unless, as you say, the AI finds it useful to have a
<br>
constantly running society to observe, a society could be ressurected for
<br>
specific tests without necessitating any storage of meatspace bodies in a
<br>
human-conducive environment. Hence, it seems to me while the survival of
<br>
unmodified human minds running constantly, whether in meat or uploaded, is
<br>
unable to be known, the probability of the continuance of information about
<br>
modern humanity sufficient to ressurect beings we can identify with is as
<br>
certain as anything can be in this topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least the uploaded humans would modify themselves to execute more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on whatever hardware exists, and once the self-tampering starts, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it stop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes self modification is fine. But we don't really know how that'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn out yet. Kinda like chimps trying to predict the stock market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well if you were going for irony there, I'd have to say that the Buffet has
</em><br>
shown this is quite possible. If not, this still brings up the million
<br>
chimps on a million typewriters point: if we guess enough we'll come up with
<br>
something resembling the truth.
<br>
<p>And as for your point about the 50s, it's quite apt, and I have another
<br>
parallel to point out: back in the 50s visions of the future were far
<br>
different from what is actually here. Sometimes when I'm feeling pessimistic
<br>
I wonder if our speculation about the singularity is merely a modern
<br>
expression of that same optimism. But this is a question for another thread.
