<p><em>&gt;&gt; You so very often leave your correspondent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so little context that he, as me right here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can make nothing whatsoever of what you are trying to say. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well hell, I think I left you with enough context for you to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I was responding to, you did after all write the damn thing.
</em><br>
<p>Okay. Then it's just a request from me, who doesn't remember
<br>
exactly what he wrote or what I was thinking when I wrote it,
<br>
to you, who probably excels me on that task:
<br>
<p>Pretty please, with sugar on it, supply more context.  :-)  Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; but formal logic can show that any mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; is good enough to do arithmetic is susceptible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; to getting into infinite loops regardless of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the details of its operation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can you expand on that?  How would formal logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do that? And why do we need formal logic anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An internal combustion engine consumes gasoline not the laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thermodynamics, certainly it does not understand them; and yet a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can use those laws to determine the limits of what ANY heat engine can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do regardless of the precise details of its construction.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A mind might not use formal logic and not even know the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing about it,
</em><br>
<p>Right, and very good.  An *extremely* capable mind, to boot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nevertheless we can use that discipline to know there are some tasks a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind can never accomplish even with infinite time; and what's more there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no way to know beforehand what all those tasks are.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  Remember the classic and totally idiotic Star Trek example
<br>
&quot;please calculate the last digit of pi&quot;. Grrrr. And that device, supposedly
<br>
intelligent, could not see the problem (as you suggest here):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't know for certain if you are in a infinite loop or not, you must use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your judgment, and if you judge you probably are in such a loop then jump out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I'm not just talking about a limit in tasks of formal logic! There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are some things in arithmetic you can never prove or disprove, and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's the case with something as simple and fundamental as arithmetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine the contradictions and ignorance in more abstract and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precise arts like physics or economics or politics or philosophy. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get into an infinite loop over arithmetic it must be childishly easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get into one when contemplating art. Fortunately real minds (but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictional fixed goal minds) have a defense against this, real minds get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bored. I believe that is why evolution invented boredom.
</em><br>
<p>I definitely would *not* say that boredom is the main defense, because:
<br>
<p>Should I, for example, live through this century somehow, 
<br>
I intend to never be bored. In fact, I have many good days
<br>
right now when I am never bored. Yet I can see I'm getting
<br>
nowhere with a certain approach, say, or can recall that I
<br>
read through this part of a book just a day or two ago and
<br>
have no expectation of further enlightenment.  And I can do
<br>
all that without being bored.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Well, *you* like to keep mentally considering conjectures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and often trying to refute them. Are you stuck in a loop? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's interesting you should say that, I do indeed sometimes suspect I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck in an infinite loop, however I have hope. I like to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually I'll prove my conjectures to be true, or show them to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false, or just get tired of the whole damn thing and forget it and go to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beach.
</em><br>
<p>Me, I don't mind being caught in that kind of what you call &quot;infinite
<br>
loop&quot;.  Me conjecturing away, thinking, delighting in understanding,
<br>
even putting myself in the same state as on a previous occasion
<br>
by listening to certain music---why, that's just fine. 
<br>
<p>So when you say &quot;I do indeed sometimes suspect I am stuck in an
<br>
infinite loop, however I have hope&quot; what exactly is the problem?
<br>
That you keep banging your head on some problem that won't give?
<br>
Yes, after a while your &quot;futility circuit&quot; (not, I claim, your &quot;boredom
<br>
circuit&quot;) will kick in.  Maybe you'll just sleep on the problem Maybe
<br>
months or years will go by and you'll learn some ancillary things that
<br>
suddenly make it possible for you to go back and succeed.
<br>
<p>Alas, I am afraid that our ideas of being &quot;in an infinite loop&quot; don't
<br>
quite overlap completely. And what about these examples
<br>
<p>A:   Certain priests continually ask themselves almost as often
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as possible if they are doing enough to serve God;  are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they stuck in a loop?   
<br>
B:   A self-actualizer enthusiast may ask himself every day: &quot;Am
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doing the best I can to be the greatest human being I can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be?&quot;
<br>
C:   An AI who has got marvelously smarter than people, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is as devoted to them as some people are to their stamp
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collections (please don't get diverted here by thinking this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossible---it might be, but that's not the point)  and who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says to itself very often &quot;What more can I do for those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonderful, dear, cute, simple little evolutionary devices that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought me into being?  Am I really devoting enough time to them?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my 0.0001% focus on them enough, or should I be doing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Are A, B, and C examples (to you) of being &quot;stuck in an infinite loop&quot;?
