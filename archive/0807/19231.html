<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford</a>'s_law&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law</a>&gt;mentions:
<br>
<p>&quot;the observation that real-world measurements are generally distributed
<br>
logarithmically, thus the logarithm of a set of real-world measurements is
<br>
generally distributed uniformly&quot;
<br>
<p>The intuition I get from this is that if you have some big random set of
<br>
algorithms or recipes (here representing the different possible ways to
<br>
shape matter so as to get computing power out of it), then, as an observed
<br>
mathematical regularity, the output numbers from those algorithms (here
<br>
representing quantitative measures of computing power) will be distributed
<br>
logarithmically; and so a linear increase in &quot;algorithm quality&quot; will
<br>
correspond to an exponential increase in computing power. Moving from the
<br>
56th to the 57th percentile of good algorithms will increase the output by
<br>
the same *percentage* as moving from the 57th to the 58th percentile. (Here
<br>
the distribution would be cut off at some physical limit.) You could
<br>
probably construct an argument why a fixed amount of research effort
<br>
corresponds roughly to moving a fixed amount of &quot;algorithm quality&quot; measured
<br>
in percentiles.
<br>
<p>So I would agree that &quot;most technological growth is exponential&quot; in
<br>
quantitative performance, but not because &quot;the rate at which technology
<br>
improves is proportional to the amount of technology already in existence&quot;,
<br>
but because the logarithm of quantitative performance is just a more natural
<br>
scale for measuring technological progress. There's not much of a Moore's
<br>
law for log(computing power).
<br>
<p>This is unrigorous and probably confused in a few places and it doesn't
<br>
explain why the doubling time is what it is, or why the doubling time has
<br>
been so constant (if it has been). Still, I think it's where a deep
<br>
explanation would have to start.
