</em><br>
<p>True.  But I feel that we already have sufficient knowledge and power to 
<br>
exterminate ourselves, and that the control of such power is in an increasing 
<br>
number of independently acting hands.  As such, without a singularity, it's 
<br>
fairly clear that we won't long survive.  (I consider that only a few people 
<br>
would survive to be unlikely over periods of a few decades from the initial 
<br>
catastrophe.)  A lesser war, which only killed, say, half to 3/4 of humanity 
<br>
wouldn't slow down progress towards the singularity by more than a few 
<br>
decades.  A global dictatorship might, but it would only slow it down.  
<br>
(&quot;Dark ages&quot; commonly include lots of progress in applied science.  The 
<br>
middle-ages yielded, among other things, improved metal working, evidenced by 
<br>
plate armor, the horse-collar, which allowed horses to replace oxen in 
<br>
plowing [horses are far superior], and mortar-board plows.  Also, of course, 
<br>
moveable type, which ended the middle-ages.  Note that this is far from a 
<br>
complete list.  I'm merely listing major transformative technology 
<br>
improvements.)
<br>
<p>OTOH, saying that something recognizably human will survive a positive 
<br>
singularity is almost a tautology.  Which singularities that nothing 
<br>
recognizably human would survive would you call positive?
