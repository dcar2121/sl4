<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, but millions of people (so far in history, given their own

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; NEVER spontaneously go from domination of elites and a great King
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; towards any sort of self rule.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They already are able to behave in whatever way their brains come up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with, to the extent that the implementation is available and so on, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not they would survive a switch wasn't what I was hoping at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting at -- remember, we were talking about &quot;Solar System 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Governments&quot; (your words) and the general ai domination scenarios (my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterization) that are thrown around here, one ai to rule them all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and such.
</em><br>
<p>That's good!  &quot;And one ai to rule them all.&quot;  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Specifically we were talking about 'property rights' and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was wondering how it is that you want an ai to behave in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some characterized manner with respect to them (hint:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the characterization  is actually incomplete but nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admits this methinks).
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with me *wanting* or finding desirable an
<br>
AI that does respect property rights?  Or at least---this is
<br>
the most I would hope for one that had taken over the
<br>
solar system (or the small piece of it where I lived)---that
<br>
would respect property rights UP TO but not including
<br>
threats to itself.  In other words, a kind of benevolent
<br>
Pinochet type dictator.  I really dare not hope for better.
<br>
(For one thing, it would be good for it to keep an eye
<br>
on my neighbor---my neighbor may be plotting an overthrow
<br>
and I could end up with something far worse!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All of these layers -- ai domination, property rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments, these are just  layers on top of the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents, and these layers are by no means 'magical', they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be created, recreated, destroyed, and most importantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redesigned, and they tend to show up on their own.
</em><br>
<p>The way we always talk past each other is like this:  you
<br>
argue on one &quot;level of practicality&quot; and I argue on another.
<br>
You don't seem to see traditions and societal inertia as
<br>
a real force to be reckoned with and against which only
<br>
*so much really is possible*!   You always say, well, 
<br>
&quot;we could do  this&quot; or &quot;we could do that&quot; or &quot;what's to
<br>
keep us from DIO&quot;  (the plural, I guess of DIY).
<br>
<p>I always argue on a different level, namely, that there will
<br>
*definitely* be no overnight change in people's attitudes,
<br>
nor in those who are in charge (say in America, for instance).
<br>
I see that as a constraint, and you never do.  So we talk
<br>
past each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look at all the random micronations, perhaps. Anyway, these layers can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likened to onion layers, which are wrapped around the actual thing that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are all interested in here -- intelligence, i.e. that person walking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around with a skull and all of those silly social dynamics issues that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't really care about. We're here for whatever the hell that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence is. All of the hypotheticals about implementation of an ai 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated society are ridiculous -- it doesn't actually have anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Since this has to be about the Nth time around here, give
<br>
me a hand.  Why do we keep talking past each other?
<br>
Why do you dismiss entirely *out of hand*  the *possibility*
<br>
of an adverse AI takeover?  In other words, when I ask again,
<br>
as I always do, WHY IS IT RIDICULOUS, for some reason,
<br>
your answer just goes right by me. Look deeper.  What am I
<br>
failing to see?  What about my position are you failing to see?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether or not people happen to not know how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live isn't the issue (in truth, nobody does anyway); if you're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afraid people will die, fine, let's go engineer solutions to those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, but let's not mix it up with the task of ai engineering and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design. :-)
</em><br>
<p>There you go again.  &quot;Let's go engineer solutions.&quot;  When, this
<br>
afternoon?  Later this evening?  Actually, my next two weekends
<br>
are booked, so I'll have to put off supplying myself and everyone
<br>
else an immortality drug until late August.  What the devil do you
<br>
think De Grey and many, many others like him---far, far more
<br>
capable than I am of &quot;let's go engineer solutions to aging&quot;---are
<br>
doing?  They *are* trying.  And I cannot believe that you think
<br>
that &quot;we&quot;---whoever that is---can do it for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I'm surprised that by now you aren't starting to be just a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; frustrated by how your own impeccably logical ideas don't seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; affecting thousands, yet alone millions, of fellow Americans. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just look at things differently. Evolution takes a long, long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not confused. What are these &quot;impeccably logical ideas&quot; that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neglect to mention ? In other words, just what is it that you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expecting of me?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  I really wasn't being satirical, even though it probably sounded
<br>
like it.  No, I mean that if there were 10^5 people just like you on
<br>
Mars, then indeed you all would very shortly bring to fruition your
<br>
various good ideas and schemes.  But you're living in a country with
<br>
300 million rather relatively conservative folk who just aren't going
<br>
to let you do whatever you want, and who aren't going to listen to
<br>
&quot;good sense&quot; (as defined by Bryan and Lee).
