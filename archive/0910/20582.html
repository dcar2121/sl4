@Kevin:  I'd say if the mouse finds himself in a mousetrap he knows the
<br>
human's intelligent.
<br>
Also, I understand the difficulty.  But there's two possible states:  either
<br>
(a) the problem's not chewable by the human mind, or (b) it is.  If A is
<br>
true, then it's useless to try and we should instead focus on the question
<br>
of how likely it is our first GAI will be malicious.  If we think it's
<br>
likely, it's time to shoot ourselves in the heads, because we can anticipate
<br>
machine-induced torture before the machine-induced death.  If it's unlikely,
<br>
we should be focusing on living it up now because we can anticipate a
<br>
simple, quick machine-induced extinction.
<br>
<p>I for one think a malicious AI is even less likely than a friendly AI, so
<br>
I'm not too worried about that.
<br>
<p>In other words, either (a) the project can be broken down into finite,
<br>
performable steps, or (b) it cannot.
<br>
<p>However, &quot;appreciating the difficulty&quot; of a problem is quite an ambiguous
<br>
turn of phrase.  If I wanted to be a reductionist ad absurdum I could say
<br>
that English already IS sufficiently mathematically rigorous, because every
<br>
English word maps to a concept which exists within the brain, which exists
<br>
within the universe, which is either a mathematically rigorous machine or by
<br>
its very existence negates the validity of mathematical rigor.  However, I'd
<br>
be an ass for doing so because there's a difference between postulating a
<br>
path which can be followed by a supreme intelligence and finding a path
<br>
which can be followed by us puny humans.
<br>
<p>Attempting to produce math directly is NOT going to work.  The reason?
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Friendly&quot; is an English word, with a definition made of English words.
<br>
&nbsp;There is no formal mathematical representation of those words, either.  Any
<br>
mathematical definition of &quot;friendly&quot; will be as arbitrary as the following:
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Object A is considered 'friendly' to object B insofar as A sends B
<br>
messages which conform to B's interface&quot;.  In other words,
<br>
<p>&quot;If object_a and object_b are instances of classes A and B, respectively,
<br>
written in Ruby,
<br>
then any program which does not produce a message of the form
<br>
'undefined method `[methodname1]' for [a]:A'  (where [methodname1] is any
<br>
string)
<br>
and in which every command begins with the string `object_a`
<br>
will also not produce a message of the form
<br>
'undefined method `[methodname2]' for object_b:B'  (where [methodname2] is
<br>
any string),
<br>
if and only if object_a is friendly to object_b&quot;
<br>
<p>whew!
<br>
<p>Basically what this says in English is &quot;object_a is friendly to object_b if
<br>
and only if object_a knows how to talk to object_b&quot;.
<br>
<p>Not a very complete definition, but at least it's a start.  Being a
<br>
programmer, day-in and day-out, I don't just appreciate the value of
<br>
mathematical rigor, I also appreciate the value of readability, and I have a
<br>
thousand tricks up my sleeve for writing mathematical definitions in a way
<br>
that keeps the entire system easily comprehensible to the humans that
<br>
maintain it.  Programming is mathematics for real-world applications.  And
<br>
what programming languages have been doing for the past five decades has
<br>
been evolving closer and closer to English without losing their rigor.
<br>
&nbsp;That's why I can write:
<br>
<p>Given a document with title &quot;to-do list for friendly AI&quot;
<br>
When I visit that document's page
<br>
And I click &quot;edit&quot;
<br>
Then I should see a form
<br>
When I type &quot;to-do list for developing object_b&quot; and click &quot;submit&quot;
<br>
Then I should see &quot;your document has been updated&quot;
<br>
And I should see &quot;to-do list for developing object_b&quot;
<br>
<p>And execute it AS CODE to test my software.  It's beautiful.

<p>A quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;More or less, we're all afflicted with the psychology of the voyeur. Not in
<br>
a strictly clinical or criminal sense, but in our whole physical and
<br>
emotional stance before the world. Whenever we week to break this spell of
<br>
passivity, our actions are cruel and awkward and generally obscene, like an
<br>
invalid who has forgotten to walk.&quot;  - Jim Morrison

</em><br>
