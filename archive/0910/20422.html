<p>
Once upon a time there was a fixed goal mind with his top goal being to
<br>
obey humans.---
<br>
<p>John,
<br>
<p>1. You appear to be far more interested in making yourself out to be a
<br>
misunderstood martyr than in describing your ideas in terms that can be
<br>
studied and discussed by other people. You are being given a fair chance by
<br>
your skeptics to show that you have even a remote clue about what you're
<br>
talking about, and you're throwing that chance away with self-pitying posts.
<br>
In particular:
<br>
<p>- You've been asked for maths that shows minds are turing machines, you
<br>
haven't provided it.
<br>
<p>- You've been asked for definitions, you haven't provided them. I quoted
<br>
part of your text above to show your use of particular phrases such as 'top
<br>
goal' and 'fixed goal mind'.
<br>
<p>- Please give a definition of your understanding of *at least* each of the
<br>
following - ideally with sufficient precision that we can compare them to
<br>
the formal definitions of algorithms, turing machines, etc.:
<br>
<p>a) &quot;goal&quot; b) &quot;fixed goal&quot; c) &quot;top level goal&quot; d) &quot;*real* top level goal&quot; e)
<br>
&quot;mind&quot; f) &quot;fixed goal mind&quot;
<br>
<p>I've seen plenty of different definitions for some of these things from
<br>
different people, and some of them seem to be phrases that are unique to
<br>
your own emails - so I really have no idea what they mean to you.  I'd like
<br>
to see a clear description of what *you* think the phrases mean. But, I
<br>
suspect you probably won't do it, even though it is the most basic courtesy
<br>
when you are presenting a new idea to someone.
<br>
<p>- The halting problem is not what you think it is. As far as I am aware, is
<br>
quite possible to show that *some* algorithms will or will not halt by
<br>
static analysis. It is not possible to show that for *all* algorithms. A
<br>
quick example; here is pseudo-code for an algorithm that is capable of
<br>
detecting a simple infinite loop and not running the code. It has the form
<br>
of a regular expression with ? as a wildcard representing i, n, or whatever.
<br>
It works for a tiny subset of all possible algorithms, specifically, 1 line
<br>
for statements with empty bodies.
<br>
<p>if sourcecode.string.compare(&quot;for (?=0; ?&gt;=0; ?++) { }&quot;); then
<br>
infinite.loop.detected=1; fi
<br>
<p>By restricting the contents of the braces to be code known to execute in
<br>
finite time (e.g. single step op-codes, no loops, no recursion, etc), and
<br>
prohibiting the use of whichever variable is represented by &quot;?&quot; while inside
<br>
the braces, you could also carry out this test on a larger subset of all
<br>
possible algorithms.
<br>
<p>Mu
<br>
