On Sun, 11 Oct 2009  &quot;Mu In Taiwan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mu.in.taiwan@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Complete%20drivel%20on%20this%20list:%20was:%20I%20am%20a%20Singularitian%20who%20does%20not%20%20believe%20in%20the%20Singularity.">mu.in.taiwan@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we have strange mysterious devices, whose abilities surpass those of turing machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already! They're called desktop PCs.
</em><br>
<p>And then he said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just wanted to point out there really is a lot of crap being written on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list currently
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I agree with you 100%. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;John K Clark
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;and it would be good if it this situation were to
<br>
<em>&gt; improve rapidly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. &quot;Fixed minds&quot;. What rot. Unless you happen to have a working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind already built, perhaps it is rather arrogant of you to discuss the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design limitations of such a thing. Heck, it's not unknown for even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'physical law' to be overturned occasionally when reality asserts itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over theory in the form of empirical data. As for mathematical theorems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, maths is beautiful but it's only a constraint when the axioms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics coincide accurately with the axioms that reality has chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Comments on here about turing machines and their consequences for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial minds. Wow, so much complete crap to wade through. In case you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't noticed, there is not one single Turing machine on this planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything we do today, we do with finite state machines that do passable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imitations of 'almost' PDAs and 'almost'   TMs. Indeed,  They have things like clock-driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interrupts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical random number generators and state reset buttons, features that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make a Turing Machine weep with envy. A turing machine is actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a handy model we use for some theory and programming - when it suits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has anyone here actually experienced a desktop PC going into a loop that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't be halted? I doubt it. Mr Reset Button is your Friend. As for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general algorithms and coding, use a timer driven interrupt that resets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of the entire machine after a fixed time if you want to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positively, certain that any arbitrary routine will certainly halt within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known time. It might not complete - but it will damn well halt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Ever noticed a model of time in a turing machine? A model of truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-deterministic behaviour? Well, perhaps making appeals to Turing's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your discussion of future artificial minds is a bit stupid, in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you should stop doing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. In case you missed it in (2): Artificial minds will not be turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines, because there are no turing machines. They don't exist. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree, then please write your response on a piece of infinitely long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and post it to this address.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you for listening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mu
