In case of an ordinary program, this is actually quite accurate
<br>
prediction of its long-term operational flow; the point is, most
<br>
programs actually *are meant to* periodically or occassionally return
<br>
to some prior state (in practically any more complex case, to one of
<br>
many prior states, the choice depending on conditional branching).
<br>
<p>Actually, not only ordinary programs or AIs, also present human minds
<br>
are (as far as my competence allows to state) systems with finite
<br>
number of operational states; what truly separates AIs and minds from
<br>
other programs, is that they are able to continuously and (in most
<br>
cases) autonomously update their data repertoir (either by generating
<br>
new knowledge from existing, or by receiving the input stream),
<br>
providing their algorithmical inner workings with new data. Thus,
<br>
although truly non-repetitive AND infinite algorithm is, most likely,
<br>
impossible, the operation of mind (either biological or cybernetic)
<br>
could be considered &quot;pseudo-nonrepetitive&quot; (i.e. if it returns to some
<br>
prior state, it, most likely does not by limitations of system but by
<br>
some kind of flow branching inside the algorithm) and
<br>
&quot;pseudo-infinite&quot; (with regard that, in physical terms, it will
<br>
operate only for a finitely long slice of time), as it would/should
<br>
not terminate while normal operational conditions are met.
