<em>&gt; Why do you make up stories about why the problem is so hard?
</em><br>
<p>Because friendliness *is* hard. We have a $1 quadrillion incentive to build AI, so we are going to build it whether we solve the friendliness problem or not. By default, AI is going to be designed to serve those who built it.

<br>
<em>&gt;Training an AI by watching people will only define &quot;human&quot; as far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cultural beliefs of the people it observes. 
</em><br>
<p>That might be true for some AI, but it's not a criticism of the
<br>
algorithm I'm pointing to.  Training that AI more than &quot;watching
<br>
people&quot;.  It's given video that's annotated to say who is present and
<br>
what they are doing and what they are perceiving, so it's the beliefs
<br>
of the people annotating the video that matter, not the cultural
<br>
beliefs of the people appearing in the video.  (The prior probability
<br>
distribution also matters, of course, but that's fixed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It will fail utterly in the case of future human-software hybrids that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't yet exist.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it will say *something*.  Whether that's failing utterly depends
<br>
on what you want and what it does, and I don't know either of those.
<br>
This is all complicated by the fact that some of these future
<br>
human-software hybrids will surely be insane by our standards, so
<br>
perhaps we don't want the AI caring much what they want.  
<br>
<p>A human-software hybrid is likely to be as powerful as an AI and not
<br>
Friendly-by-construction.  Humans are sufficiently mentally broken
<br>
that I wouldn't expect it to be Friendly-by-good-luck either.  If the
<br>
Friendly AI problem is worth solving, then maybe we don't want any
<br>
human-software hybrids until we have an FAI that seems competent and
<br>
claims it's safe to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Humans can recognize faces in videos without much effort. That doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it easy. In fact the training data that allows you to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consists of, among other things, several years worth of high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resolution video.
</em><br>
<p>I agree about the time period that people actually observe.  I
<br>
wouldn't call human vision high-resolution, but that's minor.
<br>
Although people get that much video, I don't agree that they need it
<br>
to do facial recognition.  There are programs that do facial
<br>
recognition and they must not get that much training data.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Landauer measured the complexity of human long term episodic memory to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be on the order of 10^9 bits.
</em><br>
<p>I don't dispute that estimate.  I do dispute the claim that it's
<br>
relevant.  The only way it can be relevant is if understanding who is
<br>
present and what they are doing and what they are perceiving is a
<br>
significant portion of what humans do with all that long term memory.
<br>
For example, the learning that has to happen from the training data
<br>
includes nothing about planning or motivation or domain knowledge
<br>
outside of this specific vision problem.  It includes nothing I
<br>
learned in school and nothing I learned after age 8 or so.
<br>
<p>Why do you make up stories about why the problem is so hard?  Do you
<br>
perhaps want people to give up?  Do you think you gain status by
<br>
spouting marginally relevant large numbers?  Something else?
