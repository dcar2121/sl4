<em>&gt; doesn't apply to the kids raised on games like Metal Gear Solid, which I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told contains a number singularity-related themes. I introduced these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts to a class of 15-16 year old school kids to whom I teach creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arts/philosophy, and they were entranced. They love Dresden Codak, and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than happy discussing grey goo, Jupiter brains and destructive uploads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're even starting to introduce transhumanist/singularitarian ideals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their friends, which perhaps goes to show that if we want to give these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts a wider circulation we should copy the Jesuits and get 'em while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're young.
</em><br>
<p><p>That's very cool, and I agree completely. Pretty much every
<br>
transhumanist I know got hooked on the core memes when they were
<br>
young, and have been building a more complex worldview to &quot;fill in the
<br>
gaps&quot; ever since.
<br>
<p>This is the point at which I should admit I'd never heard of Dresden
<br>
Codak. Too cool! Thanks for the heads-up!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Agree, it'd be very interesting to see how someone like Derren Brown would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle communicating such concepts. Maybe he could use his methods as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short-cut to get around that initial establishing of context, but I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that the best way to do it is to discuss things long-term. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's not always that option, so perhaps the methods you mention warrant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploring.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, it does rather boil down to whether you'd want to directly
<br>
manipulate a person's beliefs if measured &amp; rational debate wasn't
<br>
going to have the desired effect. Of course, if certain H+
<br>
technologies were to come online then such a willingness to manipulate
<br>
others would be the first step on a very slippery slope.
<br>
<p>Another relevant point here is that effects like Mere Exposure only
<br>
really work in the absence of explicit ('conscious') focus on the
<br>
stimuli, so that rules out rational debate in the first instance if
<br>
one wants to go down that road.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But regarding the esteemed Aubrey himself, I'm afraid I came to the opposite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion. There are so many barriers to break down when introducing these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts to fresh ears, and - brilliant man though he is - Aubrey does look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit like a stereotypical mad scientist, and that's going to turn some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people off before he starts speaking.
</em><br>
<p><p>Good point - I'm obviously just a sucker for a grandiose beard. Or
<br>
anything else that says &quot;mad scientist&quot;, most likely   ;-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not saying, of course, that someone like Aubrey shouldn't promote his ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whenever he has the chance... but maybe the lesson we can take from this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if we're serious about transhumanism/singularitarianism being something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other than an lightly-regarded sect, we have to pay attention to how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts we deal with are presented.
</em><br>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly. I believe that, to a degree, such ideas have
<br>
been taken to heart by the likes of the WTA (sorry, Humanity+)... it's
<br>
really just a question of whether H+ists should go beyond traditional
<br>
PR methods and get *really* machiavellian about spreading the word.
<br>
Perhaps such activity is not even necessary in the long run (although
<br>
I'm inclined to believe it is), and I do sometimes have misgivings
<br>
about a &quot;popularization&quot; approach which leads to people shying away
<br>
from discussing the kind of 'long'-term issues which got me hooked in
<br>
the first place, and are the focus of lists such as SL4.
