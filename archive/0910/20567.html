Hi all,
<br>
<p>I'm slowly starting to write a long overview paper about the debate
<br>
around the speed and type of AI improvement. Despite being biased to
<br>
one side, there are still lots of open questions which need a broader
<br>
number of participants to solve, so I am aiming to be impartial as I
<br>
can be. These are my notes so far, does anyone have any
<br>
comments/disputes I should address? This is most definitely a side
<br>
project, so time-scale is probably a year or two. Co-authors welcome.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Will
<br>
<p>Intro
<br>
<p>Cheap Intelligence will change the economy, change the pace of
<br>
scientific research and technological development. Enable cheap space
<br>
exploration. The biggest game changing development ever.
<br>
<p>1) What will AI want to do?
<br>
<p>The very first de novo AIs will have arbitrary goals as long as they
<br>
do not destroy themselves while following those goals. If there are
<br>
multiple AIs and  we are not careful in the way that AI's are
<br>
created/copied evolutionary forces will take control (a singleton is
<br>
one method of being careful). Empathy will need to be built in. Show
<br>
examples of current computing systems with arbitrary goals. Whole
<br>
brain emulations will want what humans want, if we do it right.
<br>
<p>2) What is intelligence a function of?
<br>
<p>Assume intelligence is a mathematical function outputting some value,
<br>
with a greater value being more capable of achieving its goal, what is
<br>
its domain? How much does it depend upon each part of the domain? E.g.
<br>
if intelligence is highly dependent upon the state of the world, and
<br>
the world keeps on changing then it does not make sense to talk of the
<br>
intelligence of a system by itself.
<br>
<p>3) What limits intelligence, computing power or useful information
<br>
about the world?
<br>
<p>Discuss the million einsteins for a million years thought experiment.
<br>
Can they whittle down the many hypotheses they have about the external
<br>
world to get to the right one? Discuss AIXI, different UTM's giving
<br>
different measures.
<br>
<p>4) Discussion of theoretical programmatic self-change while
<br>
maintaining predicates (friendliness/intelligence)
<br>
<p>Brief discussion on input-less self change and Rice's Theorem. Doesn't
<br>
apply to programs that take information from the environment.
<br>
Discussion on how you prove the environment gives useful information
<br>
about self-change.
<br>
<p>Conclusion
<br>
<p>5) Challenges if Eliezer is right?
<br>
<p>Friendliness etc
<br>
<p><p>6) Challenges if Eliezer is wrong?
<br>
<p>How do we avoid ending up as Charlie Stross's Economy 2.0. by
<br>
accident. Can we really expect to be able to control it?
