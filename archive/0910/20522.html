I'm not going to bother to respond to that insane vitriol, but I
<br>
want to point out to every one else that JKC cut, and failed to
<br>
respond to, almost everything I wrote.  Read what I actually wrote
<br>
for yourself, and see if you think there's anything in there he
<br>
should have replied to that he didn't.

<em>&gt; As he has demonstrated numerous times the last thing in the world Robin

<em>&gt; Lee Powell would want to be is rude, but until this second I had no idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was such a big fan of copyright law. There for a minute I thought
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomprehensible to him and might as well have been written in Chinese.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But no, that's not the reason at all, it's the copyright thing. Yes, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that's the explanation, it's the copyright thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Run the algorithm for at most N+1 steps.  At every step, mark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the state off in your enumeration.  Stop when:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You reach a state (of both the FSM and memory) that Obviously if a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has a finite memory it would be possible in seen before.  Since the Turing machine formalism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entirely deterministic, the algorithm is in an infinite loop through this state, and you're done:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does not halt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've got to admit that makes a lot of sense, but it seems oddly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar, where did I see that before? Oh yes, now I remember, I said it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself several posts ago:  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Obviously if a computer has a finite memory it would be possible in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory to keep a record of every state the machine goes into, and if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that a state was repeated then you'd know for sure that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine was in a infinite loop. But the trouble is that the machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to do all that checking would have to be much larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original machine, and that larger machine would have no way to know if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was itself in a infinite loop unless it was watched over by an even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger machine.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Stop When:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The algorithm runs out of memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again I can't disagree with that, but for some reason I am again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome by a strong feeling of Deja View. I wonder what the cause could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be. Maybe it was the post I sent sever posts before the previous one I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quoted when I said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So let's see, if you have a small memory you can prove that a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will halt when it runs out of memory. Wow what a profound result! I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidently predict that if you loaded Windows Vista into the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ENIAC from 1946 that machine will halt too.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You quote the authors (I guess text is not covered by copyright law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just mathematics) as saying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the abovementioned proof is not novel in theoretical computer science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also quote them as saying &quot;Unfortunately, N will ordinarily be such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a huge number that this result is only theoretical, it does not lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a practical algorithm&quot;. But then, bizarrely, you say &quot;Which was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point many of us have been trying to make&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the hell are you talking about? What's this &quot;many of us&quot; crap? It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point I was trying to make but nobody agreed with me, that Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was profound and this stuff about finite memory machines is vacuous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell even the authors of the paper seem to think so. Since your short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term memory is so bad I will repeat something I quoted a few paragraphs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back that comes from one of my posts I sent about a dozen hours ago: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Obviously if a computer has a finite memory it would be possible in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory to keep a record of every state the machine goes into, and if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that a state was repeated then you'd know for sure that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine was in a infinite loop. But the trouble is that the machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to do all that checking would have to be much larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original machine, and that larger machine would have no way to know if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was itself in a infinite loop unless it was watched over by an even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger machine.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is almost exactly what the paper said, and the authors of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;paper&quot; admit that it has no practical value and that they are saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing new, so it is a bit of a mystery why they bothered to write it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the first place, however there is no mystery why it is just online
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not published in a real science journal. But you read (skimmed more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely) this piece of fluff and triumphantly announce &quot;It does, in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove that the halting problem is only undecidable for infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers&quot; and then try to peddle the idea that some difficult problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be solved if only the computer had LESS memory. Should I start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulling memory cards out of my computer now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And, of course, none of this has anything to do whatsoever with goal systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except that whenever you say &quot;always do X, no exceptions&quot; and X happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be one of the infinite number of programs that produce infinite loops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then your mighty AI turns into a useless lump of metal and silicon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing wins again.
