JC: &quot;I would like to issue a challenge to all those who disagree with me,
<br>
except for &quot;Mu In Taiwan&quot; for reasons that will become obvious. Read the
<br>
above quotation and try to make the case that the remark isn't as
<br>
incredibly mind numbingly stupid as it sounds. Come on, Mu In Taiwan
<br>
thinks I'm wrong just as you do, so stick up for the man, try to put
<br>
some polish on that turd and reveal it's inner brilliance! It would be
<br>
most amusing to see you try.&quot;
<br>
John,
<br>
<p>I noted in my previous post that you:
<br>
<p>- fail to define the vocabulary you use
<br>
- fail to provide proofs for the extremely strong claims you make about all
<br>
future designs for AGI
<br>
<p>and also that:
<br>
<p>- you selectively quote small pieces of other authors' text - with childish
<br>
insults added - instead of presenting a defence of the arguments you are
<br>
putting forward, or a sane deconstruction of someone else's arguments, or a
<br>
full response to the points that people make against your ideas.
<br>
<p>- you fail to respond to requests for evidence to support your claims.
<br>
<p>I note that once again, you have done these things. Regarding my request for
<br>
*your* evidence to support *your* extremely strong claim about *your
<br>
problem*, which *you* describe as being the most significant issue for AI.
<br>
Responding to my request for evidence by describing it as a 'turd' and
<br>
'incredibly mind-numbingly stupid', and attempting to exclude me from
<br>
follow-up responses, does not qualify as any reasonable kind of response.
<br>
That kind of response is what I would expect from a primary school child.
<br>
<p>Look, please stop posting this stuff to this mailing list if you're not
<br>
prepared to discuss it seriously - that is, with definitions, evidence, and
<br>
so on.  In particular, why on earth don't you welcome people criticizing
<br>
your ideas and asking you for further detail/evidence about them?
<br>
<p>For example, I don't agree that Randall's suggested interpretation of your
<br>
words is correct; but I am glad he offered his suggestion, which was
<br>
contrary to my own interpretation.
<br>
<p>Also: Please stop misrepresenting the claims of dead researchers (e.g. AT,
<br>
1936) - it is quite sufficient to provide a link to the paper and allow
<br>
people to reach their own conclusions. Similarly, please pay more attention
<br>
to peer-reviewed results which you are being presented with.
<br>
<p>Randall: Regarding the extropian mailing list. I am unfamiliar with it, and
<br>
I don't believe in giving credit to outlandish and unsupported claims on the
<br>
basis of mailing list membership. If it has been around since the 1990s,
<br>
(wow... that's coming up on 20 years ago) it must have achieved amazing
<br>
things over the last two decades of effort. Can someone briefly summarize
<br>
the main achievements of that forum for me? I looked up Google, but all I
<br>
found were some posts about &quot;Elvis sightings&quot;, &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;, &quot;Remote Mind
<br>
Control&quot; and &quot;Precognition on TV&quot;.
<br>
<p>Mu
