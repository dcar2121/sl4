Couldn't you just append the fixed goal with [oh yeah, plus don't get
<br>
bored]? Hmm... I guess that turns out to be a problem if everything the AGI
<br>
views as interesting is dangerous to humans!

<em>&gt; How to interface incompleteness with &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;infinite loops&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mind&quot; and goals being &quot;fixed&quot; is far from being obvious
</em><br>
<p>Godel proved that there are some things that are true but have no proof,
<br>
that means you will never find a counterexample to show it to be wrong and
<br>
never find a finite proof to prove it right. This wouldn't be so bad if you
<br>
could determine that some things are false or true but unprovable, then you
<br>
could just ignore them and move on to other things; but in 1936 Turing
<br>
showed that you can't even do that. That means that in general you can't
<br>
determine if you are in a infinite loop or not; perhaps you will get your
<br>
answer in 2 more seconds, perhaps 3, perhaps 10 billion years, perhaps
<br>
never. Real minds get around this problem by getting bored, after tackling a
<br>
task for a long time and making no progress they get bored and move on to
<br>
other problems that look more productive. A fixed goal mind could never do
<br>
this, a fixed goal mind never gets bored so it's stuck forever. That's why
<br>
evolution never made a fixed goal mind.
