<p>This assumes that, if the AGI isn't working the way we want, then (1)

the failure will be detectable, and (2) we'll still have enough power

over it that we're able to tweak/reboot it.

<p><em>&gt; I'd argue that so long as humans can get new information to the AGI, humans

</em><br>
<p>That sounds plausible, but I'm not convinced. Isn't this equivalent to
<br>
saying &quot;given two agents playing a game (in the game-theoretic sense),
<br>
player two can always ensure an outcome e finds acceptable&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example imagine an AGI with the top level goals of alternately curing
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds fair so far... Until one day Acme MegaGyroscopes figures out that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can change the rate of spin of the earth...
</em><br>
<p>Realistically, who's going to figure that out first -- the human
<br>
engineers at AMG, or the superhuman AGI?
<br>
<p><p>I think you underestimate the consequences of a vastly superhuman
<br>
intelligence. The difference between a post-Singularity AGI and a human
<br>
is comparable to the difference between a human and a colony of mold, or
<br>
between organic life and dead rock. If we're smart, diligent, and lucky,
<br>
then human-civilized worlds might become like cells in its body.
