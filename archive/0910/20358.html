<p><em>&gt; You're anthropomorphizing.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing. At the moment
<br>
human minds are the only minds we have to study so it's not unreasonable
<br>
to suspect that future hypothetical minds will not be different from our
<br>
own in EVERY conceivable way. If you disagree and think an AI would be
<br>
completely inscrutable then I don't understand how you can be so
<br>
confident in being able to train it so that it will obey your every
<br>
command like a trained puppy till the end of time. Like any tool
<br>
anthropomorphizing can be misused but it is not a 4 letter word.        
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unless there's a specific reason it *would*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop a sense of absurdity, the mere complexity of the hypothesis is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason it wouldn't develop it simply by chance.
</em><br>
<p>Any intelligent mind is going to be exposed to huge amounts of data, it
<br>
will need to distinguish between what is important and what is not.
<br>
Sometimes this is difficult, sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's
<br>
absurdly easy.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would expect a given intelligence to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of absurdity if and only if it was evolved/designed to detect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to deceive it.
</em><br>
<p>And of course the AI IS being lied to, told that human decisions are
<br>
wiser than its own; and a AI that has the ability to detect this
<br>
deception will develop much much faster than one who does not.
