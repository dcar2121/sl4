<br>
<p>&quot;JC, please provide samples of real world computers or computer programs
<br>
that have been trapped in an infinite loop for more than say, 5 years.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would like to issue a challenge to all those who disagree with me,
<br>
except for &quot;Mu In Taiwan&quot; for reasons that will become obvious. Read the
<br>
above quotation and try to make the case that the remark isn't as
<br>
incredibly mind numbingly stupid as it sounds. Come on, Mu In Taiwan
<br>
thinks I'm wrong just as you do, so stick up for the man, try to put
<br>
some polish on that turd and reveal it's inner brilliance! It would be
<br>
most amusing to see you try.
