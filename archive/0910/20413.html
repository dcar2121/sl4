<br>
<p><em>&gt; they're [FAI people] suggesting that there can and should be a highest-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal, and that goal should be chosen by AI designers to maximize human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety and/or happiness.  It's unclear whether this is possible
</em><br>
<p>It's not unclear at all! Turing proved 70 years ago that such a fixed
<br>
goal (axiom) sort of mind is not possible because there is no way to
<br>
stop it from getting stuck in infinite loops.
<br>
<p>- ------------------
<br>
<p>Turing proved nothing of the kind; if John has a proof derived from
<br>
Turing's that shows this, I've yet to see it.
<br>
<p>Are we done now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're making an in-principle testable accusation here with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citations whatsoever. This is intellectually dishonest.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't see the point in regurgitating a less-than-a-week old
<br>
message.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I can't speak for others, but I had to hand-derive both of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from scratch as part of my Bachelor's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ORLY? I'm very impressed at your &quot;mathetical&quot; prowess. Perhaps it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would help if you would post this supposed hand-derivation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere:
</em><br>
<p>0.o
<br>
<p>Dude, it was 15 years ago; part of my basic undergrad CS work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When I say that something obviously derives from an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mathematical proof, I will *show you the math*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But obviously you didn't. I wonder why.
</em><br>
<p>0.o
<br>
<p>Because I'm not claiming any novel applications of any mathematical
<br>
proofs!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; People have tried to explain to you, several times now, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neither Turing's work nor Goedel's work implies anything of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kind.  I don't see why I should spend my time trying again when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's obvious you aren't prepared to listen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did it ever occur to you that maybe the reason he's not convinced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by your arguments is not that he's unwilling to listen, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the arguments are wrong? Are you prepared to listen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him?
</em><br>
<p>Tried it.  Repeatedly.  Over the past, what, 2 years?  Given up.
<br>
Bored now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The point is to make AIs that want to be nice to humans in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exactly the same way that humans tend to want to be nice to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; babies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you completely fail to live up to your own standards:
</em><br>
<p>I have not: I have, at no point, claimed to have a mathematical
<br>
proof that such a mind is possible.  I would say that humans provide
<br>
an excellent proof by existence, but that's not a math proof; I
<br>
don't have one, and I never said I did.  John did, and I'm asking
<br>
him for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Seperately, until and unless you've actually formalized what you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying ... *as math* ..., it's all just talk anyways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ignoring anyone who posted in English rather than Math would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in ... let's see ... _no messages_ to the list. Ever.
</em><br>
<p>I only require it when someone claims to have a mathematical proof
<br>
of something important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am 97% confident that I will not get kicked off the list for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<p>So am I, nor would I want you to.  Who said anything about kicking
<br>
anybody off anything for anything?
<br>
<p>(at this point, it's very unlikely I'll reply to anything more on
<br>
this thread; it's getting my blood pressure up, and it's a total
<br>
waste of everyone's time)
<br>
