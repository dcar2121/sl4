<em>&gt; John is claiming that the math of Turing and Goedel proves

</em><br>
<p>Where is he claiming that? You're making an in-principle testable
<br>
accusation here with no citations whatsoever. This is intellectually
<br>
dishonest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't speak for others, but I had to hand-derive both of

</em><br>
<p>ORLY? I'm very impressed at your &quot;mathetical&quot; prowess. Perhaps it would
<br>
help if you would post this supposed hand-derivation somewhere:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I say that something obviously derives from an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical proof, I will *show you the math*.
</em><br>
<p>But obviously you didn't. I wonder why.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People have tried to explain to you, several times now, that neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing's work nor Goedel's work implies anything of the kind.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see why I should spend my time trying again when it's obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you aren't prepared to listen.
</em><br>
<p>Did it ever occur to you that maybe the reason he's not convinced by
<br>
your arguments is not that he's unwilling to listen, but because the
<br>
arguments are wrong? Are you prepared to listen to him?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there's no question in my mind that what you're saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes no sense whatsoever.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I guess not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point is to make AIs that want to be nice to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans in exactly the same way that humans tend to want to be nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to babies.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you completely fail to live up to your own standards:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seperately, until and unless you've actually formalized what you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying ... *as math* ..., it's all just talk anyways.
</em><br>
<p>Ignoring anyone who posted in English rather than Math would result in
<br>
... let's see ... _no messages_ to the list. Ever.
<br>
&lt;/flame&gt;
<br>
<p><p>I am 97% confident that I will not get kicked off the list for that.
