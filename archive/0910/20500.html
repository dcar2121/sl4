<p>Did I say &quot;place a human in a void for 3 hours&quot;?  No.  Let's try again.
<br>
<p>&quot;Place a human in a void and in effect, we cease to be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Everything that makes a person, a person, involves being acted upon in some
<br>
way by an outside world, either human or other.
<br>
<p>If you took everything you learned from every else and threw it away, what
<br>
would you know? You'd ask me &quot;What?&quot; But, language is learned from someone
<br>
else. You'd try to use your kung-fu skills on me, but again, that's
<br>
something you've learned.
<br>
<p>&quot;But, but, Mr Zak, everything had to be learned somewhere at some point.&quot;
<br>
<p>While this is true, this happened on earth, with an environment.
<br>
<p>Try learning Kung-Fu in a void where you have no reference and no prior
<br>
knowledge of what it is. Hell, you don't even know what Kung-Fu means.
<br>
<p>Add onto that the fact that a person cannot breathe in a void, and my point
<br>
is compounded upon.
<br>
<p>A human isn't a human when it's dead, just a mass of flesh and bone, that
<br>
whilst might resemble a person, hell could be your best friend, isn't
<br>
anymore.
<br>
<p>Unless you believe in the after-life, but that's on a whole 'nother
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>Now, imagine that you are the air, the very soul for a computer, you give it
<br>
life, you are the external reference, the replacement to the void.
<br>
<p>It may be that you, as a person, are controlling it, but is it not an
<br>
extension of your very thoughts, your personality, your knowledge.
<br>
<p>If those don't make me have a mind, I don't know what would.
