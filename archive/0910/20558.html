<em>&gt;&gt; An obvious typo, as the following paragraph makes clear;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robin Lee Powell:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and yet, 90+% of human parents raise their children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; without ever getting bored and leaving them to die.  Proof by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; existence: many human minds succeed at this, and without getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; into infinite loops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TYPO MY ASS! Did you even read it? The paragraph makes crystal clear it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this was not a typo. Robin Lee Powell is saying humans don't have fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals and they don't get into infinite loops so that proves I'm wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I supposed to believe that only fixed goal minds work. I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it proves beyond dispute that quite literally Robin Lee Powell doesen't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what he's arguing about. I want to emphasize this is not a figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of speech, Robin Lee Powell literally doesn't know what he's talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about. Literally! There is simply no other explanation for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph.
</em><br>
<p>No, Robin is saying - as he said in both followup emails - that humans
<br>
do have the fixed goal of raising their children, and that they
<br>
succeed in accomplishing this goal without falling into loops. Here,
<br>
I'll even quote Robin:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My point was simply that there exists at least 1 human mind
</em><br>
that:
<br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Will always help a baby in need, no matter the circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  Doesn't enter into infinite loops at random and end up cold and
</em><br>
lifeless as a result.
<br>
<em>&gt; I assert, in fact, that there are millions of such minds on our
</em><br>
planet, if not billions.
<br>
<p>#1 is a fixed goal; #2 is not falling into loops. You assert that
<br>
fixed goals (#1) implies falling into loops (negation of #2).
<br>
<p>How you think Robin has taken your position about non-fixed goals
<br>
being necessary, I don't know. I'll leave it to the reader to decide
<br>
who doesn't know what they are talking about, literally...
