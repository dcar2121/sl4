<p>
I confess to being a little shocked when somebody on this list said that
<br>
all Turing did was prove the trivial fact that a program like the one
<br>
that produced the digits of Pi will never halt. I was shocked at this
<br>
misunderstanding because I think Turing's results are some of the most
<br>
important in all of science. He proved that a computer, and by simple
<br>
extension a mind, can't do everything, it can't even handle some
<br>
numbers. Alan Turing discovered those numbers and then used them to
<br>
prove that in general no computer program can ever predict if it will be
<br>
able to come up with a solution to some problems, much less predict what
<br>
that answer will be. This is how Turing proved that a computer can not
<br>
deal with all numbers or even most numbers.
<br>
<p>First make a list of all possible binary computer programs to run on the
<br>
abstract computer that is now called a Universal Turing Machine. Yes, he
<br>
was well aware that his list of all possible binary computer programs
<br>
would be infinitely large, it does not flaw his proof. If the programs
<br>
don't produce endless loops they will eventually spit out a digital
<br>
output of some sort when you run them, we will treat this binary output
<br>
as a number, so that program Pn produces the binary number bn1 bn2 bn3
<br>
...   Sometimes the output will be infinitely long, like Pi, that's OK,
<br>
write  it all down. Sometimes the program will have no output at all
<br>
because it is caught in an endless loop, in that case just put in a
<br>
blank line in the list. This is how the list would look.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P1 outputs bits  b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 ... etc   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P2 outputs bits  b21 b22 b23 b24 b25 ... etc   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P3 outputs bits  b31 b32 b33 b34 b35 ... etc    
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P4 outputs bits  d41 d42 d43 d44 d45 ... etc   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P5 outputs bits    blank
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P6 outputs bits  b61 b62 b63 b64 b65 ... etc           
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.
<br>
<p>Now we can come up with our non computable number, all we need is to
<br>
apply the &quot;not&quot; (~) operator in a diagonal manner on our list. The
<br>
following number is non computable ~b11 ~b22 ~b33 ~b44 ...   Program P1
<br>
will not produce bit ~b11, program P2 will not produce bit ~b22 
<br>
ProgramP3 will not produce bit ~b33 etc. No computer program will ever
<br>
produce this number, not even with infinite memory and with an infinite
<br>
amount of time at your disposal.  
<br>
<p>But you could quite correctly object to all this and insist that
<br>
everything I've said looks perfectly mechanical, so why couldn't a
<br>
computer program produce it? To find the nth bit of our so called non
<br>
computable number all you need to do is run the Pn computer program
<br>
until it produces the nth bit and then &quot;not&quot; it. Now we have a computer
<br>
program producing a number that no computer program can produce.    
<br>
<p>Something is not right. Something stinks. The only solution to the
<br>
paradox is that in general the Halting Problem must not have a solution.
<br>
It means I was pulling a fast one when I said &quot;Sometimes the program
<br>
will have no output at all because it is caught in an endless loop, in
<br>
that case just put in a blank line in the list&quot; because you can never
<br>
know if it deserves a blank. It means you can't know for sure if the
<br>
program will ever produce the nth bit. It might go into an endless loop,
<br>
it might not. It might produce the nth bit in 5 seconds, it might
<br>
produce it in 5 billion years, it might never produce it. There is no
<br>
general algorithm to decide, that means that in general a computer
<br>
program can never know if it will find a solution to a problem or what
<br>
it will do next until it actually does it.
