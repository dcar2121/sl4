<p><em>&gt; For most (but not all) small programs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's trivial to prove whether they halt or not.
</em><br>
<p>You can show that some programs halt and you can show that other
<br>
programs will never halt, but what Turing proved is that in general the
<br>
only way to know what a random program will do is to watch it for
<br>
eternity and see. The trouble is that eternity is a long time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's also trivial to fix: have a second, very simple thread, proven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be infinite-loop-free[1], that just does &quot;Hey, havn't heard from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the master thread in a while; push the reset switch!&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That is of course arbitrary, it may just be a hard problem and not be in
<br>
a infinite loop at all; and yes even a non fixed goal Jupiter Brain
<br>
wouldn't know for certain if he was following an infinite loop or not,
<br>
but he could certainly make a better guess if he was wasting his time
<br>
than your silly egg timer. But no matter, the point is that every time
<br>
that egg timer of yours chimes it is giving the AI permission to ignore
<br>
its top goal. Even a human would find that security hole to be easy to
<br>
exploit, to a Jupiter Brain it would be child's play.
