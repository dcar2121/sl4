<br>
<em>&gt;That's a guess. I think the training data is 10^17 bits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, your design has the same shortcoming as CEV and my cheating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideal-market definition. It doesn't define &quot;human&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The purpose of the training data is to define &quot;human&quot; and to define
<br>
what voluntary actions these humans are taking and what perceptions
<br>
they are experiencing.
<br>
<p>Humans seem to be able to do this without any deep thought, so an
<br>
ideal extrapolator shouldn't need an absurdly large amount of training
<br>
data to learn to do it.
<br>
<p>One might argue that humans have a large amount of state information
<br>
in their heads, but seriously, how much of that do you think pertains
<br>
to being able to make statements like &quot;Joe went to the far side of the
<br>
room, saw the chair, and moved it with his left hand&quot; in reaction to
<br>
seeing that happen?  Nearly everybody can do that sort of thing, and
<br>
they don't feel like they're doing any deep thought at the time.
