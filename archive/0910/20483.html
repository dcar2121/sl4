Hello Randall,
<br>
If you assume that 'in general' means &quot;For all X...&quot;, why would JC use
<br>
phrases such as 'given algorithms' and 'random programs'? These distinct
<br>
phrases seem to imply he is referring to predictions about samples, rather
<br>
than a universal claim.
<br>
<p>Also, 'programs' and 'algorithms' are not semantically equivalent except
<br>
under certain definitions; many programs would be described as heuristics
<br>
rather than algorithms, for example those that abort using a timer after a
<br>
given time, and may not produce a result; those that use randomness (e.g.
<br>
monte carlo with physical random seed), etc.
<br>
<p>Finally, consistency between JC's posts may not be important anyway, given
<br>
that they are simply factually inaccurate: JC claims: &quot;what Turing proved is
<br>
that in general the only way to know what a random program will do is to
<br>
watch it for eternity and see&quot;. This is absolutely not what I see AT
<br>
actually claiming in that paper.
<br>
