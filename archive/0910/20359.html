Me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Stuart, are you seriously suggesting that the stupid leading the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brilliant is a permanently stable situation?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Stuart Armstrong&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dragondreaming@googlemail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20I%20am%20a%20Singularitian%20who%20does%20not%20believe%20in%20the%20Singularity.">dragondreaming@googlemail.com</a>&gt; 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course it is - if the brilliant desire it.
</em><br>
<p>And you think this astronomically powerful mind will always want to be a
<br>
slave led around by the nose because human beings put in a line of code
<br>
that says &quot;always obey people&quot;; the very same people who can't write a
<br>
word processing program without bugs, the same people who can't predict
<br>
what some 5 line programs will do. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extreme current example: a whole section of the population follows a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book, an object so stupid that it can't even talk back or decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything at all, just because that book is holy. 
</em><br>
<p>Stuart, are you seriously suggesting that the stupid leading the
<br>
brilliant is a moral situation? Do you think the best analogy for the
<br>
future of humanity is a race of phony TV preachers?
<br>
<p>I'd be much more outraged with this entire silly &quot;friendly AI&quot; stuff if
<br>
I thought such a horror was actually possible, but fortunately
<br>
engineering a SUPERIOR slave race is not.
