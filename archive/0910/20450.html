</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a formal mathematical definition of intelligence?  What's so great
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't know whether a formal definition of intelligence exists or is
<br>
possible. (I left the checkbox on step C unchecked, you'll notice.)
<br>
<p><p>As for the value of math:
<br>
<p>This is a very difficult idea to explain, because it's very subtle. The
<br>
best hope I can offer you is that, once you get it, it feels utterly
<br>
simple and obvious in retrospect.
<br>
<p>What follows is a very poor attempt to allude at the general direction
<br>
of the answer you're looking for. If you're already most of the way
<br>
there, it may make some sense to you.
<br>
<p><p>Yes, I consider English to be insufficiently precise. (Note, though,
<br>
that certain proper subsets of English can be used to communicate
<br>
mathematically-rigorous ideas.)
<br>
<p>Yes, I consider Ruby sufficiently formal. A Turing machine is specified
<br>
with mathematical rigor; a Turing machine (plus oracles for clock, HRNG,
<br>
etc.) can emulate a modern PC; therefore, any computer program is
<br>
mathematically rigorously defined.
<br>
<p>The existence of a formal definition of a question is a necessary
<br>
prerequisite to being able to answer the question with certainty.
<br>
<p><p>Consider the following text from version 0 of the document:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Compile design requirements for &quot;friendly AI&quot;.  When will we know we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have succeeded?
</em><br>
<p>In order for this step to be properly completed, the design requirements
<br>
must be so clear and precise that there is no possible dispute over
<br>
their interpretation.
<br>
<p>(There may of course be dispute over whether they correctly ask the
<br>
&quot;friendly AI&quot; question, but that problem is probably intractable even in
<br>
principle.)
<br>
<p>This degree of total precision is, essentially, the definition of
<br>
mathematical rigor.
<br>
<p><p>Mathematics is more than just the ability to manipulate numbers. It's
<br>
_logic_, the discipline of clear, precise, unambiguous thought. Logic
<br>
means seeing the world with sharp edges, and distinguishing with
<br>
absolute certainty between truth and falsehood.
