<p>I don't know.  It seemed that there was a way to interpret the post

such that it was consistent.  Perhaps I'm wrong.

<p>I'm inclined to give Mr. Clark the benefit of the doubt where possible,

considering his reputation on, for example, the Extropians list of the

1990s.  I do think it's still an open question whether a fixed hierarchy

of goals is workable for a GAI.
