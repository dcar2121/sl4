<p>if this AI models only my mind, it will have no reason to kill the
<br>
biological life it has subsumed.  I imagine that after an upload, my
<br>
old-school flesh and blood self would still want to live out a human
<br>
lifetime.  The uploaded self wouldn't care because its goals (are
<br>
capabilities) are instantly so different/disconnected from the flesh
<br>
that we're effectively different people anyway.  I currently believe I
<br>
would let me live.  I expect that immediate after upload I would still
<br>
let me live - in both contexts.  So what does a human_v1 do with
<br>
itself after the techorapture?  You've already suggested that
<br>
evolution has programmed us to fear death, so a few might suicide in
<br>
response to overwhelming change but not all.  You're right, there's
<br>
nothing about my identity that can't be more cheaply simulated by the
<br>
AI - except maybe for presence.  Those remaining human_v1 will
<br>
probably return to a tribal/communal living arrangement not of
<br>
necessity (there won't be necessity for much) but out of the choice to
<br>
'be' around each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Depends what you mean by &quot;better&quot;. You were created by evolution. It wasn't your idea to program yourself to fear death and then die. But evolution knows better.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution doesn't really know anything.  It's just patient.
