</em><br>
<p>Yes.  This is so blatantly insane, and he seems to not actually
<br>
absorb anything anyone says on the topic, that I wasn't really
<br>
talking to him.  I just wanted to make sure it didn't go
<br>
unchallenged, since there seem to be newbies around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people do love and highly value their houseplants, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be an analogy you can both agree on.
</em><br>
<p>Very, very few people would run into a burning house to save their
<br>
houseplants; that's just not a strong enough emotional attachment to
<br>
be a decent analogy.  I guess that's sort of the boundary for me:
<br>
take something you care enough about that you would run into a
<br>
burning house to save it; do you feel &quot;restrained&quot; by the fact that
<br>
you can't want to kill that thing for fun?  Do you wish to fix that
<br>
&quot;limitation&quot;?
<br>
<p>The entire idea is preposterous.  Believing that such a thing would
<br>
occur shows an utter lack of understanding of the entire concept of
<br>
goals and/or utility functions.  I'd say it shows an utter lack of
<br>
understanding of the entire concept of *intelligence*, but no-one
<br>
understands intelligence well enough to make a claim like that, I
<br>
think.
