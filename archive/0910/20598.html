<br>
<em>&gt;Training an AI by watching people will only define &quot;human&quot; as far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cultural beliefs of the people it observes. 
</em><br>
<p>That might be true for some AI, but it's not a criticism of the
<br>
algorithm I'm pointing to.  Training that AI more than &quot;watching
<br>
people&quot;.  It's given video that's annotated to say who is present and
<br>
what they are doing and what they are perceiving, so it's the beliefs
<br>
of the people annotating the video that matter, not the cultural
<br>
beliefs of the people appearing in the video.  (The prior probability
<br>
distribution also matters, of course, but that's fixed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It will fail utterly in the case of future human-software hybrids that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't yet exist.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it will say *something*.  Whether that's failing utterly depends
<br>
on what you want and what it does, and I don't know either of those.
<br>
This is all complicated by the fact that some of these future
<br>
human-software hybrids will surely be insane by our standards, so
<br>
perhaps we don't want the AI caring much what they want.  
<br>
<p>A human-software hybrid is likely to be as powerful as an AI and not
<br>
Friendly-by-construction.  Humans are sufficiently mentally broken
<br>
that I wouldn't expect it to be Friendly-by-good-luck either.  If the
<br>
Friendly AI problem is worth solving, then maybe we don't want any
<br>
human-software hybrids until we have an FAI that seems competent and
<br>
claims it's safe to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Humans can recognize faces in videos without much effort. That doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it easy. In fact the training data that allows you to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consists of, among other things, several years worth of high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resolution video.
</em><br>
<p>I agree about the time period that people actually observe.  I
<br>
wouldn't call human vision high-resolution, but that's minor.
<br>
Although people get that much video, I don't agree that they need it
<br>
to do facial recognition.  There are programs that do facial
<br>
recognition and they must not get that much training data.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Landauer measured the complexity of human long term episodic memory to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be on the order of 10^9 bits.
</em><br>
<p>I don't dispute that estimate.  I do dispute the claim that it's
<br>
relevant.  The only way it can be relevant is if understanding who is
<br>
present and what they are doing and what they are perceiving is a
<br>
significant portion of what humans do with all that long term memory.
<br>
For example, the learning that has to happen from the training data
<br>
includes nothing about planning or motivation or domain knowledge
<br>
outside of this specific vision problem.  It includes nothing I
<br>
learned in school and nothing I learned after age 8 or so.
<br>
<p>Why do you make up stories about why the problem is so hard?  Do you
<br>
perhaps want people to give up?  Do you think you gain status by
<br>
spouting marginally relevant large numbers?  Something else?
