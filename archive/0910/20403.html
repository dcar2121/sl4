<p><em>&gt; Just for the record, John Clark is something of a local nutjob;
</em><br>
<p>I may or may not be a nutjob, but I am not local, I've been writing
<br>
about this on many other lists for one hell of a lot longer than you
<br>
have. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the only reason I responded to him at all is that we've had a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newbies in here lately and I didn't want his crap to go unanswered.
</em><br>
<p>Then why don't you answer some of my crap, it should be easy and fun to
<br>
make me look like a fool, after all its just crap. Instead you just
<br>
shrug your shoulders when I show that mathematicians have known for 75
<br>
years that a fixed goal mind won't work; but perhaps you think calling
<br>
me a nutjob is enough of a answer to protect those poor innocent
<br>
&quot;newbies&quot; from my corrupting influence.
<br>
<p>And by the way, if I called you a &quot;nutcase&quot; there would have been howls
<br>
of protest and demands that I be kicked off the list, but I don't mind,
<br>
I'm a big boy and have been called worse.
