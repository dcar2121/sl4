<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will not actually reproduce the math here; that would be rude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the authors, at the very least, and copyright violation.
</em><br>
<p>As he has demonstrated numerous times the last thing in the world Robin
<br>
Lee Powell would want to be is rude, but until this second I had no idea
<br>
he was such a big fan of copyright law. There for a minute I thought
<br>
that maybe the reason he didn't explain the math was that it was totally
<br>
incomprehensible to him and might as well have been written in Chinese.
<br>
But no, that's not the reason at all, it's the copyright thing. Yes, I'm
<br>
sure that's the explanation, it's the copyright thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Run the algorithm for at most N+1 steps.  At every step, mark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the state off in your enumeration.  Stop when:
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You reach a state (of both the FSM and memory) that Obviously if a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a finite memory it would be possible in seen before.  Since the Turing machine formalism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely deterministic, the algorithm is in an infinite loop through this state, and you're done:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not halt.
</em><br>
<p>I've got to admit that makes a lot of sense, but it seems oddly
<br>
familiar, where did I see that before? Oh yes, now I remember, I said it
<br>
myself several posts ago:  
<br>
<p>&quot;Obviously if a computer has a finite memory it would be possible in
<br>
theory to keep a record of every state the machine goes into, and if you
<br>
found that a state was repeated then you'd know for sure that the
<br>
machine was in a infinite loop. But the trouble is that the machine
<br>
needed to do all that checking would have to be much larger than the
<br>
original machine, and that larger machine would have no way to know if
<br>
it was itself in a infinite loop unless it was watched over by an even
<br>
larger machine.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stop When:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The algorithm runs out of memory.
</em><br>
<p>Again I can't disagree with that, but for some reason I am again
<br>
overcome by a strong feeling of Deja View. I wonder what the cause could
<br>
be. Maybe it was the post I sent sever posts before the previous one I
<br>
quoted when I said:
<br>
<p>&quot;So let's see, if you have a small memory you can prove that a computer
<br>
will halt when it runs out of memory. Wow what a profound result! I can
<br>
confidently predict that if you loaded Windows Vista into the original
<br>
ENIAC from 1946 that machine will halt too.&quot;
<br>
<p>You quote the authors (I guess text is not covered by copyright law,
<br>
just mathematics) as saying 
<br>
&quot;the abovementioned proof is not novel in theoretical computer science.&quot;
<br>
You also quote them as saying &quot;Unfortunately, N will ordinarily be such
<br>
a huge number that this result is only theoretical, it does not lead to
<br>
a practical algorithm&quot;. But then, bizarrely, you say &quot;Which was the
<br>
point many of us have been trying to make&quot;.
<br>
<p>What the hell are you talking about? What's this &quot;many of us&quot; crap? It's
<br>
the point I was trying to make but nobody agreed with me, that Turing
<br>
was profound and this stuff about finite memory machines is vacuous,
<br>
hell even the authors of the paper seem to think so. Since your short
<br>
term memory is so bad I will repeat something I quoted a few paragraphs
<br>
back that comes from one of my posts I sent about a dozen hours ago: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Obviously if a computer has a finite memory it would be possible in
<br>
theory to keep a record of every state the machine goes into, and if you
<br>
found that a state was repeated then you'd know for sure that the
<br>
machine was in a infinite loop. But the trouble is that the machine
<br>
needed to do all that checking would have to be much larger than the
<br>
original machine, and that larger machine would have no way to know if
<br>
it was itself in a infinite loop unless it was watched over by an even
<br>
larger machine.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is almost exactly what the paper said, and the authors of this
<br>
&quot;paper&quot; admit that it has no practical value and that they are saying
<br>
nothing new, so it is a bit of a mystery why they bothered to write it
<br>
in the first place, however there is no mystery why it is just online
<br>
and not published in a real science journal. But you read (skimmed more
<br>
likely) this piece of fluff and triumphantly announce &quot;It does, in fact,
<br>
prove that the halting problem is only undecidable for infinite
<br>
computers&quot; and then try to peddle the idea that some difficult problems
<br>
could be solved if only the computer had LESS memory. Should I start
<br>
pulling memory cards out of my computer now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And, of course, none of this has anything to do whatsoever with goal systems
</em><br>
<p>Except that whenever you say &quot;always do X, no exceptions&quot; and X happens
<br>
to be one of the infinite number of programs that produce infinite loops
<br>
then your mighty AI turns into a useless lump of metal and silicon.
<br>
Turing wins again.
