<em>&gt; Alright, it is no wonder you guys can't get anything done.  I start a single thread, with a single, simple purpose:  to trade versions of a single document: the to-do list.  And you all can't resist the urge to get into the most arcane, esoteric mathematical bullshit imaginable.  &quot;Degree of compressibility&quot;.  &quot;Test giver must have more information than test-taker&quot;.  wank wank wank.
</em><br>
<p>Because your checklist is wrong. Specifically, the first 3 steps are wrong. This invalidates the last 2 steps that depend on them. To quote:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
This document implies dependencies only insofar as each step's dependencies should appear before that step.  Note that other sequential orderings are possible while maintaining this constraint. 
<br>
<p><p>[ ] Compile design requirements for &quot;friendly AI&quot;.  When will we know we have succeeded?
<br>
<p>[ ] Develop automated tests which will determine whether a given system is friendly to humans or not
<br>
[ ] Develop automated tests which will determine whether a given system is intelligent or not (IQ, whatever)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(these tests should reflect the requirements laid out in the first step: &quot;compile design requirements&quot;)
<br>
<p>[ ] Develop prototype systems and apply these tests to them.  Refactor tests as necessary in the case we find that some requirement is not specified in the tests.
<br>
<p>[ ] Continue refactoring prototypes until we have a system which passes both the intelligence tests and friendliness tests.  
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;1. The definition of &quot;Friendly AI&quot; has an algorithmic complexity of 10^17 bits. Roughly, it means to do what people want, with conflicts resolved as an ideal secrecy-free market would resolve them. So your definition has to describe what 10^10 people want, and how much they want it, which means your definition must describe what they know, and each person knows about 10^7 bits that nobody else knows. My definition is cheating, of course, because I am pointing to human brains instead of describing what they contain.
<br>
<p>Also, I haven't defined &quot;people&quot;. Does it include embryos, animals, slaves, women, and illegal immigrants? (Don't give me an answer that depends on your cultural beliefs). Does it include future human-animal-robot-software hybrids? Do all people have equal rights or do we weight rights by how much money you have like in a real market?
<br>
<p>2. You can't test for friendliness unless you already know that the tester is friendly. How do you know it isn't lying?
<br>
<p>3. You can't test for intelligence unless you are smarter than the test taker. Otherwise, how do you know that it is giving the right answers?
<br>
<p>So the result is we will find another way to build AI. There is a US$1 quadrillion incentive to get it done. That's the value of global human labor divided by market interest rates.
<br>
<p>Just in case you haven't noticed, the internet is getting smarter.
