<p>That's what I thought you meant.

<p><em>&gt;    - I'm also a web developer, and I'm pretty confident that at least some
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;    systems like neural networks.
</em><br>
<p>The neural networks will be written in code.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    - Mathematical definition of friendliness - good luck with that.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    we could start with English definitions, then slowly start constraining our
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Does anyone know of a body of formal mathematical definitions of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Economics and game theory might be a good place to start.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there's a big tradeoff between rigor and applicability.  Linear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems (cannon firing at ï¿½ from horizontal with velocity V - where will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannonball land?) lend themselves nicely to mathematical analysis - i.e. we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can answer the question without performing the experiment.  Nonlinear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems (6 * 10 ^ 23 concepts interconnecting and mutually
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much - i.e. we won't really know until we build the darn thing and turn
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The cannonball is only a simple system because we have a good high-level
<br>
model of the 10^whatever quantum interactions that make it up. My
<br>
understanding of the FAI question is that it's trying to produce a
<br>
similarly high-level model of AI systems that will allow us to predict
<br>
the overall behavior of a Jupiter brain without explicitly tracking
<br>
every flip of a bit.
