<p>I don't think it's possible to have a coherent conversation without math.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've noticed that conversations on this list consistently do one thing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The to-do list was an effort to contract the conversation.  An English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teacher of mine in high school once laid out the process of writing a paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;=
</em><br>
<p>You're right, of course.
<br>
<p>But, then, this list has been working on the problem for a long time.
<br>
Don't you think the simple, high-level concepts have been worked out by now?
<br>
<p>I'm still a newbie, but I imagine it worked something like this: people
<br>
saw an important problem, started breaking it down into its component
<br>
pieces, solved the easy parts, and started banging their heads together
<br>
over the hard parts.
<br>
<p>Since they've broken the problem down and done away with the easy parts,
<br>
they're necessarily fussing over relatively small details; since all the
<br>
easy parts are solved, they're necessarily left with the hard parts.
<br>
<p>So what you see when you come in and look at them in the middle of the
<br>
problem is a pack of hyenas tussling over a bit of gristle. It looks
<br>
like they're focused on random minor details, because you didn't see how
<br>
that detail got sorted out from all the rest. It looks like they're not
<br>
making any progress, because you didn't see them making progress through
<br>
all the other parts. All you see is the seemingly interminable struggle
<br>
over the last remaining scraps.
<br>
<p>This should be true of any field that's been around for a while, I
<br>
think, so the theory should be testable in multiple situations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, and as for &quot;mathematical&quot; definitions of friendliness, I'd say to hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with economics (which never models more than one entity and has no concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of allies).  I'd ask the military:  how do you gauge whether another entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is friendly?  I'm sure the CIA's been working on that problem for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looooooong time.  Maybe they won't share their findings though.  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're not friendly to our goals.  But being humans, who also stand to die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the hands of circular saw-wielding terminators, they might just see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit in sharing knowledge.  Anyone here do military theory?
</em><br>
<p>I think you're confusing the human-empathic, ordinary-language meaning
<br>
of &quot;friendly&quot; with the more formal, specialized term &quot;Friendly&quot; (with
<br>
the capital F). A Friendly AI is one that we would want to have go foom;
<br>
in particular, a well-intentioned but misguided AI (e.g., a smiley-face
<br>
maximizer) is friendly but not Friendly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry if I offended anyone.  I'm only trying to up the mutation rate;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing personal.
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully you'll succeed. Your post did seem to break up the usual pace
<br>
somewhat, which is probably a good thing. Aerate the water and all that.
