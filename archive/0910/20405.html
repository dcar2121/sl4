<p>
I apologise to get back into this, and I apologise for the somewhat
<br>
snarky tone of my previous post and this one, but I can't really let
<br>
this side any longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when I show that mathematicians have known for 75
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years that a fixed goal mind won't work;
</em><br>
<p>This is a lie. I am a mathematician, and have run this by some of my
<br>
colleagues who work in formal logic and theoretical computer science.
<br>
You are not &quot;repeating what mathematicians have known&quot;, you are making
<br>
a new, and extraordinary, claim.
<br>
<p>The onus is not on us to refute it, but for you to prove it. Start
<br>
with &quot;Assume there exists a fixed goal mind that works&quot; and work
<br>
though a series of logical steps to &quot;Therefore there must exist an
<br>
algorithmic procedure for deciding if an arbitrary Turing machine
<br>
stops&quot;. Make sure each step is rigorous, and that the definitions are
<br>
clear and solid. Take your time.
<br>
<p>I deliberately chose the contrapositive version (not B implies not A,
<br>
equivalent with A implies B), because it's easier to follow in this
<br>
case, and less easy to cheat in the reasoning chain.
<br>
<p>So, are you up to the task? Since you affirm your statement with the
<br>
force of a mathematical theorem, are you ready to write out the proof
<br>
that would actually make it into such a theorem?
<br>
<p>As I said before, apologies for the tone, but I feel there is no other
<br>
way of getting the point across.
<br>
<p>Stuart
