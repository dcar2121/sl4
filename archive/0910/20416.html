<p>So write the AI without the urge to check itself for infinite loops,
<br>
since that's obviously impossible?  Furthermore, the AI itself would
<br>
know that was impossible, and wouldn't even try.
<br>
<p>Is that seriously your argument?  That a fixed goal mind *must*
<br>
check itself for infinite loops to function?

They say:  &quot;The first AIs will be built by the military as weapons.&quot;
And I'm  thinking:  &quot;Does it even occur to you to try for something
other  than  the default  outcome?&quot;  See <a href="http://shrunklink.com/cdiz">http://shrunklink.com/cdiz</a>
