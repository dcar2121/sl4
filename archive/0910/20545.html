As far as we can tell the brain operates on a finite set of inputs.  
<br>
Consciousness ignores most of the incoming signals, but they exist at 
<br>
the interface.  So for the purpose of this discussion Turing machines 
<br>
are relevant.
<br>
<p>I rather agree that Turing machines don't have much to do with actual 
<br>
implementation of an AI, but they're easy to prove theorems about, and 
<br>
they can be proven equivalent (within certain constraints) to any other 
<br>
computer, so they're useful for setting a framework.
<br>
<p>Just to be clear I am denying the assertion &quot;A brain doesn't work on a
<br>
fixed set of inputs, nor even on a predictable set of inputs.&quot; on the 
<br>
grounds that the sensory nerves are finite in number, and each one is 
<br>
finite in the number of states that it can occupy.  If either of these 
<br>
assertions is challenged, then I see reason to disagree with my 
<br>
conclusions, but both seem (to me) rather certain.  You may not be able 
<br>
to predict which inputs will be used, but you can create a set of all 
<br>
possible input signals for any situation, and then create a family of 
<br>
Turing machines that cover those signals.  (Yeah, it's an unreasonably 
<br>
large set.  This kind of explosion happens when you are trying to prove 
<br>
things with vague boundaries.  The fact that it's unreasonably large 
<br>
doesn't keep you from determining characteristics that are true for all 
<br>
members of the set.)
