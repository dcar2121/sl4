<em>&gt;&gt; The halting problem is not what you think it is. As far as I am aware,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is quite possible to show that *some* algorithms will or will not halt
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No shit Sherlock
</em><br>
<p>1. Well, at least you are beginning to acknowledge that other people's
<br>
criticisms of what you are saying, are correct. A form of progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if it were not true *all* algorithms would be useless.
</em><br>
<p>2. Absolute rubbish. There are algorithms and heuristics that are used
<br>
despite our inability to predict their run-times accurately. The utility of
<br>
an algorithm is only partly defined by our ability to predict whether or not
<br>
it will halt.
<br>
<p>Take the field of constraint satisfaction programming. It is fairly well
<br>
known among researchers that problems in that field tend to have the
<br>
property of being either a) easy to find answers to, b) easy to show that no
<br>
answer exists, or c) A complete nightmare that will take a hideous, and
<br>
perhaps effectively incomputable, amount of time. The problem is that we
<br>
have no effective way to distinguish between these cases a priori other than
<br>
some very broad heuristics. Guess what? This technology is used for
<br>
scheduling problems every day, all over the world.
<br>
<p>3. I note that you have once again ignored a call for definitions of your
<br>
'fixed brains' 'non-fixed brains', etc. You also ignored most of the points
<br>
made by your critics in recent messages.
<br>
<p>Mu
<br>
<p>p.s.
<br>
<p>4. I note that your claims are not even consistent between consecutive
<br>
posts:
<br>
<p>your reply to me: &quot;What Turing proved is that in general there is no way to
<br>
prove that any
<br>
given algorithm will halt.&quot;
<br>
<p>your immediately subsequent reply to Robin: &quot;what Turing proved is that in
<br>
general the only way to know what a random program will do is to watch it
<br>
for eternity and see.&quot;
<br>
<p>These claims are inconsistent (&quot;any given&quot; != &quot;random&quot;,    &quot;prove&quot; != &quot;know,
<br>
watch for eternity and see&quot;).
<br>
<p>5. They're also both wrong.
<br>
<p>What Turing actually proved, as far as I am aware, was that *a* general
<br>
*algorithm* cannot solve the halting problem for *all* possible
<br>
program-input combinations.
<br>
<p>Note my use of emphasis on &quot;a&quot; &quot;algorithm&quot; (here, equivalent to 'turing
<br>
machine program') and &quot;all&quot;.
