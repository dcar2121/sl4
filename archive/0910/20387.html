Hello,
<br>
I just wanted to point out there really is a lot of crap being written on
<br>
this list currently, and it would be good if it this situation were to
<br>
improve rapidly.
<br>
<p>1. &quot;Fixed minds&quot;. What rot. Unless you happen to have a working artificial
<br>
mind already built, perhaps it is rather arrogant of you to discuss the
<br>
design limitations of such a thing. Heck, it's not unknown for even apparent
<br>
'physical law' to be overturned occasionally when reality asserts itself
<br>
over theory in the form of empirical data. As for mathematical theorems:
<br>
well, maths is beautiful but it's only a constraint when the axioms of your
<br>
mathematics coincide accurately with the axioms that reality has chosen for
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>2. Comments on here about turing machines and their consequences for
<br>
artificial minds. Wow, so much complete crap to wade through. In case you
<br>
haven't noticed, there is not one single Turing machine on this planet. Not
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>Everything we do today, we do with finite state machines that do passable
<br>
imitations of 'almost' PDAs and 'almost'   TMs. Indeed, we have strange,
<br>
mysterious devices, whose abilities surpass those of turing machines
<br>
already!
<br>
<p>They're called desktop PCs. They have things like clock-driven interrupts,
<br>
physical random number generators and state reset buttons, features that
<br>
would make a Turing Machine weep with envy. A turing machine is actually
<br>
just a handy model we use for some theory and programming - when it suits
<br>
us.
<br>
<p>Has anyone here actually experienced a desktop PC going into a loop that
<br>
couldn't be halted? I doubt it. Mr Reset Button is your Friend. As for
<br>
general algorithms and coding, use a timer driven interrupt that resets the
<br>
state of the entire machine after a fixed time if you want to be absolutely,
<br>
positively, certain that any arbitrary routine will certainly halt within a
<br>
known time. It might not complete - but it will damn well halt.
<br>
<p>3. Ever noticed a model of time in a turing machine? A model of truly
<br>
non-deterministic behaviour? Well, perhaps making appeals to Turing's work
<br>
in your discussion of future artificial minds is a bit stupid, in that case,
<br>
and you should stop doing it.
<br>
<p>4. In case you missed it in (2): Artificial minds will not be turing
<br>
machines, because there are no turing machines. They don't exist. If you
<br>
disagree, then please write your response on a piece of infinitely long tape
<br>
and post it to this address.
<br>
<p>Thank you for listening
<br>
<p>Mu
<br>
