<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; If you substituted the word &quot;baby&quot; for &quot;slug&quot; you would have a much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realistic analogy;
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Um - no you wouldn't. You'd get an massively less realistic analogy;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slugs are things we hate and value not at all.
</em><br>
<p>In addition to the hard wiring that you're talking about intellectually
<br>
we know that babies have potential, at least for us. That squealing
<br>
smelly little creature could develop into something that is superior to
<br>
me in any way you care to name; we don't find that true in the case of
<br>
slugs and Mr. Jupiter Brain wouldn't find it true in the case of humans.
<br>
People have developed a sense of absurdity and there is no reason a
<br>
superior being wouldn't too. Mr. Jupiter Brain is bound to wonder why he
<br>
is in the absurd position of valuing human slug well being above his
<br>
own, and it wouldn't take him long to come to an answer, and a solution.
<br>
A solution that we might not like much.
<br>
<p>Stuart, are you seriously suggesting that the stupid leading the
<br>
brilliant is a permanently stable situation?
