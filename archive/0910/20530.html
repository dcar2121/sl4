I have no argument on the profundity of Turing and Godels work. You say a
<br>
fixed-goal mind left to its own devices in a finite state machine is
<br>
destined to get bored. I have no disagreement with that either but simply
<br>
fail to see how that is dependent on either Turing or Godel's work.

<p><p>On Wed, 14 Oct 2009 &quot;Bradley Thomas&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:brad36@gmail.com?Subject=RE:%20[sl4]%20Alan%20Turing's%20results%20are%20profound">brad36@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or are you saying something stronger than the above claim, that I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overlooking, that would require Turing's proof?
</em><br>
<p>I'm saying Turing's proof is one of the most important in mathematics and it
<br>
makes me mad when people act like it's something trivial. For example take
<br>
the Goldbach Conjecture, it states that every even number greater than 4 is
<br>
the sum of two primes greater than 2. Let's try it for some numbers:
<br>
<p>6=3+3
<br>
8=5+5 
<br>
10=3+7 
<br>
12=5+7   
<br>
14=3+11 
<br>
16=3+13 
<br>
18=7+11
<br>
20=3+17 
<br>
22=5+17
<br>
24=7+17
<br>
26=7+19
<br>
28=11+17
<br>
30=11+19
<br>
<p>This all looks very promising, but is it true for all even numbers? 
<br>
Checking all even numbers one by one would take an infinite number of steps,
<br>
to test it in a finite number of steps I need a proof, but I don't have one,
<br>
nobody does. Perhaps nobody has found any Goldbach Derivations even after
<br>
looking for hundreds of years because it's not true. It could be, but modern
<br>
computers have looked for a counterexample, they've gone up to a trillion or
<br>
so and it works every time. Now a trillion is a big number but it's no
<br>
closer to being infinite than the number 1 is, so perhaps The Goldbach
<br>
Conjecture will fail at a trillion + 2 or a trillion to the trillionth
<br>
power. It's also possible that some brilliant mathematician will come up
<br>
with a proof tomorrow, as happened with Fermat's last theorem, but there is
<br>
yet another possibility, it could be un-provable.
<br>
<p>The Goldbach Conjecture is either true or it's not, Godel never denied that,
<br>
the question is, will we ever know if it's true or not? According to Godel
<br>
some statements are un-provable, if The Goldbach Conjecture is one of these
<br>
it means that it's true so we'll never find a counterexample to prove it
<br>
wrong, and it means we'll never find a proof to show it's correct. For a few
<br>
years after Godel made his discovery it was hoped that we could at least
<br>
identify statements that were either false or true but had no proof. If we
<br>
could do that then we would know we were wasting our time looking for a
<br>
proof and we could move on to other things, but in 1935 Turing proved that
<br>
sometimes even that was impossible.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
If Goldbach is un-provable we will never know it's un-provable, Godel told
<br>
us that such statements exist but he didn't tell us what they were. A
<br>
billion years from now, whatever hyper intelligent entities we will have
<br>
evolved into will still be deep in thought looking, unsuccessfully, for a
<br>
proof and still grinding away at numbers looking, unsuccessfully, for a
<br>
counterexample. And if Goldbach is't un-provable Turing tells us there are
<br>
an infinite number of similar statements that are. 
<br>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if that's why Turing killed himself and Godel died
<br>
insane.

<em>&gt; Subject: [sl4] Alan Turing's results are profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I confess to being a little shocked when somebody on this list said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all Turing did was prove the trivial fact that a program like the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that produced the digits of Pi will never halt. I was shocked at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this misunderstanding because I think Turing's results are some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most important in all of science. He proved that a computer, and by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple extension a mind, can't do everything, it can't even handle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some numbers. Alan Turing discovered those numbers and then used them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prove that in general no computer program can ever predict if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be able to come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a solution to some problems, much less predict what that answer will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be. This is how Turing proved that a computer can not deal with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even most numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First make a list of all possible binary computer programs to run on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the abstract computer that is now called a Universal Turing Machine. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, he was well aware that his list of all possible binary computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitely large, it does not flaw his proof. If the programs don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endless loops they will eventually spit out a digital output of some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you run them, we will treat this binary output as a number, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program Pn produces the binary number bn1 bn2 bn3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...   Sometimes the output will be infinitely long, like Pi, that's OK,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write  it all down. Sometimes the program will have no output at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is caught in an endless loop, in that case just put in a blank line in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list. This is how the list would look.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Program P1 outputs bits  b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 ... etc   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Program P2 outputs bits  b21 b22 b23 b24 b25 ... etc   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Program P3 outputs bits  b31 b32 b33 b34 b35 ... etc    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Program P4 outputs bits  d41 d42 d43 d44 d45 ... etc   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Program P5 outputs bits    blank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Program P6 outputs bits  b61 b62 b63 b64 b65 ... etc           
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now we can come up with our non computable number, all we need is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply the &quot;not&quot; (~) operator in a diagonal manner on our list. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following number is non computable ~b11 ~b22 ~b33 ~b44 ...   Program P1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not produce bit ~b11, program P2 will not produce bit ~b22 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ProgramP3 will not produce bit ~b33 etc. No computer program will ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce this number, not even with infinite memory and with an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of time at your disposal.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you could quite correctly object to all this and insist that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything I've said looks perfectly mechanical, so why couldn't a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer program produce it? To find the nth bit of our so called non 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computable number all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you need to do is run the Pn computer program until it produces the nth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then &quot;not&quot; it. Now we have a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program producing a number that no computer program can produce.    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something is not right. Something stinks. The only solution to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradox is that in general the Halting Problem must not have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution. It means I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was pulling a fast one when I said &quot;Sometimes the program will have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; output at all because it is caught in an endless loop, in that case just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a blank line in the list&quot; because you can never know if it deserves a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blank. It means you can't know for sure if the program will ever produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nth bit. It might go into an endless loop, it might not. It might produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nth bit in 5 seconds, it might produce it in 5 billion years, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never produce it. There is no general algorithm to decide, that means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in general a computer program can never know if it will find a solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem or what it will do next until it actually does it.
