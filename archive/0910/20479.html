</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt; Even a Turing machine operating on a blank tape (all zeros), need

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This will simply cycle backwards and forwars on the tape, in ever

<em>&gt;&gt; increasing periods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The *turing machine* doesn't return to the same state, but the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same state routinely.  Same with the Pi example.  Program !=
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way you can get a machine running deterministicaly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never returns to exactly the same state and never halts is if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program is infinite, or the data is infinite; the latter is the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your Turing machine.  On real computers, this isn't possible.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fact what the person Stuart was replying to is correct, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require both the FSM and the data to be finite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Just to distinguish this from the rest of the discussion: I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply clarifying; no vitriol or arguing is intended).

Or if the data is occasionally altered by some external factor.  E.g., 
<br>
if your memory isn't perfect, and occasionally does bit-flips (possibly 
<br>
due to quantum processes).
<br>
<p>OTOH, given that the program an the data is finite, there can be only 
<br>
(#program states * #data states)  states for the program (including 
<br>
data) to be in.  So the states would be recurrent.  But a fallible 
<br>
process might ensure that one couldn't predict with total certainty 
<br>
which state would follow which other state.
<br>
<p>Sorry, but this seems true from inspection.
<br>
<p>Now consider that the observable universe is finite.  Interpreting the 
<br>
universe as a state machine, one can derive that it will eventually 
<br>
enter a repeating set of states.  If, of course, it lasts long enough.  
<br>
So humans are contained within a machine that is finite.  Therefore 
<br>
humans are finite.  Therefore humans (both individually and 
<br>
collectively) can only think a finite number of thoughts.   ----   
<br>
Unless you postulate external factors.  If you do, please be explicit 
<br>
about this, and identify any constraints that you consider to exist on 
<br>
those external factors.  (No constraints is equivalent to unconstrained 
<br>
magic.  This is stronger than most gods.)
