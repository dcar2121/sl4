<p>I dunno from quantum, but cosmic rays actually *do* cause bit flips
<br>
fairly regularily in real life:

<p>Sun Support, for a long time, had just the wrong form factor of
<br>
cache RAM on its CPUs for this sort of thing; very dense, very
<br>
physically large (inches on a side).  Support actually told me that
<br>
they had a cosmic ray database; a certain kind of crash/reboot was
<br>
almost always caused by cosmic rays, but people couldn't just go
<br>
back to their boss and say &quot;Enh, cosmic rays&quot;, so they had a
<br>
database; the first time it happened, they'd enter the CPU in, and
<br>
if it happened again, they'd replace it.

They say:  &quot;The first AIs will be built by the military as weapons.&quot;
And I'm  thinking:  &quot;Does it even occur to you to try for something
other  than  the default  outcome?&quot;  See <a href="http://shrunklink.com/cdiz">http://shrunklink.com/cdiz</a>
