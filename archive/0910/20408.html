See Stuart Armstrong's post just sent a few minutes ago on this
<br>
thread; John is claiming that the math of Turing and Goedel proves
<br>
things that it simply, clearly, does not in any way actually prove.
<br>
He his making new and novel statements about important mathetical
<br>
theorems that are quite well understood by many, many people on this
<br>
list.  I can't speak for others, but I had to hand-derive both of
<br>
them from scratch as part of my Bachelor's.
<br>
<p>So far:
<br>
<p>- no-one agrees with him that those pieces of math prove the things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he says they do
<br>
<p>- he refuses to listen to anyone who tries to explain what they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;actually show
<br>
<p>- he hasn't actually shown any *math* for what he claims is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;straight mathematical result
<br>
<p>That's really all there is to it; see how it stands up at lists like
<br>
<a href="http://primes.utm.edu/notes/crackpot.html">http://primes.utm.edu/notes/crackpot.html</a> or
<br>
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html</a> , but substituting
<br>
Turing for the various famous scientists on those lists.
<br>
<p>When I say that something obviously derives from an important
<br>
mathematical proof, I will *show you the math*.  Until then, calling
<br>
me a nutcase for asking someone else to do so seems rather abrupt.
<br>
<p>It's true I didn't ask him for the math in that particular post, but
<br>
that's because having done it many times, and having seen others do
<br>
the same many times, I'm just tired of the whole thing.

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Just for the record, John Clark is something of a local nutjob;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I may or may not be a nutjob, but I am not local, I've been writing

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the only reason I responded to him at all is that we've had a lot of

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

They say:  &quot;The first AIs will be built by the military as weapons.&quot;
