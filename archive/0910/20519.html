@Pavitra:
<br>
Many points, presented in no particular order.  Bullet points are great for
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I've read some of GEB (Hoftstader) and some of The Emperor's New Mind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Penrose), so I'm familiar with the &quot;formal&quot; definition of &quot;formal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematical&quot; - i.e. not just 2 + 2 but also !Q =&gt; !P, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I may not have specified levels correctly on that task in version 0.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said &quot;When will we know we have succeeded?&quot; I should have said &quot;When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will we know we have succeeded in creating a friendly AI?&quot;, and not &quot;When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will we know we have succeeded in creating design requirements?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I kinda like Yudkowski's definition of intelligence as &quot;that which hits
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a target in less than chance time.&quot;  This allows things like heat-seeking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missiles to be considered intelligent.  Not mathematically rigorous, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty close.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I've debated with some MIT kids on the value of &quot;understanding&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence, and whether this is a necessary step in the creation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence.  Being a zen buddhist, I'm incredibly skeptical that anything
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be fully understood.  Yet I'm still able to get things done here and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there (though I'm always ignorant of the full effects of my actions).  I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just want to invent a cheap, mass-producible neural network implemented in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware and sell it like the laptop-for-every-child machine, and have kids
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing a good intuition for what can and cannot be achieved with neural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;networks, the same way they know what can and cannot be achieved with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plasma grenade (see Halo franchise).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I'm also a web developer, and I'm pretty confident that at least some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aspect of our future strong AI will be written in code.  However, I predict
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the code will be simply managing tasks which are handled by black-box
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems like neural networks.  Something like &quot;if(@picture.contains(&quot;a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pizza&quot;)){ say &quot;I see you're thinking about pizza - would you like me to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order you some?&quot;}, where &quot;contains a pizza&quot; will be handled by a neural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;network.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mathematical definition of friendliness - good luck with that.  Perhaps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we could start with English definitions, then slowly start constraining our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;language more and more until we can get a formal mathematical definition.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone know of a body of formal mathematical definitions of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sociological interactions?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Being a civil engineer by training, web developer by trade, serial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entrepreneur, musician, masseuse, and meditator-at-large, and psychedelic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enthusiast, I see myself as bringing some project management expertise to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the table.  I'd be curious to know what everyone else's background and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day-to-day line of work is.  What do you all do?  How can we forge ourselves
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into an effective team, and not just a bunch of idly-chattering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idea-machines?  Do we have any mathematicians in the group?  Musicians?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists?  Billionaires?  Hippies?  Politicians?  Child psychologists?
<br>
<p><p>I think there's a big tradeoff between rigor and applicability.  Linear
<br>
systems (cannon firing at è from horizontal with velocity V - where will the
<br>
cannonball land?) lend themselves nicely to mathematical analysis - i.e. we
<br>
can answer the question without performing the experiment.  Nonlinear
<br>
systems (6 * 10 ^ 23 concepts interconnecting and mutually
<br>
activating/inhibiting within a Jupiter Brain - will it try to kill us?) not
<br>
so much - i.e. we won't really know until we build the darn thing and turn
<br>
it on.
<br>
<p>I'm really quite (1) optimistic about our ability to spawn intelligence
<br>
greater than our own, and (2) pessimistic that the resulting machines will
<br>
be so easily taken out with a simple EMP blast, let alone be guaranteed
<br>
friendly.  But I'm willing to explore the space, because I think it's our
<br>
only hope.
<br>
<p>But rest assured, I'm doing my best to live it up now because I don't have
<br>
much hope of living beyond 2040.
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; My question was this:  You seemed to, for the most part, re-state a lot

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the steps in terms of a problem of formal mathematics.  Why?  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consider English to be insufficient/imprecise?  Do we get to count
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ruby&lt;<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/</a>&gt;as a formal mathematical system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is there a formal mathematical definition of intelligence?  What's so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about formal mathematics?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know whether a formal definition of intelligence exists or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. (I left the checkbox on step C unchecked, you'll notice.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the value of math:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a very difficult idea to explain, because it's very subtle. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best hope I can offer you is that, once you get it, it feels utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple and obvious in retrospect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What follows is a very poor attempt to allude at the general direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the answer you're looking for. If you're already most of the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, it may make some sense to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I consider English to be insufficiently precise. (Note, though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that certain proper subsets of English can be used to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematically-rigorous ideas.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I consider Ruby sufficiently formal. A Turing machine is specified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with mathematical rigor; a Turing machine (plus oracles for clock, HRNG,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.) can emulate a modern PC; therefore, any computer program is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematically rigorously defined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The existence of a formal definition of a question is a necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prerequisite to being able to answer the question with certainty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the following text from version 0 of the document:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Compile design requirements for &quot;friendly AI&quot;.  When will we know we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have succeeded?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In order for this step to be properly completed, the design requirements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be so clear and precise that there is no possible dispute over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their interpretation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (There may of course be dispute over whether they correctly ask the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;friendly AI&quot; question, but that problem is probably intractable even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This degree of total precision is, essentially, the definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical rigor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematics is more than just the ability to manipulate numbers. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _logic_, the discipline of clear, precise, unambiguous thought. Logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means seeing the world with sharp edges, and distinguishing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute certainty between truth and falsehood.
