<p>People have tried to explain to you, several times now, that neither

Turing's work nor Goedel's work implies anything of the kind.  I
<br>
don't see why I should spend my time trying again when it's obvious
<br>
you aren't prepared to listen.
<br>
<p>Having derived both results from scratch during my math/CS degree in
<br>
my youth, there's no question in my mind that what you're saying
<br>
makes no sense whatsoever.
<br>
<p>Seperately, until and unless you've actually formalized what you're
<br>
saying (in parcticular, what a &quot;fixed goal mind&quot; means) *as math*
<br>
and shown *as a mathematical proof* how they can't work, it's all
<br>
just talk anyways.

And I'm  thinking:  &quot;Does it even occur to you to try for something
other  than  the default  outcome?&quot;  See <a href="http://shrunklink.com/cdiz">http://shrunklink.com/cdiz</a>
