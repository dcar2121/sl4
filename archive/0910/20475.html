<em>&gt; &gt; John: the problem you're talking about simply doesn't exist in real
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like hell it doesn't! Why do you think programs unexpectedly hang?
</em><br>
<p>I've been a sysadmin and programmer for 15 years; I know *exactly*
<br>
why programs hang, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the
<br>
halting problem.  90+% of the time it's either I/O contention, or a
<br>
concurrency deadlock of some kind, neither of which are an infinite
<br>
loop in any sense at all (hint: concurrency on modern computers does
<br>
not use looping to wait for resources).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before Turing nearly everybody assumed that a finite algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be found that cuts through all that recursive stuff and just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tells you if a program will send you into an infinite loop or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What Turing found is that such an algorithm does not exist, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the implications of his discovery are vast.
</em><br>
<p>The implications are not what you think they are, in any way, as
<br>
many people have pointed out.  Until you actually find a hole in the
<br>
math in that article, I'm done.

They say:  &quot;The first AIs will be built by the military as weapons.&quot;
And I'm  thinking:  &quot;Does it even occur to you to try for something
other  than  the default  outcome?&quot;  See <a href="http://shrunklink.com/cdiz">http://shrunklink.com/cdiz</a>
