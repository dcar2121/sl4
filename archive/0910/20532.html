<p>
Wow... so many replies, yet so few attempts to check the axioms and
<br>
reasoning.
<br>
<p>Starting from the beginning of JC's post:
<br>
<p>JC wrote: &quot;I confess to being a little shocked when somebody on this list
<br>
said that
<br>
all Turing did was prove the trivial fact that a program like the one
<br>
that produced the digits of Pi will never halt. I was shocked at this
<br>
misunderstanding because I think Turing's results are some of the most
<br>
important in all of science.&quot;
<br>
Well, those are claims about your own mental state and what you believe, no
<br>
problem there.
<br>
<p>JC: &quot;He proved that a computer, and by simple extension a mind, can't do
<br>
everything&quot;
<br>
<p>A computer? By simple extension a mind?
<br>
<p>What utter tosh! And consequently the rest of your post, based as it is
<br>
around these claims, is of no value. If your axioms or reasoning are wrong,
<br>
your conclusions are wrong and should be discarded.
<br>
<p>1 - Turing proved things about Turing Machines in 1936; not computers.
<br>
Turing Machines are not the same as physical computers; they are
<br>
mathematical abstractions that cannot and do not exist in the real world.
<br>
This is a fact of physics. There's just no room for the tape.
<br>
<p>2 - If you would like to prove me wrong, simply show me a turing machine - a
<br>
photo would suffice - to demonstrate that it can exist in the real world. I
<br>
will be looking out for the infinite tape, in particular. Note that regular
<br>
computers are finite state machines, because, surprise surprise, they have a
<br>
finite set of states.
<br>
<p>3 - &quot;by simple extension a mind&quot;? Humans have been disagreeing about what
<br>
constitutes brain and mind for over 2000 years, and you think you can
<br>
casually explain all future minds as being Turing machines with the two
<br>
words 'simple extension'? Such arrogance!
<br>
<p>4 - You keep being asked to provide your evidence that 'all future minds
<br>
will be turing machines'. You keep failing to do so. Why are you failing to
<br>
do so?
<br>
<p>5 - Considering that the only known examples of minds that we have (human
<br>
minds / human brains, depending on your point of view) are clearly not
<br>
Turing machines (they lack infinite state), this would seem to be the
<br>
strongest possible evidence that you do not know what you're talking about.
<br>
<p>6 - I note from
<br>
<a href="http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2006-April/026391.html">http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2006-April/026391.html</a>  that
<br>
you believe yourself to be a computer program. This is a quite extraordinary
<br>
delusion, and is perhaps also the source of the cognitive dissonance that
<br>
you appear to be experiencing when people on this list present you with
<br>
inconvertible facts such as, 'there's not enough room on this planet for a
<br>
turing machine' and mathematical results such as 'e.g. the halting problem
<br>
only applies to theoretical turing machines'.
<br>
<p>7 - You also claim not to possess a subjective experience in that post I
<br>
refer to above. In that case, 'you' ought not to be offended when I call
<br>
'you' an unhinged lunatic. Sure, we might see the body of John Clark react
<br>
in anger, but no harm has actually been done - nobody subjectively
<br>
experienced the feeling of being insulted, don't you agree?
<br>
<p>8 - In an attempt to end your continual misrepresentation of Church and
<br>
Turing's work, I refer you to a peer-reviewed research paper that describes
<br>
your mistake in depth, and why it is a mistake.
<br>
<p>Before you dismiss this paper without reading it - as I expect you will - I
<br>
want to note that the author is the Director of the Turing Archive for the
<br>
History of Computing, and a well-known author of numerous books about Alan
<br>
Turing and Artificial Intelligence. He is widely considered to be one of the
<br>
world's top authorities on what Alan Turing said and did.

<p>&quot;The Broad Conception of Computation&quot; B. JACK COPELAND, 1997
<br>
<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/6/690">http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/6/690</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;*A myth has arisen concerning Turing's article of 1936, namely that Turing
<br>
set forth a fundamental principle concerning the limits of what can be
<br>
computed by machine—a myth that has passed into cognitive science and the
<br>
philosophy of minds to wide and pernicious effect. This supposed principle,
<br>
sometimes incorrectly termed the* Church-Turing thesis, *is the claim that the
<br>
class of functions that can be computed by machines is identical to the
<br>
class of functions that can be computed by Turing machines. In point of
<br>
fact, Turing himself nowhere endorses or even states this claim (nor does
<br>
Church). The author describes a number of notional machines, both analog and
<br>
digital, that can compute more than a universal Turing machine. These
<br>
machines are exemplars of the class of nonclassical computing machines.
<br>
Nothing known at present rules out the possibility that machines in this
<br>
class will one day be built or that the brain itself is such a machine. These
<br>
theoretical considerations undercut a number of foundational arguments that
<br>
are commonly rehearsed in cognitive science and gesture toward a new class
<br>
of cognitive models*.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, STOP WRITING GARBAGE!
