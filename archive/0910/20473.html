<p>So far in this discussion, the above seems to be the most technically
<br>
precise incorrect assertion you've made. Until you take it back, it
<br>
serves as a reference example of your incompetence.
<br>
<p>(That is, a program that halts immediately does halt, nothing
<br>
impossible about that; similarly, a specific algorithm that runs for
<br>
at most X steps, in the meantime checking a transition system for
<br>
loops or whatever, does stop after than number of steps.)
