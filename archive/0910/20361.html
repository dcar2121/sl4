</em><br>
<p>While I agree that an AGI will undoubtedly be lied to about something,
<br>
I don't think those in the Friendliness camp are suggesting that it
<br>
be lied to, or told that human decisions are wiser than its own. 
<br>
<p>Rather, they're suggesting that there can and should be a highest-level
<br>
goal, and that goal should be chosen by AI designers to maximize human
<br>
safety and/or happiness.  It's unclear whether this is possible, but if
<br>
it is possible, and if the AI's goal system is structured this way, 
<br>
then *someone* will have to choose a highest-level goal, and since the
<br>
AI won't want to change it (by definition, since it's the highest 
<br>
possible goal), it'll be stable except via accident or outside changes.
<br>
<p>Now, it's entirely arguable whether such a goal system is possible to
<br>
build (as a stable system, etc), but it doesn't make any sense to 
<br>
accept the Friendliness camp's assumption that it is possible and 
<br>
then argue that the AI will magically discard the goal because it's
<br>
so much more intelligent.  A highest level goal guides intelligence;
<br>
it isn't subject to argument or examination.  
<br>
<p>I think one of the reasons this is difficult is that humans do not
<br>
appear to have a goal system which is structured in this way, so we
<br>
can examine and object to *any* goal we have, and are thus much less
<br>
reliable than any entity with such a goal system.
