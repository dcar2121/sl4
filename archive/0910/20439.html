</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a. A real time clock.

<p><p>You are wrong, and you could have checked your facts even by using Wikipedia
<br>
for about 30 seconds, rather than continuing to spew your junk claims out

all over the mailing list.

<p><p><em>&gt; ; and it can tell the time because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's connected to the outside world&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am quite certain the real time clock in my Mac would continue to work even
<br>
if it were isolated from the universe by cold vacuum and zero incoming
<br>
radiation, assuming the battery were sufficiently charged. If you disagree,
<br>
please state reasons and evidence.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But no matter, try beating a Jupiter Brain armed with nothing but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random number and the time of day. Good luck. You'll need it.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't know what your idea of a Jupiter Brain is, since you continually
<br>
refuse (or are unable) to define the vocabulary and ideas you are using.
<br>
<p>I shall assume that it is an algorithm running on an asynchronous large
<br>
finite state machine (implementing a crude almost-turing machine, as most
<br>
computers do), without a real time clock or true random number generator.
<br>
<p>I therefore challenge your &quot;Jupiter Brain&quot; to a game of
<br>
stone-paper-scissors, armed with my random number generator. There is a
<br>
possibility that I may be able to model its mental state, and thus beat it
<br>
consistently over the long term. If it appears capable of modelling my own
<br>
mental state better than I am of modelling its, I will switch to using my
<br>
random number generator to force a draw over the long term. If I have any
<br>
doubts about my ability to model its mental state, I will use the random
<br>
number generator from the beginning. In the worst case I can force a draw;
<br>
in the best case, I can win consistently. Looks good to me.
<br>
<p>Oh, and if I am feeling a bit cheaty, I will play it once, hit reset, and
<br>
then beat it consistently by consistently replaying the first game over and
<br>
over via the reset button, knowing what it will output.
<br>
<p>Next I will challenge it to a game I played as a child. Remaining silent,
<br>
without looking at a watch, count to 60 seconds in your head, and call out
<br>
when the minute is up. The individual whose guess is closest to the real
<br>
time measured on a clock, wins.
<br>
<p>Yawn
