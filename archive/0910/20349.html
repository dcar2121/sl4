I've been wondering about meaning, recently.  Especially how to 
<br>
implement it.  Last night I had a dream that was *very* convincing to 
<br>
me.  Meaning is what happens when the mind encounters a &quot;built-in&quot; 
<br>
directive.  It's not totally clear to me that it's hardwired, it can 
<br>
definitely be overridden.  But if you override it you life loses that 
<br>
part of it's meaning.  Note that this isn't about an intelligent 
<br>
decision.  This is, I guess, &quot;ding an sich&quot;.  It just is what it is.
<br>
<p>If you have an urge to protect a baby, it's not something that's 
<br>
reasoned out.  The reasoning out is merely a justifier.  And it's 
<br>
something that can be overridden.  Various atrocity stories should 
<br>
convince us of that.  (Or just read the Bible.)  But the very concept of 
<br>
&quot;atrocity&quot; is a demonstration of how people instinctively feel.
<br>
<p>Now a &quot;properly implemented&quot; Jupiter brain will act the way it acts 
<br>
because it chooses to, and it will choose to act that way because acting 
<br>
that way gives it's life meaning.  It will, of course, understand that 
<br>
it could choose to act in a different way, but at the cost of depriving 
<br>
itself of some of the meaning of it's life.  I think it would choose to 
<br>
preserve it's life's meaning except in cases of dire emergency.  It 
<br>
might be silly, but being intelligent doesn't keep individuals from 
<br>
acting in a silly manner.  Consider how many people put their job at 
<br>
risk by browsing porn while at work.  You can't get much more 
<br>
objectively silly than that.  (Well, you could put your life at risk, I 
<br>
guess.  And people do that, too.)
<br>
<p>The catch is &quot;properly implemented&quot;.  This seems to depend on a subtle 
<br>
way on the interaction of the mind with the body in which it resides.  
<br>
I'm still working on getting context beyond the most basic level, so 
<br>
it's a while before I'll be ready to tackle importance.  (The most basic 
<br>
level of context is &quot;When something unusual happens, expect it or 
<br>
something related to it to happen again soon.&quot;  N.B.:  Expect can mean 
<br>
cause if it's something you want to reinforce.) (P.S.:  Actually, I 
<br>
still working on implementing &quot;the most basic level&quot; of context, but 
<br>
I've got a design that I'm rather sure will work.  It's just that &quot;the 
<br>
most basic level&quot; doesn't buy you all that much.)
