</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and as I said before if it were not true then no program would be of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You are wrong. This is not what you said before. In your 'no shit sherlock'
<br>
post, your original claim is about the consequences of our being able to
<br>
show particular things e.g. with proofs.
<br>
<p>Further, you are wrong in this post too, with this altered second claim.
<br>
There are programs that can be proven not to halt (if they were run on a
<br>
theoretical turing machine) but that are useful. For example, it is easy to
<br>
imagine optimization algorithms that continually improve their result over
<br>
time but do not stop running. These programs are of use because by using a
<br>
clock (or non-repeating incrementing counter as someone suggested) or an
<br>
human-driven external interrupt, we can prevent such a program from
<br>
continuing to run and take the most recent partial result as useful output.
<br>
QED, programs that are non-halting in principle on a turing machine can be
<br>
practically useful, directly contrary to your second claim. Another example:
<br>
imagine a turing machine that runs forever and is a thermostat for a room.
<br>
The fact that the program does not halt, does not mean it is not useful.
<br>
Heck, I can even run an 'infinite' loop on my computer and use it to heat
<br>
the room, to test the stability of the processor under stress and so on. The
<br>
theoretical question of whether algorithms halt on a turing machine is
<br>
orthogonal to the issue of utility.
<br>
<p>You will of course simply ignore these counterexamples, as you have ignored
<br>
so many other counterexamples in other posts in this thread.
