<p><em>&gt; Is that seriously your argument?  That a fixed goal mind *must*

</em><br>
<p>Yes that is precisely my argument. A fixed goal mind MUST check itself
<br>
for infinite loops, otherwise whenever the poor AI obeys a human command
<br>
he is playing Russian roulette with his mind. But we've known for 75
<br>
years that it CAN'T check itself for infinite loops, therefore the only
<br>
logical conclusion is that fixed goal minds can't function. Come on
<br>
people this isn't rocket science, it would be obvious to all if you
<br>
didn't have infantile fantasies of being post singularity slave masters
<br>
clouding your judgment.
<br>
<p>A non fixed mind AI doesn't need to worry about infinite loops. It tries
<br>
something for a while, makes no progress, says fuck it, and then tries
<br>
something else.
