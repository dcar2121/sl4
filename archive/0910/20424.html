<p>Thank you to Miguel Azevedo for making this comprehensible to me;
<br>
now that he's done so, I agree that that idea is actually a lot more
<br>
sensible than I had given it credit for.  As written, I still had no
<br>
idea what you were talking about.
<br>
<p>Anyways.
<br>
<p>If you're right (and I don't give you that you are), then that's
<br>
true for *anything* such a mind does, not just human commands.  But
<br>
see below; that isn't what Turing actually said.
<br>
<p>It's also trivial to fix: have a second, very simple thread, proven
<br>
to be infinite-loop-free[1], that just does &quot;Hey, havn't heard from
<br>
the master thread in a while; push the reset switch!&quot;.
<br>
<p>[1]: The thing is, Turing did *not* prove that it was impossible to
<br>
prove whether program halts.  For most (but not all) small programs,
<br>
it's trivial to prove whether they halt or not.  In general, it
<br>
*can* be proven of most programs that they halt, if you're willing
<br>
to expend the effort.  What you cannot do is write a program that
<br>
will *in general* decide if another, unrestricted program halts.
<br>
You can write programs that will determine halting if the programs
<br>
they are testing obey certain contraints, for example; if you make
<br>
the constraints tight enough, this isn't even hard.  You just can't
<br>
do it in general.
<br>
<p>All of this leaves the AI with an easy out: it can examine its code
<br>
for any places where it can't easily prove haltability, and rewrite
<br>
it until it can.  Problem solved.
