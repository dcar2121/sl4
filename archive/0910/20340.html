<p>
Michael Wilson (aka &quot;Starglider&quot;) has recently written a &quot;Mini-FAQ on
<br>
Artificial Intelligence&quot; on a science/philosophy subforum of a certain
<br>
somewhat random forum where he sometimes ends up discussing things:
<br>
<p><a href="http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=136633">http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=136633</a><br>
<p><p>I mention this mostly because the mini-FAQ is written in a style that
<br>
I found to be somewhat unusually honest in a refreshingly funny way,
<br>
example below (also, there are very few things in the document that
<br>
I'd disagree with):
<br>
<p><p>***** start of quote *****
<br>
9. Can you tell me what it is like in the field? Having spend most of
<br>
my time doing school work I'm not sure about the current developments
<br>
and what doing work in the field involves and how I could fit in.
<br>
<p><p>If you mean the history, culture, personalities etc of the field,
<br>
numerous books have been written on the subject* and they are still
<br>
restricted to a brief overview of each subfield. As a graduate, your
<br>
choice is between staying in academia, commercial narrow AI work (the
<br>
biggest areas are robotics, games and search/data mining - though not
<br>
that even in games very few people do purely AI), or joining a wildly
<br>
ambitious general AI start-up (e.g. Adaptive AI Inc).
<br>
<p>* 'Mind Design II', compiled by John Haugeland, is a great example,
<br>
because it's basically a big collection of papers from many different
<br>
subfields where researchers trash rival approaches and claim only
<br>
their own can work, as politely as possible. Probably inaccessible to
<br>
laypeople, but it's really funny if you're in the field.
<br>
<p>Unsurprisingly most commercial work is kind of dull - you normally
<br>
pick the off-the-shelf algorithm that has the lowest technical risk
<br>
and development time, slot it in, and spend most of your time doing
<br>
requirements capture, functional testing, interfaces and other non-AI
<br>
stuff anyway. Finance has some interesting decision support problems
<br>
and in the US particularly there have always been be a fair number of
<br>
military and intelligence projects trying to push the narrow AI
<br>
envelope (you'll need a security clearance for that).
<br>
<p>Academia usually means slaving away for low pay implementing the
<br>
research director's ideas, when you're not grading essays or drafting
<br>
papers (for your superiors to stamp their names on and take credit).
<br>
Eventually you'll get tenure (if you're lucky) and be able to do
<br>
pretty much what you like, as long as it results in lots of papers
<br>
published and looks good at university open days. Startups focused on
<br>
general AI are usually exciting, stimulating stuff, but the jobs are
<br>
nearly impossible to get, probably involve moving across the country
<br>
or to another country, and last for an average of oh 24 months or so
<br>
before the company runs out of funding and implodes.
<br>
***** end of quote *****
