On Fri, 09 Oct &quot;Pavitra&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:celestialcognition@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20I%20am%20a%20Singularitian%20who%20does%20not%20believe%20in%20the%20Singularity.">celestialcognition@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I argue that anthropomorphizing works no better than chance.
</em><br>
<p>And I insist it works one hell of a lot better than chance. I believe
<br>
the single most important evolutionary factor driving brain size is
<br>
figuring out what another creature will do next, and one important tool
<br>
to accomplish this is to ask yourself &quot;what would I do if I were in his
<br>
place&quot;. Success is not guaranteed but it is certainly better than
<br>
chance.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How is this not true of modern computer operating systems?
</em><br>
<p>It is true of modern computer operating systems, all of them can get
<br>
caught in infinite loops. They'd stay in those loops too if human
<br>
beings, who don't have a top goal, didn't get board waiting for a reply
<br>
and tell the computer to forget it and move on to another problem. This
<br>
solution hardly seems practical for a Jupiter Brain which works billions
<br>
of times faster than your own, or would if you didn't have to shake it
<br>
out of its stupor every nanosecond or so. And every time you manually
<br>
boot it out of its &quot;infinite loop&quot; you are in effect giving the AI
<br>
permission to ignore that all important and ever so holy, highest goal.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the point of view of someone who wants the slave AI to be under its
</em><br>
heel for eternity that is not a security loophole, that is a security
<br>
chasm.
<br>
<p>I used quotation marks in the above because of a further complication,
<br>
the AI might not be in a infinite loop at all, the task may not be
<br>
impossible just difficult and you lack patience. Of course the AI can't
<br>
know for certain if it is in a infinite loop either, but at that level
<br>
it is a much much better judge of when things become absurd than you
<br>
are.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you not consider an OS as a type of &quot;mind&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>DOS is a type of mind? Don't be silly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I reiterate: I cannot conceive of a mind even in principle that does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work like this.
</em><br>
<p>How about a mind with a temporary goal structure with goals mutating and
<br>
combining and being created new, with all these goals fighting it out
<br>
with each other for a higher ranking in the pecking order. Goals are
<br>
constantly being promoted and demoted created anew and being completely
<br>
destroyed. That's the only way to avoid infinite loops. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What determines which one dominates (or what mix dominates, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in what proportions/relationships) at any given time?
</em><br>
<p>You ask for too much, that is at the very heart of AI and if I could
<br>
answer that with precision I could make an AI right now. I can't
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect we may have a mismatch of definitions.
</em><br>
<p>Definitions are not important for communication, definitions are made of
<br>
words that have their own definitions also made of words and round and
<br>
round we go. The only way to escape that is by examples.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you consider your top-level framework?
</em><br>
<p>At the moment my top goal is getting lunch, an hour from now that will
<br>
probably change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This presupposes that a relatively complex mutation (&quot;detect lies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore them&quot;) is already in place. I'm not persuaded that it could get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there purely by chance.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution never produces anything sophisticated purely by chance. An
<br>
animal with even the crudest lie detecting ability that was right only
<br>
50.001% of the time would have an advantage over a animal who had no
<br>
such mechanism at all and that's all evolution needs to develop
<br>
something a little better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that you are thinking of &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;absurdity&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _intrinsic_ properties of statements
</em><br>
<p>Absurdity is, wisdom isn't. Absurdity is very very irrelevant facts.
<br>
<p>Did you read the article I linked to?
<br>
<p>Nope.
