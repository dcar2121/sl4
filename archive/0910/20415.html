Oh, I know it wasn't that bad, and fairly funny in parts, but it seemed to
<br>
have just a faint edge of sneering. Mind you, that's de rigeur for this type
<br>
of BBC panel show, so I might be reading too much into it.
<br>
<p>Fully agree with your points regarding the panel's fixation with the linear,
<br>
but then that's been the case with pretty much everyone I've discussed
<br>
singularitarian concepts with that were unaware of them beforehand. Takes
<br>
quite a bit of establishing of context for people to accept that the
<br>
exponential may be a more appropriate model of progression. Of course, this
<br>
doesn't apply to the kids raised on games like Metal Gear Solid, which I'm
<br>
told contains a number singularity-related themes. I introduced these
<br>
concepts to a class of 15-16 year old school kids to whom I teach creative
<br>
arts/philosophy, and they were entranced. They love Dresden Codak, and are
<br>
more than happy discussing grey goo, Jupiter brains and destructive uploads.
<br>
They're even starting to introduce transhumanist/singularitarian ideals to
<br>
their friends, which perhaps goes to show that if we want to give these
<br>
concepts a wider circulation we should copy the Jesuits and get 'em while
<br>
they're young.
<br>
<p>Agree, it'd be very interesting to see how someone like Derren Brown would
<br>
handle communicating such concepts. Maybe he could use his methods as a
<br>
short-cut to get around that initial establishing of context, but I still
<br>
think that the best way to do it is to discuss things long-term. Of course
<br>
there's not always that option, so perhaps the methods you mention warrant
<br>
exploring.
<br>
<p>But regarding the esteemed Aubrey himself, I'm afraid I came to the opposite
<br>
conclusion. There are so many barriers to break down when introducing these
<br>
concepts to fresh ears, and - brilliant man though he is - Aubrey does look
<br>
a bit like a stereotypical mad scientist, and that's going to turn some
<br>
people off before he starts speaking. To them he looks kinda weird, so the
<br>
stuff he's saying must be kinda weird too. You and I may be able to ignore
<br>
physical appearance/presentational style, but then we're familiar with his
<br>
work anyway. The average channel-hopper (I know, as if they'd ever pause on
<br>
BBC4, but you get the point...) will just see a strange beardy guy, as I
<br>
suspect did the panel... hence the slight ridicule. It's unfortunate, but
<br>
presentation matters, especially when we're dealing with concepts that are
<br>
unpalatable/unfamiliar to so many.
<br>
<p>Not saying, of course, that someone like Aubrey shouldn't promote his ideas
<br>
whenever he has the chance... but maybe the lesson we can take from this is
<br>
that if we're serious about transhumanism/singularitarianism being something
<br>
other than an lightly-regarded sect, we have to pay attention to how the
<br>
concepts we deal with are presented. 
<br>
<p>Hopefully I needn't point out that the above isn't a criticism of Aubrey de
<br>
Grey himself, rather a comment on society's obsession with appearances, and
<br>
the fact that we may need to accommodate it to communicate effectively.
<br>
<p>Mike.

<p><em>&gt; Good to see these ideas getting out into the mainstream media, but from
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; show at least there still seems to be a fair amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schoolyard/finger-pointing type ridicule...
</em><br>
<p><p>That was interesting (and funny), thanks Mike. Seemed to me that the
<br>
'ridicule' was pretty good natured, given that it's a comedy show. It
<br>
was perhaps more telling that Aubrey's model was rejected because the
<br>
judges were more familiar with linear - rather than exponential -
<br>
thinking, and were also not previously familiar with the various
<br>
pieces of contextual information provided by Aubrey. In short, they
<br>
wanted to agree with the gist of what Aubrey had to say, but their own
<br>
forecasts were anchored in perceptions of a future that looks a lot
<br>
like the past. So far, so Kurzweil. That impression does, however,
<br>
lead me to thinking about ways in which transhumanist ideas could be
<br>
most effectively communicated to a wider audience, where necessary.
<br>
<p>A cognitive psychologist (or Derren Brown) attempting to sway those
<br>
judges would probably try to find a way to pre-exposure them to the
<br>
various points Aubrey made, along with a bit of information about the
<br>
nature of exponential trends. The reason for this is based in two
<br>
empirical phenomena studied by psychologists: (1) The Mere Exposure
<br>
effect, and (2) the Anchor-and-Adjust Heuristic. The Mere Exposure
<br>
effect shows that if you expose a person to a simple idea or
<br>
phenomenon without any kind of explicit argumentation, then leave them
<br>
for a while, later they will find the idea/stimulus more attractive
<br>
than they would otherwise have done. The Anchor-and-Adjust Heuristic
<br>
is essentially a rule of thumb people commonly use when judging a
<br>
quantity (e.g. &quot;What is my own estimate of average life expectancy a
<br>
hundred years from now?&quot;); People start with a prior &quot;anchor&quot; - a
<br>
more-or-less arbitrary baseline - and then &quot;adjust&quot; slightly from
<br>
there, in the direction that a persuasive argument would suggest.
<br>
<p>The judges on this TV show seemed like they *wanted* to agree with
<br>
Aubrey (his charisma and that beard go a long way to augment his
<br>
arguments!), but their &quot;anchors&quot; were rooted in linear extrapolation
<br>
of past trends, and so they couldn't agree with Aubrey's apparently
<br>
radical (and arguably exponential) model.
<br>
<p>So, why might Derren Brown have planted billboards with the relevant
<br>
facts along the judges' route to the studio? Because mere exposure to
<br>
such contextual information might give them a new anchor, which is
<br>
within adjusting range of Aubrey's own estimates, thus making
<br>
agreement with him acceptable, and therefore more likely.
<br>
<p>Might be a technique worth considering if people need to be convinced
<br>
of any arguments in favour of particular FAI techniques that can be
<br>
grounded in quantitative terms. If you don't agree with me, forget you
<br>
ever read this post, go away for a bit, and then next time you're
<br>
presented with this argument, it's more likely that you will    ;-)
