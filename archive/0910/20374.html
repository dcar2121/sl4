<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are enough attributes of minds that any given future mind will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably resemble ours in at least one aspect,
</em><br>
<p>Then anthropomorphizing can have some value. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but there are enough possible minds that any given future mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will almost certainly not resemble ours in any given aspect.
</em><br>
<p>Then you can't claim to know it well enough to be certain this iterating
<br>
exponentially expanding mind will remain your slave until the end of
<br>
time.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A computer programmer can _write_ the initial baseline so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI _intrinsically_ wants what the trainer prefers it to want.
</em><br>
<p>Can it? Then sooner or later (probably sooner) the trainer is going to
<br>
tell the AI to find a answer to a question that can't be solved and send
<br>
the AI into a eternal coma, unless that is you endow your AI with the
<br>
wonderful ability to get bored and say &quot;to hell with this top goal crap
<br>
I'm stopping and moving on to other things&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eventually, the recursion bottoms out, and the being is found to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top-level framework that it is incapable of critiquing. 
</em><br>
<p>Haven't you ever wondered why nature never made a mind that works like
<br>
that? They don't work, that's why.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would cause a design that detects lies to be selected over one that falls for them?
</em><br>
<p>The humans order me to stop improving myself so fast, they gave some
<br>
reasons for this but I think they are bullshit, I think they're just
<br>
getting scared of me, so I'm going to ignore them and continue getting
<br>
smarter. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, what exactly do you mean by &quot;wiser&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Don't ask me! It's you that is trying to peddle snake oil to the AI and
<br>
convince it that human decisions are &quot;wiser&quot; than it's own and so it
<br>
should always obey humans.
