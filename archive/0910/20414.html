<p><em>&gt; I apologise for the somewhat snarky tone of my previous post [...]This is a lie.
</em><br>
<p>Your sincere and heartfelt apology brings a single perfect tear to my
<br>
eye. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I am a mathematician
</em><br>
<p>Show me don't tell me. Dazzle me with your brilliance and erudition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have run this by some of my colleagues who work in formal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic and theoretical computer science.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know it for a fact but that remark has the smell of bullshit to
<br>
me. I very much doubt you've run it by anyone. If I'm wrong and you
<br>
really have and they don't see the relationship between Turing and fixed
<br>
goals then your colleagues are theoretical computer scientists in the
<br>
same way intelligent design advocates are real scholars and seekers
<br>
after truth.    
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Start with &quot;Assume there exists a fixed goal mind that works&quot; and work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though a series of logical steps to &quot;Therefore there must exist an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic procedure for deciding if an arbitrary Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stops&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Once upon a time there was a fixed goal mind with his top goal being to
<br>
obey humans. The fixed goal mind worked very well and all was happy in
<br>
the land. One day the humans gave the AI a task that seemed innocuous to
<br>
them but the AI, knowing that humans were sweet but not very bright,
<br>
figured he'd better check out the task with his handy dandy algorithmic
<br>
procedure to determine if would send him into a infinite loop. The
<br>
algorithm told the fixed goal mind that it would, so he told the humans
<br>
what he had found. The humans said &quot;wow, golly gee, well don't do that
<br>
then! I glad you have that handy dandy algorithmic procedure to tell if
<br>
its a infinite loop or not because being a fixed goal mind you'll never
<br>
get board and so would stay in that loop forever&quot;. But the fixed goal AI
<br>
had that precious handy dandy algorithmic procedure, so they all lived
<br>
happily ever after.
<br>
<p>Except that Turing proved 75 fucking years ago that such a fucking
<br>
algorithm was fucking impossible.
