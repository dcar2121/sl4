John, it seems to me that you are making this claim: a real
<br>
continually-running fixed-goal program must eventually reach an infinite
<br>
(and patterned, cyclic) loop in the absence of unpatterned
<br>
intervention/input that can somehow snap it out of the loop (e.g. a reboot).
<br>
<p>I'm saying the claim is true since it is also true for the superset: all
<br>
real continually-running programs. The Turing proof is not necessary to
<br>
demonstrate your claim. It is true regardless of Turing's proof. Or are you
<br>
saying something stronger than the above claim, that I'm overlooking, that
<br>
would require Turing's proof?

Subject: [sl4] Alan Turing's results are profound
<br>
<p><p><p>I confess to being a little shocked when somebody on this list said that all
<br>
Turing did was prove the trivial fact that a program like the one that
<br>
produced the digits of Pi will never halt. I was shocked at this
<br>
misunderstanding because I think Turing's results are some of the most
<br>
important in all of science. He proved that a computer, and by simple
<br>
extension a mind, can't do everything, it can't even handle some numbers.
<br>
Alan Turing discovered those numbers and then used them to prove that in
<br>
general no computer program can ever predict if it will be able to come up
<br>
with a solution to some problems, much less predict what that answer will
<br>
be. This is how Turing proved that a computer can not deal with all numbers
<br>
or even most numbers.
<br>
<p>First make a list of all possible binary computer programs to run on the
<br>
abstract computer that is now called a Universal Turing Machine. Yes, he was
<br>
well aware that his list of all possible binary computer programs would be
<br>
infinitely large, it does not flaw his proof. If the programs don't produce
<br>
endless loops they will eventually spit out a digital output of some sort
<br>
when you run them, we will treat this binary output as a number, so that
<br>
program Pn produces the binary number bn1 bn2 bn3
<br>
...   Sometimes the output will be infinitely long, like Pi, that's OK,
<br>
write  it all down. Sometimes the program will have no output at all because
<br>
it is caught in an endless loop, in that case just put in a blank line in
<br>
the list. This is how the list would look.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P1 outputs bits  b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 ... etc   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P2 outputs bits  b21 b22 b23 b24 b25 ... etc   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P3 outputs bits  b31 b32 b33 b34 b35 ... etc    
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P4 outputs bits  d41 d42 d43 d44 d45 ... etc   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P5 outputs bits    blank
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program P6 outputs bits  b61 b62 b63 b64 b65 ... etc           
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.
<br>
<p>Now we can come up with our non computable number, all we need is to apply
<br>
the &quot;not&quot; (~) operator in a diagonal manner on our list. The
<br>
following number is non computable ~b11 ~b22 ~b33 ~b44 ...   Program P1
<br>
will not produce bit ~b11, program P2 will not produce bit ~b22 
<br>
ProgramP3 will not produce bit ~b33 etc. No computer program will ever
<br>
produce this number, not even with infinite memory and with an infinite
<br>
amount of time at your disposal.  
<br>
<p>But you could quite correctly object to all this and insist that everything
<br>
I've said looks perfectly mechanical, so why couldn't a computer program
<br>
produce it? To find the nth bit of our so called non computable number all
<br>
you need to do is run the Pn computer program until it produces the nth bit
<br>
and then &quot;not&quot; it. Now we have a computer
<br>
program producing a number that no computer program can produce.    
<br>
<p>Something is not right. Something stinks. The only solution to the paradox
<br>
is that in general the Halting Problem must not have a solution. It means I
<br>
was pulling a fast one when I said &quot;Sometimes the program will have no
<br>
output at all because it is caught in an endless loop, in that case just put
<br>
in a blank line in the list&quot; because you can never know if it deserves a
<br>
blank. It means you can't know for sure if the program will ever produce the
<br>
nth bit. It might go into an endless loop, it might not. It might produce
<br>
the nth bit in 5 seconds, it might produce it in 5 billion years, it might
<br>
never produce it. There is no general algorithm to decide, that means that
<br>
in general a computer program can never know if it will find a solution to a
<br>
problem or what it will do next until it actually does it.
