Hi John,

<p>and why would it do that? I guess You mean to say it should check that, to
<br>
prevent it from happening. Because the humans could be stupid/unlucky enough
<br>
to give it a task, for which the computation would not end. 
<br>
I think it should _not_ try to check it.
<br>
<p>First, of course, because it can't ;-)
<br>
But secondly, because it would not be sensible even if it were possible.
<br>
It would not be helpful, because for the humans it is not important,
<br>
wether a calculation would, theoretically, ever end. It has to complete
<br>
in a reasonable timeframe too. If the AI would find out, that it can
<br>
finish the task in a million years, then it might decide that it can do
<br>
it, but the people asking the question might already be dead, and would
<br>
rather it had not wasted all that time.
<br>
It is also not necessary to check that. It would be enough if it hat
<br>
multiple processes, each of which would monitor all the others. Some
<br>
infinite-loop-conditions could be detected directly, when they occur,
<br>
but more importantly the different processes could interrupt each other
<br>
after a reasonable time T has passed without a result. The length of
<br>
T could be determined by the interests of the humans (calculating the
<br>
lottery-numbers is only usefull until the drawing) and by some fast
<br>
heuristics with which to estimate the probable complexity of the problem.
<br>
<p>In short: I think that the danger of infinite loops (and thereby the
<br>
necessity to be able to know about them beforehand) is only present with
<br>
single-tasking machines.
<br>
<p>All the best,
<br>
rob
