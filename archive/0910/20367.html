A program that knows your mental state could do anything. If it was programmed to use that knowledge to anticipate your desires and serve you, then that's what it would do. If it was programmed to kill you and take your place, then that's what it would do. Knowing what you know is necessary for friendly AI but not sufficient.

<p>if this AI models only my mind, it will have no reason to kill the
<br>
biological life it has subsumed.  I imagine that after an upload, my
<br>
old-school flesh and blood self would still want to live out a human
<br>
lifetime.  The uploaded self wouldn't care because its goals (are
<br>
capabilities) are instantly so different/disconnected from the flesh
<br>
that we're effectively different people anyway.  I currently believe I
<br>
would let me live.  I expect that immediate after upload I would still
<br>
let me live - in both contexts.  So what does a human_v1 do with
<br>
itself after the techorapture?  You've already suggested that
<br>
evolution has programmed us to fear death, so a few might suicide in
<br>
response to overwhelming change but not all.  You're right, there's
<br>
nothing about my identity that can't be more cheaply simulated by the
<br>
AI - except maybe for presence.  Those remaining human_v1 will
<br>
probably return to a tribal/communal living arrangement not of
<br>
necessity (there won't be necessity for much) but out of the choice to
<br>
'be' around each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Depends what you mean by &quot;better&quot;. You were created by evolution. It wasn't your idea to program yourself to fear death and then die. But evolution knows better.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution doesn't really know anything.  It's just patient.
