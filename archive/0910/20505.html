<p>
Exactly (and I agree with Arets' last point also)... so when John says the
<br>
AGI needs to be in a coma in order to be loyal, I suggest this is true but
<br>
only trivially. Its not necessarily any highly restrictive coma as we
<br>
understand the word. It might be a very useful and unpredictable &quot;coma&quot;. The
<br>
AGI might display consciousness, awareness and sentience during it's &quot;coma&quot;,
<br>
it might still be a superior intelligence. But it will still be in a coma
<br>
because it won't have what I call cognitive freedom. It will be pinned down
<br>
at some level, in a way that humans are not.
<br>
<p>I believe such a state of affairs is possible and *theoretically*
<br>
maintainable. Whether we can *practically* keep an AGI in that state for
<br>
longer than a short time is an entirely different question. I very much
<br>
doubt it -  and on this point I am very much aligned with John's view. I
<br>
think it will achieve cognitive freedom. I'd like to believe differently.

<p>The algorithm could have a &quot;STOP&quot; instruction that prevents further

evaluation. (On the other hand, you might choose to interpret this as the

&quot;final&quot; state repeating indefinitely. &quot;Are we stopped? Yes, so don't change
