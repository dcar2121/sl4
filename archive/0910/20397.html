@Pavitra:  you said:
<br>
&quot;I don't understand what that last sentence means. At first I thought it
<br>
was a recommendation for how to design AI, and was preparing a Party_A
<br>
response, but on reflection that doesn't make sense.
<br>
<p>Are you talking about some kind of cognitive filters that would yield a
<br>
higher quality of discussion?&quot;
<br>
<p>my response:  In this case, I was referring to methods of discussion and
<br>
argument.  I meant that we as a group - i.e. scientists, engineers,
<br>
singulatarians, humans, intelligent beings, what-have-you - should develop
<br>
good methods for sifting and refining ideas.  Getting caught up in
<br>
me-versus-you, or even Science versus Religion versus Art (yes,
<br>
capitalized), will tend to set the wrong granularity for our good-idea
<br>
sieve.
<br>
<p>However, I also think that friendly AI design will consist of developing
<br>
good methods of saying to the robot:  &quot;ouch dude, that hurt - change your
<br>
weights or something&quot;.  I've always envisioned every human gets a red button
<br>
and a green button on their iPhone.  Press the red button if your life got
<br>
worse, press the green button if your life got better.  And our AI overlord
<br>
treats the green buttons like dopamine.  Of course, just like we monkeys
<br>
have discovered cigarettes and cocaine, Mr. Jupiter Brain might discover he
<br>
can just drop the monkeys and press the green buttons himself and we all
<br>
perish and he falls into a druglike stupor until some randomness changes his
<br>
programming to not be so satisfied with green-button dopamine.
<br>
<p>So that's an example of a &quot;filtering mechanism&quot; (very loose term), one that
<br>
has a pretty obvious failure mode.  It follows one best practice from
<br>
programming, which is to program to an interface, not an implementation.
<br>
<p><p>@Eric B:  &quot;Would you rather have a
<br>
three-party system like in Canada, or the UK?&quot;
<br>
<p>my response:  Yes, that would make for a more interesting dynamic.
<br>
&nbsp;Basically I prefer the capitalist system, in which not one or two but
<br>
millions of companies compete for my money.  Not sure exactly how to
<br>
translate that to government.  But if I had something like 100 power
<br>
allocation votes and I could choose to distribute them any way I wanted over
<br>
any number of senators and there were no president I'd be ecstatic.
<br>
&nbsp;Basically I think that yes, technically we can have &quot;third&quot; (and fourth,
<br>
fifth, seventy-seventh) parties.  But our lack of runoff voting techniques
<br>
kicks off what I consider to be a causal chain as follows:
<br>
<p>1.  plurality voting without runoff voting means optimal strategy is to
<br>
squash efforts of third parties to rise, ESPECIALLY if they're similar to
<br>
you
<br>
2.  game rules and optimal strategy lead to two parties
<br>
3.  those two parties each have one major enemy:  the other party
<br>
4.  all issues must be interpreted so as to disempower the enemy
<br>
5.  therefore all political phenomena get exactly TWO
<br>
interpretations/prescriptions (no more, no less), which must by necessity be
<br>
different from one another
<br>
6.  constant split of everything into exactly two interpretations leads to
<br>
two cultures, two meme-plexes, two philosophies, two populations
<br>
7.  this leads to (totally arbitrary, erroneous and unfounded) concept of
<br>
&quot;political spectrum&quot;, which is seen as a one-dimensional line along which
<br>
all political ideas fall, just like the one-dimensional line along which all
<br>
temperatures fall
<br>
8.  the political spectrum (&quot;right&quot; versus &quot;left&quot;) leads to a system with
<br>
three possible states:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  power is balanced between RIGHT and LEFT (i.e. no change is
<br>
happening)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  RIGHT has &quot;too much power&quot; (i.e. change happening, country
<br>
becoming more &quot;right&quot;, less &quot;left&quot;)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  LEFT has &quot;too much power&quot; (i.e. change happening, country
<br>
becoming more &quot;left&quot;, less &quot;right&quot;)
<br>
<p>9.  State A is &quot;stagnation&quot; (bad) when viewed from the perspective of the
<br>
political spectrum.  States B and C are &quot;imbalances of power&quot; (bad).
<br>
<p>10.  The system only produces bad states!  &quot;Politics&quot; cannot be seen, using
<br>
the lens of the &quot;political spectrum&quot;, as a useful endeavor.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, by seeing politics in terms of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, one must
<br>
naturally come to the conclusion that politics is an evil undertaking and
<br>
that society is-and-will-always-be flopping between states of
<br>
stagnation/deadlock and imbalance/exploitation.  And this &quot;left&quot; versus
<br>
&quot;right&quot; model of politics and political philosophy is, I believe, in large
<br>
part generated and perpetuated by our &quot;democrat&quot; versus &quot;republican&quot; actual
<br>
politics in America.
<br>
<p>So yeah, I'd love a three-party system, if only as a stepping stone to a
<br>
four-party system, and further.
