<p>Go read a book on formal computation.  *PLEASE*?  This is, in fact,
<br>
a very important part of the Turing machine formalism.
<br>
<p>A Turing machine, on each run, takes a single input, at the
<br>
beginning, and that's all.  This is part of where the halting
<br>
problem comes from.  This is what is meant by &quot;fixed set of inputs&quot;.
<br>
There's no such thing as &quot;interaction&quot; with a Turing machine; you
<br>
give it a program, and an input, and you run it; you never interact
<br>
with it again until it halts.  That's the whole point of the Turing
<br>
machine formalism.
<br>
<p>Humans, and computers in the real world, routinely receive new and
<br>
interesting inputs from the outside world, whether they want to or
<br>
not.  This rather handily makes the halting problem essentially
<br>
irrelevant: given new input to respond to, an infinite loop can be
<br>
avoided, unless it's so bad that it leads to ignoring all input
<br>
entirely, in which case someone was a pretty crappy programmer, and
<br>
that's why we have reset switches (which, again, are input from the
<br>
outside, nicely circumventing the halting problem).  For humans, we
<br>
have things like adrenalin and antipsychotics and shock therapy,
<br>
although to be fair those don't always work.  But then, the reset
<br>
button doesn't always work.
<br>
<p>Anyways, it's only a real problem if every thinking being on earth
<br>
halts at the same time.  I'll lay my odds against that one, thanks.
