<br>
<em>&gt;Training an AI by watching people will only define &quot;human&quot; as far as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cultural beliefs of the people it observes.
</em><br>
<p>That might be true for some AI, but it's not a criticism of the algorithm
<br>
I'm pointing to.  Training that AI more than &quot;watching people&quot;.  It's given
<br>
video that's annotated to say who is present and what they are doing and
<br>
what they are perceiving, so it's the beliefs of the people annotating the
<br>
video that matter, not the cultural beliefs of the people appearing in the
<br>
video.  (The prior probability distribution also matters, of course, but
<br>
that's fixed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It will fail utterly in the case of future human-software hybrids that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't yet exist.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it will say *something*.  Whether that's failing utterly depends on
<br>
what you want and what it does, and I don't know either of those. This is
<br>
all complicated by the fact that some of these future human-software hybrids
<br>
will surely be insane by our standards, so perhaps we don't want the AI
<br>
caring much what they want.  
<br>
<p>A human-software hybrid is likely to be as powerful as an AI and not
<br>
Friendly-by-construction.  Humans are sufficiently mentally broken that I
<br>
wouldn't expect it to be Friendly-by-good-luck either.  If the Friendly AI
<br>
problem is worth solving, then maybe we don't want any human-software
<br>
hybrids until we have an FAI that seems competent and claims it's safe to
<br>
do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Humans can recognize faces in videos without much effort. That doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it easy. In fact the training data that allows you to do this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consists of, among other things, several years worth of high resolution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;video.
</em><br>
<p>I agree about the time period that people actually observe.  I wouldn't call
<br>
human vision high-resolution, but that's minor. Although people get that
<br>
much video, I don't agree that they need it to do facial recognition.  There
<br>
are programs that do facial recognition and they must not get that much
<br>
training data.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Landauer measured the complexity of human long term episodic memory to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be on the order of 10^9 bits.
</em><br>
<p>I don't dispute that estimate.  I do dispute the claim that it's relevant.
<br>
The only way it can be relevant is if understanding who is present and what
<br>
they are doing and what they are perceiving is a significant portion of what
<br>
humans do with all that long term memory. For example, the learning that has
<br>
to happen from the training data includes nothing about planning or
<br>
motivation or domain knowledge outside of this specific vision problem.  It
<br>
includes nothing I learned in school and nothing I learned after age 8 or
<br>
so.
<br>
<p>Why do you make up stories about why the problem is so hard?  Do you perhaps
<br>
want people to give up?  Do you think you gain status by spouting marginally
<br>
relevant large numbers?  Something else?
