<p>Why should it? A data compressor assigns a nonzero probability to all possible input strings such that they add to 1.

<em>&gt; It my understanding is correct, it dooms any hope that a computable mind could experience unbounded happiness, where &quot;happiness&quot; is defined as an increase in utility. I argued previously that in any finite state machine whose behavior can be modeled in terms of a utility function, that there is a state of maximum utility in which any thought or perception would be unpleasant because it would result in a different state. It should be obvious that this degenerate state of Utopian bliss that all goal seeking agents aspire to (whether they know it or not) is indistinguishable from death.

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; A way out would be to continually add memory to your mind so that the number of states is unbounded. De Blanc's paper quashes that approach. Utility must be bounded or else you cannot make choices based on expected utility. De Blanc discusses some ways out in section 6, but these all involve alternative utility functions, all of which are bounded.

<p>&quot;Thus we assume that the agent assigns a nonzero probability to any
<br>
computable environment function.&quot;
<br>
<p>I noted this line with interest, given my recent* argument that
<br>
assigning nonzero probabilities to each member of an infinite set
<br>
leads to nonsensical conclusions. Aren't there an infinite (or at
<br>
least unbounded) number of computable environmental functions, given a
<br>
UTM?
<br>
Given a minimum probability for any environment, that seems to lead
<br>
straight to Pascal's Mugging - the program to turn
<br>
1/minimum-probability into minimum-probability+1 is very short...
<br>
<p>One of the possible ways seems promising: &quot;We could use a smaller
<br>
hypothesis space; perhaps not all computable environments should be
<br>
considered.&quot; It'd be interesting to know whether AIXI could be mugged;
<br>
if it can't, perhaps the issue is expecting a computable AI to do
<br>
something that requires uncomputability.
