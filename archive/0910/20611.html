<p>
Dr. Mahoney makes a solid argument that &quot;friendly&quot; is not defineable
<br>
via the vague terms &quot;human&quot; or &quot;happiness&quot;. However, there might be a
<br>
distinction to be made between &quot;defineable&quot; and &quot;indexible&quot;.
<br>
<p>For example, suppose that someone has the ability to perform a
<br>
particular computation. (In fact, the computation is squaring.)
<br>
However, they do not have the ability to name or define what they are
<br>
doing. They write down a large set of input-output pairs and say
<br>
&quot;Here, I believe there is a concise, formal definition of this
<br>
computation that I am doing. Please tell me what it is.&quot;
<br>
<p>They have not defined the operation of squaring. However, with enough
<br>
datapoints, and the criterion that the solution should be concise and
<br>
formal, the definition of squaring becomes extremely salient. The
<br>
interesting thing is that with enough datapoints, even if the human
<br>
sometimes makes mistakes in computation, the squaring definition still
<br>
becomes salient. Presumably, shown the definition and its qualities,
<br>
the human would agree that yes, those datapoints were mistakes.
<br>
<p>My understanding is that Friendliness is supposed to be analogous, and
<br>
that we believe that there is a way to resolve the vague notions of
<br>
&quot;human&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; into alternative precise notions that we would
<br>
agree capture the original intent. (E.g. we don't actually care about
<br>
&quot;human&quot; but rather &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;, which some but not all computer
<br>
programs or aliens have.) One of the problems is that we anticipate
<br>
that those alternative precise notions will be quite large, possibly
<br>
larger than any human presently alive could know.

<p>Note: I'm alluding to the field of &quot;Inductive Logic Programming&quot; here.
