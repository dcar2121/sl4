<em>&gt; John: the problem you're talking about simply doesn't exist in real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers. 
</em><br>
<p>Like hell it doesn't! Why do you think programs unexpectedly hang?
<br>
Obviously if a computer has a finite memory it would be possible in
<br>
theory to keep a record of every state the machine goes into, and if you
<br>
found that a state was repeated then you'd know for sure that the
<br>
machine was in a infinite loop. But the trouble is that the machine
<br>
needed to do all that checking would have to be much larger than the
<br>
original machine, and that larger machine would have no way to know if
<br>
it was itself in a infinite loop unless it was watched over by an even
<br>
larger machine.
<br>
<p>Before Turing nearly everybody assumed that a finite algorithm would be
<br>
found that cuts through all that recursive stuff and just tells you if a
<br>
program will send you into an infinite loop or not. What Turing found is
<br>
that such an algorithm does not exist, and the implications of his
<br>
discovery are vast.
