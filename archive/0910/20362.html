Richard pointed out (correctly in my view) that from Smith &amp; Medin, concepts
<br>
do not have crisply defined sets of features and relationships. I wonder how
<br>
a top-level goal is different from a concept. In other words, I see the same
<br>
difficulty in finding a crisp definition there as with any other concept.

</em><br>
<p>While I agree that an AGI will undoubtedly be lied to about something, I
<br>
don't think those in the Friendliness camp are suggesting that it be lied
<br>
to, or told that human decisions are wiser than its own. 
<br>
<p>Rather, they're suggesting that there can and should be a highest-level
<br>
goal, and that goal should be chosen by AI designers to maximize human
<br>
safety and/or happiness.  It's unclear whether this is possible, but if it
<br>
is possible, and if the AI's goal system is structured this way, 
<br>
then *someone* will have to choose a highest-level goal, and since the AI
<br>
won't want to change it (by definition, since it's the highest 
<br>
possible goal), it'll be stable except via accident or outside changes.
<br>
<p>Now, it's entirely arguable whether such a goal system is possible to build
<br>
(as a stable system, etc), but it doesn't make any sense to 
<br>
accept the Friendliness camp's assumption that it is possible and 
<br>
then argue that the AI will magically discard the goal because it's so much
<br>
more intelligent.  A highest level goal guides intelligence; it isn't
<br>
subject to argument or examination.  
<br>
<p>I think one of the reasons this is difficult is that humans do not appear to
<br>
have a goal system which is structured in this way, so we can examine and
<br>
object to *any* goal we have, and are thus much less reliable than any
<br>
entity with such a goal system.
