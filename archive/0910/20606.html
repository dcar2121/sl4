<em>&gt;The vast majority of people in the world (China, India, South
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America, Africa) are still more-or-less medieval peasant farmers;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maybe not literally, but the mentality is going to be about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same.  The world they would envision without more knowledge and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time to think about it and so on is going to look very much like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stereotypical Christian heaven: you get to lie around and eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grapes, and you never do anything because your every need is take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;care of.  
</em><br>
<p>Hee hee.  No coincidence there.  That stereotypical Christian heaven
<br>
was made up by medieval pesant farmers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No thank you!!  That's hell to me, and after a week or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;month it would be hell to them too, but it's what they want right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you up to this point, but you didn't get to the end of
<br>
the scenario.  I don't think it goes where you expect:
<br>
<p>After a week or a month they want something else, then the AI figures
<br>
out what they want and gives them something else, and the problem
<br>
you're envisioning has solved itself.  
<br>
<p>Here's an example that bothers me: Nobody has lived 1000 years.  Maybe
<br>
the human mind has bugs in that untested scenario.  One possible bug
<br>
is that all 1000 year olds are suicidal.  I'm concerned that the
<br>
Extrapolation step would figure out what people would want if they
<br>
&quot;had grown up farther together&quot;, where &quot;farther&quot; means 1000 years, and
<br>
then correctly infer that everyone would want to die in that
<br>
situation.  The AI gives them what they would want if they had grown
<br>
up farther together by killing them all now.  I'd prefer that it let
<br>
the situation evolve naturally -- that way maybe people would kill
<br>
themselves at age 900 but they'd still get a decent life for a while.
<br>
<p>Here's another example that bothers me: Mpebna in Somalia is starving.
<br>
If Mpebna weren't starving, and had grown up in a more gentle
<br>
environment, he would like, among other things, to have a virtual
<br>
reality system that allowed him to communicate visually with his
<br>
friends without the trouble of travelling to visit them.  The FAI
<br>
comes into power, and poof! Mpebna is presented with a fancy VR
<br>
system.  Mpebna doesn't know WTF it is, Mpebna is still starving, and
<br>
now Mpebna hates the people who deployed the FAI, since they could
<br>
have fed him and they chose not to.  How exactly did the people who
<br>
deployed the FAI benefit from getting into conflict with Mpebna here?
<br>
The alternative was to give him food and wait patiently for him to
<br>
want something else.
