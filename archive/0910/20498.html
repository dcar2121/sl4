<p>
John,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would like to issue a challenge to all those who disagree with me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except for &quot;Mu In Taiwan&quot; for reasons that will become obvious. Read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above quotation and try to make the case that the remark isn't as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly mind numbingly stupid as it sounds. Come on, Mu In Taiwan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks I'm wrong just as you do, so stick up for the man, try to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some polish on that turd and reveal it's inner brilliance! It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most amusing to see you try. 
</em><br>
<p>don't you think that this kindergarden-style namecalling is very hard to 
<br>
distinguish from genuine trolling?
<br>
<p>Do you even have any interest in convincing the others of your point?
<br>
<p>If you do then please let me assure you that this way of conversation is
<br>
surely not the best way to accomplish that.
<br>
<p>Since it literally hurts my mind to wittness this total lack of manners
<br>
(that does, of course, also include some of the other posters here) I will
<br>
forsake any insights I could have gotten from this list and unsubscribe
<br>
myself.
<br>
<p>Grow up.
<br>
rob
