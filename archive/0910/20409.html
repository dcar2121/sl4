<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then why don't you answer some of my crap, it should be easy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fun to make me look like a fool, after all its just crap. Instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you just shrug your shoulders when I show that mathematicians have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; known for 75 years that a fixed goal mind won't work; 
</em><br>
<p>you: 
<br>
<em>&gt; People have tried to explain to you, several times now, that neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing's work nor Goedel's work implies anything of the kind.
</em><br>
<p><p>They have done nothing of the sort, all they have done is say I am wrong
<br>
without specifics while dreaming up new personal insults for me. I've
<br>
been at this long enough to recognize a phony when I see one and the
<br>
speech your garden variety phony gives is always some variant of the
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>&quot;You are completely and embarrassingly wrong, it would be trivially easy
<br>
to expose your stupidity, and by implication my brilliance, but for
<br>
reasons I refuse to make clear I will not do so. Instead I will include
<br>
a link to a respectable looking web page that I just found 2 minutes ago
<br>
with a Google search and haven't read and say that page proves John
<br>
Clark is 100% wrong.
