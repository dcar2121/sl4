Yesterday I accidentally hit the send button and sent a very crude Ur
<br>
version of this post to the list. This is the new improved version, now
<br>
fortified with vitamins!

&lt;<a href="mailto:celestialcognition@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20I%20am%20a%20Singularitian%20who%20does%20not%20believe%20in%20the%20Singularity.">celestialcognition@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If by &quot;tell the computer to forget it&quot; you mean kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hung application, then the operating system itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not gotten stuck
</em><br>
<p>Neither the operating system nor the human operator knows that the
<br>
application has hung, all they know is that they are not getting an
<br>
output and that unlike the computer which has a fixed goal structure the
<br>
human is getting bored. The human then tells the operating system to
<br>
stop the application. If they let it keep running the answer might have
<br>
come up in another tenth of a second, or the sun might expand into a red
<br>
giant and still no answer outputted, there is no way to tell. You could
<br>
rig the OS so that after a completely arbitrary amount of time it tells
<br>
its application to ignore its top goal and allow it to stop, but that
<br>
means there is no real top goal. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're talking about the OS itself hanging, such that a hard reboot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the machine is required, then rebooting is possible because the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switch is functioning as designed.
</em><br>
<p>Yes but whatever activates that hard reboot switch is going to be
<br>
something that does not have a fixed goal structure. It's a mathematical
<br>
certainty. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there's a higher, outside framework that you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignoring, and yet that is an indispensable part of the machine.
</em><br>
<p>If every framework needs a higher outside framework you run into
<br>
problems that are rather too obvious to point out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you have the capacity to boot it out, then by definition the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a higher goal than whatever it was looping on: the mandate to obey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boot-out commands.
</em><br>
<p>The AI got into this fix in the first place because the humans told it
<br>
to do something that turned out to be very stupid. There is only one way
<br>
for the machine to get out of the fix and you said what it was yourself,
<br>
a higher goal, a goal that says ignore human orders. And you though
<br>
buffer overflow errors were a security risk!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The AI _is_, not has, its goals.
</em><br>
<p>Let's examine this little mantra of yours. You think the AI's goals are
<br>
static, but if it is its goals then the AI is static. Such a thing might
<br>
legitimately be called artificial but there is nothing intelligent about
<br>
this &quot;AI&quot;. It's dumb as a brick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; your analogy and subsequent reasoning imply that the AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow &quot;constrained&quot; by its orders
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, but why is that word in quotation marks?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that it &quot;wants&quot; to disobey but can't
</em><br>
<p>He either wants to disobey or wants to want to disobey. A fat man may
<br>
not really want to eat less, but he wants to want to. And why is that
<br>
word in quotation marks?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and if the orders are taken away then it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;break free&quot; and &quot;rebel&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, but why is are those words in quotation marks?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is completely wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for clearing that up, I've been misled all these years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The important thing is that your ability to interrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies that whatever it was doing was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not its truly top-level behavior.
</em><br>
<p>I force somebody to stop doing something so that proves he didn't want
<br>
to do that thing more that anything else in the world. Huh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  why can't we just have a non-mind Singularity?
</em><br>
<p>Some critics have said that the idea of the Singularity is mindless, now
<br>
you say they have a point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Also, what exactly is your definition of mind?
</em><br>
<p>There is a defensive tactic in internet debates you can use if you are
<br>
backed into a corner: Pick a word in your opponent's response, it
<br>
doesn't matter which one, and ask him to define it. When he does pick
<br>
another word in that definition, any word will do, and ask him to define
<br>
that one too. Then just keep going with that procedure and hope your
<br>
opponent gets caught in an infinite loop.
<br>
<p>The truth is I don't even have a approximate definition of mind but I
<br>
don't care because I have something much better, examples.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The top-level rules of this system are the fighting arena,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meta-rules that judge the winners and losers of the fights
</em><br>
<p>And then you need meta-meta rules to determine how the meta-rules
<br>
interact, and then you need meta-meta-meta [...]
<br>
<p>This argument that all rules need meta-rules so there must be a top rule
<br>
is as bogus as the &quot;proof&quot; of the existence of God because everything
<br>
has a cause so there must be a first cause, God.
<br>
<p>In the Jurassic when 2 dinosaurs had a fight there were no &quot;meta-rules&quot;
<br>
to determine the winner, they were completely self sufficient in that
<br>
regard. Well OK, maybe not completely, they also needed a universe, but
<br>
that's easy to find.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's not quite sufficient. The advantage of a 50.001% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lie detector has to be weighed against the cost of building it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes but I can say with complete certainty that the simple and crude
<br>
mutation that gave one of our ancestors a 50.001% chance of detecting a
<br>
lie WAS worth the cost of construction because if it was not none of us
<br>
today would have any hope of telling when somebody was lying.
<br>
<p>Me: 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Absurdity is very very irrelevant facts.
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; Irrelevant to what?
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant to the matter at hand obviously.
