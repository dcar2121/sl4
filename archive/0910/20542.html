On Wed, 14 Oct 2009 &quot;Mu In Taiwan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mu.in.taiwan@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Alan%20Turing's%20results%20are%20profound">mu.in.taiwan@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Turing proved things about Turing Machines in 1936; not computers.
</em><br>
<p>He proved things about both. He used Turing Machines to prove things
<br>
that must be true for anything powerful enough to do arithmetic, like
<br>
computers, or you and me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Turing Machines are not the same as physical computers; they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical abstractions that cannot and do not exist in the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a fact of physics. There's just no room for the tape.
</em><br>
<p>That is entirely true. A computer is not a Turing Machine nor is a
<br>
human, it is an abstract tool used in formal logic. In a similar way
<br>
Carnot heat engines do not and can not exist in the real world but
<br>
engineers still study them because they tell you the limits of what a
<br>
heat engine can do; if even a Carnot engine can't do something a real
<br>
engine never could.
<br>
<p>An engine consumes gasoline not the laws of thermodynamics, certainly it
<br>
does not understand them; and yet a mind can use those laws to determine
<br>
the limits of what ANY heat engine can do regardless of the precise
<br>
details of its construction. A mind might not be a Turing Machine, use
<br>
formal logic, or even know the first thing about it. Nevertheless we can
<br>
use that discipline to know there are some tasks a mind can never
<br>
accomplish even with infinite time; and what’s more there is no way to
<br>
know beforehand what all those tasks are. You can’t know for certain if
<br>
you are in a infinite loop or not, you must use your judgment, if you
<br>
judge you probably are in such a loop then jump out.
<br>
<p>You can't build a Turing Machine but you can use the abstraction of one
<br>
to prove that any system, computer, or mind that is powerful enough to
<br>
do arithmetic is subject to the limitations that Goedel and Turing
<br>
specified. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I note from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2006-April/026391.html">http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2006-April/026391.html</a> 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you believe yourself to be a computer program.
</em><br>
<p>Well,its not relevant to the question we've been discussing but you
<br>
brought it up. I don't think I'm a computer program although I could in
<br>
principle be one someday. I am not a noun, I am a adjective, I am the
<br>
way atoms react when it is organized in a johnkclarkian way. In short I
<br>
am information, my atoms are just generic. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also claim not to possess a subjective experience in that post I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer to above.
</em><br>
<p>Oh I have subjective experiences. In fact I think my subjectivity is the
<br>
most important thing in the universe. You may disagree. I have a hunch
<br>
you have subjective experiences too, although I can't prove it. I think
<br>
it unlikely I am the only conscious being in the universe, but that's
<br>
just another hunch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 'you' ought not to be offended when I call 'you' an unhinged lunatic.
</em><br>
<p>You know, sometimes I almost think you are being unfriendly.
