<em>&gt; Good to see these ideas getting out into the mainstream media, but from this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show at least there still seems to be a fair amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schoolyard/finger-pointing type ridicule...
</em><br>
<p><p>That was interesting (and funny), thanks Mike. Seemed to me that the
<br>
'ridicule' was pretty good natured, given that it's a comedy show. It
<br>
was perhaps more telling that Aubrey's model was rejected because the
<br>
judges were more familiar with linear - rather than exponential -
<br>
thinking, and were also not previously familiar with the various
<br>
pieces of contextual information provided by Aubrey. In short, they
<br>
wanted to agree with the gist of what Aubrey had to say, but their own
<br>
forecasts were anchored in perceptions of a future that looks a lot
<br>
like the past. So far, so Kurzweil. That impression does, however,
<br>
lead me to thinking about ways in which transhumanist ideas could be
<br>
most effectively communicated to a wider audience, where necessary.
<br>
<p>A cognitive psychologist (or Derren Brown) attempting to sway those
<br>
judges would probably try to find a way to pre-exposure them to the
<br>
various points Aubrey made, along with a bit of information about the
<br>
nature of exponential trends. The reason for this is based in two
<br>
empirical phenomena studied by psychologists: (1) The Mere Exposure
<br>
effect, and (2) the Anchor-and-Adjust Heuristic. The Mere Exposure
<br>
effect shows that if you expose a person to a simple idea or
<br>
phenomenon without any kind of explicit argumentation, then leave them
<br>
for a while, later they will find the idea/stimulus more attractive
<br>
than they would otherwise have done. The Anchor-and-Adjust Heuristic
<br>
is essentially a rule of thumb people commonly use when judging a
<br>
quantity (e.g. &quot;What is my own estimate of average life expectancy a
<br>
hundred years from now?&quot;); People start with a prior &quot;anchor&quot; - a
<br>
more-or-less arbitrary baseline - and then &quot;adjust&quot; slightly from
<br>
there, in the direction that a persuasive argument would suggest.
<br>
<p>The judges on this TV show seemed like they *wanted* to agree with
<br>
Aubrey (his charisma and that beard go a long way to augment his
<br>
arguments!), but their &quot;anchors&quot; were rooted in linear extrapolation
<br>
of past trends, and so they couldn't agree with Aubrey's apparently
<br>
radical (and arguably exponential) model.
<br>
<p>So, why might Derren Brown have planted billboards with the relevant
<br>
facts along the judges' route to the studio? Because mere exposure to
<br>
such contextual information might give them a new anchor, which is
<br>
within adjusting range of Aubrey's own estimates, thus making
<br>
agreement with him acceptable, and therefore more likely.
<br>
<p>Might be a technique worth considering if people need to be convinced
<br>
of any arguments in favour of particular FAI techniques that can be
<br>
grounded in quantitative terms. If you don't agree with me, forget you
<br>
ever read this post, go away for a bit, and then next time you're
<br>
presented with this argument, it's more likely that you will    ;-)
<br>
