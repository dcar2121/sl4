I'd actually make the argument that any computer with an OS that's been 
<br>
up for more than 5 years has been successfully executing an infinite 
<br>
loop for that period of time.  This is not a problem, this is a design 
<br>
state.  The loop is called (sometimes) the main loop, or the 
<br>
read-eval-execute loop.
<br>
<p>Infinite loops are only a problem if you don't want to maintain homeostasis.
