<p>
Hello all.  I have recently entered a new stage of my life, and I intend to
<br>
start participating in the discussions here as I now have the time and
<br>
sources of inspiration which I will likely wish to share.
<br>
As a newcomer, I recognize that I may not fully grasp the conventional
<br>
subject matter and syntax here.  If any of my messages, such as the
<br>
following one, are unfit for this forum please alert me to this fact and
<br>
please, if you can, identify why it's off-topic.
<br>
<p>end-intro, begin-message:
<br>
<p>I just read a great sci-fi story about the future.  It examines a world
<br>
which is technologically advanced (slightly) and culturally/politically
<br>
different than our current one (slightly).  What I particularly like about
<br>
it is that it gives a beautiful description of the human experience of one
<br>
living in this (slightly) different world.  Enjoy:

<p>Well looky there, my font changed.  I do most of my typing in monospace so I
<br>
haven't the slightest idea how to get it back the way it was.
<br>
<p>I've been reading the recent marathon discussion of constraining robots to
<br>
be our friends.  All I have to add is this:  conversation can serve more
<br>
functions than the defense of two mega-points.  The assumption of a
<br>
bilateral split between &quot;what I'm saying&quot; and &quot;what you're saying&quot; is
<br>
basically completely erroneous.  In buddhism this error is known as getting
<br>
caught up in &quot;I&quot;, which does not in reality exist.  In logic, it borders on
<br>
ad-hominem reasoning, in a slightly varied form, essentially saying &quot;if I
<br>
can get you on one point, I've got you on all of them.&quot;  Our American
<br>
situation with the two parties and how any issue has to have a Party_A
<br>
response which must be different than the Party_B response has unfortunately
<br>
trained us all to habitually lump ALL of a person's points into &quot;that
<br>
person's argument&quot;, and hence get caught in devoting too much time to
<br>
belaboring tiny points, just to have the satisfaction of putting a chink
<br>
somewhere, anywhere, in their armor.
<br>
<p>Create good filtering processes, and the rest is gravy.
<br>
<p>Peace
<br>
&nbsp;- Luke
