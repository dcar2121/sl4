I think there is a lot of truth in what Vlad is saying.
<br>
<p>It is nice that the segments of society with narrowminded, largely
<br>
religiously-guided notions of ethics are focusing their attention on human
<br>
cloning and genetic engineering and so forth, and leaving AI alone.
<br>
<p>As soon as the first really impressive &quot;Real AI&quot; results come out, it's
<br>
quite possible that these forces will turn against *us*.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, though, computing is even harder to squelch than biology...
<br>
computers are everywhere in the Western world, software can be easily
<br>
transmitted from place to place, country to country, etc....  By the time
<br>
the forces of narrowmindedness start to pay attention to us, it will
<br>
probably be too late for them to cause much damage.  Especially if these
<br>
early &quot;Real AI&quot; programs are doing good deeds.  After all, the reason
<br>
they'll fail to stop human cloning and so forth, is that it does so much
<br>
good for curing disease....  It's hard for the average American to really
<br>
hate a branch of science that saves cute little kids -- or their parents --
<br>
from dying...
<br>
<p>I think that if the Singularity is going to go down relatively smoothly with
<br>
Joe and Jane America, we have to be sure that our AI software, when it's at
<br>
the stage of &quot;scarily smart but not yet superhuman&quot; is doing things that are
<br>
palpably for the good of humanity.
<br>
<p>If it's my team's AI software that gets there first, then this will be the
<br>
case, because (in our spare time ;) we are working on applications in the
<br>
area of genetics and drug discovery...

conditions of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ESY&gt; As for trying to propagate the meme outwards, I've been trying to do

that
<br>

</em><br>
progress
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think, wide propagating of Singularity is a mad and dangerous idea. The
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All we will get due to propagating is a huge backlash. If a doctor of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you think a mere people would not became your enemies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now nobody cares about Singularity becouse nobody knows about it. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoose who knows does't believe it in-heart, as we do. But then they
</em><br>
will...
<br>
<em>&gt; Do you want to be a more wanted than Bin Laden?   :o)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So IMHO we need some sort of conspiracy, moving ahead, keeping a privy
