</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  As always, Ben Goertzel thinks I'm a fuddy-duddy just because I
<br>
don't do sex, drugs, drinking, smoking, fighting, or gambling.  But I did
<br>
once go out on the dance floor on a science-fiction convention, which
<br>
should permanently put an end to the rumor that Singularitarians have less
<br>
fun.
<br>
<p>This may come as a surprise to you, Ben, but I've never been a fan of the
<br>
sour-grapes theory of ascetism.  I think sex is a great thing.  I just
<br>
don't want to find out from personal experience.  Who here, if they'd
<br>
managed to go through their whole life up until this point without ever
<br>
tasting chocolate, would take a bite *now* and spend the rest of their
<br>
life trying to resist the temptation to eat donuts?  Well... probably
<br>
quite a few people, actually.  The point I'm trying to make is that I have
<br>
to expend willpower to control my diet, but I don't have to expend
<br>
willpower to control my sex life because I decided early on not to have
<br>
one.  This doesn't mean I think that sex is worthless or morally wrong.  I
<br>
think sex is a great thing, for other people.  If I ever had the
<br>
opportunity to help out with a friend's love life, I'd do it.  Helping a
<br>
friend isn't likely to trigger a mental chain of events that ends by
<br>
sucking up all my Saturday nights until the end of time.
<br>
<p>Am I at risk for alcohol addiction?  Would seeing the world through a rosy
<br>
glow, for just a few hours, make the rest of my existence harder to bear? 
<br>
I'll never know, because there's a very easy way to avoid finding out.
<br>
<p>Love, of course, is a more interesting issue, as I happen to be a hopeless
<br>
romantic.  As such, I believe - call me loony - that love is a cathedral
<br>
you build together, a rose that you grow and water together, *for its own
<br>
sake*.  It is something that you expend time and effort *on*, because you
<br>
care about it, not an investment that pays back your expended time because
<br>
only one of you has to go on the weekly shopping trips.  You put time,
<br>
mental energy, and caring into love, and what you get in return is love. 
<br>
Sort of like children, albeit to a lesser extent.  If you try and impose
<br>
the requirement that love serve as the most effective means to some other
<br>
end (i.e., the Singularity), the necessary conditions soon become so
<br>
exotic as to be entirely impossible.
<br>
<p>Let me put it this way:  I suppose that a sufficiently intelligent,
<br>
sufficiently altruistic female reader of SL4 might email me in response to
<br>
this message and say:  &quot;Hi, I'm an independently wealthy 25-year-old woman
<br>
who's totally devoted to the Singularity.  I've decided that the most
<br>
efficient way for me to advance the Singularity is to act as your support
<br>
mechanism.  I'm dyslexic, so you can't recruit me for the programming
<br>
project, or turn me into a Singularity writer [either of which would make
<br>
her time too valuable to be spent primarily on supporting me].  I
<br>
therefore order you to marry me.&quot;  And I'd do it.  Similarly, someone
<br>
might say:  &quot;Hi, I'm a billionaire.  I want to fund your project but your
<br>
ascetism makes me nervous.  I will therefore donate a million dollars to
<br>
SIAI, on the condition that you give me your word of honor that you will
<br>
start dating.&quot;  And I'd do it.  I'm a pretty easy guy to manipulate, as
<br>
long as it doesn't violate my ethics.  But both cases seem rather
<br>
unlikely.
<br>
<p>These impossible conditions aren't an artificial attempt on my part to
<br>
avoid intimacy or whatever.  It's a naturally impossible set of
<br>
conditions, stemming from the fact that love is something you put time
<br>
*into*, not something that you get time *out* of.
<br>
