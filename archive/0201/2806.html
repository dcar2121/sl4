Seriously, though, it is.  Ask someone to explain the idea.  The 
<br>
response goes something like this:
<br>
<p>ME:  Why do things die?
<br>
VER:  Because it's natural.  It's the Circle of Life!
<br>
ME:  What is natural?  What is the key to the Circle of Life?
<br>
VER:  Death.
<br>
<p>Ah, yes, that explains it.  :-P
<br>

<br>
<p>This is just a silly caricature.  Most real belief systems are vastly
<br>
more complex and deep than this.  For instance, my wife is a
<br>
Buddhist and there is an awful lot of depth to the Buddhist view
<br>
of death.  It's tied in with the idea that physical existence
<br>
is illusory, for instance.  This list is not the place for an
<br>
exposition of Buddhist philosophy, however....
<br>
<p>I stress that I am not myself a Buddhist or a believer in
<br>
death as a good thing.  I hope my kids retain their current
<br>
intense interest in uploading, cryonics, and so forth, once
<br>
they grow up.  I'll be happy if my wife changes her mind about
<br>
wanting to die, but
<br>
I'm not betting on it, and I muchly appreciate many other aspects of her
<br>
world-view that are bound up with her (unpalatable to me) views
<br>
on death...
<br>
<p>I guess that as uploading becomes a real possibility, fewer and
<br>
fewer people will be scared by it, and the Diaspora vision of a small
<br>
population of &quot;fleshers&quot; will be largely accurate.  However as I said,
<br>
I think the Diaspora vision of uploads as so closely human-like will not
<br>
hold for long.  Without the human body to anchor us, we will drift into
<br>
very different, and probably very interesting, experiential spaces.
