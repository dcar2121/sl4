<em>&gt; &gt;In terms of ultimate goals, if 99% of the people on Earth

<em>&gt; &gt;don't want the Singularity for itself, they are welcome to stay on Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;after the Singularity finishes, but I must deny them their moral right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deny me transhumanity based on their own moral judgements.  *That* part
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unambiguous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose the UN decides to ban all Singularity-related research because it
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;incompatible with human dignity&quot;. If I understand you correctly, you
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; go ahead anyway to the best of your ability?
</em><br>
<p>I know I would. Any person, government or society that wishes to oppress me
<br>
is going to get a fight. Not only from me, but from other people who have
<br>
the reasoning capability to understand why I do what I'm doing, and also
<br>
protesters who are against intolerance (who are pro-tolerance) for other
<br>
cultures such as Singulatarians that do have tolerance for other cultures
<br>
(or is that Extropianism?)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The reason I ask is because I think that this is the most likely outcome
</em><br>
if
<br>
<em>&gt; a sufficient number of people understood the concept of the Singularity
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; believed that it was a real possibility. The UN is now debating a
</em><br>
world-wide
<br>
<em>&gt; ban on human cloning for no other reason than that cloning is scary stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see &quot;dignity&quot; above). And as you all know, the implications of cloning is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing compared to those of the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>It's scary, but people will get over it. Cars are scary, kill thousands of
<br>
people each year, which was a lot more than say 50 years ago too. The next
<br>
generation of children will be born into the scary new world, and the old
<br>
people are going to die along with their fears.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If not an outright ban on AI-related research, my guess is that you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face a 10-year moratorium on AI-research (precautionary principle and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that). In this timeframe, there could be nanotech grey goo disasters or
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; have you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is of course also the inevitable rise of neo-Luddite terrorist
</em><br>
groups
<br>
<em>&gt; who would probably go to any length to stop you. The world will be at
</em><br>
stake
<br>
<em>&gt; for them, literally. They could even have widespread public support.
</em><br>
<p>Both of these scenarios I consider worst-case, because they would occur
<br>
through lack of reasoning and lack of tolerance. Fundamental Muslims,
<br>
Christians, et al. are intolerant groups of people, and they are diminishing
<br>
in numbers as we speak. Atheism (lazy-ism?) and agnostics are plentiful now
<br>
because their own experiences have shown them that the intolerant religions
<br>
just don't make sense for whatever reason.
<br>
<p>However when you talk about &quot;widespread&quot; public support, I wonder if you
<br>
include the population of China. That's a whole culture I know very little
<br>
about, so I shall refrain from commenting or trying to guess as to what
<br>
their reaction would be to common technological changes elsewhere in the
<br>
world. How is the Chinese Windows XP selling? ;-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; With all this in mind, and what Eliezer wrote above, I suggest a simpler
</em><br>
way
<br>
<em>&gt; of meme-spreading than what's been suggested by most people here: Don't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Don't spread the meme.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely not, and I hope you don't try to stop me if I ever do make a
<br>
concentrated effort. However, being the tolerant and reasonable person that
<br>
I am, I will listen to your arguments and maybe adjust my method
<br>
appropriately.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The main problem is, as I described above, for every person that hears
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; S. and is pro-S, there will be 10 that is anti-S.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I'm an optimist, but I think that there are more reasonable people in
<br>
the world to reduce that ratio by a lot. Say, 3 to 1.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) If the meme start spreading anyway, it would be better if we put some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive spin on it to begin with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is probably true, but I think what positive spin SingInst/SL4
</em><br>
produces
<br>
<em>&gt; will be swamped by negative spin once the meme is out in the media. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have stated that the meme is bound to start spreading (like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HIV-virus i believe the metaphor was). I do not think this must be the
</em><br>
case
<br>
<em>&gt; (I could elaborate on this, but in a separate post).
</em><br>
<p>Well the negative spin is obviously using the metaphor of the HIV virus.
<br>
Let's use a positive one, like a Great Oak tree, or heck, even the
<br>
resurrection of some respected celebrity, like Einstein.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) People have a right to know. (This is mostly unspoken, but this might
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; the strongest reason for some)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People would also have a right to see the other side of the Singularity.
</em><br>
If
<br>
<em>&gt; the two &quot;rights&quot; are mutually exclusive (which I think they are), one must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take precedent over the other. To me, the obvious choice is the
</em><br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>And to reasonable people, that would probably be the obvious choice too.
<br>
Again, I don't think I'm as pessimistic about the ratio that you or what
<br>
most of the people on this list seem to be. The Truth Is Out There!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I think that making the S-meme widespread would harm your work more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help it. Since SingInst is thinking about paying people to do logotypes, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must suppose you don't agree with me. What are your arguments for this?
</em><br>
<p>We need some sort of symbol or identification, otherwise how are people
<br>
going to get the meme? Who is going to have the first Singularitarian
<br>
tattoo? Eliezer? ;-) Maybe if we got him drunk in a brothel first ...
<br>
