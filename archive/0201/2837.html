<em>&gt; &gt; Well, the part where you said that any choice involving growing old,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pain, and death is objectively wrong coupled with the part where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; said that when you see pain, you want to heal it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say it was objectively wrong; I said it was wrong under virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone's moral premises, even though some people may refuse the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence necessary to extrapolate their moral premises consistently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does not follow that forcible upgrading of intelligence is a moral act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under those same premises.
</em><br>
<p>I think your statement that &quot;accepting death is wrong under virtually
<br>
everyone's moral
<br>
premises&quot; is not correct.
<br>
<p>I feel that you do not very thoroughly understand the &quot;moral premises&quot; of
<br>
the vast number
<br>
of human beings.
<br>
<p>In my view, differences in ethical and moral theory are not primarily due to
<br>
logical inconsistency on the
<br>
part of those with the &quot;wrong&quot; ethics or morals.
<br>
<p>There is some illogicality involved of course.
<br>
Christianity is a particularly illogical religion in many ways.
<br>
Buddhism for example is highly logically self-consistent, and provides a set
<br>
of
<br>
moral premises under which accepting death is absolutely correct.  Islam is
<br>
also highly logically
<br>
consistent, although I personally like it far less than Buddhism.
<br>
<p>There is a nice 2-volume set called &quot;Buddhist Logic&quot; by Th. Stcherbatsky
<br>
(??) which reviews
<br>
the internal logic of the Buddhist perspective, based mainly on the work of
<br>
the medieval
<br>
Buddhist logicians Dharmakirti and Dignaga.
<br>
<p>The Buddhist view (to which I repeat, I do not fully subscribe) does not
<br>
rely on any
<br>
scientifically unlikely ideas such as heaven or reincarnation, either.
<br>
Among other things, it
<br>
portrays this world AND the world of the upload as illusions, and argues
<br>
that to deny death is to
<br>
cling to a world of illusions and an ultimately illusory individual
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
You  may accuse this view of logical inconsistency or lack of
<br>
intelligence -- but Buddhist logicians could debate you expertly and
<br>
logically on any point of your choice
<br>
until you were both either dead or uploaded....  Hell, the ancient Indians
<br>
*invented* logic!!
<br>
<p>Also, I note that death does not necessarily involve pain.  Death involves
<br>
more pain now than
<br>
it did in most previous cultures, which did not have such advanced
<br>
life-extension technology.  Embracing death does not imply embracing pain.
<br>
Buddhism is all about escaping the pain of the samsaric world via mental and
<br>
spiritual purification, part of which is the acceptance of death as Ok given
<br>
the fundamental illusoriness of reality.
<br>
<p>I am not trying to convert anyone to Buddhism, a religion in which I do not
<br>
believe.  But I do believe Buddhism to be a logically consistent
<br>
perspective, as much so as any science for sure.  It simply begins from
<br>
different fundamental assumptions than my own point of view.
<br>
<p>Whether superintelligent beings will have belief systems comparable to
<br>
Buddhism, i really have no idea.  Perhaps beings explicitly implemented on a
<br>
foundation of simulations and bits will have a highly evolved sense of their
<br>
own illusoriness, in a semi-Buddhist sort of way. Time will tell...
