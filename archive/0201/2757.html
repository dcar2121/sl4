</em><br>
<p>William Calvin (&quot;The Ascent of Mind&quot;) made a decent argument that the
<br>
reason our brain isn't bigger than it is, is that evolution couldn't figure
<br>
out how to make a woman's pelvis open wider....  His argument is not
<br>
ironclad but seems pretty solid based on various pieces of evidence that
<br>
he assembles.
<br>
<p>This is good news, because it suggests that at least in the case of the
<br>
human
<br>
brain, evolution did *not* stop where it did because of some kind of size-
<br>
based cognitive limit....  (Of course, even if the human brain architecture
<br>
had a size-based cognitive limit, this wouldn't prove that all intelligence
<br>
architectures had similar limits...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, I *think* there are some solid tricks for getting around these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems (at least insofar as what I was working with), but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I would ever expect to evolve in biological wetware.
</em><br>
<p>There seem to be OK tricks in the context of my own AI work, but of course I
<br>
don't *really* know how well these tricks will scale....  That would require
<br>
doing some very (but perhaps not impossibly) hard math...
<br>
<p>I think this kind of discussion is quite valuable, because it concretizes
<br>
for us &quot;what kinds of questions are important to ask&quot; as we move toward
<br>
real implementations of seed AI...
