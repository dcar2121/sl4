<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, this is a silly topic of conversation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rational altruism?  Why would it be?  I've often considered starting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;third mailing list devoted solely to that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hi all, I have been lurking from the sidelines for a while, watching all the
<br>
great info being passed here, but thought I might be able to ask a question
<br>
here that someone could answer, and maybe clarify it for myself and others.
<br>
<p>Why is altruism even a virtue?
<br>
What have others done to garner the results of my efforts?
<br>
Why am I not deserving of my attention, effort, and being a self-sufficient
<br>
reason for existing?
<br>
<p>If a man were on a deserted isle, his purpose and philosophy should be quite
<br>
simple and obvious. Being in a civilization of billions doesnt change man's
<br>
basic nature or relationship to reality. Trying to live through others and
<br>
for others doesnt appeal to me or seem rational at all. Remember, the
<br>
greatest crimes in history was done in the name of altruism, sacrifice, and
<br>
immolation of the self on the altar of the &quot;greatest good&quot;. Need I point to
<br>
Russia, China, and other socialistic countries that tried to destroy egoism
<br>
in the name of altruism? Im sure Ill get a response back that it wasnt
<br>
altruism they were practicing, Ive included a quote or 2 below that should
<br>
make certain leaders intentions clear and show the exact definition of
<br>
altruism they were working toward.
<br>
<p>To tell the truth, I think the future will be all about anarcho-capitalism,
<br>
but thats to be seen.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is thus necessary that the individual should come to realize that his
<br>
own ego is of no importance in comparison with the existence of his nation;
<br>
that the position of the individual ego is conditioned solely by the
<br>
interests of the nation as a whole ... that above all the unity of a
<br>
nation's spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit
<br>
and will of an individual. .... This state of mind, which subordinates the
<br>
interests of the ego to the conservation of the community, is really the
<br>
first premise for every truly human culture .... we understand only the
<br>
individual's capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for his fellow
<br>
man.&quot; (Adolph Hitler, 1933)

<br>
Oct. 7, 1933
<br>
<p>&quot;The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And
<br>
intends to be the master.&quot; (Ayn Rand)
