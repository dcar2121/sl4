<p>&lt;&lt; Well, it would likely be of `true value' then, whatever you mean by that. 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Singularity-promoting, directly or indirectly.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Perhaps that would work for a normative human.  Last time I checked, 
<br>
though, I was actively pursuing behavior that is non normative for 
<br>
humans.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I despite the norm.  But some characteristics of the opposite sex, or the 
<br>
same sex for that matter have value independent of such norms.  For example, 
<br>
novelty and intelligence is nearly always good.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;One thing that bugs me a bit in your reasoning is that you assume that 
<br>
the Singularity is beyond a doubt the most important thing ever.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yep, but getting to the Singularity is part of the Singularity, and getting 
<br>
to the Singularity can be *very*, *very* fun.  So eventually we can all ditch 
<br>
our obsolete non-Singularitarian worldviews when the glory of the 
<br>
Singularitarian path becomes more clear, rapturous, and fun.  Of course I 
<br>
could be wrong.  What bugs you about this wordview, specifically?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Like what?  No matter what you do, it will help bring about the Singularity 
<br>
in some way.   Microbes in an organic soup replicating have, in a very 
<br>
fundamental sense, the same &quot;purpose&quot; as human beings and our thoughts - to 
<br>
evolve, to proceed to the End.  The &quot;End&quot; is the Singularity.  Not in any 
<br>
negative way of course.  You might as well optimize your activities to 
<br>
acheive the highest degree of Singularity-helpfulness now, because it will 
<br>
only get funner and more progressive as time goes on, leaving our more 
<br>
&quot;mundane life&quot; behind in the dust.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;Here and now&quot; activities are essential to help acheive Singularity as well.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Lots of different skills are needed and in the end I 
<br>
may provide some key bit of info to reach the Singularity safely.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Absolutely, but wouldn't you rather supply more key info rather than less?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;On 
<br>
the other hand, maybe I'm screwing everything up by keeping on with my 
<br>
life without the Singularity on top of my goal system.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We'll see.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Well, I don't 
<br>
know what's going to happen, so I do what I think is best for me and 
<br>
hope that things turn out well for the universe, too.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The universe wants you to acheive Singularity, I think.
<br>
<p>Note:  If at the emergence of life, single-celled organisms happened to 
<br>
arrange themselves in an order for rapid recursive self-improvement and 
<br>
extreme cognitive speed, right off the bat, wouldn't that have been nice?  
<br>
'We&quot; would've had a Singularity billions of years ago.  This would be 
<br>
&quot;skipping levels of progress&quot; however.  But since we're conscious, why can't 
<br>
*we* at least *try* to acheive analogous &quot;skipping&quot;?
