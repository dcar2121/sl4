<p><em>&gt; genome.  You should try it sometime.  It's fun.

<p>Yes, it is.  :-)
<br>
<p>Since I was very young, I haven't liked my emotions.  They always made 
<br>
me do something that didn't make sense (the rational part of my brain 
<br>
has worked for a long time).  Thus, I concluded, since I don't like 
<br>
acting irrational and emotions seem to cause this, I'll get ride of 
<br>
emotions.  Well, I didn't think this explicitly until some time after I 
<br>
realized what I was doing.
<br>
<p>The process was slow.  Before about the age of 13 I got close to 
<br>
nowhere.  I didn't like my emotional responses and got upset with myself 
<br>
but couldn't get ride of them very well.  Then, well, minor emotions 
<br>
started to trickle away.  By the time I was 16 I had gotten rid of minor 
<br>
emotions.  Alas, the big ones remained.  And, to be honest, it is 
<br>
dangerous to have only big emotions and no little ones.  If my ego got 
<br>
inflated, I was at its mercy.  If I fell in love, I had it bad.  Really 
<br>
bad.  Life sucked more.  :-/
<br>
<p>Well, I finally managed to get a hold of myself by 17.  I suppressed my 
<br>
ego into submission.  To this day it still gets excited when I do 
<br>
something that causes ego inflation, but I douse the excitement quickly 
<br>
and make sure I don't act on it.  If someone tells me I did a good job, 
<br>
my opinion of my ability to do skill x is only raised by assessing their 
<br>
credibility to make such claims and the likelyhood that they are being 
<br>
honest along with my own self assessment.  It happens sometimes that my 
<br>
ego gets going, but generally not.  It is on its death bed.  As you 
<br>
might imagine, I'm proud of this.  (just kidding, just kidding, I'm not 
<br>
proud of it, it just is)
<br>
<p>Love, well, I'll admit, my genes made me fall in love.  And, yes, for 
<br>
quite a while, I believed that I really was in LOVE.  Luckily, due to a 
<br>
number of circumstances in my life, I fell out of LOVE and ended up 
<br>
being rationally in love.  Rational love is a great thing, let me tell 
<br>
you.  It makes you feel good but at the same time your aren't blind.  
<br>
Plus, it caries no need to reproduce.  And, rational love has had 
<br>
positive effects on the relationship.  Of course, I'm still only a few 
<br>
months into this, so I'll have to save more detail for later since I 
<br>
don't have everything figured out.  Maybe I just managed to tap into a 
<br>
different love emotion than the one used to reproduce.  At any rate it 
<br>
lets me keep thinking rationally.
<br>
<p>Note that killing an emotion usually involved getting at its source.  
<br>
Viz., you can't kill the weed with a lawnmower, you have to pull it out, 
<br>
roots and all.  I only realized this later, which made my job a lot 
<br>
easier.
<br>
<p>Unlike Eliezer, my goal is only to be rational, not rationally 
<br>
altruistic necessarily.  If that's what being rational requires, then so 
<br>
be it.  From what Eliezer writes, I'm not nearly as far along as he is, 
<br>
but at least the rational module of my brain doesn't get upset very much 
<br>
any more (i.e. I'm not acting irrationally).  Of course, my mind could 
<br>
be in possession of an emotion I don't even know is there and it is 
<br>
fooling me, but from what I can tell of my own mind there is no such 
<br>
emotion.
<br>
<p>Oh, a final word of warning.  Before you engage in some kind of crusade 
<br>
to become rational (and being a rational person is a lot better than 
<br>
being irrational), be sure you have some wisdom.  You'll need heuristics 
<br>
that you never knew you didn't have when you become apathetic.  I found 
<br>
this out the hard way.  Very hard!
<br>
<p>Now, back to your regularly scheduled SL4 content.
<br>
<p>PS:  Eliezer, a list for discussion of these issues sounds interesting 
<br>
and a good learning experience for all (I know I'd like to learn more).  
<br>
Since it isn't super Singularity related I'll look into setting one up, 
<br>
knowing that that's a requirement for you to do something.
<br>
<p>One really final note.  I know that my time line of events may be off.  
<br>
Things may have happened sooner or later than listed above.  This is 
<br>
simply due to the fact that I have a hard time with time.  I remember 
<br>
events, but I have to estimate when they happened relative to the few 
<br>
events that I'm sure of the time on.  Sorry if there's any 
<br>
inconvenience.  Now, if only I could remember when I first realized that 
<br>
I had this problem ... :-)
