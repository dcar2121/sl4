Hello polysync,
<br>
<p>You have mixed up quotations from me and somebody else,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given this fact, the assumption that there is only 1 reality is just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ungrounded as the assumption that there are many.  Each of the
</em><br>
approximations
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to reality that reason makes, only narrows down the space of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realities a bit, it doesn't show that ony one true reality lies within
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; narrowed- down space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Are you saying there's a finite (or infinite) number of realities, and
</em><br>
we're
<br>
<em>&gt; randomly (or even orderly) cycling between them? And supposing that were
</em><br>
true,
<br>
<em>&gt; what stops me from saying &quot;the only One True Reality&quot; is nothing more than
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;set of sub-realities&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>I was saying here that WE JUST DON'T KNOW whether there is one true
<br>
reality or not.   (Maybe the post-Singularity supermind will figure it out
<br>
... or dismiss
<br>
the question as irrelevant blather...)
<br>
<p>The difference between a single reality and a set of realities, in my view,
<br>
is logical
<br>
consistency.  If X occurs in reality A, but does not occur in reality B,
<br>
then I call
<br>
A and B different realities.  Of course this could also be formalized in a
<br>
probabilistic
<br>
way... thus giving a probability estimate of the difference vs. sameness of
<br>
two
<br>
realities A and B.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A good metaphor, in my view are uncomputable numbers.  You can never
</em><br>
express
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an uncomputable number, never give a real example of one.  Yet you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; construct a series of rational approximations to one, and know that
</em><br>
you're
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; getting closer &amp; closer...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I can't predict random numbers or the next roll of perfect dice either,
</em><br>
but I
<br>
<em>&gt; think I understand their One True Reality.
</em><br>
<p>Well, far be it from me to dispute your delusion ... everyone is welcome to
<br>
their
<br>
own religion as far as I'm concerned ;-&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even so, that does not give &quot;you&quot; the right to exercise intolerance of
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who are &quot;wrong&quot; (by your personal definition).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So you're tolerant of the person who says the 6-sided die can sometimes
</em><br>
roll a
<br>
<em>&gt; seven?
</em><br>
<p>Here you are responding to a quote from someone other than myself.
<br>
<p>To answer your question for myself, anyway: I certainly *try* to be tolerant
<br>
of
<br>
people who believe things I think are dumb, such as astrology.  Being an
<br>
imperfect
<br>
human being, I don't always succeed.  I derive a certain amount of humility
<br>
from
<br>
the knowledge of the extreme finitude of my own mind, though perhaps not as
<br>
much as I should.  In other words, no matter
<br>
what my wife might say, I don't *actually* believe I'm always right ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Also, even though I have a generally tolerant *attitude*, when a practical
<br>
decision
<br>
has to be made I naturally go with my own beliefs rather than a weighted
<br>
average
<br>
of everybody else's!!!
<br>
