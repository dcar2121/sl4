<em>&gt; I find this extremely doubtful.  I have several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends who have gotten their hard-earned Ph.D's in AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and every single one of them says that creating an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through experimental software methods alone and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aided by a thorough knowledge of brain science will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doomed to failure. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I got my hard-earned PHD in math, but I've been an
<br>
AI researcher for many years, and I teach AI in the university.
<br>
(see the syllabus for my current course at 
<br>
www.goertzel.org/unm/ai/ ).  I even supervise PhD students
<br>
getting their hard-earned PhD's in AI.
<br>
<p>So while my opinion is different than that of many other
<br>
experts, this difference does not automatically render me
<br>
a non-expert...
<br>
<p>It is true that the current mainstream approaches to AI are not really
<br>
aimed at artificial general intelligence (AGI).  For a summary of
<br>
various contemporary approaches to AGI, go to
<br>
www.goertzel.org/realaibook/ and follow the link to the Prospectus.
<br>
<p>If genuine AGI is achieved within the next decade, it will not
<br>
be the first time in the history of science and technology that
<br>
a radical breakthrough will have proved the majority of experts
<br>
to be shortsighted and narrowminded.
<br>
<p>What would most experts have said about quantum theory in 1895, or
<br>
about airplanes 10 years before the Wright Brothers?  Beware of
<br>
forming strong opinions based on the ideas of &quot;experts.&quot;
<br>
<p>Brain science of course can be highly inspirational for AI.  But
<br>
since our current computer hardware is so un-brain-like, I really
<br>
doubt that closely emulating the brain is going to be a workable
<br>
approach to implementing AI for a good long while.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In addition they also all agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that unlimited computer speed alone with do nothing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance the state of AI Research. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, actually, *unlimited* computer
<br>
speed would allow true AI with a very simple program (this is
<br>
known as Solomonoff Induction).  But mere orders of magnitude
<br>
improvements won't do that trick.  What they will do, however,
<br>
is make it easier to implement and experiment with powerful
<br>
approaches to AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of my friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently told me that the biggest flaw with several AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pathways is their overestimation of their scalability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  He compares them to a person who, climbing a tree and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing that they are moving ever upward, concluding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if they continue they will eventually reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moon.  Truer words have never been spoken.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the majority of AI approaches have severe scalability
<br>
problems.  This fact does not imply that severe scalability
<br>
problems necessarily plague all non-brain-based approaches to
<br>
AI.  AI approaches tend to get optimized for small problems because
<br>
this is how researchers can get results quickly and easily and
<br>
hence publish papers or make saleable products.  To optimize an
<br>
AI approach for large problems is a much harder and more time-
<br>
consuming project with fewer interim rewards.  For instance, 
<br>
neural net algorithms
<br>
come in more and less scalable varieties.  Hebbian learning is
<br>
fairly well scalable but works poorly with small networks.  Backpropagation
<br>
is terribly unscaleable (esp. in its recurrent variety) but works
<br>
well with small networks. Which one gets all the attention?
<br>
<p>I think some AI researchers are so bullish on brain science partly
<br>
because they know the difficulties of AI so well, and are more
<br>
ignorant of the difficulties of brain science.  The grass is
<br>
always greener....  In my view one will need a pretty sophisticated
<br>
AI just to make sense of all the data that advanced brain scanners
<br>
generate.  Making sense of EEG and MEG and PET and fMRI data is
<br>
already too hard for feeble human brains, in many cases... though
<br>
there have of course been some interesting results derived...
