<p>Well, I'm just not sure that's true on a fundamental level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some kind of semantic net of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extracted for instance need not be all that brittle at all.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, this I *know* not to be true.  Brittleness in this case is an unavoidable
<br>
artifact of the mutability of objects (files, etc.) in today's information storage
<br>
paradigm.  Because an object from which semantic information is &quot;extracted&quot; may later
<br>
be changed, having a separate semantic net (metadata of any kind, really) overlaid on
<br>
top is an *inherently* brittle arrangement.  Unless the storage substrate itself
<br>
becomes smarter / can understand the semantics of what is stored, you're always going
<br>
to have a potential for metadata and data to be out of sync.  And IMO, that's worse
<br>
than not having the metadata at all.
<br>
<p>Further, ontologies are inherently brittle because they are models of the world, and
<br>
these models evolve over time as our context and our understanding of the world itself
<br>
evolves.  Any semantic network which seeks to capture such an ontology *is* doomed to
<br>
obsolesence.  (To illustrate this:  how many times in your life have you rearranged
<br>
your own home directory filesystem to better organize your stored bits?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the amount of structuring that is actually needed to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstructured data significantly more useful doesn't necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require that much expertise or expensive processing.
</em><br>
<p>I'm completely with you regarding &quot;annotation&quot;-like external markup and addition of
<br>
dimensions to otherwise-unstructured content.  But IMO, the grand vision of the
<br>
semantic web goes much further than that, into a relatively dangerous territory.  Do
<br>
some reading about the history of the hierarchical database paradigm for a starter /
<br>
refresher course in the danger of reference-based structures as a storage metaphor...
<br>
<p>Finally, I'm not convinced that structure isn't *inherently* harmful.  IMO, it's a
<br>
poor man's workaround for lack of intelligence in general.  There is no evidence to
<br>
suggest that information is stored / accessed / used in a structured way in biological
<br>
intelligence.  I'm not sure why we think it's so important in artificial information
<br>
processing systems.
