<p><em>&gt; Hi,

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we largely agree conceptually, we just differ on estimates of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various quantitative amounts (*how much* improvement can be achieved through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groupware and non-AI search tools, *how hard* will it be to get to real AI
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed. It's refreshing to rapidly converge on our differences without
<br>
a lot of diversionary rhetoric. Is it worthwhile to attempt to quantify
<br>
these estimates on both our parts? I'll try here, but I realize that
<br>
I'm operating from little more than gut feeling, and I'll understand it
<br>
if you don't wish to play this game..
<br>
<p>I've been a systems architect/programmer for 30 years. I've seen only a
<br>
modest improvement in software development productivity in this time,
<br>
with most improvement at the lowest ( i.e., lexical and syntactical)
<br>
levels (better editors, compilers, and languages.) attempts at
<br>
higher level improvements (CASE tools, etc.) have mostly failed. However
<br>
I find that my productivity has begun improving over the last few years
<br>
for two main reasons: the avauilability of open-source software, and the
<br>
availability of search engines. Neither of these is actually designed to
<br>
enhance software development productivity. What if we now explicitly
<br>
try to build tools to build on the open-source base by using tuned 
<br>
search engines? There are several scattered efforts, but I know of no
<br>
integrated effort with this as an explicit goal. I feel that 
<br>
productivity could easily triple, and that this could lead to (another)
<br>
qualitative change in the nature of software development. If this gut
<br>
feeling is correct, then I believe rapid feedback will commence as we
<br>
apply the techniques to enhancing the techniques.
<br>
<p>I feel that this could happen at any time and is likely sometime in the
<br>
next four years. (&quot;Likely&quot; means 90% probability.)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;don't. In any event I don't think the human/computer interface is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;important constraint on the human/computer SI. It's a software problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mostly in the data presentation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I believe you on this, then I'm going to downgrade my estimate of how far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI can be pushed via collaborative technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I still suspect there's a pretty low upper limit on how deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaboration can be made via current tech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best we're going to get without very good AI or radical new interfaces,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my view, is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) conferencing tech that lets globally distributed teams work as if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) collaborative-filtering-enhanced search tech that does a better job of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returning info you want, not based on understanding of content, but based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clever use of ratings and user info, together with minimal non-AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of content...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope I'm pleasantly surprised...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm thinking quite practically &amp; personally about the tech we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I would love to see 1) come about, especially if it worked on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow pipe to Brazil, since that's where most of my collaborators are.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe 1) would double the efficiency of my globally distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; team.  A factor of 1.5  in productivity would be my guess (of course, we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very productive already..).  As for 2), I'm not sure how useful it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for obscure topics; I think the main win would be in presenting popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics to new audiences (e.g. I'm a CS guy who wants to learn about genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulatory networks  -- where have other CS guys looked before when wanting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn about such things?).  At this point we don't do that much library
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Net research for our work, so this would speed up our process by an even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller factor....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another point is that 1) would make it easier to recruit new people to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; team....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All in all I'm feeling maybe a 2x increase in productivity due to advances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in groupware and search and related technology, for the specific &quot;real AI&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oriented work I'm involved in.  Of course, the increase in productivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be far greater for people working in different domains, e.g. domains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused on looking up the research of others, or contacting others widely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our work is based on a team of people with a common idea working closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together... we already understand each other about as well as can be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without looking into each others' brains... and we use collaborative tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e-mail, phone, CVS, documents with particular naming conventions, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we all are comfortable with.  Could things be improved?  Yeah, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course....  But a factor of 10??  I dunno...
