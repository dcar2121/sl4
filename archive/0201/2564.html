<p>Yep, they continue below.  I finally got this movie and, without a 
<br>
doubt, this has instantly become my new favorite movie (but /pi/ comes 
<br>
in a very close second).

<em>&gt;&gt; I liked the movie OK, but it didn't live up to my expectations (after
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oops.  In retrospect, I can see that you are completely correct about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.  But it does make it rather hard to recommend the movie!
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about that.  I knew there was a transhuman sci-fi element, 
<br>
but in many ways that made the foreshadowing better (and I was able to 
<br>
pick up on some subtle things that were probably missed in most first 
<br>
viewings), though I suppose I might have a different opinion if I'd sat 
<br>
there like Eliezer saying 'no, they couldn't ...'.  Regardless, this is 
<br>
a very well made film.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; And of course, why, oh why did he have to jump from a building to wake 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; up?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either dramatic plot device, or some kind of psychological method for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; severing the connections to the old world before waking up.  Almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly the former.  Still, you can rationalize quite a lot on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption of SL3 gross psychosurgery rather than uploading.
</em><br>
<p>Well, but the choice of jumping as opposed to just dying by the most 
<br>
convenient method ties in with the idea that he's dreaming and I have 
<br>
gotten the impression that many people have falling dreams where they 
<br>
wake up just before hitting the ground (personally, I've had dreams 
<br>
where I only felt like I was falling, but not in the sense that I was 
<br>
plummeting to the ground).  Silly as it may seem, this is an intuitive 
<br>
way to many people to make themselves wake up from a dream (though I 
<br>
have never had a problem with waking up when I chose too, so I again 
<br>
defer to my knowledge of what other people have told me about their 
<br>
dreams).
