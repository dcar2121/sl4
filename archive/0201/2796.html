<em>&gt; &gt; I'll be deeply saddened if a majority or even a substantial minority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; six billion people choose to voluntarily die,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure why you'd be deeply saddened by this, Eli.  Your compassion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laudable, but I worry that it is accompanied by a certain lack of empathy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and understanding for world-views very different from your own.
</em><br>
<p>I think that perhaps we have different ideas of why empathy and
<br>
understanding are important.  When I see a hurt, I empathize with the
<br>
hurt, and I want to heal the hurt.  I don't say &quot;Gee, what a nice way to
<br>
be hurt, I wish I were hurt like that&quot;.  I don't believe in a cultural
<br>
relativism of pain.  I respect your right to make your own choices, even
<br>
wrong choices.  It doesn't make the choices any less wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't really harm the overall evolution of mind in the cosmos if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens.
</em><br>
<p>Really?  Well, maybe not; my species is too young for me to know that sort
<br>
of thing.  And I'm not going to make the inevitable comparisons to the
<br>
various bad guys of history and their excuses, because so far it sounds
<br>
like you're saying this out of genuine respect rather than callous
<br>
disregard.  But I think we do lose something.  And I think we still lose
<br>
something even if it's a death by choice.  Every human's death diminishes
<br>
me; voluntary deaths less than involuntary deaths, but still.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And is it *bad* for the people involved if it's their choice.  I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why, necessarily.
</em><br>
<p>Because they will die.  Because they will hurt.  Because they will
<br>
diminish with age instead of growing.  Because their deaths will be
<br>
meaningless, and utterly unnecessary.  Because they will have made the
<br>
wrong choice under their own moral premises, having refused the
<br>
intelligence needed to extrapolate those premises toward their true ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A life lived towards death is different than a life lived towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Each type of life has its own aesthetic integrity, in my view.
</em><br>
<p>We've been hurt for so long, and so unavoidably, that it's not suprising
<br>
that philosophies spring up that try to diminish the mental hurt by
<br>
providing plausible-sounding arguments for the &quot;necessity&quot; of various
<br>
gaping wounds in the world.  Those arguments are completely bogus and
<br>
would never have been invented in a world without those wounds.  And I see
<br>
your argument for the aesthetic integrity of death and pain as being one
<br>
of those bogus arguments.
<br>
<p>Nobody, in a world without hatred, would invent hatred for aesthetic
<br>
purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My wife does not wish to live forever -- she realizes it may well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but her choice will be to die &quot;naturally.&quot;  If I do manage to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially forever,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I hope and mostly believe will happen, then I'll sure as fuck miss her,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I won't feel sad for her.
</em><br>
<p>My first reaction was &quot;How can you possibly say this and say you love your
<br>
wife?&quot;  So I guess we really are speaking from fundamentally different
<br>
worldviews here.
<br>
<p>If the movie &quot;A.I.&quot; had one truthful lesson, it's that immortals shouldn't
<br>
fall in love with mortals.  I hope that your wife chooses to let herself
<br>
listen to the transhuman side of the story, because I believe that
<br>
transhumanity is the *correct* choice under the moral premises of
<br>
virtually everyone, and that anyone who chooses to listen to the truth,
<br>
possibly as explained by an (unbiased, non-manipulative) transhuman, will
<br>
choose immortality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we should accept that there is a strong psychological and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spiritual positive to this feeling of oneness with nature, and not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saddened by people whose lives are governed by this feeling, rather than by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate feeling (that you and I share) that the self is mostly the mind and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater individual intelligence is  a extremely important goal.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we share the same feelings at all.  My sadness on seeing a
<br>
voluntary death stems from a viewpoint that is closer to a &quot;feeling of
<br>
oneness&quot; than &quot;individualism&quot;.  I think the story of the universe gets a
<br>
little sadder whenever a mind ends, even voluntarily.
<br>
