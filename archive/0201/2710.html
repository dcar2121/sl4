<p>Yep, you're loony.  ;-)  This sort of thinking is my denial of choice 
<br>
when it comes to thinking about why I'm in love.  But, I'm fine with a 
<br>
little self denial when it is a useful tool.  I can find no evidence 
<br>
that free will exists, thus I think that it doesn't, but I'm perfectly 
<br>
fine with the self denial that I have such a thing since it keeps me 
<br>
thinking smoothly.  I just have to make sure that part of me is separate 
<br>
and knows when I'm in self denial and when I'm not.  Okay, so that means 
<br>
it's not *really* self denial, but it's working and that's good enough 
<br>
for me.  :-P
<br>
<p>Of course, just because I realize that some of this is self denial 
<br>
doesn't mean that I don't actually think like this.  I think Mr. Spock 
<br>
of Star Trek provides a good parallel to myself:  mostly rational, but 
<br>
can't help his human background.  As much as I want to be completely 
<br>
rational (I blame the OCD for this), it's not going to happen while I'm 
<br>
running on this brain.  And, even when I get smart, so to say, I may 
<br>
decide that it's best not to be completely rational.  Any way you look 
<br>
at it, it should be interesting.
<br>
<p>Finally, love is not just a complex issue, but a horribly complicated 
<br>
one.  In the past year and a half that I've been in love I have probably 
<br>
thought and rethought my theory of love 10 times or more.  Maybe in 
<br>
about five years I'll have something approaching a stable theory (I can 
<br>
keep it for about six months ;-)).  I think Sarah will just be happy not 
<br>
to have me scarring the shit out of her every other month.  ;-)  At 
<br>
least they keep getting more and more logically sound.
<br>
<p>Oh, just to pose the question, if a man offered you the marriage deal, 
<br>
Eli, would you take it?  This question is mostly to find out what is at 
<br>
the heart of the reasoning for this deal.  I'm just curious, though, not 
<br>
trolling.
