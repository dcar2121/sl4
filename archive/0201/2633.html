<p>
<em>&gt; If you look at chess playing computers, they beat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best humans when they had specialized hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was estimated to be 3% of a human brain in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total capacity.  The implication is that the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human players devote 3% of their brain to chess,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the rest to the usual stuff our brains do.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, though, we all know that &quot;total capacity&quot; means next to nothing
<br>
when comparing such totally different systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, I take a lower bound on 'when will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity happen' as when we have computers at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that capacity level available for specific tasks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like optimizing code and designing chips.
</em><br>
<p>But without some kind of advanced AI, no matter how fast future computers
<br>
are at carrying out specific aspects of chip design and code optimization,
<br>
the bottleneck is still going to be human thought and communication.
<br>
<p>Fast computers, unless they're also smart, aren't going to come up with
<br>
the next breakthrough in global program optimization, 3D chip design, or
<br>
whatever.  They're just going to solve hard technical problems within the
<br>
framework of each human-created breakthrough.  And then when (as
<br>
inevitably) the possible improvements achieved by *that* breakthrough have
<br>
been
<br>
exhausted, we're back to human brains for the next step.
<br>
<p>So, I don't believe that &quot;having programs fast enough to superintelligently
<br>
optimize
<br>
code and chips&quot; is going to launch the Singularity.  Even these seemingly
<br>
technical tasks rely heavily on general intelligence for their ongoing
<br>
progress.
<br>
<p>Yes, chess champion programs have been written without general intelligence.
<br>
But I think playing chess is more analogous to solving hard problems within
<br>
a given conceptual framework, than to inventing a new conceptual framework.
<br>
And Moore's Law and other related laws *do* rely on the invention, every few
<br>
years, of really new ways of looking at the relevant technical issues...
