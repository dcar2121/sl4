<em>&gt; However there seems to be an underlying premice, that a &quot;Big

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Ruling&quot; is such a strong word, and I confess that I always feel like I run
<br>
against limitations in the English language when trying to explain the
<br>
minimum degree of regulation that the preservation of the human race will
<br>
require.
<br>
<p>One way to look at a minimalist singleton SI like a Sysop is this:  A Sysop
<br>
is not interested in restricting or punishing the actions of would-be
<br>
murderers;  It is interested in protecting those who do not wish to be
<br>
murdered.  (Take this same reasoning and apply it to nanotech grey goo,
<br>
bioengineered super-plagues,
<br>
nuclear weapons, etc.)
<br>
<p>Would you be upset if your local police department were 100% efficient and
<br>
preventing violent crime and 0% corrupt in the use of this power?
<br>
<p>The reason so many people cringe at their first exposure to a concept like
<br>
Sysop is that they assume the system would for some reason abuse its ability
<br>
to completely protect those who desire protection.  Everyone on this list
<br>
would agree that giving any human this kind of power would be a mistake, but
<br>
assigning ulterior motives to a Sysop is anthropomorphism, and several
<br>
threads in the SL4 archives have already discussed it at length.  I think
<br>
March '01 was an especially good month for this topic.
<br>
<p>You may be asking a deeper philosophical question: &quot;Do I really want to live
<br>
in a world where murder is impossible?&quot;  I know people who feel that this
<br>
would strip away some valuable component of 'humanity', and I don't have a
<br>
good answer for them - my only response is that if the ability to carry out
<br>
murder is an essential element of humanity, then I look forward to becoming
<br>
something other than human.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also mentioned is the destruction of all natural habitat within which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human life could be sustained in favor of computonium... Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really so casually brush asside _ALL_ Life including people who disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;sysop&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>Of course I wouldn't, and a Sysop wouldn't either.  I said that computronium
<br>
could become the preferred state of matter, but where it is not there is no
<br>
reason to think that a Sysop would steal biospheres for the sake of
<br>
conversion.  The universe is a big place; There is plenty of room for
<br>
uploaded civilization without &quot;assimilating&quot; the Earth.  Please do not take
<br>
phrases like, &quot;Even if all the matter in the solar system were converted to
<br>
computronium. . .&quot; to mean &quot;The entire solar system should be converted to
<br>
computronium.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Simulations essay does not attempt to fully explain the Sysop
<br>
scenario -- I defer to Gordon Worley or Eliezer for more thorough outlines
<br>
of the concept.
