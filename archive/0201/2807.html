Sure, but not everyone has theories to finish, nor do they want to.  The
<br>
human race is not primarily composed of theorists or scientists.
<br>
<p>Some people like *who they are* and they see that uploading would transform
<br>
them into *someone/something very different* (even if one grants continuity
<br>
of consciousness).  They don't want to become so different.  They figure: If
<br>
I'm going to become a totally new kind of being, then why bother, why not
<br>
just let this &quot;me&quot; die and let there be *another* new being without any
<br>
continuity of consciousness from me.
<br>
<p>In the Buddhist view, the need for a human mind to have continuity of
<br>
consciousness with an upload it creates
<br>
is just a form of &quot;worldly attachment.&quot;  The view is that we should not be
<br>
so attached to our individual stream of consciousness, our personal self, so
<br>
as to feel the need to hold onto it in that way.
<br>
<p>I agree that the Buddhist view, like all world-views, is largely a product
<br>
of human reality which is full of death and suffering (and life and joy).
<br>
<p>But I also wonder: To my upload 10000 years from now, how much will it
<br>
matter that it had some kind of &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; with a meat
<br>
puppet named &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; way back in the flesh ages??

&nbsp;My nightmare scenario:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student 1: &quot;It's too bad Uncle Rob didn't live until they solved the
<br>
problems
<br>
of immortality.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student 2: &quot;Yeh, if only he could have held on for another 800 years. The
<br>
cure was just around the corner. Then he would have had plenty of time to
<br>
finish his theories.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student 1: &quot;Yep. Well, I have to get back to this report, it's due in 3
<br>
millennia, and I've barely started. It's about time I graduated, 5 million
<br>
years in school is just too long.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;800 years. Just another 800 years....
