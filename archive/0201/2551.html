<em>&gt; Unless the storage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes smarter / can understand the semantics of what is stored,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're always going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have a potential for metadata and data to be out of sync.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, but to be fully accurate the statement should be fuzzily
<br>
quantified, obviously.
<br>
<p>The degree of metadata/data asynchrony is going to be (roughly, perhaps
<br>
nonlinearly)proportional to the degree of understanding
<br>
embedded-in/attached-to the storage substrate
<br>
<p>Until you can identify the details of this proportionality, you can't show
<br>
that an incremental improvement in &quot;AI&quot; won't lead to a significant
<br>
improvement in data/metadata asynchrony
<br>
<p>I think this is where your intuition, Jeff, differs from that of those who
<br>
are really bullish on the Semantic Web.  Such as Sasha Chislenko, for
<br>
instance, my good friend who was really hyped on the idea.  He knew better
<br>
tech would be needed to make it work, but he thought that what in my view
<br>
constituted minor improvements (mostly to do with collaborative filtering)
<br>
would make a big difference.  I actually didn't agree with him; in
<br>
conversations with him I always took the anti-Semantic-Web view, or at any
<br>
rate the view that pretty big AI improvements (though not necessarily
<br>
human-level AI) would be needed to make it work.
<br>
<p>I should say, however, that Webmind Inc. made products that did automatic
<br>
markup of documents for some customers, and in many cases the products
<br>
worked quite well.  In some cases they didn't work so well.  So Sasha was
<br>
half right.  As simple examples of success, automatically marking up
<br>
document  by *topic area* can be gotten to work with 95%+ precision, and
<br>
automatically marking up *sentences* by topic area can be gotten to work
<br>
with 80% precision or so, assuming the sentences are grammatical (news
<br>
articles, not message board text...).  We could also automatically mark up
<br>
addresses, phone numbers, prices and so forth with 95%+ precision.  So a
<br>
part of the Semantic Web vision is certainly achievable right now, should
<br>
someone with appropriate power and $$ choose to commission the appropriate
<br>
people to write the appropriate software.
<br>
<p>This partial success could be seen as evidence that the nonlinear
<br>
proportionality mentioned above is not as severe as you're suggesting, Jeff.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest that information is stored / accessed / used in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structured way in biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there IS a lot of evidence that information is *used* and *stored*
<br>
in a structured way in the human mind.  However, the structures involved are
<br>
not the same as a simplistic semantic network.
<br>
<p>There is a lot of knowledge out there about the structure of different
<br>
memory subsystems, including episodic memory, declarative memory, memory of
<br>
physical actions taken, etc.  This knowledge doesn't come NEAR to a complete
<br>
theory of memory, and it's of dubious value for AI, but it certainly
<br>
demonstrates the existence of *memory structures*, i.e. of habitual patterns
<br>
of interrelatedness among &quot;memory traces&quot; in the brain (whatever precise
<br>
physical form they may take).
<br>
<p>At best the semantic network is an OK model of how the human brain stores
<br>
declarative memory.  In fact, the earliest semantic net models (Quillian et
<br>
al, in the mid-70's, was an early paper I remember -- no, I didn't read it
<br>
when it first came out, I wasn't quite *that* precocious of a
<br>
10-year-old...) were inspired by results on priming in human memory.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the Web and many document databases contain a lot of episodic
<br>
knowledge which is not well described by standard semantic net models at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>Also, the semantic net models out there are oversimplified in many important
<br>
ways.  They rarely contain adequate ways of specifying uncertain knowledge.
<br>
They don't do well with n-ary relationships, being tailored for binary ones.
<br>
They don't do well with describing processes.  Etc.
<br>
<p>So, in my view, the problem is not that &quot;natural intelligence&quot;'s memory has
<br>
no structure to it.  The problem is rather that this structure is vastly
<br>
more complex than the structure that the Semantic Web folks would like to
<br>
impose on it.  Taking a structure that models word priming experiments and
<br>
generalizing it to all human knowledge is a rather big leap, I would say.
<br>
<p>But a more advanced knowledge representation demands more advanced learning
<br>
mechanisms, so that accepting the oversimplicity of the semantic net
<br>
approach means accepting that building the Semantic Web adequately *really
<br>
is* an AI problem, and most Semantic Web boosters do not want to do that.
