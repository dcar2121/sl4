<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Perhaps that would work for a normative human.  Last time I checked,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I despite the norm.  But some characteristics of the opposite sex, or

<em>&gt; the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novelty and intelligence is nearly always good.
</em><br>
<p>Not to be rude, but this fascination with spiting the norm to spite it 
<br>
seems to be pretty adolescent behavior.  If I'm going to take on the 
<br>
world, I make sure that I've got a damn good reason first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;One thing that bugs me a bit in your reasoning is that you assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity is beyond a doubt the most important thing ever.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, but getting to the Singularity is part of the Singularity, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Singularity can be *very*, *very* fun.  So eventually we can all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ditch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our obsolete non-Singularitarian worldviews when the glory of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarian path becomes more clear, rapturous, and fun.  Of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be wrong.  What bugs you about this wordview, specifically?
</em><br>
<p>My problem with this kind of world view is that it makes you blind.  You 
<br>
have a hard time thinking outside the box.  You're so focused on 
<br>
reaching the Singularity that you may completely miss when some new idea 
<br>
X comes along that will achieve essentially the same results as the 
<br>
Singularity but in half the time.  For some time I have been involved 
<br>
with political activities and this is the kind of thinking that hurts 
<br>
the leaders of groups 90% of the time.  They have some ideal solution, a 
<br>
practical solution comes along, but they stick to the ideal solution and 
<br>
get no positive end results.  While I don't doubt that it is possible to 
<br>
be dedicated to the Singularity and be able to step back and consider 
<br>
the big picture, I get the impression that you don't do this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like what?  No matter what you do, it will help bring about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some way.   Microbes in an organic soup replicating have, in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental sense, the same &quot;purpose&quot; as human beings and our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts - to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve, to proceed to the End.  The &quot;End&quot; is the Singularity.  Not in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative way of course.  You might as well optimize your activities to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acheive the highest degree of Singularity-helpfulness now, because it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only get funner and more progressive as time goes on, leaving our more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mundane life&quot; behind in the dust.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I can't not have fun now.  It's a trade off between future fun 
<br>
and fun now.  I just have to assess the situation and see how much fun I 
<br>
should have now and how much I want to work to see in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Lots of different skills are needed and in the end I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may provide some key bit of info to reach the Singularity safely.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely, but wouldn't you rather supply more key info rather than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't care how much key info I supply.  If I supply none, then 
<br>
that's life.  But, if I've got the key info then I'll offer it up.  The 
<br>
thing is, I have no way of knowing what key info will be, so I work on 
<br>
things that interest me, learning a lot, and maybe it will be useful 
<br>
again some day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The universe wants you to acheive Singularity, I think.
</em><br>
<p>There's more in that statement than I care to deconstruct.  In short, 
<br>
you are assuming that the universe cares.  This is equivalent to saying 
<br>
`It's God's Will!'.  The universe is just where we live.
<br>
<p>Of course, this statement is accurate, after a fashion, given Alpha 
<br>
Lines and such.  ;-)
