<p>&lt;&lt;While the inclusion of &quot;I think&quot; proves that your ego is better
<br>
restrained than Elizer's, you must always remember that all ethics are
<br>
relative. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Actually, this list is where I restrain my ego the most!  ;D  Why make 
<br>
unconstructive quips about Eliezer's ego?  Doesn't anyone respect him for 
<br>
what he is doing, what he has done, and what he has wrote?  Goodness!
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt; particles, all genes, all living things, all rocks, on many subsequent
<br>
<em>&gt; levels and all over the place) is int! egrated into the Final Pattern.
</em><br>
How is this different/better than a gaia spirituality?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It could very well be the way the universe works.  This presumption is based 
<br>
on extrapolations of current and past trends, ie life engulfing the surface 
<br>
of most of the planet in a beautiful order.  I have no past in gaia 
<br>
spirituality/mysticism and don't hold any views not based on rationalism.  
<br>
The rationalism of my own limited mind, of course.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Faith is dangerous -- ALWAYS.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Faith in technology?  Faith in intellect?  Faith in ethics?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; &gt; create an environment for us that will lead to the greatest possible 
<br>
<em>&gt; growth/enlightenment/happiness/fullfillment/intelligence/etc,
</em><br>
We appear to already be in that environment. Our challenge lies with
<br>
improving ourselves not crawling into a box with lots of blinking LEDs.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Oh my.  Improving ourselves is transcending onto another level of 
<br>
implementation.  Your &quot;box with blinking LEDs&quot; is a wonderful example of a 
<br>
stereotype of uploading, however.  You could be in a &quot;box with blinking LEDs&quot; 
<br>
right now, and not know it, if the LEDs were complex enough.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;That sounds very authoritarian. Please be clear about where you stand on
<br>
the political spectrum. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I'm a radical libertarian, if you must put me into some political 
<br>
classification.  The Singularity is &quot;arch-anarchy&quot;, freedom from all possible 
<br>
restraints, including those of the laws of physics (when within a simulation, 
<br>
for sure).  The &quot;Sysop&quot; will not restrain us but rather guide us and help us, 
<br>
putting in necessary guidelines for a smoothly functioning Omega State.  I 
<br>
dislike this word &quot;Sysop&quot;.  It conjures up images of Matrix-y manipulative 
<br>
AIs.  From now on, I will refer to the &quot;Sysop&quot; concept as the &quot;Singularity 
<br>
Transsentience&quot;, I think that might have a much better connotation.  Yez.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;An AI can do many things. But that alone has never been nor ever will be
<br>
at all connected with what is right, proper, and just.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>...no comment.
<br>
<p>That's all folks!  =D
