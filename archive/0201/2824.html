<em>&gt; I'll be deeply saddened if a majority or even a substantial minority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six billion people choose to voluntarily die,
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure why you'd be deeply saddened by this, Eli.  Your compassion is
<br>
laudable, but I worry that it is accompanied by a certain lack of empathy
<br>
and understanding for world-views very different from your own.
<br>
<p>It doesn't really harm the overall evolution of mind in the cosmos if this
<br>
happens.
<br>
And is it *bad* for the people involved if it's their choice.  I don't see
<br>
why, necessarily.
<br>
<p>A life lived towards death is different than a life lived towards
<br>
immortality.
<br>
Each type of life has its own aesthetic integrity, in my view.
<br>
<p>My wife does not wish to live forever -- she realizes it may well be
<br>
possible,
<br>
but her choice will be to die &quot;naturally.&quot;  If I do manage to live
<br>
essentially forever,
<br>
as I hope and mostly believe will happen, then I'll sure as fuck  miss her,
<br>
but I won't feel sad for her.  This is her own choice and her own method for
<br>
structuring her life and her psyche.  I'm sure this aspect of her mind is
<br>
all wrapped up with many other aspects that I find quite wonderful and
<br>
delightful.
<br>
<p>There is a oneness with nature that some people feel, which leads them to
<br>
feel
<br>
the &quot;right&quot; thing is to die a natural death.  This same oneness with nature
<br>
makes
<br>
these same people very uncomfortable with the idea of themselves personally
<br>
uploading.
<br>
<p>I think we should accept that there is a strong psychological and
<br>
spiritual positive to this feeling of oneness with nature, and not be
<br>
saddened
<br>
by people whose lives are governed by this feeling, rather than by the
<br>
alternate
<br>
feeling (that you and I share) that the self is mostly the mind and greater
<br>
individual
<br>
intelligence is  a extremely important goal.
<br>
<p>I am pissed by people who want to stop ME from uploading -- it's none of
<br>
their damn
<br>
business.  But if some people feel themselves part and parcel of the
<br>
biosphere and prefer
<br>
to remain that way for their whole lives, even if it means losing their
<br>
consciousness
<br>
permanently and merging their cells back into the biosphere, that's cool
<br>
with me.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
