Hi,
<br>
<p>I think we largely agree conceptually, we just differ on estimates of
<br>
various quantitative amounts (*how much* improvement can be achieved through
<br>
groupware and non-AI search tools, *how hard* will it be to get to real AI
<br>
without substantially improved such tools, etc.)...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My first little paper on this subject (&quot;Paths to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity,&quot; 1996) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost, darn it. At the time, I thought that we needed new peripherals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I changed my mind shortly thereafter. A good computer display can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present information as fast as a human can accept it, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joystick/game controller can accept decisions as fast as a human can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convey them: If you don't believe this, watch a kid playing a video
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game. We would all like to believe we think faster than this, but we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't. In any event I don't think the human/computer interface is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important constraint on the human/computer SI. It's a software problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly in the data presentation.
</em><br>
<p>If I believe you on this, then I'm going to downgrade my estimate of how far
<br>
SI can be pushed via collaborative technologies.
<br>
<p>Because I still suspect there's a pretty low upper limit on how deep
<br>
collaboration can be made via current tech.
<br>
<p>The best we're going to get without very good AI or radical new interfaces,
<br>
in my view, is:
<br>
<p>1) conferencing tech that lets globally distributed teams work as if they
<br>
were local
<br>
<p>2) collaborative-filtering-enhanced search tech that does a better job of
<br>
returning info you want, not based on understanding of content, but based on
<br>
clever use of ratings and user info, together with minimal non-AI
<br>
understanding of content...
<br>
<p>I hope I'm pleasantly surprised...
<br>
<p>I'm thinking quite practically &amp; personally about the tech we're
<br>
discussing...
<br>
<p>Personally I would love to see 1) come about, especially if it worked on the
<br>
narrow pipe to Brazil, since that's where most of my collaborators are.  But
<br>
I don't believe 1) would double the efficiency of my globally distributed
<br>
team.  A factor of 1.5  in productivity would be my guess (of course, we're
<br>
very productive already..).  As for 2), I'm not sure how useful it would be
<br>
for obscure topics; I think the main win would be in presenting popular
<br>
topics to new audiences (e.g. I'm a CS guy who wants to learn about genetic
<br>
regulatory networks  -- where have other CS guys looked before when wanting
<br>
to learn about such things?).  At this point we don't do that much library
<br>
or Net research for our work, so this would speed up our process by an even
<br>
smaller factor....
<br>
<p>Another point is that 1) would make it easier to recruit new people to the
<br>
team....
<br>
<p>All in all I'm feeling maybe a 2x increase in productivity due to advances
<br>
in groupware and search and related technology, for the specific &quot;real AI&quot;
<br>
oriented work I'm involved in.  Of course, the increase in productivity
<br>
could be far greater for people working in different domains, e.g. domains
<br>
focused on looking up the research of others, or contacting others widely.
<br>
Our work is based on a team of people with a common idea working closely
<br>
together... we already understand each other about as well as can be done
<br>
without looking into each others' brains... and we use collaborative tools
<br>
(e-mail, phone, CVS, documents with particular naming conventions, etc.)
<br>
that we all are comfortable with.  Could things be improved?  Yeah, of
<br>
course....  But a factor of 10??  I dunno...
