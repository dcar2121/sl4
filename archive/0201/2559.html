<p>Well, you, as an augmented upload, could go on to create a Friendly AI, an
<br>
intelligent substrate scenario, or whatever.  I don't really think of
<br>
Friendly AI as being in opposition to uploading.  Uploading has a
<br>
different set of implicit dangers than FAI but the dangers aren't
<br>
necessarily worse, and if an upload can make it past the dangers (both
<br>
moral, and cognitive) then there's no reason why an upload-originating SI
<br>
couldn't fill the role of Transition Guide.  For me the strategic scenario
<br>
amounts to [Friendly AI || uploading] versus [a repeat of 9.11 with
<br>
military nanotech || repeat of the anthrax scare with weapons-grade AIDS
<br>
that can be transmitted by mosquitoes].  If you phoned me right now and
<br>
said there was an uploading device in front of you but you had to decide
<br>
whether to get in within the next five seconds, I'd tell you to climb in,
<br>
and hope you got the rest right.  It's just that uploading is a lot
<br>
*harder*, technologically, than AI; in terms of both computing capacity
<br>
and knowledge of cognitive science it is twenty years post-AI.
