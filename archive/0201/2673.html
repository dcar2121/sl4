<em>&gt; 1. &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; country&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; JFK, roughly quoted, same sentiment, different country. Being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bad guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Hitler) doesn't contaminate every word that ever came out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your mouth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To the extent that he belived the mass of people should be able to oppress
<br>
an individual, he would be just as guilty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and masters. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intends to be the master.&quot; (Ayn Rand)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Probably everyone on this list has read Ayn Rand, and most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably read just about all of her material. Then we took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn from it, and moved on, incorporating it into our meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what I did. I learned a lot from Rand's writing but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticed a key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing: She forgot that &quot;no man is an island&quot;. Howard Roark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and John Galt are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman in their abilities (not to mention their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companions), but readers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually pay that no mind, enamored of the books as they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of prime importance to realize that.
</em><br>
<p>I dont take Objectivism as the gosple from St. Rand, I personally hate the
<br>
cult of personality that Objectivism has become and I think it sets back
<br>
objective philosophy years. Her style of writing was a romantic style,
<br>
showing men not as they are, but as they could be. This is the same reason
<br>
that action movies are so popular. Superheros are very common in movies,
<br>
books, and all forms of entertainment. It was hardly a breach of character
<br>
on Rand's part to create them too. What you may have missed from the stories
<br>
is the most selfish characters actually caused the greatest leap in the
<br>
standard of lifestyle for man. Im not going into the contributions made to
<br>
humanity by capitalists, it should be self evident and would take an
<br>
enourmous act of deliberate evasion to blank out all the good done by them
<br>
(I can offer the increased lifespan as a start, but let me know if we need
<br>
to go into personal empowerment like cars, medicine, entertainment, etc...).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is the reason that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief system should NOT be set on a foundation of Rand's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply too extreme, putting principles before practicality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gabe
</em><br>
<p>So a philosophy of extreme moderation is the answer? Or can I invalidate a
<br>
philosophy too simply by throwing the term &quot;extreme&quot; at it? Whats wrong with
<br>
extreme? I want my family to be extremely happy, healthy, and wealthy. I
<br>
want my food extreamly free of poison, not just moderately. Extreme is
<br>
simply a measurment, not inherantly evil. Dropping the context for what your
<br>
discussing, and calling it evil simply because of its measument can get you
<br>
in trouble. What if your spouse asked you if you were extremly in love with
<br>
them? You know what your answer better be unless you want to be sleeping on
<br>
the couch.
<br>
<p>Im just saying that because you disagree with a few things Rand said (as do
<br>
I), dont throw out the baby with the bath water.
<br>
