</em><br>
<em>&gt; A fun read. Thanks Michael. Anyone on this mailing list fit the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description, if only in spirit, of an SL5'er?
</em><br>
<p>What is this strange fascination that the word &quot;SL5&quot; seems to exert over
<br>
people?  Why do so many people, confronted with SL0 through SL4, feel this
<br>
impulse to top it by coming up with SL5?  Oh, never mind.  Anyway...
<br>
<p>To be a Singularitarian, or even just a good-old-fashioned transhumanist,
<br>
is to tap into some very powerful ideas.  It is an unfortunate but true
<br>
fact that humans tend to malfunction in the presence of powerful ideas, so
<br>
if you want to incorporate powerful ideas and remain rational, those ideas
<br>
have to be balanced by self-awareness and mental discipline.  At the core,
<br>
all of this is about *intelligence*.  Intelligence is more important than
<br>
fanaticism.  You can only permit yourself that degree of fanaticism that
<br>
does not, at your current level of mental discipline, interfere with your
<br>
intelligence.  An extreme effort in the service of a counterproductive
<br>
goal is worse than nothing.
<br>
<p>The absolute primacy of rationality and intelligence is what must be
<br>
preserved, above all, as Singularitarian ideas begin to reach out beyond
<br>
the core audience of scientifically literate aggressive rationalists. 
<br>
Compromise that in the name of &quot;recruiting&quot; and the reins will simply be
<br>
torn out of your hands by the people you tried to recruit.  It has
<br>
happened before and may happen to us even if we do everything *right*; we
<br>
cannot afford to make deliberate compromises.
<br>
<p>The powerful ideas have to be coupled to equally powerful drives toward
<br>
rationality, or the actual *goal* isn't going to get done.  And I do not,
<br>
by the way, believe in the model of a few rational people remaining sane
<br>
in order to provide the strategic direction for a larger group of insane
<br>
fanatics; I am not aware of any historical instance of this model
<br>
working.  Everything I know about human nature says that the insane
<br>
fanatics would drop the rationalists like a rotting moose carcass and
<br>
promote the most insane of their number.  Rationality has to be for
<br>
*everyone*, the whole membership; if you recruit someone that is not a
<br>
scientifically literate aggressive rationalist, then you have to make sure
<br>
that your literature tells people &quot;We think rationality is good... try and
<br>
make yourself more rational.&quot;  You have to preserve the part of the
<br>
message that says:  &quot;Unlike other ideas, Singularitarianism doesn't say
<br>
it's a sin to be skeptical or to question the leaders.&quot;  Because while
<br>
some people may take this for granted, everyone else may not.
<br>
<p>Now I am an extremist, by anyone's standard, and I know it.  I make no
<br>
excuses about having devoted my life completely to the Singularity; I have
<br>
done so, I admit it, I'm proud of it, and I'd do it again in a minute. 
<br>
The six billion lives that I *know* are at stake, to say nothing of all
<br>
the future lives that may someday come to be, outweigh my own life by an
<br>
indescribably enormous factor.  I do acknowledge that I need to have fun
<br>
every now and then in order to stay in mental shape, but this is not the
<br>
same as living a &quot;normal&quot; life in which fun is pursued for its own sake. 
<br>
And it may be that fun pursued for the sake of efficiency is not as much
<br>
fun as fun which is pursued for its own sake.  It may even be that this
<br>
makes me less efficient.  *But*, and this is the key point, to pursue fun
<br>
for its own sake I'd have to change my actual picture of the world, and
<br>
I'm not willing to do that because it would compromise *rationality*.  I
<br>
will not compromise rationality even if it makes my life more efficient! 
<br>
If I keep to the rational course, then eventually I expect to discover
<br>
some way to have utilitarian fun that is just as healthy as intrinsic
<br>
fun.  I'm not going to lie to myself, because that would cut off the
<br>
possibility of future progress, even if it delivered a small (or a large)
<br>
short-term benefit.  If you're going to be a good fanatic, then you have
<br>
to remember that good fanaticism is just a very intense effort, and effort
<br>
has no intrinsic worth.  Dedication proves nothing.  It has no value on
<br>
its own.  It is nothing to be proud of.  It is useful only insofar as it
<br>
achieves the actual goals, and to compromise rationality removes the
<br>
possibility of achieving those goals.  Now I do think that complete
<br>
dedication is, in fact, very useful, and for that reason I am completely
<br>
dedicated, but &quot;dedication&quot; is not the point.  It's not something to be
<br>
proud of for its own sake.
<br>
<p>If you're going to be a Singularitarian fanatic, then you have to remember
<br>
that the Singularity is more important than your own fanaticism.  I expect
<br>
this sounds obvious to most of us, but it is not, in fact, obvious.  The
<br>
vast majority of fanatics talk and act as if fanaticism is inherently a
<br>
sign of moral worth.  The vast majority of fanatics do not know how to
<br>
safely handle this mental plutonium in order to use it as fuel, which is
<br>
why extremism, even extremism in altruism, has such a lousy reputation
<br>
among rationalists.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Unlike most other aggressive rationalists, I don't think that extremism is
<br>
bad, I just think it has to be handled carefully.  But if you *don't know*
<br>
how to do that, then you really would be better off distrusting your own
<br>
passion, even if it means less mental energy and getting less work done. 
<br>
You can always come back to the problem later, when you have a little more
<br>
practice at rationality.
<br>
<p>If you're going to be an extremist, you have to be aware of the forces
<br>
underlying human nature.  And you have to dodge them, successfully, even
<br>
at the price of diminishing your own extremism if that's what it takes.
<br>
<p>At this time, and from the &quot;Shock Level Analysis&quot; page, I don't think
<br>
Michael Anissimov dodged successfully.  There are some obvious PR
<br>
problems, but PR problems generally go away with sufficient writing
<br>
experience.  The main thing that I think represents a real problem is the
<br>
&quot;us vs. them&quot; mindset - what I usually call the &quot;group polarization&quot;
<br>
dynamic, the tribalism instincts from evolutionary psychology.
<br>
<p>People are not divided into groups by future shock level.  At most, you
<br>
can use FSL to divide your readers into audiences.  You should not use it
<br>
to divide humanity into tribes, place your own tribe at the top, and heap
<br>
hatred on the rest.  That'd be too... human.  Seriously.  The original
<br>
&quot;Future Shock&quot; essay I wrote contains an explicit admonishment against
<br>
dividing people into feuding tribes by FSL, and this is exactly why;
<br>
because I know something about how human psychology works, and I know that
<br>
if I establish an ascending scale that could theoretically be applied to
<br>
people, even if it's meant to be applied only to audiences in a specific
<br>
context, then people are going to see a social hierarchy, and they're
<br>
going to try and place themselves at the top.  (Hence all the attempts to
<br>
top the scale with SL5, of course.)
<br>
<p>For example, let's take Anissimov's description of SL -1 and SL -2. 
<br>
There's some pretty darned hateful language in there, which I will avoid
<br>
quoting permanently in the SL4 archives, in case Anissimov decides to
<br>
change it.  The point is:  Why hate?  What does it accomplish?  What good
<br>
does it do?  It sure doesn't help you outthink an opponent.  It is
<br>
instinctive to hate, and it may even be politically useful to the
<br>
individual to whip up hate against opponents (it worked for McCarthy), but
<br>
the point is that it doesn't accomplish anything useful in terms of the
<br>
actual *goal*.
<br>
<p>I wrote the original Shock Level essay very carefully in order to
<br>
establish that I was not establishing a new social hierarchy and putting
<br>
myself at the top.  That would be stupid, boring, and very human, and is
<br>
unworthy of anyone with the slightest smattering of evolutionary
<br>
psychology.  And now, not to mince words about it, someone has gone out
<br>
and done *exactly this* and it looks every bit as awful as I thought it
<br>
would.
<br>
<p>The Singularity needs more people who are willing to dedicate themselves
<br>
completely and to hell with the usual reserve; with this I agree.  But you
<br>
can't just take that dedication and not take the other things that go
<br>
along with it and keep it rational.
