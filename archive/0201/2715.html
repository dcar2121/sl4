<em>&gt;&gt;Note that, by the same logic, it is possible to experience certain kinds

of fun in VR that might be thought impossible in a transhuman world; for
<br>
example, reliving episodes of (for the sake of argument) The X-Files in
<br>
which Scully (Mulder) gets to save the life of Mulder (Scully), even though
<br>
only the main character (you) is real and all other entities are simply
<br>
puppets of an assisting AI.  The usual suggestion is to obliterate the
<br>
memories of it all being a simulation, but this begs the question of whether
<br>
&quot;you&quot; with your memories obliterated is the same entity for purposes of
<br>
informed consent - if Scully (you) is having an unpleasant moment, not
<br>
knowing it to be simulated, wouldn't the rules of individual volition take
<br>
over and bring her up out of the simulation?&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><p>I think this also begs the question of whether an obliterated memory would
<br>
make the experience any more entertaining anyway.  I say this considering
<br>
the fact that humans have for decades been quite entertained by video games
<br>
that simulate artificial environments -- and this despite having intact
<br>
memories and mental hardware many orders of magnitude more powerful than the
<br>
system running the game.  Controlling a Mulder puppet may be, to a
<br>
transhuman, the equivalent of playing Pong. . . but hey, some people really
<br>
enjoyed Pong.
<br>
<p>One feature that almost universally enhances the fun factor of any kind of
<br>
game is an intelligent (even sentient) teammate or adversary.  It is not
<br>
inconcievable that even a hyperintelligent, pandimensional being might enjoy
<br>
a game of chess if matched up against a comparable oponent.
<br>
<p>I think we can trust that transhumans will be able to keep transhumans
<br>
entertained.
