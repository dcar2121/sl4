&lt; I think that making the S-meme widespread would harm your work more than 
<br>
help it. &gt;
<br>
<p>There seems to be a tacit acceptance here (in this discussion) that we have 
<br>
some control over whether the Singularity meme 'escapes' its currently 
<br>
limited adoption. (If I am wrong about that, sorry ;-) it doesn't change 
<br>
what I am going to say next) I think we have no chance of limiting the 
<br>
spread of the meme.  Zero!  Once an idea is 'out', it has a life of its own.
<br>
<p>Item 1: We may be able to help _mould_ the Singularity meme into something 
<br>
more (or less) palatable to the general public.
<br>
<p>Item 2: We may be able to help _speed_ the spreading of the Singularity 
<br>
meme.
<br>
<p>The meme has been launched - unlaunching is not possible. I could cite 
<br>
dozens of historical examples of ideas whose time had come (and authority's 
<br>
attempts to suppress them :-/) but I'm sure we all can think of many by 
<br>
ourselves.  We are powerless to put the jini back in the bottle.  Therefore, 
<br>
IMO it is very important to discuss whether we should expend energy doing 
<br>
items 1 and/or 2, and if so: what?
<br>
<p>My current position on item 1 is: We have an inescapable obligation to mould 
<br>
the (public) meme into something i) acceptable to the maximum number of 
<br>
people possible, ii) easily understood,  iii) not frightening.  My intent 
<br>
here would be to reduce alienation, mental dislocation, and knee-jerk 
<br>
reactions - so that fewer people will get hurt [ killed? =( ] when the 
<br>
singularity becomes the #1 public and political issue.
<br>
<p>My current position in item 2 is: Speeding the spread of the meme is 
<br>
unecessary, and possibly counterproductive.  My reasoning for this is that I 
<br>
percieve the 'western headspace' to be heading in the direction of increase 
<br>
acceptence of technology, and increased integration of computers into 
<br>
everyday life.  The younger generations have been growing up with powerful 
<br>
computers, VR games, mainstream SF (even on TV) portraying 
<br>
'singularity-relavent' issues.  The more time that goes by, the more 
<br>
inevitable a Singularity will seem, even to the entertainment-anesthetized 
<br>
masses.
<br>
<p>--&gt; very interested in hearing SL4 opinions on both item 1 and 2, as I am 
<br>
always willing to revise my opinions based on better data/reasoning.
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames.
