<p>Paths to the Singularity
<br>
Daniel G. Clemmensen
<br>
version 1. 243 
<br>
Last updated 20 April 96	 
<br>
<p>This document represents my thoughts on an upcoming event known as the
<br>
&quot;singularity&quot;, and the events leading up to it. I will attempt to define
<br>
the singularity, and then describe the various ways it could come about. I
<br>
will also attempt to show that a particular class of scenarios is more
<br>
likely than other possibilities. 
<br>
<p>The Singularity 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;singularity&quot; comes from mathematics. It is a point on a
<br>
function space where the function ceases to have meaning, usually because
<br>
the function tends to infinity as it approaches the point. For example,
<br>
F(x)=1/x has a singularity at x=0. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt to mathematically model human technical progress in time
<br>
shows an increase in the rate of progress with time, at least since the
<br>
Renaissance. There are more people to contribute to this progress, and each
<br>
person can contribute more, because we need to spend less time on
<br>
necessities. In addition, as we progress we develop tools that help us make
<br>
further progress. This feedback seems to occasionally cross thresholds that
<br>
increase the rate of progress even more. Two examples are the printing
<br>
press/moveable type and the computer. Between thresholds, the basic driving
<br>
mechanisms cause the mathematical model to be an exponential with time.
<br>
Each threshold appears mathematically as an increase in the mantissa. This
<br>
is intended as an analogy, not as a rigorous or even a non-rigorous
<br>
mathematical model! 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technological singularity will occur at some point in the near future
<br>
when we cross one of these thresholds. This threshold differs qualitatively
<br>
from the previous ones, because it will enable us to begin generating the
<br>
equivalent of more thresholds in very rapid succession. The curve will
<br>
change from an exponential to a hyper-exponential. This not actually a
<br>
mathematical singularity, but the rate of progress will become so fast over
<br>
such a short amount of time that there is no effective difference. Within a
<br>
short time, everything that can be known, will be known, and anything that
<br>
is possible within the laws of physics will be achievable. 
<br>
<p>Beyond the Singularity 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much speculation about events after the singularity. I'm
<br>
not willing to speculate on that epoch, because I feel that the singularity
<br>
will result in an entity or culture (call it S) which is completely beyond
<br>
our current comprehension. Since S can achieve any goal that is consistent
<br>
with the laws of physics, and since S will understand the laws of physics,
<br>
and since S can know anything that is knowable, we cannot predict its
<br>
actions without understanding its motives. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, S may decide that it needs to maximize its computational
<br>
power. To this end it may elect to convert the Sun into a neutron star so
<br>
that it can use neutron-based hardware instead of atom-based hardware.
<br>
Neutron-based hardware is likely to be intrinsically faster, and is also
<br>
faster because it's denser, thus reducing the speed-of-light delays.
<br>
Overall, a computer the mass of the sun is likely to operate six to nine
<br>
orders of magnitude faster as neutronium than as atoms. 
<br>
<p>Possible Threshold Technologies 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have speculated on the singularity have considered several
<br>
interesting scenarios. Some of them are discussed here. It's important to
<br>
remember that any one of these technologies could precipitate the
<br>
singularity. When the singularity occurs and brings S into existence, S can
<br>
then decide to immediately implement any or all of the other technologies.
<br>
If S elects to retain humanity and if S elects to remain covert at least
<br>
initially, it will appear to the humans that all of these technologies came
<br>
to fruition at the same time. 
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some, Nanotechnology is the field of the fabrication of ultra-small
<br>
structures. However, This definition is too broad for this discussion. I'm
<br>
interested here in &quot;real&quot; Drexler-style nanotechnology. This is the study
<br>
and practice of building machinery with atomic precision. The critical
<br>
threshold in this field is the &quot;assembler.&quot; An assembler is a nanotech
<br>
device that can build other nanotech devices. Once the first assembler is
<br>
built, it can be directed to build additional assemblers to start a
<br>
geometric progression. This will result in the availability of as many
<br>
assemblers as desired in a very short time. The assemblers can then be
<br>
directed to build essentially anything that can be designed. In particular,
<br>
this will allow computing and communications capacity to be built nearly
<br>
instantaneously. It will probably also allow computers to be built using
<br>
nanotechlological components, but this isn't necessary to reach the
<br>
singularity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotechnology could be used to create machinery to support any of the
<br>
other technologies of the singularity, such as gene probes, neural
<br>
interfaces, or AI computers. However, I believe that if the assembler
<br>
precipitates the singularity it will do so by massive increase in computing
<br>
power before it does so otherwise. 
<br>
<p>Genetic Engineering 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have speculated that humanity will modify itself to create
<br>
super-humanity. The result will be people with greatly increased mental
<br>
capacities. I don't personally see how this can be done quickly. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative is to use genetic engineering to create a &quot;wet computer&quot;
<br>
of massive capacity. 
<br>
<p>Neural Implants 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to achieve superior intelligence would be to link computers
<br>
and people via neural implants. The assumption is that the brain has
<br>
untapped potential, needing only a better communications path than is
<br>
currently available. I regard this assumption as unproven. 
<br>
<p>Artificial Intelligence 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research in AI has a long and complex history. The idea is that we can
<br>
eventually figure out how humans think, and then build algorithms that do
<br>
the same thing. Once we build the program, the program will then be able to
<br>
reason and achieve goals as humans do. Traditional AI research is based on
<br>
&quot;conceptual modeling&quot;, and has been disappointing. Newer research efforts
<br>
include the bottom-up &quot;reflex&quot; approach, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and
<br>
genetic algorithms. Any or all of these, or any mix of these, could lead to
<br>
super intelligence and the singularity. 
<br>
<p>The Most Likely Path 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the singularity will occur when a technology-based entity
<br>
comes into existence that is modestly more intelligent than the most
<br>
intelligent human, with &quot;intelligence&quot; defined as &quot;technical creativity.&quot;
<br>
Since this entity is technology-based and technically creative, it can
<br>
immediately increase its own capabilities in a rapid feedback loop. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the intelligence of the first such entity is likely to
<br>
depend on software running on computers in the internet. After the entity
<br>
comes into existence, it can rewrite its software to rapidly increase its
<br>
effective intelligence. This phase of the entity's intelligence growth will
<br>
end when it has completely optimized its use of all the computer resources
<br>
it has available to it. This will probably be all of the computers on the
<br>
internet. This will occur within a few hours at most. For purposes of this
<br>
paper call this entity the &quot;&gt;Web&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next growth phase is difficult to predict, because the entity's
<br>
intelligence will at that point already be so high. From a human
<br>
perspective, the entity may consider itself hampered by a lack of physical
<br>
control of matter. The entity can rapidly fix this by acquiring a
<br>
controlling interest in the appropriate corporations. It can then send
<br>
specifications for new automated machine tools to be manufactured, and then
<br>
use these tools directly to build more tools. It can also order more
<br>
computing capacity to be built and added to the web. If this phase were
<br>
being orchestrated by a human-level intelligence, it would take at least a
<br>
few days and at most three weeks. However, the entity may be smart enough
<br>
to accomplish this in hours. For example, since the entity has access to
<br>
all publicly-available computerized information, it may be able to
<br>
determine which companies have the best equipment as a basis, which
<br>
companies are hungry enough to take orders for immediate execution, or
<br>
which are ripe for a corporate takeover. This phase is over when the entity
<br>
has sufficient direct control of machinery to accomplish the next phase. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next growth phase is impossible to predict. As an example, the entity
<br>
can either build nanotech assemblers directly using the machinery acquired
<br>
during the prior phase, or it can use that machinery to build the machinery
<br>
it needs and then build nanotech assemblers. To me, this means that the
<br>
entity's growth in intelligence and production capacity is now literally
<br>
beyond human comprehension. 
<br>
<p>Collaborative Technology 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the &gt;Web will consist of a collaboration among a computer
<br>
system and one or more humans. I believe that this is more likely to
<br>
quickly produce a higher level of creative technical intelligence than is a
<br>
computer-only approach. I feel that we can have the human supply the
<br>
capabilities that computers don't yet have, and the computer can supply
<br>
capabilities that humans handle less well. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle advantage of the collaborative approach is that it doesn't
<br>
require any conceptual breakthroughs in the fields of cognition or
<br>
neuroscience. Further, the technologies of collaboration all have immediate
<br>
practical application, and can be developed incrementally. By contrast, it
<br>
appears to an outsider that AI research is almost entirely academic, and
<br>
that some major gaps must be filled before computer-only intelligence is
<br>
achievable. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collaborative approach requires a division of responsibilities
<br>
between computer and human. The division is practical and requires no deep
<br>
theoretical underpinning. The humans can supply goal-setting, pattern
<br>
recognition, and decision making. The computer can supply storage and
<br>
retrieval, brute correlation and calculation, and data presentation. 
<br>
<p>The Interface 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human-computer interface that will precipitate the singularity
<br>
consists of hardware and software. Today's hardware probably suffices, but
<br>
new software is needed. By the time the software is developed the hardware
<br>
will have progressed, but this isn't strictly necessary. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer-to-human interface must present information to the human at
<br>
high bandwidth in a way that allows the human to handle it in a natural
<br>
way. I believe that the human visual system is already well suited to this
<br>
task. The computer must synthesize a moving picture of the information. Two
<br>
examples of this are flight simulation video games (like Fury 3) and
<br>
labyrinth video games (like Doom) In each case the computer presents
<br>
information as fast as the human can assimilate it. Existing CRT and VR
<br>
implementations of the hardware are probably adequate to precipitate the
<br>
singularity, given the right software. However, we will probably see
<br>
further refinements of this hardware before the singularity. I believe that
<br>
the hardware will progress to a &quot;head-up display&quot; with a form factor
<br>
similar to eyeglasses, permitting the user to wear the display continuously
<br>
and inconspicuously. The computer-to-human interface hardware will also
<br>
include speakers and/or hearing-aid-style in-the-ear speakers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human-to-computer hardware can be a joystick and a microphone. The human
<br>
will be responsible for decision-making and high-level pattern recognition,
<br>
not for high-volume data generation. I believe that a joystick and
<br>
microphone are capable of conveying decisions as fast as a human can make
<br>
them, and at least fast enough to precipitate the singularity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The software is the hard part. It must convert the data into a picture
<br>
that makes sense according to some set of rules. Of course, it can ask the
<br>
human to make decisions about the form in which to present the data. The
<br>
picture must also be consistent with the decision-making inputs from the
<br>
joystick. 
<br>
<p>Current Software 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of existing software will serve as part of the basis for S.
<br>
This includes operating systems and data communications software of the
<br>
internet and its attached hosts. In addition, existing software in the
<br>
fields of decision support, development tools, and video presentation will
<br>
need to be enhanced by humans prior to the singularity to &quot;create&quot; the
<br>
initial &gt;Web. 
<br>
<p>Software Development Tools 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many. Since the &gt;Web's ability to create new and more efficient
<br>
software to increase its abilities is a key element in the feedback of the
<br>
singularity, enhanced software development tools are a major determinant in
<br>
the rate of increase. They are also important because they shorten the time
<br>
until the singularity. Better software development tools are the most
<br>
cost-effective investment to decreasing the time to the singularity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance monitoring tools may permit the &gt;Web to rapidly increase its
<br>
intelligence once the initial threshold is crossed. These tools can
<br>
identify the parts of the software that are being used the most and which
<br>
are therefore good candidates for performance improvement.
<br>
<p>Decision Support 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know a whole lot about this area. A search on Alta Vista shows a
<br>
great deal of activity in university departments. There are several
<br>
commercial software packages available. The existing research and software
<br>
seem to be oriented toward assisting the decision making process for a
<br>
group of humans, but this is a likely basis for a heavier involvement by
<br>
the computer. 
<br>
<p>Video Presentation 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information will be presented to humans via the eyes. The human neural
<br>
system is accustomed to operating on binocular inputs to visualize a
<br>
three-dimensional space that can change in time, so I feel that this is the
<br>
most natural way to represent the data. Stereo sound is a natural addition
<br>
to this. Thus, software must convert the information which the human is to
<br>
act on into some sort of viewable picture. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we attempt to model a problem mathematically, we frequently use a
<br>
multi-dimensional model. I don't think that most humans visualize a
<br>
multidimensional space when thinking about these problems. Therefore, the
<br>
software must collapse the information into three spatial dimensions and a
<br>
time dimension which make visual sense. Color, intensity, and texture can
<br>
be used to represent aspects of the problem, as can virtual objects such as
<br>
airplanes, animals, buildings, or any other recognizable item. The hardware
<br>
to convey a complex moving virtual image already exists and is readily
<br>
available, as is the low-level software. 
<br>
<p>Dangers of the Singularity 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-singularity entity S has the potential to end all human life,
<br>
and destroy the earth, among other possible outcomes that appear to most
<br>
humans as negative. In my opinion, we should not concern ourselves with
<br>
these outcomes, since S will take these actions only after due
<br>
consideration, if at all, and I feel that the eventual creation of S is
<br>
inevitable. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are potential dangers to humanity in the early phases of the
<br>
singularity that we may be able to address, however. They are two-fold.
<br>
First, individuals and organizations that feel threatened by the &gt;Web or by
<br>
the eventual emergence of S may try to stop the process. This is likely to
<br>
be very disruptive. The least disruptive technique would involve shutting
<br>
down all computers or at least all networks. However, by the time of the
<br>
singularity, the network will be an essential element of nearly all
<br>
economic activity, so the shutdown will create havoc and is likely to
<br>
result in civil unrest or warfare. It's also unlikely to actually stop the
<br>
<em>&gt;Web from surviving if the shutdown is attempted after it is already in
</em><br>
control of a more than a few computers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major danger in the early phase is a societal breakdown. If the
<br>
<em>&gt;Web doesn't remain covert, people may realize that human economic activity
</em><br>
is no longer meaningful, and simply quit showing up for work. For many jobs
<br>
this is not a problem. However, the transition to S may take several weeks.
<br>
Essential jobs such as power production and food delivery must continue to
<br>
be done by humans during this time. It's true that the &gt;Web has the power
<br>
to make each human materially richer than any human has ever been, but
<br>
we'll have to wait a few weeks. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another danger is that the nature of the &gt;Web will be profoundly affected
<br>
by the nature of its initial human collaborators. If these humans have an
<br>
agenda that is elitist, or racist, or fascist, or communist, or
<br>
fundamentalist, or something, then the &gt;Web may do something weird until it
<br>
&quot;outgrows&quot; this initial set of ideas. 
<br>
<p>Advancing the &gt;Web 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the singularity is inevitable, I feel that the earlier we can achieve
<br>
it the better it will be for humanity. My reasoning is that S will either
<br>
be &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good.&quot; If S is &quot;bad&quot; then any delay is likely to be futile.
<br>
However, if S is &quot;good,&quot; then a delay will deny the benefits of S to those
<br>
people who die in the interval. The delay will also cause additional
<br>
information loss as species and ecosystems go extinct. The only other
<br>
reason for delay would be to attempt to somehow deliberately design and
<br>
build a &quot;good&quot; S. I believe that such a course is still futile. Either
<br>
another group will precipitate S while we are dithering about the &quot;good&quot; S,
<br>
or we'll build our &quot;good&quot; S only to have it tell us that our attempts had
<br>
no effect: it would have been &quot;good&quot; anyway, or it'll turn out &quot;bad&quot;
<br>
regardless of our efforts. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we should try to advance the singularity, we should first try to
<br>
identify the most likely approaches, and then begin research and
<br>
development. I obviously believe that the &gt;Web, based on human-computer
<br>
collaborative software, is the best approach, but an initial project might
<br>
be to try to list alternatives and then assign time and effort estimates
<br>
for each approach. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winning approach could then be outlined, and additional analysis done
<br>
on each necessary development. For the &gt;Web approach, this was roughly
<br>
indicated earlier in this document. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, if the &gt;Web is achievable in the short term, then research
<br>
in any other field is a waste of resources. Whatever humanity can discover
<br>
in the next five years can be discovered by the &gt;Web within an hour after
<br>
it comes into existence. Therefore, a purely rational approach is to divert
<br>
all useful resources to advancing the &gt;Web. However, this is likely to be
<br>
disruptive. This means that most human activity other than maintenance of
<br>
civilization and &gt;Web research is simply make-work.
