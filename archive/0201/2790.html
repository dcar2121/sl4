<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gather that one chess Grandmaster ran a school whose curriculum

included Phys Ed.  Yes, I know, sex was not included, but well made is the 
<br>
point: your paleolithic brain won't be bothered with things perceived as too 
<br>
far afield or far off until &quot;basics&quot; are taken care of.  It turned out the 
<br>
students played better when in better shape and feeling better.  The mind 
<br>
can't tune out the body - or does so at risk.

<p><em>&gt;   Psychology is far from an exact science (it might be argued it

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast heard of these new-fangled &quot;Perl Monks&quot; then?

<p><em>&gt;   Sex is good for you. Have healthy servings occasionally.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Flare core team aand the major players of the SI will, I 
<br>
hope, get whatever they need, whatever floats their boat, since the fate of 
<br>
the world rests on their shoulders ever so deceptively lightly.
