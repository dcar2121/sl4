<em>&gt; Coincidentally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last night I was doing some simple calculations regarding the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of learning computer programs and I obtained some results that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of point in this direction.  Of course, it's all very heuristic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconclusive, but it's food for thought...
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; As I said, this little narrow calculation is in no way conclusive about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything general.  It's not even directly relevant to my own AI work, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both Webmind and Novamente use evolutionary methods only to create *small*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program trees, which are then pieced together using other techniques
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (association-finding, probabilistic inference).  But I share it because it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concrete example of a general *type* of result that we've been vagely talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about on this list for a while: Results showing that after a brain/mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaches a certain * very large* size, learning and adapting it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly more difficult.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; What this indicates is that there *may* be tricky mathematical issues that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arise when one tries to make programs vastly  exceeding the human brain in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.   The human brain has about 10^12 neurons which is interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the light of this calculation....
</em><br>
<p><p>While I don't have anything definitive to add here, I've noticed the same
<br>
pattern when doing back-of-the-envelope calculations for parameter
<br>
optimization and design scalability.  I've done the calculations on
<br>
different aspects than the one mentioned above, mostly for my own amusement
<br>
and curiosity, but I too have noticed that some cognitive processes start to
<br>
get very difficult as things get into what I would estimate to be
<br>
human-level and above.  Basically exponential functions that are essentially
<br>
linear for small cases but which really hit the ramp when things get
<br>
&quot;large&quot;, which means n &gt; 10^9 (+/- three orders of magnitude depending on
<br>
what I'm looking at).  If my numbers mean anything (and they probably
<br>
don't), it would kind of indicate that the human brain was in a sweet spot
<br>
in terms of bang for the evolutionary buck.
<br>
<p>I was going to mention it eventually, but I don't have a solid enough basis
<br>
to start throwing around assertions.  After all, saying that there might be
<br>
fundamental difficulties in getting really smart AI on this list is akin to
<br>
saying &quot;fuck&quot; in your Sunday school class. ;-)  But since Ben mentioned it,
<br>
I'll throw in a &quot;me too&quot;.  BTW, I always heard that there were ~10^10
<br>
neurons in the human brain (or perhaps that is just in the parts that have
<br>
some cognitive utility).
<br>
<p>That said, I *think* there are some solid tricks for getting around these
<br>
problems (at least insofar as what I was working with), but they are nothing
<br>
that I would ever expect to evolve in biological wetware.
<br>
