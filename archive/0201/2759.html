<p>Bruce Malamud (King's College,
<br>
London, <a href="mailto:bruce@malamud.com?Subject=RE:%20obstacles%20to%20unbounded%20intelligence">bruce@malamud.com</a>) and Donald Turcotte (Cornell
<br>
University, <a href="mailto:turcotte@geology.cornell.edu?Subject=RE:%20obstacles%20to%20unbounded%20intelligence">turcotte@geology.cornell.edu</a>) argued that &quot;fractal&quot;
<br>
assessments of natural hazards are often more realistic than older
<br>
statistical models in predicting rare but large disasters.  He cited as
<br>
an example the great Mississippi flood of 1993; a fractal-based
<br>
calculation for a flood of this magnitude predicts one every 100
<br>
years or so, while the more-often-used &quot;log-Pearson&quot; model
<br>
predicts a period of about 1500 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realm of earthquakes, John Rundle (who heads the
<br>
Colorado Center for Chaos and Complexity at the University of
<br>
Colorado, <a href="mailto:rundle@cires.colorado.edu?Subject=RE:%20obstacles%20to%20unbounded%20intelligence">rundle@cires.colorado.edu</a>, 303-492-1149) described a
<br>
model in which the customary spring-loaded sliding blocks used to
<br>
approximate individual faults have a more realistic built-in leeway
<br>
(or &quot;leaky thresholds,&quot; not unlike &quot;integrate-and-fire&quot; provisions
<br>
used in the study of neural networks) for simulating the way in
<br>
which faults jerk past each other. Applying these ideas to
<br>
seismically-active southern California, 3000 coarse-grained
<br>
regions, each 10 km by 10 km (the typical size for a magnitude-6
<br>
quake) are defined.  Then a coarse-grained wave function,
<br>
analogous to those used in quantum field theory, is worked out for
<br>
the region, and probabilities for when and where large quakes
<br>
would occur are determined.  Rundle claims to have good success
<br>
in predicting, retroactively, the likelihood for southern-California
<br>
earthquakes over the past decade and makes comparable
<br>
prognostications for the coming decade.  (See also Rundle et al.,
<br>
Physical Review Letters, 1 October 2001; and Rundle et al.,
<br>
PNAS, in press).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the AGU meeting Mandelbrot himself delivered the first
<br>
Lorenz Lecture, named for chaos pioneer Edward Lorenz. 
<br>
Mandelbrot discussed, among other things, how the process of
<br>
diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) is characterized by not one
<br>
but two fractal dimensions.  DLA plays a key role in many natural
<br>
phenomena, such as the fingering that occurs when two fluids
<br>
interpenetrate.  In a DLA simulation, one begins with a single seed
<br>
particle.  Then other particles, after undergoing a &quot;random walk,&quot;
<br>
attach themselves to the cluster.  This results in a branching
<br>
dendritic-like structure in which the placement of new particles is
<br>
subject to the blockage of existing limbs.  You can study the
<br>
dimensionality of this structure by drawing a circle and counting
<br>
the number of particles lying on the circle at that radius out from
<br>
the original seed particle, and counting up the angular gaps
<br>
between branches at that radius. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years studies of DLA have been confused by
<br>
conflicting reports as to the underlying fractal dimensionality. 
<br>
Now Mandelbrot (at both IBM 914-945-1712,
<br>
<a href="mailto:fractal@watson.ibm.com?Subject=RE:%20obstacles%20to%20unbounded%20intelligence">fractal@watson.ibm.com</a> and at Yale, <a href="mailto:mel@math.yale.edu?Subject=RE:%20obstacles%20to%20unbounded%20intelligence">mel@math.yale.edu</a>), Boaz
<br>
Kol, and Amnon Aharony (<a href="mailto:aharony@post.tau.ac.il?Subject=RE:%20obstacles%20to%20unbounded%20intelligence">aharony@post.tau.ac.il</a>, 972-3-640-
<br>
8558 at the University of Tel Aviv) have shown by employing a
<br>
massive simulation involving 1000 clusters, each of 30 million
<br>
particles (previous efforts had used no more than tens of thousands
<br>
of particles) that two different dimensionalities are always
<br>
present, but this only becomes apparent in huge simulations.  
<br>
Comparing a modest (10^5 particles) and a large (10^8 particles)
<br>
simulation shows that the larger cluster is not merely a scaled up
<br>
version of the smaller (see figures at <a href="http://www.aip.org/mgr/png">http://www.aip.org/mgr/png</a>). 
<br>
These results (4 February 2002 issue of Physical Review Letters)
<br>
are the first quantitative evidence for this type of nonlinear self
<br>
similarity.
