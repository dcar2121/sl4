I suspect that once general intelligence is achieved, it will become
<br>
possible to run a human equivalent general intelligence on hardware
<br>
equivalent to a contemporary pc.  There are several ways to approach the
<br>
problem, all very speculative, but which seem to me to point in the same
<br>
direction.
<br>
<p>One approach often used is to compare to the human brain.   Consider that
<br>
(1) much of the human brain is used for tasks other than general
<br>
intelligence,  (2)  the brain is not used to capacity  (that is, an injury
<br>
that destroys a substantial amount of brain tissue does not necessarily
<br>
result in a proportionate loss of functionality as the remaining brain
<br>
tissue can in some circumstances gradually pick up some or all of the lost
<br>
abilities),  (3) the brain may be extremely inefficient because  there is a
<br>
likely evolutionary payoff to massive redundency in both memory storage and
<br>
processing, and (4) increases in speed and reliabilty in the performance  of
<br>
simple operations can in part substitute for the absolute number of
<br>
conections.  There is a lot of room for argument on much of this, but when I
<br>
put it together I suspect that a human equivalent general intelligence will
<br>
run on hardware at least several orders of magnitude smaller than the human
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>A second approach is to look at existing work in AI and ask if it looks like
<br>
a mature scientific field where further advances are likely to be only on
<br>
the margins and in the details.  My impression is the reverse, that AI now
<br>
contains a number of widely disparate approaches, some of which don't really
<br>
address general intelligence at all.  There is little agreement on
<br>
fundamental principles.  I don't see anything much in existing AI work that
<br>
would enable one to rule out the speculations Emil quotes.
