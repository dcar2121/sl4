<p><em>&gt; What is this strange fascination that the word &quot;SL5&quot; seems to exert over

</em><br>
<em>&gt; impulse to top it by coming up with SL5?
</em><br>
<p>One possible reason with some amount of merit:
<br>
<p>There're a number of folks in &quot;the community&quot; for whom the Singularity is
<br>
viewed as &quot;opaque,&quot; apocalyptic, something beyond which nothing can be known
<br>
--- or at least, beyond which probabilities for various scenarios cannot be
<br>
calculated at all.  For these folks, the Singularity is a kind of Rapture, an
<br>
almost mystical, eschatological event in itself.  Let's call those folks
<br>
&quot;transhumanists&quot; with a nod to their tendency towards viewing things from a
<br>
kind of genericized humanist viewpoint.  Let's say those people are the ones
<br>
for whome SL4 is really a terminal concern.  These people are, for example,
<br>
very concerned about the potential loss of individual human lives in the time
<br>
between now and Singularity.
<br>
<p>SL5 folks would then be those for whome the truly long-term outcomes of generic
<br>
intelligence and the universe itself --- the cosmological eschatology implied
<br>
by physics and technology --- is the thing of interest and motivation, who do
<br>
not reject the idea that even today's knowledge can tell us something about the
<br>
post-Singularity long-term.  For these folks, Singularities aren't
<br>
eschatological in any sense;  they're just business-as-usual, a standard stop
<br>
along the road from eukaryotic life to ascendant intelligence.  Let's call
<br>
those folks the &quot;posthumanists&quot; and posit that they've abandoned priorities of
<br>
individual or even species survival in favor of the notion of ultimate survival
<br>
of intelligence in general.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure that there are really hard-and-fast boundaries between these
<br>
things;  any classification scheme (like the existing SL levels) is a coarse
<br>
and inaccurate tool.  However, it might be useful to consider these two points
<br>
of view as relatively distinct.
