<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; I have done all the things you mention many times, except for using

<em>&gt;  EP-Prime. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe we should try to use it sometimes!  It's very progressive at the

<em>&gt; They were more interesting to me when I was in the range of 12-16, heh.
</em><br>
But
<br>
<em>&gt; I think its always good to wear clothes just a *little* bit off from
</em><br>
everyone
<br>
<em>&gt; else, to either make them uncomfortable a bit, or to admire you, or at
</em><br>
least
<br>
<em>&gt; notice the visual uniqueness that you convey.  Wearing original clothing
</em><br>
also
<br>
<em>&gt; helps us to articulate our own personalities better, in effect making us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (better?) individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuality is a bulletproof waistcoat, a utilikilt, and a confidant
<br>
t-shirt
<br>
holster (for maximum concealment) accessorized with one's firearm of
<br>
choice.  And comfy steeltoed boots with plenty of ankle support and
<br>
those killer specialty insoles.  also a digitalangel, a good cel, and
<br>
emergency rations.
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&lt;This doesn't mean I think that sex is worthless or morally wrong.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think sex is a great thing, for other people. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Having sex just a few times was more than enough for me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mean *all total*, not per day, right???&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, total.  First it was for physical, then emotional purposes, now I
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; only do it purely for novelty or intensity of the experience.  Too bad no
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; meets the standards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Hey, I know some girls who might be able to change your mind about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this....&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mmm, I doubt it.  I dislike compromising my standards due to
</em><br>
instinct-based
<br>
<em>&gt; mating desires.  If anyone could find me a gf it would probably be you
</em><br>
though
<br>
<em>&gt;  =D
</em><br>
<p>I would like to encourage everyone to get regular doses of sex. While not
<br>
a clinical psychologist I do have some background here and sex, even
<br>
sex that isn't the greatest, is good for you. Males especially.
<br>
Until we have total voluntary control of our hormonal systems (or
<br>
are post-corporeal) we must manipulate our bodies to function
<br>
at optimum levels. This means getting laid occasionally.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Males who do not have sex (and do not have close emotional
<br>
contact with someone (usually female) are probably not
<br>
functioning at the optimum level they could be if their backbrains
<br>
were reassured that the urge to procreate was occasionally being
<br>
tended to.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychology is far from an exact science (it might be argued it
<br>
is far from even being a science, strictly speaking), but the
<br>
affective and cognitive effects of abstinence at the highest
<br>
levels of human functioning, where subtle value judgements
<br>
and high-level abstracting occur frequently, these effects are
<br>
not known to be favourable.  What info we have suggests the
<br>
opposite (though this is far from proven, it merely seems reasonable!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the historical rolemodels of monasticism may or
<br>
may not be applicable.. but I'd like to inject a word or three
<br>
of caution here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex is good for you. Have healthy servings occasionally.
<br>
Even if 'love' is not involved. It helps male apes keep sane.
<br>
<p><p>regards,
<br>
