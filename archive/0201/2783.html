</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; *Shrug*.  The human universe goes where the destiny of humanity goes.

<p>Which cannot possibly be divorced from the actual humans.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/|\     &lt; Human.

<p><em>&gt; I'll be deeply saddened if a majority or even a substantial minority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six billion people choose to voluntarily die,
</em><br>
<p>I don't intend to die...
<br>
That's what my nanites are for. =)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but the human path is to the stars, and whoever follows that path is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;human universe&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Uh whatever... 
<br>
I don't doubt that should my life procede as I would hope I would, at
<br>
one point, undertake an interstelar journey. 
<br>
<p>If it takes 100,000 years to move a space station ten lightyears, so be
<br>
it...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention, of course, that uploads potentially live a much faster 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; timescale and,
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any value in this notion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ergo, may well constitute a majority of the human universe in a very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short time even if only a million people on all Earth choose to follow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human pathway out to the stars. 
</em><br>
<p>In Diaspora, The robots (whom I won't bother trying to spell) left earth
<br>
before the polises.
<br>
<p>I would grant the robots some claim to humanity, though not the entities
<br>
in the polises. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But my point is that it doesn't matter. Unlike most past 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice points, such as the divergence of humanity from the ape line, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who gets to participate in the Singularity is a matter of pure personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice and not wealth or genetics.
</em><br>
<p>Or so you would hope. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But once that choice is made, the human universe moves on, regardless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what percentages are involved.
</em><br>
<p>You can't have it both ways.
<br>
You can't both claim to be human and be an upload. As much as your ego
<br>
would like to hold on to the old comfortable blanket of &quot;human&quot; in his
<br>
cold hard Cray, wishing won't make it so. You will have to create a new
<br>
essence to match your existance. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And whoever chooses to stay behind is no longer a pre-Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, which is to say a creator of the future and a potential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman, but is rather an obsolete remnant, with no destiny and no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential, leading an entirely meaningless life, unless and until that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person decides to join the rest of the human universe. 
</em><br>
<p>The problem with your conceptualization is that there is no &quot;diaspora&quot;
<br>
Only a single streight line of evolution that never branches. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanity does not hinge on the acceptance of any one single
<br>
technology. The world would be horrible if that were the case., rather I
<br>
would hope to see many uppon many visions of transhumanity be explored.
<br>
<p>The mere existance of a superior race does not deprive a single human of
<br>
his personal potential, his future, or the meaning he finds in his own
<br>
life. 
<br>
<p>Finally, the statement you make about these things being contingient
<br>
uppon the acceptance of _YOUR_ future indicates a profound sense of
<br>
being left out of mainstream humanity. I must say I sympathize but at
<br>
the same time I don't allow my ego to drive me to pronounce that my own
<br>
personal prefferances ammount to the manafest destiny of humanity
<br>
exclusive of all others. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because everything is a matter of choice doesn't mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some choices aren't blatantly wrong.
</em><br>
<p>That is the aditude I fear.
<br>
Despite all your smiling papers on Friendly AI, this aditude coupled
<br>
with your unrestrained ego may quickly lead you to overwrite much of
<br>
what you said in that paper about forced uploading.
<br>
<p>I suppose I see a lot of the same in Linux users who insist that they
<br>
are using the one true OS when infact it is among the worst I have come
<br>
across. They continue on to say that I am somehow inferior for not
<br>
jumping at the chance at working ten times as hard to get the same level
<br>
of service I get from my DOS/WIN3.11 setup.
