<p>&lt;&lt; I have done all the things you mention many times, except for using
<br>
&nbsp;EP-Prime. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Maybe we should try to use it sometimes!  It's very progressive at the 
<br>
least...
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>They were more interesting to me when I was in the range of 12-16, heh.  But 
<br>
I think its always good to wear clothes just a *little* bit off from everyone 
<br>
else, to either make them uncomfortable a bit, or to admire you, or at least 
<br>
notice the visual uniqueness that you convey.  Wearing original clothing also 
<br>
helps us to articulate our own personalities better, in effect making us 
<br>
(better?) individuals.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;As for &quot;changing subcultures,&quot;I have seen an awful lot of subcultures, from 
<br>
&quot;common criminals &amp; junkies&quot; to super-rich Wall Street traders, rock 
<br>
musicians, used car dealers, scientists, artists,etc. etc.  But these days I 
<br>
seem to mostly keep to my certain group of renaissance-geek friends...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Great, that's the best type of life to live in my opinion.  Yep, I mostly 
<br>
keep to a small group nowadays too.  That seems to be the equilibrium for 
<br>
efficency.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;There are limits to what any one human can experience during their
<br>
lifetime while still devoting themselves to art, science and family; and
<br>
there are some experiences for which the danger outweighs the excitement and 
<br>
curiosity....&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>True, but don't you like to make your recreational experiences to be as 
<br>
novel/engaging as possible every time, within the bounds of danger?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Well, y'know, I don't watch TV, I read few magazines, (Scientific American),
<br>
I'm bored by spectator sports... but you're not going to convince me to push
<br>
*music* out of my life to increase my effectiveness in working toward the
<br>
Singularity.  Sorry...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Great, I hope there are more Singularitarians like you.  I'm assuming Eliezer 
<br>
lives his life in this similar manner.  The problem with concerts is that 
<br>
they are too much like TV; no interactivity really, and little novelty.  Plus 
<br>
think of all that time you spend driving and waiting and paying and 
<br>
etc...highly inefficent way to have fun in my opinion.  Music is great, and I 
<br>
endorse the most novel, intense, modern music as possible, and hope I always 
<br>
do!
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&lt;This doesn't mean I think that sex is worthless or morally wrong.  I
<br>
<em>&gt; think sex is a great thing, for other people. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having sex just a few times was more than enough for me,
</em><br>
You mean *all total*, not per day, right???&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, total.  First it was for physical, then emotional purposes, now I would 
<br>
only do it purely for novelty or intensity of the experience.  Too bad no one 
<br>
meets the standards.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Hey, I know some girls who might be able to change your mind about 
<br>
this....&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Mmm, I doubt it.  I dislike compromising my standards due to instinct-based 
<br>
mating desires.  If anyone could find me a gf it would probably be you though 
<br>
&nbsp;=D
<br>
<p>Sorry about the unstandard quoting, I hope italicizing makes it better...hope 
<br>
to get the standard quoting thing going very soon...!
