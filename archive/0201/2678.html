<p>
I'd just like to make a point on this.
<br>
I'm not sure that &quot;Eternal Life!&quot; should be a feature of the singularity 
<br>
that we should be pushing to the general public.  From my experience the 
<br>
majority of the general public who is interested in Eternal Life already 
<br>
subscribe to a religion that grantees it, and would probably see the 
<br>
singularity as &quot;the work of the devil&quot;, &quot;distracting them from Eternal Life 
<br>
with God&quot;, etc... etc...
<br>
<p>There's also a segment of the population who doesn't want to live forever 
<br>
&quot;trapped in a computer.&quot;  You can try explaining to them until you're blue 
<br>
in the face that life in a computer will be more 
<br>
interesting/diverse/rich/fun/etc... but there's a good chance that they 
<br>
won't be convinced.
<br>
<p>It would be more productive to tell people that after the singularity, they 
<br>
will be able to chose the time of their death (although some may see that 
<br>
as forced suicide, and therefore evil).  I was just talking to a friend 
<br>
about death today.  He said that it wasn't death that bothered him the 
<br>
most, he was more concerned with growing old, not being able to be active, 
<br>
getting sick, etc... We can tell those people that they won't grow old, 
<br>
they won't feel the pain of arthritis, etc...
