<em>&gt; All good points.  None of this particularly concerns me, btw.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I'm more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned with is the idea that we're going to turn the Web into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some huge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine-grained CycL KB. ;-)  IMO, effort to do so is, modulo some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-level stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of interest as mentioned above, mostly wasted effort.  (I.e., the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Web (e.g. its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content) doesn't need a general concept of &quot;man,&quot; something else ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications that use the Web --- needs specific notions of &quot;man.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>yes, I think we agree here.  The problem is that the general concept of
<br>
&quot;man&quot; is a subtle and complex thing, not easily captured in a compact
<br>
formal-logic-style definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Put another way, type is a slippery slope.  Strong and weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typing don't coexist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with each other happily.  If a critical mass of applications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins to expect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain level of structure embedded in Web content, then there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative incentive for content that does *not* embed such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to *increasing* the friction of publication on the Web, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermines the very thing that made the Web so useful (and drove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adoption) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first place.
</em><br>
<p>yes, this is an excellent point as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; but it certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrates the existence of *memory structures*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sigh.  Please let's not have a semantic argument about the meaning of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;structure.&quot;  I'm specifically talking about relational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrangements, reference-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and graph-based structures, semantic nets, etc. as they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonly known and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in building information systems today.  Information for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metadata (often of fixed schema) is known or can be directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deduced from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stored form of the information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We probably agree on one thing:  the kind of structure that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain uses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to store and access information is not anything that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforwardly /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently be represented in a textual medium. ;-)  I.e., the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Semantic Web is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; graph structure because text markup is good for representing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; graph structures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not because semantic networks are a particularly good model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>I think that a *weighted, typed hypergraph with some static nodes and some
<br>
nodes interpreted as combinators (a la combinatory logic* is a good model of
<br>
human information storage.
<br>
<p>However, I think that the accurate representation of a concept such as &quot;man&quot;
<br>
in this kind of extended graphical representation is necessarily *very very
<br>
big and complex and messy*, not something that we can easily write down in
<br>
an elegant CYC style definition.  It will take a reasonably sophisticated --
<br>
but perhaps not human-level -- AI to create the definition.  The reason an
<br>
AI can create the definition better than a human is that an AI has more
<br>
transparency, i.e. its brain structures can be dumped to text more easily
<br>
than ours.
