<p>My wife does not wish to live forever -- she realizes it may well be
<br>
possible,
<br>
but her choice will be to die &quot;naturally.&quot;  If I do manage to live
<br>
essentially forever,
<br>
as I hope and mostly believe will happen, then I'll sure as fuck  miss her,
<br>
but I won't feel sad for her.  
<br>
<p>I don't think what individual humans wish for right now really matters on 
<br>
their fate at all; an AI could more readily convince everyone of vis state of 
<br>
extremely rational mind, while at the same time expanding and enchancing all 
<br>
minds, and I believe the &quot;strange attractor of complexity/information 
<br>
processing&quot; of the next epoch will be far, far away from the current human 
<br>
&quot;wishes, dreams, and mentalities&quot;, including the current (and in any possible 
<br>
human mode of thought) concepts like &quot;Sysop&quot;, &quot;volition&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, 
<br>
so on and so forth.  
<br>
<p>I think the more likely &quot;universal concepts&quot; to remain will be 'fun', in some 
<br>
sense, more 'understanding' in some sense, and more 'increased amount and 
<br>
speed of information processing/complexity' in *some* sense.  I think it 
<br>
would be considered unethical to a Next-Level entity to *not* convince a 
<br>
human (which it could do quite easily) to accept the uploading/transcension 
<br>
process.  
<br>
<p>A loose hypothesis for this is that human minds would represent &quot;pockets of 
<br>
information processing/complexity&quot;, especially live human minds, and that it 
<br>
would be most &quot;efficent&quot; for the &lt;Sysop, intelligent substrate, shockwave of 
<br>
new 'physical law' expansion, 'ontological shift force', 'Singularity force'&gt; 
<br>
to &lt;'absorb', 'enhance', 'convince/help/be ethical to', 'upgrade'&gt; the 
<br>
adjacent human mind rather than a &quot;destroy and recycle&quot; method.  And, I 
<br>
suspect consciousness to be lurking in all the nooks and crannies of reality 
<br>
(panpsychism...I am beliefs which state that even atoms themselves have a 
<br>
rudimentary form of &quot;consciousness&quot;, in some sense, even if its only the 
<br>
&quot;ethics&quot; implicit in chemical bonds that this manifests itself as) and 
<br>
ultimately I don't think size or locality will have much to do with how 
<br>
Everything and Everyone (including memes, all particles, all genes, all 
<br>
living things, all rocks, on many subsequent levels and all over the place) 
<br>
is integrated into the Final Pattern.
<br>
<p>And even if she didn't personally say yes to uploading, you could make a 
<br>
million perfect copies of her in PowerSpace and talk with them all day long!  
<br>
Or a more enhanced version of her, or whatever!  I have faith that the Sysop 
<br>
will create an environment for us that will lead to the greatest possible 
<br>
growth/enlightenment/happiness/fullfillment/intelligence/etc, regardless of 
<br>
what we think now.  Especially such a trivial thing as human love...it's like 
<br>
being sad about dropping a gold fleck a mere hundred yards away from a brick 
<br>
of gold the size of a house!
<br>
<p>I think we should accept that there is a strong psychological and
<br>
spiritual positive to this feeling of oneness with nature, and not be
<br>
saddened
<br>
by people whose lives are governed by this feeling, rather than by the
<br>
alternate
<br>
feeling (that you and I share) that the self is mostly the mind and greater
<br>
individual
<br>
intelligence is  a extremely important goal.
<br>
<p>But people can be *taught* and (dare I say so) enlightened!
<br>
<p>But if some people feel themselves part and parcel of the
<br>
biosphere and prefer
<br>
to remain that way for their whole lives, even if it means losing their
<br>
consciousness
<br>
permanently and merging their cells back into the biosphere, that's cool
<br>
with me.
<br>
<p>Only an unethical, subhuman AI would allow this to happen without a fight.  
<br>
And AI's always win in fights with humans, perfectly and physically 
<br>
harmlessly in cases of intellect/memetics.  (The &quot;uploading is the better 
<br>
way&quot; meme, supermemetically engineered by a hyperconscious AI.  It's like 
<br>
memes on crack.)
