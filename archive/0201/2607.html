<p>&lt;&lt; There is an assumption made in the article that the Singularity is likely 
<br>
to
<br>
&nbsp;be brought about by a small number of people (say, 1000) who are explicitly
<br>
&nbsp;focused on bringing the Singularity about, rather than by the more diffused
<br>
&nbsp;efforts of hundreds of thousands of scientists and technologists. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I speculate this because of a property I've called &quot;progress differential&quot;, 
<br>
which is where, in each subsequent universal cycle, only a small percentage 
<br>
of material from the previous cycle almost entirely responsible for the 
<br>
&quot;progress&quot; made.  For example, only a small percentage of the universe's 
<br>
matter has formed into heavy elements.  Only a very small percentage of these 
<br>
have formed into life.  Only a percentage of the human race is currently 
<br>
doing most of the producing more this world (sadly).  As the pace of 
<br>
technology increases, I believe that there will only be a few people to &quot;get 
<br>
their acts together&quot;, and their progress will create a feedback effect in 
<br>
which they are responsible for most of the progress.  This feedback effect 
<br>
could be created in marketing sub-seed AIs and recycling the profits back 
<br>
into better interfaces, more smart drugs, whatever.  This is not elitism.  
<br>
Jeff Bone put it well when he said: 
<br>
<p>&quot;SL5 folks would then be those for whome the truly long-term outcomes of 
<br>
generic intelligence and the universe itself --- the cosmological eschatology 
<br>
implied
<br>
by physics and technology --- is the thing of interest and motivation, who do
<br>
not reject the idea that even today's knowledge can tell us something about 
<br>
the
<br>
post-Singularity long-term.  For these folks, Singularities aren't
<br>
eschatological in any sense;  they're just business-as-usual, a standard stop
<br>
along the road from eukaryotic life to ascendant intelligence.  Let's call
<br>
those folks the &quot;posthumanists&quot; and posit that they've abandoned priorities of
<br>
individual or even species survival in favor of the notion of ultimate 
<br>
survival
<br>
of intelligence in general.&quot;
<br>
<p>SL5 is just prediction and speculation.  It's not an assertion, its not for 
<br>
making anybody mad.  How else would you describe people a distinct level and 
<br>
mentality above SL5?  Imagine if Eliezer (or some other critical SingInst 
<br>
person, should the SingInst be critical) decided to fall in love and run off 
<br>
with some girl?  This could be a disaster.  I just think it would take a 
<br>
different type of shock level to *truely* serve the Singularity over 
<br>
anthropocentric desires.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;SL5 as Anissimov
<br>
describes it seems to me to be making some fairly specific and ambitious
<br>
assertions about how rapidly certain things will happen post-Singularity.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The loose reason is, that once adopting these beliefs, these people might 
<br>
become even more committed to the cause.  But of course this is speculation.  
<br>
In fact, I'd like to ask Jeff Bone, if he is reading this, if I may integrate 
<br>
his thoughts on SL5 into my paper, perhaps taking out some of the more 
<br>
fanatical-sounding writings of my own in that one section?  
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I'm not sure it's a higher &quot;shock level&quot;; maybe it's just a higher level of
<br>
arrogance and hubris ;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't think the anthropocentric attitudes of arrogance and hubris would be 
<br>
adopted by a truely higher shock level.  Higher levels of efficency and 
<br>
productivity, on the other hand, most definitely would.  This means 
<br>
eliminating things like sex and eating long meals, or even chatting with 
<br>
friends in person or going out to the &quot;real world&quot;.  Maybe they'll evolve 
<br>
beyond the need to have &quot;fun&quot; for mental health, because new interfaces will 
<br>
be so interesting and engaging that that will be all they need.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Maybe I should take that out, or maybe I should just make a bold note of it 
<br>
that &quot;SL5 IS PURE SPECULATION FOR NOW&quot;.  Frankly, I didn't even think the 
<br>
publication of my &quot;Shock Level Analysis&quot; would go noticed (much less 
<br>
discussed) by anyone on SL4.  Next time I have a questional paper to publish 
<br>
I suppose I'll invite criticism before making it available on my site, if 
<br>
people would be interested in constructively criticizing.  By all means, join 
<br>
my mailing list if you are.  Here's my next paper, in very rough form, and I 
<br>
invite you all to comment on it;
