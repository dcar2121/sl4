<p>
I tremble in *fear* writing this message, because as soon as I mention 
<br>
an ancient incantation such as &quot;Moore's Law&quot;, the list is bound to 
<br>
degenerate into endlessly rehashed banalities which could be avoided 
<br>
with a quick look at the archives. I might as well throw in &quot;human 
<br>
augmentation&quot; and &quot;qualia&quot;, and really foul things up. ;-)
<br>
<p>My attempt at a somewhat-new question is:
<br>
<p>How could some preeminent scientists, in this day and age, defend the 
<br>
notion that existing computer power (or even a lot less than it), 
<br>
combined with some rather simple but undiscovered programming technique, 
<br>
would be sufficient for general intelligence?
<br>
<p>It does not suffice to say &quot;Given enough scientists (even famous ones) 
<br>
and enough viewpoints, there's someone to defend just about anything.&quot; I 
<br>
would like for people who know more about the history and personalities 
<br>
behind the study of AI than I do to explain where this notion comes from 
<br>
and why it persists. I suspect that the answer would be quite subtle.
<br>
<p><p>John McCarthy says this in his FAQ [1]:
<br>
<p>Q. Are computers fast enough to be intelligent?
<br>
<p>A. Some people think much faster computers are required as well as new 
<br>
ideas. My own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast 
<br>
enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from 
<br>
the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster.
<br>
<p><p>Stephen Wolfram said this in a 1996 interview [2]:
<br>
<p>&quot;Sometime--perhaps ten years from now, perhaps twenty-five--we'll have 
<br>
machines that think. And then we'll look back on the 1990s and ask why 
<br>
the machines didn't get built then. And I'm essentially sure the reason 
<br>
won't be because the hardware was too slow, or the memories weren't 
<br>
large enough. It'll just be because the key idea or ideas hadn't been 
<br>
had. You see, I'm convinced that after it's understood, it really won't 
<br>
be difficult to make artificial intelligence. It's just that people have 
<br>
been studying absolutely the wrong things in trying to get it. ...
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, anyway, after the failures of the early brute-force approaches to 
<br>
mimicking brains and so on, AI entered a crazy kind of cognitive 
<br>
engineering phase--where people tried to build systems which mimicked 
<br>
particular elaborate features of thinking. And basically that's the 
<br>
approach that's still being used today. Nobody's trying more fundamental 
<br>
stuff. Everyone assumes it's just too difficult. Well, I don't think 
<br>
there's really any evidence of that. It's just that nobody has tried to 
<br>
do it. And it would be considered much too looney to get funded or 
<br>
anything like that.&quot;
<br>
<p>... &quot;I'm guessing that a key ingredient is going to be seeing how 
<br>
computations emerge from the action of very simple programs--the kind of 
<br>
thing that happens in the cellular automata and other systems I've 
<br>
studied.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Marvin Minsky has stated recently (I do not have the exact quote) that a 
<br>
1 megahertz machine could become sentient with the right programming [3].
