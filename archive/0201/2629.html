Basically, you are right, but there is a more important point, you are 
<br>
missing.
<br>
What Penrose is sceptic about is the Church thesis that states that the
<br>
every discrete aspect of any physical process can be modelled by a Turing
<br>
machine. This thesis is of course unprovable, but there is no counterexample
<br>
so far. Even the quantum computation models stay within the realm of
<br>
Turing-computability, &quot;only&quot; the efficiency of some algorithm could be
<br>
increased theoretically. (This is also experimentally unproved, and some
<br>
scientists doubt the possibility of practical implementations of this.)
<br>
Only if we knew all physical laws, this would be a well posed
<br>
mathematical question, but probably a hard one. I don't know whether the
<br>
Church thesis is proved even for the Newtonian mechanics.
<br>
Of course, if there existed a grand unified theory, there would be still 
<br>
a chance that
<br>
the model is not complete, so some uncertainity will always remain.
<br>
<p>The main question is therefore: is the human consciousness modellable by
<br>
a Turing machine (a digital computer).  This is one of the most interesting
<br>
question posed in science so far, even if it is far from well-defined
<br>
or decidable.
<br>
