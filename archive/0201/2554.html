<p>(BTW, it's not *entirely* intuition.  It's somewhat informed by an exercise in
<br>
&quot;intelligent&quot; news processing that consumed me for part of '99 and most of '00.
<br>
It's a somewhat informed opinion, admittedly based on a relatively small sample
<br>
of practical experience in trying to apply some of the concepts we're talking
<br>
about.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As simple examples of success, automatically marking up

</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically marking up *sentences* by topic area can be gotten to work

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to write the appropriate software.
</em><br>
<p>All good points.  None of this particularly concerns me, btw.  What I'm more
<br>
concerned with is the idea that we're going to turn the Web into some huge and
<br>
fine-grained CycL KB. ;-)  IMO, effort to do so is, modulo some high-level stuff
<br>
of interest as mentioned above, mostly wasted effort.  (I.e., the Web (e.g. its
<br>
content) doesn't need a general concept of &quot;man,&quot; something else ---
<br>
applications that use the Web --- needs specific notions of &quot;man.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Put another way, type is a slippery slope.  Strong and weak typing don't coexist
<br>
with each other happily.  If a critical mass of applications begins to expect a
<br>
certain level of structure embedded in Web content, then there will be a
<br>
negative incentive for content that does *not* embed such structure.  That is
<br>
equivalent to *increasing* the friction of publication on the Web, and
<br>
undermines the very thing that made the Web so useful (and drove adoption) in
<br>
the first place.  (Exercise:  go back and cast a historical eye on hypertext
<br>
research before the Web.  It seems amazing to me that we're rehashing some of
<br>
the same arguments.  Ask yourself why the Web succeeded.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This partial success could be seen as evidence that the nonlinear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportionality mentioned above is not as severe as you're suggesting, Jeff.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggest that information is stored / accessed / used in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structured way in biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, there IS a lot of evidence that information is *used* and *stored*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a structured way in the human mind.  However, the structures involved are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the same as a simplistic semantic network.
</em><br>
<p>True.  By &quot;structured&quot; I meant the simplistic, reference-oriented semantic
<br>
network.  The &quot;structures&quot; that the human mind seems to work with seem to be
<br>
much more fuzzy, abstract, and of a higher order than &quot;structure&quot; as its
<br>
typically dealt with in information systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but it certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrates the existence of *memory structures*,
</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  Please let's not have a semantic argument about the meaning of
<br>
&quot;structure.&quot;  I'm specifically talking about relational arrangements, reference-
<br>
and graph-based structures, semantic nets, etc. as they are commonly known and
<br>
used in building information systems today.  Information for which particular
<br>
metadata (often of fixed schema) is known or can be directly deduced from the
<br>
stored form of the information.
<br>
<p>We probably agree on one thing:  the kind of structure that the human brain uses
<br>
to store and access information is not anything that can straightforwardly /
<br>
efficiently be represented in a textual medium. ;-)  I.e., the Semantic Web is a
<br>
graph structure because text markup is good for representing graph structures,
<br>
not because semantic networks are a particularly good model of human information
<br>
storage.  :-)
