<br>
<p>A fun read. Thanks Michael. Anyone on this mailing list fit the following
<br>
description, if only in spirit, of an SL5'er?
<br>
<p>&quot;SL5:  NeoSingularitarian Omegists.  These people believe in the idea of a
<br>
'Ontotechnological Singularity' or the idea that once the Singularity
<br>
occurs, it will immediately get ontotechnology, faster than light travel,
<br>
time travel, near-infinite power sources, near-infinite virtual space, and
<br>
take on the quality of having a near-infinite number of dimensions.  You
<br>
could call these people the human embodiments of the Singularity.  A
<br>
radically strict version of Singularitarian.  They spend all of their time,
<br>
money and energy on attempting to reach the Singularity as soon as possible.
<br>
They drop out of school or college because it is a waste of time.  This
<br>
person is almost certainly a computer programmer, a fanatical memetic
<br>
engineer, or perhaps a tycoon who works intensely hard to accumulate wealth
<br>
so he can donate it to the Cause.  The only activities this person engages
<br>
in are those that will bring about a quicker Singularity.  Sex is only used
<br>
as an anti-stress mechanism.  More fanatic than religious fanatics because
<br>
their beliefs have a logical foundation rather than a illogical one.  They
<br>
attempt to integrate weak AI into everything they do, and would probably be
<br>
constantly on smart drugs or even possibly low doses of psychedelics.
<br>
Probably vegan (don't eat any animal products) so that they can digest food
<br>
as efficently as possible and spend as little time as possible in the
<br>
bathroom.  No newspaper reading, TV watching, movie watching....they attempt
<br>
to keep all their information input on the SL4-5 level.  Anthropomorphism
<br>
and ontocentrism is notably faded.  They spend nearly all their time
<br>
programming or collaborating with other researchers on the Internet.  Such a
<br>
hypothetical person might would probably have an important role as part of
<br>
the final AI development team.  I forsee the existence of at least 10 of
<br>
these people as imminent and an upper limit of several thousand in the
<br>
entire history of pre-Singularity reality.  The entire evolution and
<br>
development not of society, or humanity, or life, but of the entire Universe
<br>
will culminate in these individuals.&quot;
<br>
<p>Best
<br>
Nat
