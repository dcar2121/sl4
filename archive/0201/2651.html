<em>&gt; Unlike Eliezer, my goal is only to be rational, not rationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruistic necessarily.  If that's what being rational requires, then so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be it.  From what Eliezer writes, I'm not nearly as far along as he is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but at least the rational module of my brain doesn't get upset very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more (i.e. I'm not acting irrationally).  Of course, my mind could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in possession of an emotion I don't even know is there and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fooling me, but from what I can tell of my own mind there is no such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, you people are weird!!!!!
<br>
<p>Not that it bothers me -- I *love* weird people! ;&gt;  [note: I am displaying,
<br>
egads, an emotion!]
<br>
<p>Personally, I very  much enjoy having strong passions and emotions and I
<br>
have very little desire to squash my feelings.  To me, the sometimes crazy &amp;
<br>
overwhelming passion of feeling is much of what makes life worth living....
<br>
Rationality is wonderful too, but it's sure not the whole story...
<br>
<p>A huge amount of the human brain is devoted to dealing with emotion
<br>
(Cytowic, in &quot;The Man Who Tasted Shapes&quot;, makes this point pretty nicely)...
<br>
it's a huge amount of what we are.
<br>
<p>Will AI superminds be more rational, more free of emotion?  Maybe.  Or maybe
<br>
they will just have different kinds of emotions.  Maybe they will have
<br>
different mental patterns altogether, different from what we call either
<br>
emotional OR rational....  Who knows?  I guess we'll find out.  I'll be very
<br>
*excited* to find out!! [note: another gosh-darned emotion!! ;) ]
<br>
<p>Why do I *feel* feeling is so important?  Is this just a self-perpetuating
<br>
complex? -- feeling feels like there has to be lots of feeling?
<br>
<p>And other other hand, reason reasons that there has to be lots of reason???
<br>
<p>Reason is only meaningful in service of some goal.  Feeling gives that goal.
<br>
<p>You say you're altruistic, your goal is &quot;good.&quot;  How do you define &quot;good&quot;?
<br>
As the causing of pleasure rather than pain to others?  Then your goal is
<br>
defined in terms of feeling....  In a universe of purely rational unfeeling
<br>
beings, you would have no notion of good, because there would be no pleasure
<br>
or pain...
<br>
<p>I don't have time this morning to spend hours writing a detailed and fully
<br>
rationally convincing essay on the necessary of love, passion and intense
<br>
emotional mania in the universe.   But maybe I will sometime later.
<br>
Obviously I have strong *feelings* on this topic, which this conversation
<br>
has elicited ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Love, my friends!  LOVE!  Lust!  Rage!!  Excitement!  Wonder!  passion!
<br>
Yes, you can have the Singularity, and you can have THESE TOO!  All for own
<br>
low, low price...
