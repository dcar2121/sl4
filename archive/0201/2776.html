</em><br>
<p>Untrue.  Vigilante violence affects nonprofits and universities before
<br>
for-profit companies, for-profit companies before military projects, and
<br>
military projects not at all.  Burning GMO crops may or may not be a good
<br>
strategy, but their goal is to minimize the total users of GMO, not
<br>
prevent one single GMO crop from being harvested anywhere in the world. 
<br>
Similarly, pushing for a worldwide ban on AIs will again affect nonprofits
<br>
and universities before for-profit companies, for-profit companies before
<br>
military projects, open military projects before underground or
<br>
intelligence military projects, and military projects in liberal
<br>
democracies before military projects in rogue states.  And starting out by
<br>
attacking the Singularity Institute, which is the only AI project on Earth
<br>
that accepts what it really means to be an AI project, the only project
<br>
that cares enough about Friendly AI to put some real work into it, is the
<br>
worst strategy of all.
<br>
<p>So let's dispense with the idea that we are fighting wise strategists who
<br>
are taking smart actions under different moral premises.  We are fighting
<br>
people who explicitly dislike rational thinking, who &quot;trust their
<br>
feelings&quot; including hatred, and who are worrisome not because they are our
<br>
rational strategic opponents but because their violent impulses threaten
<br>
everyone on Earth, including themselves.  We are dealing with people whose
<br>
actions will be suicidal even under their own moral premises, because they
<br>
are not emotionally capable of seeing the unfortunate logical flaws in an
<br>
exciting-sounding strategy.  If you start thinking of these people as
<br>
rational, you will be unable to predict or prevent their actions.  (This
<br>
does not mean that we can expect them to be tactically stupid.)
<br>
<p>Again, this is inappropriate for public discussion on SL4.  We should not
<br>
be giving these people ideas.  But I cannot let stand the idea that
<br>
vigilante violence is a smart action under different moral and ethical
<br>
premises.  That might be true of GMO crops or cloning, but it is a
<br>
strategically suicidal way to deal with AI, regardless of goals.
