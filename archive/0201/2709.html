<em>&gt; Sigh.  As always, Ben Goertzel thinks I'm a fuddy-duddy just because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't do sex, drugs, drinking, smoking, fighting, or gambling.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think you're a fuddy-duddy, Eli -- I think you're a bloody
<br>
freak!!!
<br>
<p>But you're a fascinating and excellent freak, and I wish there were more
<br>
like you ;&gt;
<br>
<p>I consider myself a freak as well, though of a rather different nature.
<br>
<p>Unlike you, I have made it my business to seek out almost every possible
<br>
type of experience.  Call it a combination of curiosity and adventurousness
<br>
and recklessness.
<br>
<p>It is true that love takes up some of one's time.  I have a wife &amp; 3 kids,
<br>
as you know, so I'm rather well aware of this.  However, I find that
<br>
romantic and parental love both add a certain depth to one's thinking and
<br>
experiencing and living, sort of in the same way that spiritual experiences
<br>
do.  And for sure my unconscious mind is always churning on intellectual
<br>
stuff, even when my body and awareness are largely occupied with family
<br>
stuff.  I don't think I'd accomplish substantially more if I were single and
<br>
ascetic; I really am a hell of a workaholic anyway....
<br>
<p>As for &quot;sex, drugs, drinking, smoking, fighting, or gambling,&quot;
<br>
<p>-- gambling bores me (though I did make some $$ counting cards in Vegas a
<br>
long time ago -- that didn't bore me so much because I was using math, not
<br>
just gambling...)
<br>
-- I certainly don't fight very often (though I did mildly beat up a drunk
<br>
burglar who came into an apartment I was staying in, about 5 months ago ;p)
<br>
-- I don't smoke tobacco
<br>
-- I very rarely drink alcohol....
<br>
-- Drugs?  Well, I don't use them frequently, but I do feel that psychedelic
<br>
drugs give you a unique vision of the world, and a very valuable one,
<br>
although they shouldn't be overused.  (Hey, if you ever get the urge to try
<br>
out the psychedelic thing, I'll trip with ya, dude!  Now that would be a
<br>
hell of a trip ;-&gt;)
<br>
<p>I don't do much with myself besides work, play with the kids, spend a little
<br>
time with my wife, improvise freaky music... and occasionally hike or rock
<br>
climb.  I'm probably almost as much of a workaholic as you are, actually.
<br>
Although it doesn't feel like &quot;work&quot; since I'm fortunate enough right now to
<br>
have a research fellowship that pays me for working on &quot;real AI&quot; stuff most
<br>
of the time....  (Last night was an exception -- I went out to see the Dead
<br>
Kennedys perform -- even without Jello Biafra they're a great band, I highly
<br>
recommend you all catch them on this tour... ;)
<br>
<p>I look at the Singularity as a big, crazy, reckless adventure, sort of like
<br>
when I fly into a third world country where I don't speak the language and I
<br>
have no idea where I'm going or what I'm doing -- I just plunge in and hope
<br>
for the best, relying on my wits and my heart to get me through... and
<br>
usually loving *most* every minute, though accepting the pain-in-the-butt
<br>
parts too....   No matter how much we plan and scheme, ultimately this is
<br>
what the Singularity is going to be like....    So perhaps having a more
<br>
experimental and adventurous approach to life's various experiences is
<br>
better preparation ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>Eli, I will certainly admit that you are more devoted to the Singularity
<br>
than I am.  I *am* very devoted to it, but I'm also committed to
<br>
experiencing all that *this* pre-Singularity world has to offer, or at least
<br>
a damn good sample.  Call me overambitious, hey....
<br>
<p>I value the perspective that the diverse experience I've gathered brings
<br>
me -- but, I also think it's great that you have your own unique perspective
<br>
based on your own more single-focused and narrowly-experienced approach to
<br>
life....  The Singularity is deep enough that it will take a lot of us with
<br>
different perspectives all working together to even get a reasonable partial
<br>
grip on what it's going to be...
<br>
