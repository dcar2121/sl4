<em>&gt;From: &quot;Christian L.&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:n95lundc@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Ethics%20and%20the%20Public">n95lundc@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Suppose the UN decides to ban all Singularity-related research because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;incompatible with human dignity&quot;. If I understand you correctly, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; go ahead anyway to the best of your ability?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know I would. Any person, government or society that wishes to oppress me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is going to get a fight. Not only from me, but from other people who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the reasoning capability to understand why I do what I'm doing, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protesters who are against intolerance (who are pro-tolerance) for other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultures such as Singulatarians
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily. This is not like, for instance, people protesting against 
<br>
the Chinese government harassing the Falun Gong movement, while they 
<br>
themselves are not religious. If the Falun Gong can live in peace, this does 
<br>
not affect these protestors directly.
<br>
<p>Anyone who supports you in a similar fashion must be a Singularitarian 
<br>
himself, because the end result of letting you live and work freely would be 
<br>
the Singularity, which would affect him/her directly. You cannot be 
<br>
&quot;neutral&quot; about something that will inevitably affect you directly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It's scary, but people will get over it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. It took me a number of years to feel comfortable with 
<br>
transhumanism, and a few extra years to accept the Singularity. I am sure 
<br>
that many of the members of this list have had a similar experience. The 
<br>
members of this list are mostly highly educated/intelligent so for a person 
<br>
of &quot;average&quot; education levels, it should take even longer to &quot;get over it&quot;. 
<br>
If the Singularity is only 10-20 years off, most people will not have gotten 
<br>
over it in that time, I believe.
<br>
<p>I think there is a threshold of how much change people can cope with, and we 
<br>
are approaching that threshold as we approach the Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The next
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generation of children will be born into the scary new world, and the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are going to die along with their fears.
</em><br>
<p>No, if the Singularity is 10-20 years off it is THIS generation that will 
<br>
face it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; There is of course also the inevitable rise of neo-Luddite terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who would probably go to any length to stop you. The world will be at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for them, literally. They could even have widespread public support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both of these scenarios I consider worst-case, because they would occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through lack of reasoning and lack of tolerance.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all, their goal is to stop the Singularity from happening. A good way 
<br>
of achieving that is by killing the people involved in research. That is not 
<br>
flawed reasoning. They would probably see it as saving humanity from certain 
<br>
destruction by inhuman machines.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Fundamental Muslims,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Christians, et al. are intolerant groups of people, and they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diminishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in numbers as we speak.
</em><br>
<p>The only reason for being &quot;tolerant&quot; towards Singularity-related research is 
<br>
if you want the Singularity to happen. I suspect that the majority of the 
<br>
world's population don't want that, so they will be an &quot;intolerant group of 
<br>
people&quot; (with respect to the Singularity).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Atheism (lazy-ism?) and agnostics are plentiful now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because their own experiences have shown them that the intolerant religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just don't make sense for whatever reason.
</em><br>
<p><p>No more than 1-3% of the world's population are atheist/agnostics if I 
<br>
remember correctly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The main problem is, as I described above, for every person that hears
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; S. and is pro-S, there will be 10 that is anti-S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe I'm an optimist, but I think that there are more reasonable people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world to reduce that ratio by a lot. Say, 3 to 1.
</em><br>
<p>I speak from personal experience. Most people that I have spoken to about 
<br>
these issues feel deeply scared about even SL3 material. And most of these 
<br>
are highly intelligent. I think the deepest cause of this is the inherited 
<br>
fear of change. Transhumanism is about embracing change, and 
<br>
Singularitarianism even more so.
<br>
<p>What are your own experience when talking to people about SL3-4 stuff?
<br>
<p>/Christian
