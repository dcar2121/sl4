<p>If you wait for the Big Crunch (now postponed indefinitely by today's
<br>
astrophysicists, it seems) and use the asymptotic increase in energy
<br>
density to perform an infinite number of computing operations in a finite
<br>
amount of time, that's &quot;Omega Point&quot; computing.  This does make certain
<br>
unproven assumptions about the laws of physics, i.e., you can keep
<br>
subdividing space past the Planck length and so on.  It also assumes a Big
<br>
Crunch, while the current universe appears to be open.
<br>
<p>&quot;Alpha Point&quot; computing is if you spawn off a new universe and perform an
<br>
infinite (or, at a bare minimum, an astronomically large) number of
<br>
computations during the infinite (or astronomically large) energy
<br>
densities of that universe's Big Bang.  &quot;Alpha Line&quot; computing, a term
<br>
coined by yours truly, is if you transfer your computing patterns to yet
<br>
another universe as soon as the first one starts to cool down, and so on. 
<br>
An Alpha Line could also refer to a larger set of universes spawned by an
<br>
Alpha-Point-based civilization that needed to reproduce exponentially
<br>
rather than just hopping from one universe to another.  
<br>
<p>One would expect that well-designed Alpha Point universe would be
<br>
maximally massive and would have minimal expansion speed, and thus, would
<br>
probably recollapse almost immediately.  If one of the spawned Universes
<br>
malfunctions due to some weird &quot;inflation&quot; scenario, then instead of
<br>
recollapsing immediately as expected, it might end up expanding and
<br>
cooling to form galaxies, stars, habitable planets, and civilizations that
<br>
go through their own Singularities and start their own Alpha Lines; if so,
<br>
the hierarchy of Alpha Lines forms an Alpha Family.
<br>
<p>This doesn't require sloppy superintelligences - you would only need an
<br>
infinitesimal proportion of malfunctioning universes to get a very large
<br>
Alpha Family.  Even if an Alpha Line just hops from universe to universe
<br>
instead of reproducing, our own universe has seen roughly 10^60 Planck
<br>
instants go past since the dawn of time, and I doubt a universe works very
<br>
well for Alpha Point computing after cooling past the Planck time, so our
<br>
Parent Alpha Line would have spawned at least another 10^60 universes
<br>
since our own Socrates Universe was born and discarded as unsuitable due
<br>
to a cosmological constant beyond engineering tolerances.
<br>
<p>None of this is provable, but what the heck, it's fun.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I first named our home space the &quot;Socrates Universe&quot; in a
<br>
discussion of Alpha Lines on the Extropian mailing list, and as far as I
<br>
know, it was the first time anyone ever needed to come up with a name. 
<br>
Who knows, maybe someday it'll become official.
