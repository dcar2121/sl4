<p>&lt;&lt; What is this strange fascination that the word &quot;SL5&quot; seems to exert over
<br>
&nbsp;people?  Why do so many people, confronted with SL0 through SL4, feel this
<br>
&nbsp;impulse to top it by coming up with SL5?  Oh, never mind.  Anyway... &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Why did the universe, confronted with amoebas, plants, and animals, feel the 
<br>
impulse to top it with human beings?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The absolute primacy of rationality and intelligence is what must be
<br>
preserved, above all, as Singularitarian ideas begin to reach out beyond
<br>
the core audience of scientifically literate aggressive rationalists. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Look forward to Singularitarian ideas reaching far, far beyond the &quot;core 
<br>
audience of scientifically literate aggressive rationalists&quot; in the very near 
<br>
future.  Instead of insisting that the meme be stapled down to its original 
<br>
tiny group, (however rational and intelligent they may be) perhaps we should 
<br>
be considering what variants would have the best net result in conditions of 
<br>
imminent mass propagation.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>In that case, the Friendliness un-aware AI researchers might reach seed AI 
<br>
before you...you wouldn't want that, would you?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The vast majority of fanatics do not know how to
<br>
safely handle this mental plutonium in order to use it as fuel&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Evidently my fanatic publication worked as a fuel to prompt you into writing 
<br>
a quite lengthy message about fanaticism which I shall shortly print out, 
<br>
highlight the key parts, and file away in one of my binders to think about, 
<br>
hah!  And it also prompted this string of mails and fired off a good amount 
<br>
of synapses in those who read it hopefully...I originally wrote it because, 
<br>
from experience, I thought some of the items stated in your original FSL 
<br>
essay were out of place and wanted to change them...I also wanted to expand 
<br>
on each of them, because I thought they were far too brief.  If you aren't 
<br>
willing to spend the time to write such a document on your own, then 
<br>
unfortunately you're going to have to settle with what others, of various 
<br>
degrees of anthropocentrism and unintelligence, have to offer in the form of 
<br>
Singularity-related material.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;At this time, and from the &quot;Shock Level Analysis&quot; page, I don't think
<br>
Michael Anissimov dodged successfully.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>So I fell prey to irrational fanaticism?  I published that page just to get 
<br>
something, *anything* new on the Singularity into the memepool.  I have very 
<br>
little writing experience.  I have very little knowledge of evolutionary 
<br>
psychology.  I think it had a net positive effect however.  I also got my 
<br>
personal work reviewed by one of the most technologically enlightened, 
<br>
future-conscious, and progressive groups in the whole of history, amongst 
<br>
whom could be the savior of the Universe.  As a cognitive scientist you 
<br>
should be aware of such intricacies of human motivations.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The main thing that I think represents a real problem is the
<br>
&quot;us vs. them&quot; mindset - what I usually call the &quot;group polarization&quot;
<br>
dynamic, the tribalism instincts from evolutionary psychology.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It could be argued that even in creating distinct labels for those with 
<br>
different levels of future shock is perpetuating a group polarization 
<br>
mentality.  Keep in mind that a successful memeticist (but not a cognitive 
<br>
scientist) will use flaws in the human psychology to ver advantage, 
<br>
oftentimes even projecting these flaws outwards from verself for the purpose 
<br>
of harmonizing with larger portions of society.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If you're going to be an extremist, you have to be aware of the forces
<br>
underlying human nature.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Once again, you should be looking forward to and preparing for the arrival of 
<br>
swarms of extremists unaware of the forces underlying human nature.  The 
<br>
&quot;velocity&quot; of the memetic being known as Singularitarianism will slowly, then 
<br>
extremely quickly begin to accelerate, and unfortunately, these extremists 
<br>
will not have the benefit of hearing what you have to say about the forces 
<br>
underlying human nature.  Pity, but true.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;You should not use it to divide humanity into tribes, place your own tribe 
<br>
at the top, and heap hatred on the rest.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Fyi, I'm not at the top.  SL5 seems to be currently unattainable due to 
<br>
impracticality in the absence of certain smart drugs, advanced interfaces, 
<br>
and insufficent temporal proximity to the Singularity event.  When you wrote 
<br>
FSL, what shock level did you consider yourself...?  I don't hate anyone.  I 
<br>
just want to raise awareness.  Help the Shock Level ascension process.  Also, 
<br>
designating individuals into tribes implies treating the tribes differently.  
<br>
Do you have any evidence of me doing this?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;(Hence all the attempts to top the scale with SL5, of course.)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Are you denying the existence of any possible progression beyond what you 
<br>
outlined as &quot;SL4&quot;?
<br>
<p>There's some pretty darned hateful language in there, which I will avoid
<br>
quoting permanently in the SL4 archives, in case Anissimov decides to
<br>
change it.
<br>
<p>Oops.  Send me a mail of what you considered hateful.  I do plan to change 
<br>
it, I've been changing it around for the past few months.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Why hate?  What does it accomplish?  What good
<br>
does it do?  It sure doesn't help you outthink an opponent.  It is
<br>
instinctive to hate, and it may even be politically useful to the
<br>
individual to whip up hate against opponents (it worked for McCarthy), but
<br>
the point is that it doesn't accomplish anything useful in terms of the
<br>
actual *goal*.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Not hate, but perhaps &quot;playful ridicule&quot; of lower shock levels could speed up 
<br>
the process of ascension.  Humanity doesn't play by the rules of absolute 
<br>
un-anthropocentrism, as I'm sure you're well aware.  Most people think its 
<br>
more fun to read anyhow, look at Ben's comments!
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Awful...as I stated earlier, I think the value of this discussion outweighs 
<br>
any awfulness in my non-carefully put together writings.  And here, me, a 
<br>
young quasi-intelligent aspiring Singularitarian writer being put down by the 
<br>
very intellectual leader who prompted him to write about the topic in the 
<br>
first place!  No matter how right you are, perhaps you should adopt a less 
<br>
scathing and more constructive-sounding paradigm for criticism in the future, 
<br>
it encourages people to like you more!  Maybe, sometimes, just a drop of 
<br>
apparent rationality should be sacrificed for the sake of a higher feeling of 
<br>
brother/sisterhood, which could in turn initiate more, and more valuable, 
<br>
collaboration and discussion in the future.
