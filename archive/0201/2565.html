Title:  Blue Light
<br>
Author:  Walter Mosley
<br>
ISBN:  0-316-57098-2
<br>
<p>When I was in the bookstore and looking at the bargain books (because 
<br>
after I bought my text books I couldn't afford much else ;-)), one 
<br>
caught my eye titled /Blue Light/.  I picked it up and the inside flap 
<br>
described what sounded like a story of trans and posthumans as they get 
<br>
started and deal with the world.  Well, they are in there, but I was 
<br>
disappointed with the novel overall.
<br>
<p>The plot is foggy and not really there.  Stuff happens, but things never 
<br>
really get anywhere (interesting, anyway).  The problem, of course, is 
<br>
that we don't know what kind of plans posthumans might have, so of 
<br>
course the human reader (and writer) would have to miss what is really 
<br>
going on.  Characterization is good, though.  We see transhumans 
<br>
struggling with their still human biologies mixed with advanced 
<br>
thought.  There are also posthuman characters who make about as much 
<br>
sense as one of Heinlein's Martians, but at least there aren't many 
<br>
signs of them thinking like humans (in part that's because we simply 
<br>
don't see that much of them).  The book's main problems are that it gets 
<br>
a bit mystical at times, there's lots of useless sex, and the plot just 
<br>
isn't there.
<br>
<p>In all, the book never really drew me in.  The characters didn't seem 
<br>
real.  The plot does have all the basic parts, but it takes a back seat 
<br>
to getting laid and mysticism.  /Blue Light/ is a good example of why 
<br>
posthuman plots are beyond us.  Of course, it may just be that I don't 
<br>
like this writer and his pulpy style.
