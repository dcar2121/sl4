Hello friends,
<br>
<p>I joined the list a couple of days ago, and wanted to wait and get in on the discussions until I finished up a piece of writing that I've been working on.  A little bit about myself...
<br>
<p>I graduated law school at the ripe old age of 18, after getting a BA in Sociology.  Instead of taking the bar, I played poker for a living for about a year.  Than I did the whole dot-com thing for awhile... a gambling related website.  It rose pretty quick, and then fell even quicker.  Ouch.
<br>
<p>Back in school, I was always very interested in the possibility of life extension.  I made it a personal goal to go back to school and work on extending life indefinitely, as I saw this as a big component to speeding up advancement of the human race.  I thought I was original.  About four months ago, I stumbled onto transhumanism and realized that I wasn't.
<br>
<p>So here I am.  Some of you have heard from me before, because I've been emailing a few of you... I'm an impatient guy.  But I have a true account of what I think was a personal, microcosmic singularity (is that a new term?).  It doesn't contain the answers to life, the universe, and everything... but it contains the process to how I found the answers.  
<br>
<p>I have a plan to get the world safely to a post-human state.  It does not involve no sex.  Quite the opposite.  It does not involve turning off the television.  Again, quite the opposite.  I firmly believe that transhumanism is an extension of humanism.  If you can't have fun being human, why do you think you'll have fun being posthuman?  At least as a human there are answers to find, problems to solve...
<br>
<p>HERE WE GO!
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Deacon Kuhns
<br>
(But the ladies call me DICK)
