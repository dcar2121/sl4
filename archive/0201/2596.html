<em>&gt; Hello SL4,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My friend Steve Harris wrote this interesting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educational article on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity (among other topics) a few months back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I helped him with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; background research and a few ideas. I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned out quite nicely. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't share his suspicion that the emergence could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be isolating (violates my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed principle of information integration), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's for me to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove, of course, and here he nicely explores a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range of sci-fi archetypes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of non-Borgifying Transcensions. I think Damien and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several others on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list would enjoy it.
</em><br>
<p>Although I found his coverage amazing in its breadth
<br>
and depth, especially its coverage of historical
<br>
sci-fi themes, there are so many holes in his
<br>
narrative that I wouldn't even know where to begin.  I
<br>
only have one comment which may get me flamed as fast
<br>
I recently subscribed to this list:
<br>
<p>I find the overwhelming majority of fear and
<br>
trepidation surrounding almost all conjectures on SI
<br>
to be based on a couple of flawed cognitive hangups:
<br>
<p>1) Fear of the unknown, of creating and/or being in
<br>
the presence of somethng much more powerful than
<br>
ourselves.  The overhwhelming majority of sci-fi,
<br>
marred in primitive and archaic
<br>
emotional/terrirotorial squabbles, picturing aliens as
<br>
invading the earth for our so-called 'precious'
<br>
resources and the rediculous amount of horror coming
<br>
out of hollywood is the primary culprit in
<br>
perpetuating this irrational all-pervasive fear.  Even
<br>
the Matrix, an awesome film in its own right, portrays
<br>
the creation of an SI as wholly catastrophic for the
<br>
human species.
<br>
<p>2) The other primary culprit, which actually is the
<br>
deep cause of 1) above is the general and
<br>
all-pervasive malaise and emotional pain and
<br>
ill-health that effects nearly everyone on the planet
<br>
to an astonishing degree.  We are only beginning to
<br>
unlock the emotinional underpinnings of sound
<br>
emotional health and happiness.  I could go into great
<br>
length discussing the intricies of MAO-inhibbiters,
<br>
dopamine, seratonin, etc. but I won't.  Please read
<br>
David Pearce's the Hedonistic Imperative for a more
<br>
fully discussed exposition on the topic. Bottom line,
<br>
it's rather silly that psychologically sick people,
<br>
albiet functional in an aqually sociological sick
<br>
society, attempting to discuss what SI's may or may
<br>
not do.  I fully suspect that sufficiently advanced SI
<br>
in any form will suffer none of the emotional
<br>
sicknesses or petty problems that we current find
<br>
ourselves stuck in.
<br>
<p>Concluding Prediction: Any sufficiently advanced SI
<br>
will be equally more benign than we are.
<br>
