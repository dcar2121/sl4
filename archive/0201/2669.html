Mmm, sorry for the delay.  I'm preparing a much more lengthy statement on 
<br>
this whole situation about ethics for release sometime this weekend, I hope 
<br>
to shock/interest/scare people.  I believe wholeheartedly in ethics.  I don't 
<br>
believe in geniuses wasting their time giving me reviews in evolutionary 
<br>
psychology, however.  I consider myself quite non-anthropomorphic and strive 
<br>
to acheive more control over my mind everyday.  I'm not interested in 
<br>
hijacking the Singularity meme for my &quot;selfish purposes&quot;, I'm only interested 
<br>
in acheiving the Singularity as soon as possible.  It's not that I *want* to 
<br>
mass propagate the meme, I just believe it is 100% inevitable that it will 
<br>
mass propagate itself within very short time.  If we don't think about it, it 
<br>
will propagate without any control.  The meme is already in proto-form 
<br>
everywhere, the &quot;building is already rigged with dynamite&quot; so to speak.  And 
<br>
6 years is too long for such a minute amount of progress.  I believe we need 
<br>
more Singularitarians and more specialization.  But more on that in my 
<br>
statement.  Yes I am frustrated with the slow progress of the Singularity 
<br>
meme, extremely, but I never had any intention of abandoning ethics, and I 
<br>
think this faulty assumption came about primarily due to my first AIM 
<br>
conversation with Eliezer in which I showed sympathy and a desire to think 
<br>
about (but not necessary a commitment to) mass propagation of the Singularity 
<br>
meme, or at least a greater degree of propagation than we see today.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The memes that are optimized for maximum propagation are NOT
<br>
THE SAME MEMES OPTIMIZED FOR ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SINGULARITY.  The
<br>
memes that propagate best are pretty much *useless* for achieving the
<br>
Singularity.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Sorry, I don't see how a meme that has &quot;Singularity!  Eternal Life!  AI!&quot; 
<br>
posted all over it could be entirely useless for acheiving the Singularity.  
<br>
I also think some folks are suffering from undue paranoia and distrust of the 
<br>
public.  I don't think the universe is built to allow us to all die out, its 
<br>
just a question of *when* we take this next step in evolution, not *if*.  I 
<br>
never had any intention of exploiting mental flaws in people, I just have a 
<br>
desire to communicate the Singularity meme to people on *their* level.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;As it is, believe me when I say that, ethical violation or no, you are
<br>
definitely messing up the memetic side of this.  It is quite possible that
<br>
reporters will spend the next five years quoting you as definitive proof
<br>
that all Singularitarians are ends-justifies-means scary fanatics.  Don't
<br>
think that reporters aren't that evil; they are.  Don't think that they
<br>
don't know how to use a search engine; they do.  Don't think that because
<br>
you think a webpage is, in your mind, only for the &quot;inner circle&quot;, that
<br>
that's how it'll be used; reporters will read it and they will quote it. 
<br>
Everything is out in the open, which is indeed as it should be, but it
<br>
also means that you've just screwed up.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Oh my.  You'd better get 100 web pages out there made by SingInst people with 
<br>
SingInst views in that case, because a chain reaction and runaway of the 
<br>
Singularity meme will most definitely happen soon, reporters will quote the 
<br>
rogue Singularitarians, etc etc etc.  YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE YOUR ADVICE 
<br>
TO EVERY SINGULARITARIAN, ELIEZER.  I appreciate yours very much, but think 
<br>
you are wasting your time, and should primarily focus on AI development and a 
<br>
strong foundation for our community rather than &quot;group ridiculer&quot;.  You 
<br>
should have other people to do this for you, if need be.  Has anyone here 
<br>
heard of the &quot;Transtopian&quot; philosophy?  They were mentioning eugenics on 
<br>
their site right and left, right beside the Singularity mentions, and nothing 
<br>
bad has happened yet...expect many more cult-ish type Singularity 
<br>
organizations to pop up very soon as well.  You won't be able to stop them no 
<br>
matter how hard you try.  Even if everyone on the SL4 list tried, it will 
<br>
shortly get out of our hands very soon.  I'm suggesting we think carefully 
<br>
not about *if* we should spread the meme, but *how*, because its spread is 
<br>
unpreventable.  It's like trying to eliminate AIDS by insisting that everyone 
<br>
on the planet become abstinent.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If you
<br>
propose being &quot;pragmatic&quot; and abandoning all ethics in order to promote a
<br>
debased form of the Singularity meme, what other response could you
<br>
possibly expect from existing Singularitarians?  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I believe strongly in ethics.  Existing Singularitarians will eventually 
<br>
become less relevant than they are now, due to my prediction of mass 
<br>
propagation.  Anyway, I'd appreciate it if people would check with me 
<br>
personally before writing entire mails criticizing a pov that I don't even 
<br>
hold.
<br>
<p>For a more ethical Singularity,
<br>
Michael Anissimov
