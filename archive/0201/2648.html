</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Even a complete altruist still has some subgoals that intersect the
<br>
altruist.  Mentally I label these CIPBs, which stands for
<br>
&quot;context-insensitive personal benefit&quot;.  As any altruist knows, you've got
<br>
to be careful around CIPBs.  There are some basic emotions which create
<br>
CIPB goals as direct drives, and some political emotions which promote
<br>
CIPB goals created for other purposes.  There are subtler problems, but
<br>
that's 90% of them right there.  The goal is not actually to eliminate all
<br>
CIPBs, but instead to bring their intensities and content into
<br>
correspondence with the goal system that would be produced by, say, a
<br>
Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>Again, the point is not to eliminate all CIPBs, but to bring them into
<br>
correspondence with the local subgoals that would be naturally produced by
<br>
a cleanly altruistic system, and keep them from going any further.
<br>
<p>The simple but wrong description would be to say that I got Greg Bear to
<br>
autograph the book because it would give me a warm fuzzy feeling [note:
<br>
CIPB] and the warm fuzzy feeling would increase my level of mental energy
<br>
which would increase my Singularity productivity.  This is a valid chain
<br>
of reasoning as long as it's not being given undue strength by innate CIPB
<br>
drives or the political CIPB-favoring emotions.  The complex and correct
<br>
decision is that rather than re-evaluating this class of decision for each
<br>
occasion, I decided to &quot;validate&quot; this particular CIPB as an okay emotion
<br>
most of the time, and rely on my category-recognition system to catch any
<br>
specific cases where it wasn't.
<br>
<p>The point is that I got the autograph to have fun, because I've learned
<br>
that I need a certain level of fun to stay productive.  So I've validated
<br>
many, but not all, of the fun-producing emotions.  But there are other
<br>
CIPBs that I have not validated because I don't expect a net benefit to
<br>
the Singularity.  Getting Greg Bear to sign the book was a very low-risk
<br>
form of fun that did not consume a significant amount of time and may even
<br>
have minor direct Singularity benefits at some point or another.
<br>
<p>Of course, when it comes to fun, I rather doubt that I'm at even a local
<br>
optimum - i.e., I am undoubtedly having either too much fun or not enough
<br>
fun - but I do seem to be at the best optimum I can reach by deliberate
<br>
tweaks of the system.  The deeper point is that even if there are still
<br>
drives pushing on the CIPBs in one way or another, my long-term goals and
<br>
strategy are very firmly aligned on the Singularity.  I can't totally
<br>
revise the fun-management system because the basic goal, mental energy, is
<br>
too tangled with the goals that manage the activities that renew mental
<br>
energy - there is no way to maintain mental energy through pure reasoning;
<br>
all you can do is optimize mental energy against effort and risk by
<br>
managing the existing goal system.  When it comes to strategy I have a lot
<br>
more leeway to clean things up.  So the mental energy fun management
<br>
system isn't as clean as I'd like, but even so it amounts to a few drives
<br>
messing around with my local CIPB intensity levels for things like whether
<br>
or not I should listen to an MP3 or keep on working.  If you're talking
<br>
about something like choosing one Singularity strategy over another
<br>
because it affects my chances of becoming a celebrity, then no frickin'
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>And yes, Ben, the inside of my head really does look like this; yes, it
<br>
took a few years and a lot of practice to get there; and no, I haven't
<br>
been struck dead by lightning for daring to defy the tin gods of the
<br>
genome.  You should try it sometime.  It's fun.
