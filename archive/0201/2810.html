This is true today, because it is a lot of work to create a new 
<br>
intelligent being now. If there will be AIs, it will be quite trivial to 
<br>
duplicate them and let them
<br>
develop into different directions. Then, there will be the simple 
<br>
choice: do we want to duplicate an AI or do we upload a human? I think that
<br>
AIs will be much much more effective in using computational resources 
<br>
than uploaded humans whose brains are mainly devoted to tasks
<br>
completely useless inside a computer.
<br>
<p>If I would be an AI, I would not spend a picosecond to think about how 
<br>
to convince a human to upload.In fact I would try to persuade them not 
<br>
to do it,
<br>
and use the remaining space for something more &quot;interesting&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anyway, my original remark was meant  quite sarcastic. I just wanted to 
<br>
point out that the whole discussion was on a very very low level:
<br>
The problem is that the question whether to upload or not is not 
<br>
interesting at all. There are a lot of other question which can be asked 
<br>
regarding
<br>
uploading:
<br>
<p>Is it uploading at all when you are uploaded, but your programm does not 
<br>
get any processor time, but stored in some backup space?
<br>
<p>Are you uploaded, if you get 1cycle processor time per year?  One cycle 
<br>
per femtosecond?
<br>
<p>Will Bill Gates get a farm of supercomputers to run on, while poor 
<br>
people will have to share a cheap PC to live in?
<br>
<p>When are two uploaded being the same or different?
<br>
<p>Etc, etc...
<br>
<p>I don't want to discuss or answer these questions. It is hopeless.  What 
<br>
I mean: concepts like being death or alive won't  have a meaning anymore.
<br>
Our whole today perspective will be ridiculous that time, and I don't 
<br>
think that humanity will play an important role at all.
