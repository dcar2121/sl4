<em>&gt;&gt; I'll be deeply saddened if [...] six billion people choose to voluntarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; die,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And is it *bad* for the people involved if it's their choice.  I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why, necessarily.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Their _educated_ choice? I'm not sure I would call any of us, who haven't even
<br>
lived a hundred years, and that's a hundred years in today's limited society, I
<br>
wouldn't call any of us educated on the subject of living forever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My wife does not wish to live forever -- she realizes it may well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, but her choice will be to die &quot;naturally.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Do you think she would feel differently if she pondered the idea for a few
<br>
more years - say just a thousand more?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I do manage to live essentially forever, as I hope and mostly believe will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen, then I'll sure as fuck miss her, but I won't feel sad for her.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I have a wife and four children. It's difficult to think about the far future.
<br>
I don't know.  But that's my answer for now - &quot;I don't know&quot; - and I'm going
<br>
(try) to avoid any choices (like death) that would forever preclude getting to
<br>
&quot;now I know&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is her own choice and her own method for structuring her life and her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psyche. [...]  There is a oneness with nature that some people feel, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads them to feel the &quot;right&quot; thing is to die a natural death.  This same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneness with nature makes these same people very uncomfortable with the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of themselves personally uploading.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think that's because she was raised in a society with an entire history of
<br>
inevitable death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am pissed by people who want to stop ME from uploading -- it's none of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their damn business.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;In the end, I would/will accept the same for people who choose to die. It's
<br>
not my choice.  But that's not going to make me like it.
<br>
&nbsp;And I disagree with your wording, it _is_ your business, but it's not your
<br>
choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I do manage to live essentially forever, as I hope and mostly believe
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;My nightmare scenario:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student 1: &quot;It's too bad Uncle Rob didn't live until they solved the problems
<br>
of immortality.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student 2: &quot;Yeh, if only he could have held on for another 800 years. The
<br>
cure was just around the corner. Then he would have had plenty of time to
<br>
finish his theories.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Student 1: &quot;Yep. Well, I have to get back to this report, it's due in 3
<br>
millennia, and I've barely started. It's about time I graduated, 5 million
<br>
years in school is just too long.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;800 years. Just another 800 years....
