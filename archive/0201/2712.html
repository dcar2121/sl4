<p>
&lt;&lt;Unlike you, I have made it my business to seek out almost every possible
<br>
type of experience.  Call it a combination of curiosity and adventurousness
<br>
and recklessness.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My ideal self, my &quot;optima persona&quot; if you will, is something like a mix 
<br>
between Ben and Eliezer.  I love Ben's thirst for experience and obvious 
<br>
impulse to transcend limited thought...but sadly I don't personally approve 
<br>
of the institution of marriage or the ultimate slavery to selfish genes; 
<br>
child-rearing.  And whenever I hear people over the age of 25 saying things 
<br>
like &quot;almost every possible type of experience&quot;, I am always highly 
<br>
skeptical, as there are a slew of experiences only available at the high 
<br>
school level, when real responsibilities don't exist.  =D   Also, oftentimes 
<br>
people don't push themselves far enough into the realm of new experience as 
<br>
they claim or envision themselves doing.  Because they are usually 
<br>
&quot;embarassing&quot; or are simply not mentioned, for example; changing subcultures, 
<br>
making yourself look really *really* weird once in a while (hundreds of 
<br>
people staring blankly at you can be enlightening), swimming on LSD, wearing 
<br>
clothes outside of the tiny spectrum of what is expected, using EP-Prime for 
<br>
a change instead of the usual English language, etc etc etc.  All of us 
<br>
subconsciously adhere to a strict code of behavior dictated by merciless and 
<br>
selfish genes and memes, and to even break out of it just a little bit 
<br>
requires *truely letting go*.  Slaves to genes could be called 
<br>
anthropocentrists.  Slaves to memes could be called mainstreamists.  My main 
<br>
fear of Eliezer-brand conservatism is adoption of the mainstream as a default 
<br>
memepool outside of the Singularitarian memepool.  However, his asceticism 
<br>
and mysterious powers of proto-autosentience intrigue and inspire me greatly, 
<br>
no matter how conservative he is.  I'm guessing the best approach is the 
<br>
&quot;Warrior-Monk&quot; path rather than just one or the other, which is who these two 
<br>
folks seem to represent.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ack, is that really possible?  How can an workaholic manage to raise children 
<br>
in an optimum manner?  Unfortunately I'm not that much of a workaholic, so I 
<br>
have to consciously push myself towards single asceticism.  
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;(Hey, if you ever get the urge to try
<br>
out the psychedelic thing, I'll trip with ya, dude!  Now that would be a
<br>
hell of a trip ;-&gt;)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>LoL, somebody get Eliezer some LSD quick!  The future of the universe could 
<br>
depend upon it!!  Wouldn't it be great if he got a sudden inspiration and was 
<br>
able to code a Seed AI immediately!  Feedback cycles are what everything is 
<br>
made up of, and I remember thinking through some *major* logic loops while 
<br>
tripping, and getting some not-valueless-at-all revelations...instead of 
<br>
*witnessing* the glorious interconnectedness of the universe on your first 
<br>
trip, do it the Eliezer way, *save* and *Singularity-ize* the universe on 
<br>
your first trip!  Yah yah!  Just a few thoughts...
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;So perhaps having a more
<br>
experimental and adventurous approach to life's various experiences is
<br>
better preparation&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Let's not pretend that any information we absorb into our miniscule brains 
<br>
through our miniscule information bandwidths will prepare us for the 
<br>
Singularity event itself.  Having a more novel/diverse viewpoint could help 
<br>
us *up to* the Singularity, however.  Good for memetics if nothing else.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; I *am* very devoted to it, but I'm also committed to
<br>
experiencing all that *this* pre-Singularity world has to offer, or at least
<br>
a damn good sample&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Hey, would you rather live as an amoeba and &quot;live life to the fullest&quot;, or 
<br>
spend a little bit less time doing so in exchange for turning into a God 
<br>
sooner and experiencing sensations on the order of a googleplex times more 
<br>
fullfilling and intense than those you currently experience?  I consider 
<br>
99.9% of all &quot;mainstream, anthro, mundane activity&quot; to be a huge 
<br>
lie/hoax/trick to slow down our evolution!  By slowing us down on Singularity 
<br>
work, of course.  Eliminate TV, magazines, Hollywood, concerts, sports, and 
<br>
newspapers from your life!  They are devils!!  You know you can do something 
<br>
more novel, something *no one has ever done before*, if you really want to 
<br>
open your mind a bit and maintain some practical Singularity-based value.
<br>
<p>and now Eli-related comments;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt; 
<br>
<em>&gt;   Err..  Eli, are you sure you realize just how much of human existence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DEFINED by sex and passion and all these other things Ben mentioned?
</em><br>
<p>Yep, I'd say no less than 35%.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Or even less.  Or we could redefine &quot;human existence&quot; for ourselves.  Just 
<br>
because there are mountains of books about sex and passion and they are 
<br>
intertwined in our culture doesn't mean they define our existence.  Selfish 
<br>
memes and genes.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;This doesn't mean I think that sex is worthless or morally wrong.  I
<br>
think sex is a great thing, for other people. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Having sex just a few times was more than enough for me, but I suppose I 
<br>
would engage in it for novelty/endorphin release/possible inspiration 
<br>
purposes.  With the right person of course, the right person being someone of 
<br>
currently unmeetable standards, hehe.  Congratulations Eliezer, you've made a 
<br>
important step ahead of us all.  I'm happy you aren't gonna go run off and 
<br>
fall in love and screw us all over.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Helping a
<br>
friend isn't likely to trigger a mental chain of events that ends by
<br>
sucking up all my Saturday nights until the end of time.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Meta-choices like whether to engage in sex/relationships can save us hundreds 
<br>
of hours of productivity and deep thought, unless the mate has *incredible* 
<br>
value, ie, nearly perfect in every way and constantly with theories to offer 
<br>
in our mutual area of study...I doubt &quot;Singularitarian Love&quot; has occured yet, 
<br>
but I think it will one day.  It would have to be a highly rational, 
<br>
objective-oriented (progress), low-maintenance, and unanthropocentric.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If you try and impose
<br>
the requirement that love serve as the most effective means to some other
<br>
end (i.e., the Singularity), the necessary conditions soon become so
<br>
exotic as to be entirely impossible.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Not entirely.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;stemming from the fact that love is something you put time
<br>
*into*, not something that you get time *out* of.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>In Singularitarian-love you would mutually get more enlightenment and 
<br>
development out of the relationship than the traditional amount for the time 
<br>
invested.  Exponential-return love!  But love is almost inherently 
<br>
anthropocentric.
<br>
<p>To Gordon;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In the past year and a half that I've been in love I have probably 
<br>
thought and rethought my theory of love 10 times or more. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Did rethinking your theory of love help inspire you to rethink your theories 
<br>
in other areas of you life as well?  Then it would be of true value.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Maybe in 
<br>
about five years I'll have something approaching a stable theory&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Human love nearly always be described as &quot;being a slave to the 
<br>
bioevolutionary force which happens to be millions of times slower and 
<br>
restrictive than the potential of technological or memetic evolution, which 
<br>
is our real salvation, but we don't care, because we like that opiate-like 
<br>
feeling when we're around _____ girl who could be much better than she is, 
<br>
who could actually inspire me, if she was a 
<br>
countersphexist/Singularitarian/AI researcher/extremely novel/etc.&quot;.  
<br>
<p>Sorry if I offended anybody.  Hah.   Just kidding.  I think we should offend 
<br>
ourselves as much as we can.
<br>
<p>Throwing around Singularity-focused ranting so you won't touch that TV dial,
<br>
