<em>&gt; &gt; What is this strange fascination that the word &quot;SL5&quot; seems to exert over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people?  Why do so many people, confronted with SL0 through SL4, feel
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impulse to top it by coming up with SL5?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One possible reason with some amount of merit:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There're a number of folks in &quot;the community&quot; for whom the Singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewed as &quot;opaque,&quot; apocalyptic, something beyond which nothing can be
</em><br>
known
<br>
<em>&gt; --- or at least, beyond which probabilities for various scenarios cannot
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; calculated at all.  For these folks, the Singularity is a kind of Rapture,
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; almost mystical, eschatological event in itself.  Let's call those folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;transhumanists&quot; with a nod to their tendency towards viewing things from
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; kind of genericized humanist viewpoint.  Let's say those people are the
</em><br>
ones
<br>
<em>&gt; for whome SL4 is really a terminal concern.  These people are, for
</em><br>
example,
<br>
<em>&gt; very concerned about the potential loss of individual human lives in the
</em><br>
time
<br>
<em>&gt; between now and Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SL5 folks would then be those for whome the truly long-term outcomes of
</em><br>
generic
<br>
<em>&gt; intelligence and the universe itself --- the cosmological eschatology
</em><br>
implied
<br>
<em>&gt; by physics and technology --- is the thing of interest and motivation, who
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; not reject the idea that even today's knowledge can tell us something
</em><br>
about the
<br>
<em>&gt; post-Singularity long-term.  For these folks, Singularities aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eschatological in any sense;  they're just business-as-usual, a standard
</em><br>
stop
<br>
<em>&gt; along the road from eukaryotic life to ascendant intelligence.  Let's call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those folks the &quot;posthumanists&quot; and posit that they've abandoned
</em><br>
priorities of
<br>
<em>&gt; individual or even species survival in favor of the notion of ultimate
</em><br>
survival
<br>
<em>&gt; of intelligence in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure that there are really hard-and-fast boundaries between these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things;  any classification scheme (like the existing SL levels) is a
</em><br>
coarse
<br>
<em>&gt; and inaccurate tool.  However, it might be useful to consider these two
</em><br>
points
<br>
<em>&gt; of view as relatively distinct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have to chime in that while Eli's Shock Levels is coarse and
<br>
neccessarily
<br>
innaccurate..this is even worse!  &quot;Transhumanist&quot; is a word that already has
<br>
an established meaning, similarly &quot;posthumanist&quot;.  This is like me hijacking
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI&quot; to refer to my new super-programmable Furbie!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SL3 people do not neccessarily follow the above schema. I'm hanging
<br>
out on SL3, my basic position is that I do not yet have sufficent grounding
<br>
in cogitive science (though it's my field of study) to be able to tell
<br>
whether Friendly Seed-based &gt;H AI is something we will be able
<br>
to do on the short time scales, and whether a single hard takeoff
<br>
is especially likely.
<br>
I don't think of the Singularity as a rapture.. It's just an emergent
<br>
property... not unknowable..just really really difficult. Ontotechnology
<br>
and magic physics for the Sysop is something lots of SL3ers reject.
