Dear Sl4,
<br>
<p>Penrose's argument rest on the assumption that we
<br>
cannot reduce the 'source' of conciousness to physcial
<br>
matter.  Even if he is right what difference would it
<br>
make?  Lets assume that he is right.  Lets assume that
<br>
the source of consciousness resides somewhere outside
<br>
of all currently known physical laws. This still would
<br>
not make a difference.  In fact it would only
<br>
strengthen the possibility of creating an AI.  How?
<br>
<p>We are ultimately all made out of the *same stuff*. 
<br>
At the core, regardless of any other details, we are
<br>
all made of matter, which is itself governed by
<br>
Quantum Mechanics and potential 'hidden variables'.
<br>
But this would apply to all physical matter here right
<br>
now on this planet.  Penrose presupposes that somehow
<br>
we humans are made out of different 'stuff' than
<br>
something we could artificially generate.  But how? 
<br>
If the source of consciousness resides 'outside'
<br>
somewhere why would it decide to emerge in a human
<br>
being and not a sufficiently and equally complex
<br>
artificially generated substrate? This just doesn't
<br>
make any sense regarldess of where you fall on the
<br>
'hard problem' of consciousness.
<br>
<p>In the scheme of things each time we give birth to a
<br>
baby we have just created a NEW intelligence on the
<br>
planet.  We could take this a step further and
<br>
artificially inseminate a women with slightly changed
<br>
DNA and we still get a altered-human that is capable
<br>
of intelligent thought.  Take this a step further we
<br>
utilize nanobots to molecular tweak the embryo during
<br>
development and we get an even more suped up infant. 
<br>
Further, we auto-catalyze the various chemicals from
<br>
raw matter and make a baby.  Now at this point we have
<br>
created out of raw matter a semi-biological human
<br>
capable of intelligence.  Taken another step forward
<br>
and we can 'play' with the nano enabled embryogenesis
<br>
and make new babies quicker faster and more
<br>
intelligent.  We can continue to tweak this process
<br>
until eventually we create a 'being' with a highly
<br>
engineered brain - totally artificial by any
<br>
definition.  Therefore we will have created an
<br>
'Artificial Intelligence'.
<br>
<p>So if if Penrose is right, at what point in this
<br>
continuing progression does the baby cease to have any
<br>
intelligence or consciousness?  If he is saying that
<br>
at some point the baby does cease to have any
<br>
consciousness then he is now contradicting himself and
<br>
falling on the other side of the 'hard problem' of
<br>
consciousness.  Becuase if at some point a human has
<br>
consciousness and an AI does not then he is
<br>
presupposing that there is some physical complexity
<br>
threshold that plays a role.  Either way, Penrose
<br>
arguments just don't make any sense to me.  His entire
<br>
argument seems obviously flimsy and filled with
<br>
logical holes that any freshment philosophy student
<br>
would catch.  Somebody please fill me in here on what
<br>
I am missing.
<br>
