</em><br>
<p>Suppose the UN decides to ban all Singularity-related research because it is 
<br>
&quot;incompatible with human dignity&quot;. If I understand you correctly, you would 
<br>
go ahead anyway to the best of your ability?
<br>
<p>The reason I ask is because I think that this is the most likely outcome if 
<br>
a sufficient number of people understood the concept of the Singularity and 
<br>
believed that it was a real possibility. The UN is now debating a world-wide 
<br>
ban on human cloning for no other reason than that cloning is scary stuff 
<br>
(see &quot;dignity&quot; above). And as you all know, the implications of cloning is 
<br>
nothing compared to those of the Singularity.
<br>
<p>If not an outright ban on AI-related research, my guess is that you could 
<br>
face a 10-year moratorium on AI-research (precautionary principle and all 
<br>
that). In this timeframe, there could be nanotech grey goo disasters or what 
<br>
have you.
<br>
<p>There is of course also the inevitable rise of neo-Luddite terrorist groups 
<br>
who would probably go to any length to stop you. The world will be at stake 
<br>
for them, literally. They could even have widespread public support.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;the *only* acceptable excuse for obeying public opinion in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case like that is if you genuinely think that the large majority opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is correct.
</em><br>
<p>With all this in mind, and what Eliezer wrote above, I suggest a simpler way 
<br>
of meme-spreading than what's been suggested by most people here: Don't do 
<br>
it. Don't spread the meme.
<br>
<p>Just how getting the Sing-meme widespread would greatly benefit the 
<br>
Singularity is not at all obvious to me. These are the reasons I have come 
<br>
across:
<br>
<p>1) More people hear about the Singularity ==&gt; More brilliant AI-programmers 
<br>
and open minded investors hear about S.
<br>
<p>Brilliant AI programmers would probably hear about you anyway. Investors 
<br>
would be harder to get probably, but not impossible.
<br>
The main problem is, as I described above, for every person that hears about 
<br>
S. and is pro-S, there will be 10 that is anti-S.
<br>
<p>2) If the meme start spreading anyway, it would be better if we put some 
<br>
positive spin on it to begin with.
<br>
<p>This is probably true, but I think what positive spin SingInst/SL4 produces 
<br>
will be swamped by negative spin once the meme is out in the media. Some 
<br>
people have stated that the meme is bound to start spreading (like the 
<br>
HIV-virus i believe the metaphor was). I do not think this must be the case 
<br>
(I could elaborate on this, but in a separate post).
<br>
<p>3) People have a right to know. (This is mostly unspoken, but this might be 
<br>
the strongest reason for some)
<br>
<p>People would also have a right to see the other side of the Singularity. If 
<br>
the two &quot;rights&quot; are mutually exclusive (which I think they are), one must 
<br>
take precedent over the other. To me, the obvious choice is the Singularity.
<br>
<p><p>Are there more reasons that I have left out that are more/as important?
<br>
<p>I think that making the S-meme widespread would harm your work more than 
<br>
help it. Since SingInst is thinking about paying people to do logotypes, I 
<br>
must suppose you don't agree with me. What are your arguments for this?
<br>
