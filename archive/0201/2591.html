&quot;But of course this reply is equally and exactly wrong; it is the other
<br>
&nbsp;side of what ends up being the same coin.&quot; mr. yudkowsky
<br>
-----------
<br>
I contest that I'm walking the middle path betwixt extremists.  I am the
<br>
ultimate grey.
<br>

<br>
&quot;there is only one reality&quot; mr. yudkowsky
<br>
-----------
<br>
Prove it   :-p
<br>
-----------
<br>
Notwithstanding that my outlook on life is practically defined by your
<br>
&quot;Meaning of Life&quot; document, I fail to understand what drives you to think
<br>
that there is one correct reality.  Maybe your phrasing just escapes me.
<br>
Perhaps you mean that there is one ideal universal situation and we must
<br>
strive towards it.  Even so, that does not give &quot;you&quot; the right to exercise
<br>
intolerance of people who are &quot;wrong&quot; (by your personal definition).
<br>
<p>Speaking right and wrong, would it really be so &quot;wrong&quot; if a
<br>
superintelligence justified the extermination of humanity?  Can you justify
<br>
the existence of the human race?  Even if we do spawn a superintelligence,
<br>
it is in no way obligated to protect us based solely on that we believe it
<br>
should.  Obviously the SI is smarter than any of us, so if it is deemed
<br>
universally &quot;wrong&quot; to prolong human existence, who are we to fight back or
<br>
try to prevent the Singularity?  If the greater good is really our interest,
<br>
Friendly AI is a very low priority.
<br>
<p>Off on yet another tangent, does there exist an organized anti-Singularity
<br>
community?  Have any among us ever been contacted by someone who violently
<br>
desired to prevent the Singularity?  If there does not yet exist such a
<br>
forum, I propose a message board be organized for debate between those who
<br>
do or do not support the Singulatarian cause.  Quelling the fears of the
<br>
lesser shock levels is certainly of greater precedence than ensuring that
<br>
the coming superintelligence(s) pamper us without justification.  If
<br>
humanity truly need be eradicated, it will occur inevitably.
<br>
<p>By the way, the visible universe has an net hue of teal. (irrelevant fact)
