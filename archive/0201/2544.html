<em>&gt; Of Eliezer S. Yudkowsky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 06, 2002 10:32 AM

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Open Mind Common Sense project
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, my opinion on the Open Mind project remains as previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asserted:  The gathered information of the Open Mind project is useless to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI.  Maybe a human research team will be able to do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting with it, like investigate clustering in human opinion space,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to an AI it is raw, opaque, ungrounded, unsemantic data.  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus little point in debating what use the information would be to an AI;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it only appears as information to *us* because we are already general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences, capable of human language comprehension, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-existing, experientially grounded English lexicon.
</em><br>
<p>My opinion on this is not as extreme as Eliezer's, but is in basically the
<br>
same vein.
<br>
<p>I think it is possible there will be some stage of development of a &quot;real
<br>
AI&quot; at which
<br>
this kind of data will be useful.
<br>
<p>The stage would be:
<br>
<p>1) A decent but not perfect understanding of human NL
<br>
<p>2) A strong cognitive capability, honed on domains where the AI has direct
<br>
experience
<br>
<p>For an AI at this phase of development, the Open Mind / mindpixel kind of
<br>
data could
<br>
potentially be informative.
<br>
<p>The statement
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To an AI the Open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mind corpus is not information, it is noise.
</em><br>
<p>is rather oversimplistic (and presumably was intended to for polemical
<br>
purposes).
<br>
<p>Of course, to an AI at the stage I described above,
<br>
it would *not* be &quot;noise&quot; in the strict sense, it would be a combination of
<br>
&quot;noise&quot; and
<br>
useful information.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The entire Open Mind project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is based on a fundamentally misguided approach to intelligence, Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Old-Fashioned AI at its worst,
</em><br>
<p>When I talked to Push, this did not really seem to be the case.  He did not
<br>
seem to have
<br>
any fixed philosophy on AI in mind.  Rather, what seemed to be motivating
<br>
him was a respect
<br>
for *data*.  He said that he considered all existing approaches to AI to be
<br>
obviously unsatisfactory,
<br>
and he hoped that, over time, playing with his data might be a part of the
<br>
process of arriving
<br>
at a satisfactory approach.
<br>
<p>There is certainly a chicken-and-egg problem here, in that by the time it
<br>
can understand this commonsense
<br>
data, an AI system has got to have a lot of NLP knowledge, but how can it
<br>
gain this knowledge without some
<br>
commonsense data?  But this just means that the OpenMind data is not a magic
<br>
pill for commonsense knowledge,
<br>
it doesn't imply that it couldn't be part of a valuable approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and its only innovative aspect is that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has roped in a large audience of to-be-disappointed Internet volunteers.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, roping in volunteers from the Net is not an innovation, and nor
<br>
is
<br>
disappointing them ;&gt;
