hey there,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My attempt at a somewhat-new question is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How could some preeminent scientists, in this day and age, defend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that existing computer power (or even a lot less than it),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined with some rather simple but undiscovered programming technique,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be sufficient for general intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>My own belief is a little bit off from this, but not so far off.
<br>
<p>I believe that existing computer power is adequate for general intelligence,
<br>
and that what is required is a *not all that simple* design (I wouldn't call
<br>
it a &quot;programming technique&quot;).
<br>
<p>I also think that computers of 10 years ago, if not *quite* adequate for
<br>
human-level general intelligence, would have been adequate for a lot *more*
<br>
general intelligence than they were ever made to manifest.
<br>
<p>I think the idea that there's a single simple trick for realising AGI
<br>
(artificial general intelligence) is a fallacy.  I think that intelligence
<br>
requires the integration of a fair number of tricks in a mutually
<br>
interadapted
<br>
way so as to give rise to the emergent structures of intelligence.
<br>
<p>I think that the reason we don't have AGI yet is that the field of AI has
<br>
not
<br>
been focused on the right things.  Because AI comes out of the standard
<br>
tradition
<br>
of reductionist Western science, and the mind does not easily yield itself
<br>
to
<br>
this kind of thinking.  We do not have good scientific tools for thinking
<br>
about
<br>
complex emergent structures, and how to coax their emergence from the
<br>
physical systems
<br>
at hand.
<br>
<p>But the good news is, folks, my friends and I have arrived at *a* workable
<br>
design
<br>
for AGI ;)  We call it Novamente, it's the successor to Webmind.  Webmind
<br>
was basically
<br>
workable too, but had a couple problems, such as:
<br>
<p>1) the &quot;core&quot; components were not implemented in a way leading to adequate
<br>
efficiency
<br>
on a von Neumann architecture (&quot;core&quot; refers to lower-level services like
<br>
memory
<br>
management, scheduling, etc.)
<br>
<p>2) the interface between declarative and procedural mind was not worked out
<br>
correctly
<br>
<p>3) the overall design was too complex which made it hard for even us
<br>
supernerds to
<br>
manage all the interrelations between the parts
<br>
<p>We have now resolved these problems and arrived at a pretty bloody good
<br>
design if I do
<br>
say so myself.  And we are working toward implementing it, but not as fast
<br>
as we'd like,
<br>
because he have a small team, and we are spending part of our time applying
<br>
simple parts
<br>
of the system to solving practical problems in the bioinformatics domain,
<br>
because we need
<br>
to eat...
<br>
<p>&quot;Novamente&quot; = &quot;new mind&quot; in Portuguese, it also =&quot;anew/afresh/again&quot;....  As
<br>
a background
<br>
meaning, it = &quot;new lie&quot; ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>Anyway, to get back to your original question, you have, in me, a *genuine
<br>
live specimen*
<br>
illustrating the phenomenon that has been puzzling you.  Probe and poke
<br>
away, and see what
<br>
my various delusions and psychological peculiarities will yield to the
<br>
scientific instrument of
<br>
your mind...  ;-&gt;
