<em>&gt;   Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oftentimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people don't push themselves far enough into the realm of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they claim or envision themselves doing.  Because they are usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;embarassing&quot; or are simply not mentioned, for example; changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subcultures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making yourself look really *really* weird once in a while (hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people staring blankly at you can be enlightening), swimming on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LSD, wearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothes outside of the tiny spectrum of what is expected, using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EP-Prime for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a change instead of the usual English language, etc etc etc.
</em><br>
<p>I have done all the things you mention many times, except for using
<br>
EP-Prime.
<br>
<p>I must note, though, that doing things like taking massive amounts of drugs
<br>
and wearing weird clothes (or womens' clothes, or no clothes) were more
<br>
interesting
<br>
to me when I was in the age range 16-22 than they are at the moment....  Not
<br>
that
<br>
they offend me, but the urge rarely arises anymore....  As for &quot;changing
<br>
subcultures,&quot;
<br>
I have seen an awful lot of subcultures, from &quot;common criminals &amp; junkies&quot;
<br>
to super-rich
<br>
Wall Street traders, rock musicians, used car dealers, scientists, artists,
<br>
etc. etc.
<br>
But these days I seem to mostly keep to my certain group of renaissance-geek
<br>
friends...
<br>
<p>But I do obviously admit there are many aspects of human experience of which
<br>
I have not partaken.
<br>
I have never fought in a war.  I have never climbed Everest, K2 or any
<br>
comparable peak.
<br>
I have never engaged in sexual acts with farm animals (in spite of having
<br>
lived in
<br>
New Zealand a while ;).  I have been very poor and temporarily lacking
<br>
enough money to
<br>
eat, but I have never been literally homeless.  I have never lost a limb....
<br>
I have never
<br>
injected heroin....  There are limits to what any one human can experience
<br>
during their
<br>
lifetime while still devoting themselves to art, science and family; and
<br>
there are some
<br>
experiences for which the danger outweighs the excitement and curiosity....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliminate TV, magazines, Hollywood, concerts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sports, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newspapers from your life!  They are devils!!
</em><br>
<p>Well, y'know, I don't watch TV, I read few magazines, (Scientific American),
<br>
I'm bored by spectator sports... but you're not going to convince me to push
<br>
*music* out of my life to increase my effectiveness in working toward the
<br>
Singularity.  Sorry...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;This doesn't mean I think that sex is worthless or morally wrong.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think sex is a great thing, for other people. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having sex just a few times was more than enough for me,
</em><br>
<p>You mean *all total*, not per day, right???
<br>
<p>Hey, I know some girls who might be able to change your mind about this....
