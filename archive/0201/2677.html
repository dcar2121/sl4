<em>&gt; &gt;Why is altruism even a virtue?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What have others done to garner the results of my efforts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Rand blah blah]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jerry, did your parents apply this creepy calculus to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expenditures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you were an infant?
</em><br>
<p>Nope, for a full discussion on the parental responsibilities of a parent
<br>
from an objectivist view, I could refer you to a few newsgroups where this
<br>
is discussed. If it makes you feel better, Ill be paying back far more in
<br>
social security over my life then I ever received as a child, but honestly,
<br>
I would say my moral obligation to provide for my children stems from my
<br>
decision to make them with full understanding about what was required to
<br>
take care of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is it that you are asking these questions in a common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human language?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Invented it yourself entirely as `the results of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts'? Bought it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the shelf after you earned your first few hundred dollars?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<p>So I can say I'm the collection agent for the collective too then right?
<br>
Send your money via pay-pal or e-gold please. Ask yourself how governments
<br>
get that right to extract labor, time, and wealth from individuals. I'm sure
<br>
somewhere along this line of reasoning, Ill have to kneel to some god, the
<br>
majority, or a king.
<br>
<p>This is the last message I'm going to send on this, because I think it's off
<br>
topic, but there were others pumping their philosophy, and everyone else
<br>
just seem to nod and either agree, or not want to buck the experts. If you
<br>
really care to have an opposing view mentioned and not have discussion
<br>
dominated by a single mode of thought, let me know, although I really do
<br>
believe in egoism and playing devil's advocate would be a stretch for me.
<br>
<p>Jerry Mitchell
