<p>Elieser's work has been surpassingly good IMO, and has set a very high 
<br>
standard.  His work has an 'explanatory' flavour that I personally find 
<br>
delightful.  But it is not the best style for PR impact, it is not easily 
<br>
digestable by 'viewing public', those attuned to sound bites and tabloid 
<br>
journalism.
<br>
<p>When reading Michael Anissimov's writings here, and on his website, I sense 
<br>
frustration with the slow progress of the Singularity meme (please tell me 
<br>
if I'm wrong about this M.A.)  This can lead to impatience with people who 
<br>
just don't 'get it', and who won't put in the effort required to make an 
<br>
informed assessment.  And make no mistake, it takes a non-trivial effort for 
<br>
most people to educate themselves about the Singularity.  From being 
<br>
impatient it is dead easy to start characterizing these individuals as 
<br>
stupid, closed-minded, backward, animals, luddites... something derogatory.  
<br>
Even if this is a lighthearted characterization aimed at amusing those of us 
<br>
'in the know', it WILL WORK AGAINST US.

<p>Indeed.  However, an (almost) worse fate is to be ignored, and to die in 
<br>
obscurity.  We have www.intelligence.org presenting arguments to win over 
<br>
people's *minds* via rational argument.  We do not have people out there 
<br>
trying to win people's *hearts*... at least none that I've heard of.  Now, 
<br>
don't get me wrong, I am not advocating that we do this in the year 2002, 
<br>
but its gonna have to happen sometime and we had better plan for it.

<em>&gt;Singularity, right now I'd tell you to spend the next three years
</em><br>
imitating Gandhi, because whatever &quot;pragmatic&quot; ethical compromise you try 
<br>
right now is solidly *guaranteed* to spin out of your control. &lt;
<br>
<p>Good advice.  Before acting/posting/compromising we should take a lookin the 
<br>
mirror and ask ourselves &quot;Would I put my life in this person's hands?&quot;  %\
<br>
<p>There was one particular argument that Elieser made that really took hold of 
<br>
my _guts_ rather than my intellect.  He wrote (paraphrase): &quot;I want to look 
<br>
back [on SI creation] and be able to say we won this cleanly, easily and by 
<br>
a wide margin&quot;.  In times of fear and uncertainty, that is just the sort of 
<br>
PR that is going to grab people, and make them give you money, vote for you, 
<br>
and defend you in public.
<br>
<p>If Michael Anissimov's writing needs a bit of work and makes some people 
<br>
uncomfortable, I say that's alright.  He is performing a valuable service.  
<br>
We shouldn't get too comfortable.  This is going to happen over and over 
<br>
again as time goes on... let us have our arguments well sharpened so that we 
<br>
are ready to respond effectively.
<br>
<p>My 2cents.
