<p>Well, it would likely be of `true value' then, whatever you mean by that.

<p>Perhaps that would work for a normative human.  Last time I checked, 
<br>
though, I was actively pursuing behavior that is non normative for 
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>One thing that bugs me a bit in your reasoning is that you assume that 
<br>
the Singularity is beyond a doubt the most important thing ever.  I 
<br>
certainly think that the Singularity is important and want to make it 
<br>
happen, but I have other things on my mind than what will happen to me 
<br>
for the rest of my life.  I spend a lot of time on programming projects 
<br>
concerned with here and now problem spaces.  I spend time writing about 
<br>
the Singularity and making it easier for others to learn about it.  I do 
<br>
very little that will make the Singularity happen today.  I'm not too 
<br>
worried, though.  Lots of different skills are needed and in the end I 
<br>
may provide some key bit of info to reach the Singularity safely.  On 
<br>
the other hand, maybe I'm screwing everything up by keeping on with my 
<br>
life without the Singularity on top of my goal system.  Well, I don't 
<br>
know what's going to happen, so I do what I think is best for me and 
<br>
hope that things turn out well for the universe, too.
