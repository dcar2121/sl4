</em><br>
<p>Why would you oppose uploading?
<br>
What possible harm could it do you for other people to upload?
<br>
Why would you want to impose your will upon others in this manner?
<br>
Nowhere (on SL4 &amp; SIAI) have I read a  proposal to make
<br>
uploading mandatory... on the contrary, one of the main themes
<br>
is to outlaw violation of volition.  That means: If you don't want
<br>
something to happen *to you* then it doesn't happen.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is too often mixed in with these, often ludacrous, ideas about
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find the ideas surrounding uploading so revolting to everything I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value that I cannot condone it.
</em><br>
<p>Who's asking you to?  Many people are going to find the idea of
<br>
uploading a total nightmare to contemplate no matter what anybody
<br>
explains to them.  But... so what?  There are places in the world
<br>
today were personal flagellation, piercing and 'bleeding' are looked
<br>
upon a holy rites, and worthy of honour.  Not for me, thanks ;p
<br>
But I'm not going to object to others whipping themselves raw, if
<br>
that's what 'does it' for them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ever since I read Diaspora about a month ago, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been haunted by nightmares of being gooed for my own good.
</em><br>
<p>That's a definite case of Future Shock you've got there  (All be it future
<br>
that hasn't yet arrived) --&gt;  my sympathies :-{
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; While I continue to support AI/Nanotech, I at the same time demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong assurances from everyone whom I work with on singulatarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities that I will never be subject to such a process.
</em><br>
<p>I'll certainly never force it on you.  And, and far as it is possible to
<br>
know,
<br>
I wouldn't build an AI that would force you either... that's the whole point
<br>
of Friendly AI  :  it's friendly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; BTW: For the record; should I ever discover that I have been uploaded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my cheap xerox copy will dedicate every computational cycle available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards bringing about the complete obliteration of whatever entity was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsable-- Inflicting any possible level of pain in the process...
</em><br>
<p>Well, although I can identify with the feeling of wanting-to-take-revenge,
<br>
I suspect that you 'cheap xerox copy' may have a mind of its own...
<br>
just like you do.
