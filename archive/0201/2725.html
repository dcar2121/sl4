<em>&gt; Regarding the recent discussion about ethics and if/how the Singularity meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be spread, I have two quick and direct questions for Eliezer (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else whom it might concern):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Do you think that you have the ability to get a majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of the world (or even 30-40%) to have positive feelings towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity, before the event?
</em><br>
<p>If I decided I was going to do nothing else with my life, and I had enough
<br>
time before the Singularity, then maybe.  That is, I can see how I would
<br>
go about doing it, but there would be the usual caveats about anything in
<br>
life being difficult to accomplish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) If there is widespread condemnation and, say 98-99% of the people on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth did not want the Singularity to happen, how will this change your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work? Would you consider abandoning the project altogether?
</em><br>
<p>*That* is an interesting ethical question.  I would have to answer that,
<br>
in the end, the *only* acceptable excuse for obeying public opinion in a
<br>
case like that is if you genuinely think that the large majority opinion
<br>
is correct.  Obviously there should be a significant bias in favor of the
<br>
will of the majority, but I don't think it overrides everything else.  If
<br>
the verdict of the Earthweb (a la Marc Stiegler) said &quot;Eliezer, we want
<br>
you to break off on this temporarily while we try something else,&quot; I'd
<br>
probably obey, but that's because the Earthweb (by Marc Stiegler's
<br>
hypothesis) has a demonstrated ability to produce correct verdicts.
<br>
<p>For a vote of Congress it would be equally straightforward:  I'd move to
<br>
Japan and keep working.  Congress has demonstrated too little competence
<br>
at producing complex strategies for complex issues.  It doesn't matter
<br>
whether Congress is acting based on the goals of a democratic majority, or
<br>
is the emergent output of representatives trying to pander to their
<br>
concept of the lowest common denominator, because Congress as an electoral
<br>
body is not smart enough to produce strategies that can achieve complex
<br>
goals.  The responsibility of an individual to give some credence to votes
<br>
of an electoral body is not totally one-way; the electoral body has a
<br>
responsibility to show some intelligence in return.
<br>
<p>So you see, I don't believe this to be a straightforward yes-or-no
<br>
question, and it would depend on the *cause* of the widespread
<br>
condemnation - which I believe is answer enough.  In matters like these,
<br>
opinions have weight because of their factual correctness or
<br>
incorrectness.  In terms of ultimate goals, if 99% of the people on Earth
<br>
don't want the Singularity for itself, they are welcome to stay on Earth
<br>
after the Singularity finishes, but I must deny them their moral right to
<br>
deny me transhumanity based on their own moral judgements.  *That* part is
<br>
unambiguous.  It's only the question of managing a shared existential risk
<br>
that's ethically ambigiuous.
<br>
