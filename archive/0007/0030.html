Caution to the reader:<BR>
1. In all likelihood what I have written is nonsense.<BR>
2. I have done no research.<BR>
3. I don't even have a point to make. It's an indulgent ramble / brain-dump.<BR>
<BR>
That said, I always wondered about attempts at AI I read of in the news.<BR>
Results were obviously never quite as wizz-bang as was hoped. Thinking about<BR>
human development, even up to a very young age, there was one apparent<BR>
difference between infants and experimental AIs (I recall no names or<BR>
details - see 2 above), that of throughput.<BR>
<BR>
I've seen estimates of the bit rate through the optical nerves (can't<BR>
remember where, or what the figures were), and while I guess the other<BR>
sensory inputs don't have the same data rates, they must add up to a few<BR>
kilobits a second between them. Does anyone have a figure for any of those? <BR>
<BR>
Up until the age of four, a child may be awake for, say, sixty million<BR>
seconds. At (guesstimate) ten kbps, that adds up to over 70 GB of data.<BR>
Obviously it isn't all retained, but some of it is retained, and some of it<BR>
is used to train various systems (motor, language, social, visual &amp;c)<BR>
<BR>
What I'm wondering is, how much ability to understand do you want to give an<BR>
AI to start with, and to what extent should it bootstrap its own<BR>
understanding? How well have other AI systems done with similar amounts of<BR>
data and more or less prewritten perceptual systems?<BR>
<BR>
To hypothesise yet further, sight being our most important sense, our early<BR>
grasp of ontology is informed largely by it. A decent AI would presumably<BR>
know plenty about the world outside of itself, so the notion of<BR>
correspondence between internal reality models and external realities will<BR>
have to be suggested at some point (I'm still sceptical about an AI's<BR>
ability to select low-level goals itself - see my JOIN post for why).<BR>
<BR>
The happenstance of evolution affords us a learning mechanism in the form of<BR>
a brain that can handle (and is driven to understand) certain specialised<BR>
work much more easily than other sorts. What can the study of infant<BR>
learning teach us about what we are born knowing, and can we see how much of<BR>
that would be directly useful? There's nothing logically necessary about<BR>
what evolution has favoured, but at least we already know it works.<BR>
<BR>
I shall bring down the guillotine on this ramble now. Please - somebody<BR>
disagree with the contents of my JOIN post :)<BR>
James<BR>
