<em>&gt; &gt; Probably the best solution is to let them learn the very real value of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheat). These are valuable lessons we all learn as children and should form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of a growing AI's education also. Only when they've demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maturity do we give them any real freedom or power. They should then share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of our own values and want to build their own successors with similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or superior) diligence. Anything less in unacceptably reckless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that 'anything less' is risky, but I don't see that we have a choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (other than not doing AI):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) General machine intelligence will invariably be connected to the Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during development &amp; learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) It seems that the only effective way to get true AI going is the seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; route. In this scenario, there may not be a community of (roughly equal)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs. Only one will bootstrap to superior intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am very concerned about the risks of run-away AI (unlike Eli I *do* care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what happens to me). I'm desperately searching for ways of trying to predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (with whatever limited certainty) what goal system an AI might choose. Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would like to say two things, first off I don't agree with #1. Storage
<br>
will be so cheap by the time we are ready to try running the first seed
<br>
that we can store a huge chunk of the WWW (if not all of it- could this
<br>
be a new business opportunity in the future, selling copies of the WWW?)
<br>
locally and run the seed completely offline.
<br>
<p>Secondly I agree with #2... I prefer some way of testing out slightly
<br>
different seeds. However to really test what an AI will do once it is
<br>
&quot;loose&quot; you would have to provide it with a quite awesome simulation
<br>
of the real world (Matrix-like) and then see what it does to the humans.
<br>
I don't think we will be able to do that even if we had the hardware.
<br>
So I would be interested to know of other possible ways to test what
<br>
the AI would do.
