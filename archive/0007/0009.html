predominate, and hense no intelligence. Others motivators like hunger and

thirst will have no meaning and can be discarded...
<br>
<p>I agree. However, there also has to be something more fundamental like
<br>
'pain/ pleasure' (ie. stop doing this/ do more of this)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... I've heard arguments that say, once something is intelligent it
</em><br>
naturally does the 'right' thing. That's rather naive I think. You can have
<br>
intelligent dictators....
<br>
<p>Yes, this is important. There is no absolute 'platonic' right. 'Right' is
<br>
always with respect to a specified or implied goal and beneficiary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... Asimov's Laws are equally naive...
</em><br>
<p>True. We can perhaps guide (bias) an AI's value system (like we can a
<br>
child's), but cannot ultimately prevent it from being overridden/
<br>
re-programmed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Probably the best solution is to let them learn the very real value of
</em><br>
cooperation naturally. Put a group of them in a virtual environment with
<br>
limited resources and they will have to learn how to share (and to lie &amp;
<br>
cheat). These are valuable lessons we all learn as children and should form
<br>
part of a growing AI's education also. Only when they've demonstrated
<br>
maturity do we give them any real freedom or power. They should then share
<br>
many of our own values and want to build their own successors with similar
<br>
(or superior) diligence. Anything less in unacceptably reckless.
<br>
<p>I agree that 'anything less' is risky, but I don't see that we have a choice
<br>
(other than not doing AI):
<br>
1) General machine intelligence will invariably be connected to the Web
<br>
during development &amp; learning.
<br>
2) It seems that the only effective way to get true AI going is the seed
<br>
route. In this scenario, there may not be a community of (roughly equal)
<br>
AIs. Only one will bootstrap to superior intelligence.
<br>
<p>I am very concerned about the risks of run-away AI (unlike Eli I *do* care
<br>
what happens to me). I'm desperately searching for ways of trying to predict
<br>
(with whatever limited certainty) what goal system an AI might choose. Any
<br>
ideas?
