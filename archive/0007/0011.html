<p>Eliezer replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; ... as far as we know..... This is one of those cases where it's important
</em><br>
to accept both possible outcomes.  (I'm not just saying that to be
<br>
ostentatiously rational.  I really don't know.)
<br>
<p>I strongly disagree. Words/ concepts refer to things in reality. A basic
<br>
fact of epistemology. 'Right'  does not have a coherent meaning if divorced
<br>
from goal. We can be certain of this. I don't want to debate this here, but
<br>
if you are interested you could read more comprehensive arguments in a book
<br>
chapter or two I've written, or in Objectivist literature.
<br>
<p>The only relatively simply thing I can suggest here, is to ask you to try
<br>
and formulate what the concept of a 'platonic right' would refer to: What is
<br>
its definition? What are instances of it? How would we recognize it/
<br>
differentiate it from 'teleological right' (a redundancy)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...But to think of myself as being in opposition to the AI, even for
</em><br>
humanity's sake, would be to create a distinction between subject and
<br>
object.....
<br>
<p>But of course there is and has to be a distinction between subject and
<br>
object: you are you, and you are programming an AI - an entity distinct from
<br>
yourself. This does not imply that you need to necessarily be in opposition
<br>
to the AI, though it may turn out that way. (Think of having a child, but
<br>
with more, but not unlimited, control over its design &amp; learning)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... It would reduce every programmed instinct or taught piece of philosophy
</em><br>
to the fact that Eliezer tried to fool an AI and failed.
<br>
<p>Not to fool an AI, but to give it the best knowledge we have (including
<br>
moral) as a starting point. At a certain point it will be able to teach us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... Only a human sees &quot;arguments&quot; or &quot;instincts&quot;.  An AI sees cause and
</em><br>
effect. On some level, programming a seed AI with an instinct ultimately
<br>
bears no more information than the flat statement &quot;Peter Voss wants you to
<br>
have this instinct&quot;.
<br>
<p>Instincts and arguments are two different issues: Instincts are essentially
<br>
the pre-programmed heuristics needed for bootstrapping - we *expect* the AI
<br>
to overcome/ improve those. 'Arguments' or 'weight of evidence' on the other
<br>
hand, will always be needed by an AI - it isn't omniscient or infallible.
<br>
Many (ultimately all) important questions about reality cannot be decided
<br>
deductively. Induction, the very process of discovering regularities
<br>
(including cause &amp; effect), always relies on fuzzy 'arguments', subject to
<br>
the given context.
