<br>
<em>&gt; The problem of procrastination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The more unstructured your work is, the higher the probability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procrastination. Work that requires a high IQ typically is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstructured, after all, it wouldn't require high IQ if there was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple sequence of steps you could follow to complete it. So, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence that some percentage of people working on the singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are probably struggling with procrastination. Hence reducing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of procrastination will help accelerate the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indirect effect: A lot of people interested in the singularity are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably higher-than-average IQ. Even if they don't work directly at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant research they may be financial contributors(donors). If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider that these people are making less money(I wonder how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less) than they could due to losses caused by procrastination it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only make sense to increase the productivity of these people in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increase donations. Also some may be procrastinating the act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donation itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore reducing procrastination could be done without spending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that much money itself, IE just by providing good information on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reduce procrastination the above-average intelligent people reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and applying it could hopefully increase their productivity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think procrastination has a lot to do with singularity related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics like: evolutionary psychology and cognitive psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore procrastination could be classified as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive-behavioral bias. Reducing this bias could be as important as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on the cognitive biases that affect reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any good solutions to reduce procrastination? I know, there are a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of websites out there dealing with this issue, but I wonder what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart minds in this list could come up with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are your personal experiences dealing with procrastination? There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are some very bright people on this list and I'm sure there must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a bunch who had issues with procrastination the one way or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other. So tell us what did work for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't be ashamed to admit it, even famous intellectuals suffered from this:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spending one week solving the procrastination problem could well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth it if you consider the weeks gained by this on the long run. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course this assumes that a good solution will be found.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for your time and please don't procrastinate answering this! :)
