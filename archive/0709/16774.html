<p>
It's been my experience, working in commercial software development for the 
<br>
last thirty years or so, that there are two types of developer 
<br>
&quot;personalities.&quot;  I call them Starters and Finishers.  The trick for 
<br>
successfully managing any software project is to identify who is which and 
<br>
pair them up accordingly.
<br>
<p>Starters are motivated to start but, once they have the concepts nailed and 
<br>
the design perfected, they loath having to finish the deliverables (Leonardo 
<br>
da Vinci was a Starter).  Finishers are motivated to execute elegant 
<br>
solutions by developing equally elegant implementations but would rather not 
<br>
have to come up with the solutions by themselves.
<br>
<p>This solves the procrastination problem indirectly because motivation is 
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Brad
<br>
<p>P.S.  I like Ellen DeGeneres's take on procrastination: &quot;Procrastination 
<br>
isn't the problem, it's the solution.  So procrastinate now, don't put it 
<br>
off.&quot;

<p><p><em>&gt; Some additional thoughts:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was just reading the past essay &quot;AI and Effective Sagacity&quot; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mitch Howe in this list(<a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0108/2039.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0108/2039.html</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two quotes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The poor endurance of Sage, and its desire to rest at an optimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower-stress activity level also sheds light on many kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procrastination, since the thing you put off doing is often some special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that requires a higher Sage activity level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, even the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-IQ human may never produce anything new or useful to society if she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable or unwilling to regularly put her lanky-but-lazy Sage through its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paces. The low-IQ underdog may climb to the top of his field because his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awkward-but-fit Sage is continually running marathons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this sense, overcoming your procrastination is in itself a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence augmentation or amplification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
