There are probably plenty of fictional forebears, such as the 
<br>
transcendence of the children of humanity into incomprehensible glory 
<br>
at the close of Arthur Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END, but I was surprised 
<br>
to find that I'd forgotten an unequivocal transcend (under that very 
<br>
word) in Bruce Sterling's &quot;Swarm&quot; (1982). As Sterling noted in the 
<br>
introduction to SCHISMATIX PLUS, this story was (remarkably) his 
<br>
&quot;official story premiere&quot;. Here's one revelation to a weakly 
<br>
posthuman, from an ad hoc alien superintelligence tool cast up by a 
<br>
broadly unintelligent alien Swarm and its Queen, at the end of the story:
<br>
<p>&lt;&quot;In a thousand years you will not even be a memory. Your race will 
<br>
go the same way as a thousand others... They have passed beyond my 
<br>
ken. They have all discovered something, learned something, that has 
<br>
caused them to transcend my understanding. It may be that they even 
<br>
transcend *being*. At any rate, I cannot sense their presence 
<br>
anywhere. They seem to do nothing, they seem to interfere in nothing; 
<br>
for all intents and purposes, they seem to be dead. Vanished. They 
<br>
may have become gods, or ghosts.&quot;
<br>
<p>This seems to be pretty much precisely the fate of the transcended 
<br>
humans in Vinge's MAROONED IN REALTIME, where the Singularity was 
<br>
first plainly declared.
<br>
<p>Fascinating.
