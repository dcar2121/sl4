<p>
Jeff,
<br>
<p>With regards to the missing heat, the outer layer of a matroishka  
<br>
brain (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain</a>) might be as  
<br>
cool as interstellar space.  This seems more likely than hiding.  If  
<br>
you can harness a billion light-years worth of galaxies, you don't  
<br>
need to hide.  The appearance of a void gravitationally is more of a  
<br>
pickle, but could possible be explained by things like Shkadov  
<br>
thrusters:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine</a>.  Your point  
<br>
about the time-scales of complex-life evolving is another pickle.   
<br>
However, you only need it to happen once to explain this particular  
<br>
void.
<br>
<p>Most likely, it's just a big void and the exponentially expanding  
<br>
intelligence (EEI) speculations are wrong in this case.  If  
<br>
gravitational lumpiness ends up being the best explanation for this  
<br>
void, then it may be more parsimonious to assume that it is the best  
<br>
explanation for other voids as well.  Though it is still possible  
<br>
that there are more than one type of void, evidence is needed to  
<br>
support EEI theory.
<br>
<p>So Fermi's paradox may not have been solved by EEI theory of voids.   
<br>
Too bad.  In my opinion, it seemed like a good contender.  For a  
<br>
complex intelligence, the most reasonable thing seems to be to expand  
<br>
outwards and try to harness as many stars as possible for driving  
<br>
computation.  Even under the conservative assumption that recursively  
<br>
improving AI is achieved once only every couple 100-1000 galaxies, we  
<br>
should be able to explain interstellar voids and Fermi's paradox.  If  
<br>
EEI theory is wrong, then there are several different possible  
<br>
implications, which are also reasonable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Complex intelligence evolves very rarely; much less than one in  
<br>
a thousand galaxies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The evolution of complex intelligence does not imply the  
<br>
creation of recursively improving AI; perhaps the civilization is  
<br>
destroyed before obtaining that technological achievement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Even assuming recursively improving AI, stellar engines are  
<br>
unfeasible (not enough mass in the solar systems; no way of  
<br>
controlling star dynamics) or undesirable (super-intelligences  
<br>
thought of something better).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Evidence for simulation (less reasonable)?  Something else?
<br>
<p>Doesn't look good for EEI theory...  Case closed pending further  
<br>
evidence.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the discussion.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a good point.  I think you're right, that we can't really tell

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the other two issues still seem puzzling.  How any sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence would have developed that early on (3-7 billion years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the big bang, when it took 4.5 billion years on earth... and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe looked very different and less life-friendly back then).  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they're living there but hiding... how they could unbend the light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing through in such a way that it looks like there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitational disturbance there.  Another question is how/why they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooling the cosmic background radiation as it passes through, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually seems to have a rather simple answer in the context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman intelligence... they could be harvesting energy from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmic background radiation too (perhaps large antennas set up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collect it?)  If there's a way to do that technologically, it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide them with even more energy than they could get out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stars!  (Just speculating here).  But the only way to explain why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of cooling happens to be exactly what you'd expect if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were nothing there is that they are deliberately trying to trick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside observers into thinking there's nothing there.  So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question still is... why do they go through all that trouble to hide?
