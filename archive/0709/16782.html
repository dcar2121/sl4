Actually, you don't even need them to be moving.  Any sort of
<br>
instantaneous propagation of cause and effect over a large distance
<br>
implies reverse causality (something in the future affecting something
<br>
in the past)... you just need to look at it in the right reference
<br>
frame.
<br>
<p>However, you can prove that there is no way to use entanglement to
<br>
communicate or send any information faster than light (or
<br>
instantaneously).  So no, it is not a &quot;window into the future&quot; since
<br>
it would be impossible to actually send information from the future
<br>
into the past.  Also worth mentioning is that what is usually referred
<br>
to as the &quot;non-locality&quot; of quantum mechanics is just an artifact of
<br>
certain (mostly outdated) realist interpretations of quantum
<br>
mechanics.  If you subscribe to the antirealist Copenhagen
<br>
Interpretation, or the realist Many Worlds Interpretation (my personal
<br>
preference) then all of physics is local, and there is no need for any
<br>
instantaneous action at a distance (and equivalently, no
<br>
reverse-causality).  I call the non-local intepretations &quot;mostly
<br>
outdated&quot; as nearly all of the top physicists reject them now but
<br>
among lower-ranking physicists, especially those who don't work on
<br>
issues of fundamental physics such as particle physics or cosmology,
<br>
there are still many who consider them acceptable interpretations.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Assuming the quantum entanglement survives this disparity (experiments with

</em><br>
<em>&gt; an increasing difference in time between the two entangled particles such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that changing the quantum state of the slower one would manifest as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite state change in the faster one at an earlier time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Would this not effectively give us a &quot;window to the future&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  And most importantly, isn't this the last invention?  Since a window into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future gives us access to all future inventions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Of course it's entirely possible that the slower particle in this case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would simply stay in a persistent state of superposition with the wave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function being unable to collapse either to prevent a causality violation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Novikov's Self Consistency Principle) or because of a quantum cosmology in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the size of our universe it not so much a function of the speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light over time since the big bang as they taught us in physics 101... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather a function of all the matter comprising the universe and every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible quantum state of that matter and every subsequent possible quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state (minus the states with a quantum probability of zero).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Sorry, just bored at work, thought I'd poke the hornet's nest!  :D
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
