Hi Matt,
<br>
<p>****
<br>
I still believe that a distributed system has inherent advantages over
<br>
centralized systems like Google.  The silicon component of the Internet has
<br>
1000 times more computing power than Google's supercomputing clusters, and
<br>
most of it is unused.  I described 3 scenarios for acquiring computing power
<br>
(buy, beg, or steal), but a fourth is to barter.  People are willing to give
<br>
up personal information and install software that hooks into a distributed
<br>
system if they get some perceived benefit, such as free email, webhosting,
<br>
or
<br>
more convenient access to data.

<br>
<p><p>The idea of using masses of home computers for AGI processing is one that
<br>
has
<br>
appealed to me for a long time.
<br>
<p>In fact, some friends and I built a partially-functional Java prototype in
<br>
2000 for a system called WebWorld that would support massively distributed
<br>
AGI processing.  A very brief paper on that architecture and its motivations
<br>
can be found here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/395030.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/395030.html</a>
<br>
<p>(the paper was delivered at an Alife conference in Portland, I forget what
<br>
year, probably 2000.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the perspective of the Novamente Cognition Engine architecture,
</em><br>
<p>-- there are some components that will work WAY more effectively on a
<br>
cluster
<br>
than a broadly distributed network
<br>
<p>-- there are some components that could very effectively be distributed
<br>
across
<br>
zillions of users' home computers, using WebWorld or something similar
<br>
<p>So a mixed architecture would be great.  I wrote about this a bit in my 2001
<br>
book &quot;Creating
<br>
Internet Intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, logistically, convincing loads of people to actually download some
<br>
AGI-at-home thingie on their home computers may be tricky.
<br>
<p>For instance, let's suppose we launched some open-source OpenCog@Homethingie,
<br>
that let folks use their home computers to carry out cognitive processes as
<br>
part of some
<br>
global OpenCog brain...
<br>
<p>What induces them to download and install the thing?  To trust the thing?
<br>
<p>The same curiosity and civic-mindedness that caused folks to download
<br>
SETI@home, I suppose?
<br>
<p>Or do you suggest that they get some service in exchange for running the
<br>
thing?
<br>
<p>Given the preponderance of free or very low cost web services that already
<br>
exist, my intuition is that we might do better to just rely on
<br>
SETI@hometype motivations than to make it a barter type transaction...
<br>
<p>But I'm open to being refuted by great suggestions on how to turn it into a
<br>
barter thing...
<br>
<p>Most of all, I'm open to collaboration with folks who actually want to build
<br>
the thing.  Since 2000 there have been plenty of advances in infrastructural
<br>
technology, e.g. the Globus toolkit
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.globus.org/grid_software/">http://www.globus.org/grid_software/</a>
<br>
<p>that might or might not be relevant (I haven't carefully evaluated them).
<br>
