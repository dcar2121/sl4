<p>It seems extremely unlikely that us or any civilization is hit with an
<br>
extrasolar Singularity Wavefront in the short period of time in which
<br>
they have sufficient scientific and technological understanding to
<br>
think about space travel, but have not yet triggered a Singularity --
<br>
and the corresponding expanding Wavefront into space -- themselves (or
<br>
self-destructed).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it is of course not at all impossible that we have
<br>
already been hit with an extraterrestrial Singularity Wavefront
<br>
millions of years ago. Such a thing having happened might even be
<br>
hugely probable, if we assume that we are not living in a simulation,
<br>
but in a real universe. (Can anyone point to high-quality analysis and
<br>
calculations available on this topic? I've never bothered to get
<br>
familiar with the Drake Equation etc.)
<br>
<p>We might of course wonder, why it doesn't seem like a Singularity
<br>
Wavefront has gotten here long ago... I would argue that the fact that
<br>
our resources have not been converted to computronium, or whatever, is
<br>
not surprising. The universe is so full of resources that many
<br>
Singularity Wavefronts would probably mostly spare solar systems that
<br>
have interesting biological evolution going on. I think I'd do that
<br>
myself. *Not* doing that would be essentially equivalent to wanting to
<br>
get hostile towards my fellow humans after our own possible
<br>
Singularity, converting their small amount of matter into something
<br>
more efficient.
<br>
<p>Otherwise, having been hit with an ancient Singularity Wavefront is
<br>
essentially equivalent to living in a simulation. Like, the question
<br>
of &quot;Why is there nasty stuff going on?&quot; is answered with &quot;Either the
<br>
intelligences running the show don't care, or then there actually
<br>
isn't nasty stuff going on; you are just given that false impression.&quot;
<br>
The false impression could in practice mean e.g. that every individual
<br>
is seamlessly uploaded right before they would have a life experience
<br>
they would not approve of in retrospect, and replaced with a
<br>
philosophical zombie.
