Whether or not Google really is building an AI is an open question, and is verging into tinfoil hat territory. BUT IF IT WERE...
<br>
<p>Google answers, and crowd sourcing in general,  is the best tool for bootstrapping a basic system up.
<br>
<p>How many of the questions asked to Google Answers (or Amazons Turk) are asked by Google vimself? 
<br>
<p>The service could be used to access first person reports on the knowledge held in human brains. Or as a final check to clarify some subtle point that all the syntactic and semantic parsing or the web was failing to fully yield answers to.

<p>Google denies that they are building an AI, which I don't believe.
<br>
They have been observing a constant increase in the number of terms
<br>
comprising the queries, and with the results getting better as well,
<br>
what you have is basically a human computer dialog.
<br>
<p>If you sum to this all the parts of the Google grid that do actually
<br>
reside on the local machine, such as Google Desktop, Google Pack,
<br>
Google Web Accelerator, Google Offline Reader, etc. with also the
<br>
personalized results that are a consequence of your search history,
<br>
then you do have millions of volunteers that are doing exactly what
<br>
you say. Since the PageRank algorithm's value is a consequence of
<br>
human linking, active participation is also a must (not on an
<br>
individual level but as a group).
<br>
<p>It is definitely a manageable strategy, as Google showed us.
<br>
I would not be surprised if part of Powerset's tools would be based on
<br>
something similar as well.
