<p>
The problem of procrastination.
<br>
<p>The more unstructured your work is, the higher the probability of
<br>
procrastination. Work that requires a high IQ typically is
<br>
unstructured, after all, it wouldn't require high IQ if there was a
<br>
simple sequence of steps you could follow to complete it. So, it is a
<br>
consequence that some percentage of people working on the singularity
<br>
are probably struggling with procrastination. Hence reducing the
<br>
degree of procrastination will help accelerate the singularity.
<br>
<p>Indirect effect: A lot of people interested in the singularity are
<br>
probably higher-than-average IQ. Even if they don't work directly at
<br>
relevant research they may be financial contributors(donors). If you
<br>
consider that these people are making less money(I wonder how much
<br>
less) than they could due to losses caused by procrastination it would
<br>
only make sense to increase the productivity of these people in order
<br>
to increase donations. Also some may be procrastinating the act of
<br>
donation itself.
<br>
<p>Furthermore reducing procrastination could be done without spending
<br>
that much money itself, IE just by providing good information on how
<br>
to reduce procrastination the above-average intelligent people reading
<br>
and applying it could hopefully increase their productivity.
<br>
<p>I think procrastination has a lot to do with singularity related
<br>
topics like: evolutionary psychology and cognitive psychology.
<br>
Furthermore procrastination could be classified as a
<br>
cognitive-behavioral bias. Reducing this bias could be as important as
<br>
working on the cognitive biases that affect reasoning.
<br>
<p>Any good solutions to reduce procrastination? I know, there are a lot
<br>
of websites out there dealing with this issue, but I wonder what the
<br>
smart minds in this list could come up with.
<br>
<p>What are your personal experiences dealing with procrastination? There
<br>
are some very bright people on this list and I'm sure there must be
<br>
quite a bunch who had issues with procrastination the one way or the
<br>
other. So tell us what did work for you.
<br>
Don't be ashamed to admit it, even famous intellectuals suffered from this:

<br>
<p>Spending one week solving the procrastination problem could well be
<br>
worth it if you consider the weeks gained by this on the long run. Of
<br>
course this assumes that a good solution will be found.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your time and please don't procrastinate answering this! :)
