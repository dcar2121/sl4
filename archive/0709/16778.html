<p>
<em>&gt; Hence reducing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of procrastination will help accelerate the singularity.
</em><br>
<p>I hear you, but IMHO, this is still a bit off-topic. Buying the right
<br>
car will save money and free up resources and therefore would also
<br>
increase the chances that the list-members can bring about a positive
<br>
singularity scenario (which, as avturchin pointed out, is a better
<br>
goal than accelerating a singularity without regard to whether it
<br>
might end disastrously.) But that doesn't mean we should discuss cars
<br>
on this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spending one week solving the procrastination problem could well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth it if you consider the weeks gained by this on the long run.
</em><br>
<p>If there were a &quot;magic bullet&quot; for procrastination, or for
<br>
productivity in general, it would probably have been discovered
<br>
already. Most of the common-sense solutions, like &quot;finish your
<br>
broccoli before you eat dessert,&quot; are things we're all aware of (if
<br>
not, there are a countless life-hacking blogs and self-help books that
<br>
dispense such non-rigorous advice. Unfortunately I have looked for,
<br>
but not found, peer-reviewed replicable advice on such topics.)
<br>
<p>Where does that leave you? You just have to decide today, of your own
<br>
free will, to be a better and more mindful person than you were
<br>
yesterday. And then decide the same thing tomorrow. And then, when you
<br>
slip up at 6 PM on the third day, than at 7 PM the same day you have
<br>
to get back on the horse and try harder. Difficult, but some people
<br>
succeed. And, if you do succeed, than IMHO you are a hero, much
<br>
worthier of applause and recognition than the typical movie star or
<br>
sports legend.
<br>
<p>-Rolf
