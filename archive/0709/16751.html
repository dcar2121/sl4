In cooperation with AAAI, The University of Memphis is hosting the first 
conference on Artificial General Intelligence, March 1-3, 2008:
www.agi-08.org
The conference is explicitly open to all the various techniques used in 
seeking to realize general intelligence – for instance, symbolic, 
connectionist, evolutionary, robotic, mathematical, or integrative 
approaches (... or new approaches that the conference organizers have 
never heard of!). We are particularly interested in papers describing 
concrete, reasonably well-fleshed-out AGI projects – meaning, research 
projects that
* are based on a coherent theory about &quot;intelligence&quot; as a whole
* involve a concrete engineering plan oriented toward implementing the 
relevant conception of general intelligence in a computer system
* have already produced some concrete results, either practical or 
theoretical
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) was initially directly aimed 
at the construction of “thinking machines” – that is, computer systems 
with human-like general intelligence. But this task proved very 
difficult, and so as steps in this direction, AI researchers focused on 
producing AI systems displaying intelligence regarding specific tasks in 
relatively narrow domains. In recent years, however, the situation has 
been changing. More and more researchers have recognized the necessity – 
and feasibility – of returning to the original goals of the field.
Increasingly, there is a call for a transition from the current focus on 
highly specialized “narrow AI” problem solving systems, back to 
confronting the more difficult issues of “human level intelligence” and 
more broadly “artificial general intelligence (AGI).”
If interested, please inform your colleagues that our Call For Papers 
Deadline is Oct 15, 2007:

Warm regards,
Prof. Stan Franklin - www.cs.memphis.edu/~franklin
