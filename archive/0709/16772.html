Some additional thoughts:
<br>
<p>I was just reading the past essay &quot;AI and Effective Sagacity&quot; from
<br>
Mitch Howe in this list(<a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0108/2039.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0108/2039.html</a>).
<br>
<p>Two quotes:
<br>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;
<br>
The poor endurance of Sage, and its desire to rest at an optimum
<br>
lower-stress activity level also sheds light on many kinds of
<br>
procrastination, since the thing you put off doing is often some special
<br>
case that requires a higher Sage activity level.
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;
<br>
Therefore, even the most
<br>
high-IQ human may never produce anything new or useful to society if she is
<br>
unable or unwilling to regularly put her lanky-but-lazy Sage through its
<br>
paces. The low-IQ underdog may climb to the top of his field because his
<br>
awkward-but-fit Sage is continually running marathons.
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<br>
<p>In this sense, overcoming your procrastination is in itself a form of
<br>
intelligence augmentation or amplification.
<br>
<p>Roland Anderson.
