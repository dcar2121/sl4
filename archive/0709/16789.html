<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p>I've written a science fiction novel that is unabashed propaganda for
<br>
working on and donating to Singularity projects. It's a space opera
<br>
with a stolen space shuttle, a shootout between robots and Russian
<br>
gangsters, and an underground Singularity tech group called The Choir
<br>
Invisible. The protagonist is Heloise Chin, who describes herself as
<br>
The Pinup Grrrl for the Geek Rapture.
<br>
<p><p><p>Heloise issues a formal declaration of war on death and has upgraded
<br>
Pascal's Wager to Hel's Bet:
<br>
<p><p><p>Work for the Singularity to increase your odds of living indefinitely.
<br>
<p>Don't bother if you have a taste for dirt.
<br>
<p><p><p>The hardcore Singularity propaganda doesn't kick in until near the end
<br>
of Hel's Bet, but there are hints of it from the start. It does not
<br>
get into Singularity tech at all nor does it get deeply into practical
<br>
and philosophical issues. I will dive into that in the next two books
<br>
of my projected Geek Rapture Trilogy.
<br>
<p><p><p>I've posted a big hunk of the novel to <a href="http://helsbet.com">http://helsbet.com</a> . Take a
<br>
look and if it grabs you email me directly for a pdf of the complete
<br>
manuscript. I am looking for critiques at any level from editing faux
<br>
pas to overall reviews. I'd love to snag some blurbs to use for the
<br>
next step toward getting Hel's Bet published – getting a good agent.
<br>
Feel free to circulate the ms. among others in the Singularity
<br>
community.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am appalled at the lack of resources dedicated to developing
<br>
Singularity tech and Hel's Bet is my best shot at doing something
<br>
about that.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am a computer game developer currently working on reviving my
<br>
classic game ChipWits <a href="http://chipwits.com">http://chipwits.com</a> . My next game project is
<br>
GODinabox: Desktop Digital Deities – <a href="http://godinabox.com">http://godinabox.com</a> – which is a
<br>
collaboration with Bobby Henderson, creator of the Flying Spaghetti
<br>
Monster. In the mid-90's I was a programmer/manager in Microsoft
<br>
Research's Virtual Worlds Group – the first MSFT open source project.
<br>
I am a graduate of the Clarion West speculative writers' workshop –
<br>
<a href="http://clarionwest.org">http://clarionwest.org</a> .
<br>
<p><p><p>Hope you like it,
<br>
