<p>This may be orthogonal to the line of thought you were pursuing, but what if
<br>
the software's purpose is just to STORE data uploaded by the user?
<br>
<p>So, user has lots of photos and movies. User stores the photos and movies in
<br>
the globally distributed internet cognition engine. The engine does two
<br>
things:
<br>
<p>1) distributes the bits over many machines, thereby providing redundancy.
<br>
2) *compresses* the bits, thereby saving space and network bandwidth.
<br>
<p>As Matt has argued, strong compression of arbitrary data is equivalent to
<br>
AI. Strong compression of images and movies is equivalent to computer
<br>
vision. A core element of statistical learning theory is that in order to
<br>
justify complex models, one must have a suitably large set of data - the
<br>
engine by its very nature has access to immense amounts of data and thus can
<br>
develop an enormously sophisticated model.
<br>
<p>One could imagine also that different nodes in the network develop different
<br>
techniques for representing data - different encoding schemes. So for
<br>
example Node A becomes very good at representing people's faces, while node
<br>
B becomes good at representing cars. It wouldn't be hard to implement some
<br>
sort of scheme where A and B negotiate to decide which one should have
<br>
responsibility for storing a given image, by comparing the code length of
<br>
the image using A's model vs. B's model. Then, as more images of faces are
<br>
shunted to A, it can become more and more efficient at representing faces
<br>
(one might call it the Rembrandt node).
<br>
<p>Amusingly, the system would also become adept at reverse engineering. Lots
<br>
of people would want to store large executables. The most parsimonious
<br>
description of an executable is its source code, so in order to succinctly
<br>
represent such a set of files the system would just have to learn how to
<br>
back-infer the source of a compiled file.
<br>
<p>So in the barter the user gets reliable and efficient data storage, while
<br>
the system gets lots of computational resources and perhaps more
<br>
importantly, data.
