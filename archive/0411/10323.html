First, that is indeed awful. I'm sorry.
<br>
<p>I guess what you do have though is the ability to say that you are
<br>
indeed actually doing something about it, so do take what comfort from
<br>
that that you can.
<br>
<p>Also, even though it was too late to preserve him, if, as I understand
<br>
it, information cannot be totally destroyed, then effectively his
<br>
final state (and all the states previous) are spreading out as
<br>
entropy, ultimately moving out with his lightcone. So if you wish,
<br>
whenever something goes well to to a particularly fortuitus event tied
<br>
to something sufficiently sensetive to minor fluctuations, well, can
<br>
if you wish imagine that to be a tiny whisper of his final shadow.
<br>
<p>I am not taking this to mean anything more than it does, and do not
<br>
suggest you to, but still, that may be a slight comfort to keep in
<br>
mind. Perhaps in a sense meaningless, but comforting nontheless. (When
<br>
something sufficiently sensative goes wrong... blame the hot air from
<br>
any politician you don't like. :P)
<br>
<p>And while depending on these would be irrational, perhaps you may
<br>
allow yourself to at least hope in the possibility that an the result
<br>
of an FAI may be able to discover a way to outrace light and
<br>
reconstruct all the final states. It may not much of a hope, but it
<br>
may help. And again, remember that, either way, you are working to put
<br>
an end to this.
<br>
<p>And again, I'm sorry.
<br>
<p>Psy-Kosh
