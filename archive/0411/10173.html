David Clark --
<br>
<p>About my essay on patterns and ethics.  I don't mean to be rude or arrogant,
<br>
but your &quot;rebuttal&quot; displays such a basic lack of understanding of what I
<br>
was trying to say that it would take me a couple hours to give a
<br>
point-by-point re-rebuttal to your arguments, and I simply don't have the
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>I am aware that what I wrote was an informal and nonrigorous essay, and is
<br>
not optimally tailored to communicate to people with a fundamentally
<br>
different intuitive orientation.  That sort of writing is really only useful
<br>
for communicating with people who already have a certain sympathy for the
<br>
author's point of view.  To write something to be potentially convincing to
<br>
people with opposing points of view would require a lot more time, space and
<br>
didacticism.  I've done that before on different topics (e.g. the
<br>
possibility of AI) but don't have time to do so here.
<br>
<p>Some of your criticisms really tell me you're very far from &quot;getting it&quot;
<br>
regarding  my thinking on pattern ethics.  You seem to be badly misled by my
<br>
quirks of literary(?) style.    For instance, you say (to paraphrase): &quot;You
<br>
can't define 'pattern-sympathy' because patterns don't have volition.  You
<br>
can't say a pattern 'wants' to spread itself because patterns don't have
<br>
volition.&quot;  I thought it was obvious that &quot;pattern-sympathy&quot;, in that essay,
<br>
was a *defined term*, like energy or force in physics, or like the notion of
<br>
sympathetic resonance in physics.  And I thought it was obvious I was using
<br>
the term &quot;wants&quot; there in an informal sense, as in the common phrase
<br>
&quot;Information wants to be free.&quot;  While I believe that every pattern has an
<br>
element of awareness to it, I don't believe that all patterns have volition;
<br>
I've articulated a quite detailed theory of the dynamics of volition
<br>
elsewhere.
<br>
<p>I can see that the use of an informal style can lead to communicational
<br>
confusion even where there is no idea-confusion, which is why some
<br>
philosophers like Kant and Hegel opted for an extremely formal, precise and
<br>
controlled use of language, and why some modern philosophers turned to
<br>
formal logic.  But I'm not willing to take the time right now to spell out
<br>
my ideas on these topics with that kind of precision, because I have other
<br>
priorities.  So for the moment, I guess these particular ideas of mine will
<br>
be successfully transmitted only to the relatively-like-minded.
<br>
<p>Regarding your comments about AI, I fully agree with your statement that
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
The path to intelligence will not happen on it's own. It will only happen if
<br>
we make it happen. No amount of processing regardless of how smart the
<br>
algorithms are, will unlock the secret of intelligence without injecting
<br>
vast amounts of information and using a multitude of different techniques.
<br>
This has been proven (at least to some degree) by the failure of all the AI
<br>
projects to date.
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>As described in my various writings on AI, I am pursuing an approach
<br>
involving integration of different techniques, and involving getting
<br>
information into the AI system via a combination of linguistic, perceptual,
<br>
and explicit-knowledge-encoding  methods.
<br>
<p>Who's your daddy indeed!!!  (apologies for non-Americans for the &quot;obscure&quot;
<br>
reference ;-)
