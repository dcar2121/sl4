<em>&gt; High tech western civilization has not exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escaped this model, but we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have by lower birth rates and high economic growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lengthened the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycle.  It does not protect us from other parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world where high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population growth has run ahead of economic growth.
</em><br>
<p>A significant part of the world now has below
<br>
replacement fertility rates (2.1 births/woman - the
<br>
extra 0.1 accounts for children who die young).
<br>
A successful population model would have to explain
<br>
why rich areas like Western Europe (fertility rate
<br>
= 1.5), Canada (1.6), and Japan (1.4) have very
<br>
low rates; while Eastern Europe (1.4), which is
<br>
much poorer, also has a low rate; and the US (2.1)
<br>
has a significantly higher rate.  The highest rates
<br>
in the world (all &gt;6.0) are in Afghanistan, Chad,
<br>
Congo, Gaza Strip, Mali, and Uganda.  These are all
<br>
very poor places.  
<br>
<p>Wealth correlates with lower fertility rates, but
<br>
there are other factors at work.  Level of
<br>
urbanization
<br>
seems to be another major factor.  Children are
<br>
more expensive to raise in cities than on farms, where
<br>
they can provide free labor.  Level of education
<br>
also seems to contribute.  Former and current
<br>
Communist countries that had good education systems
<br>
tend to have lower fertility rates.
<br>
<p>In any case, the world's population growth rate is
<br>
slowing overall, with replacement fertility projected
<br>
for 2055 AD, at which time the total population 
<br>
(9.4 billion) will be less than 50% greater than
<br>
at present (6.4 billion).  Ignoring for a moment
<br>
the possibility of a singularity occurring in the
<br>
next 50 years, automation and productivity
<br>
improvements
<br>
are far outpacing population growth.  So I would
<br>
expect the general living conditions for mankind
<br>
as a whole to improve.
<br>
<p>The real issue I see is the distribution of wealth.
<br>
Right now business is moving to countries with low
<br>
labor costs like India and China.  If automation
<br>
gets good enough, however, cheap labor may not be
<br>
as much a factor.  Business may then pull out of
<br>
these countries.
