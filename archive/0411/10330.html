<p>
I am very sorry to hear about the death of your brother,
<br>
Eliezer. Your reaction to redouble your efforts is very
<br>
healthy. When my brother, father and mother died I also
<br>
found it helpful to get plenty of exercise and eliminate
<br>
caffeine.
<br>
<p>My younger brother died of cancer in 1997. When he died
<br>
he looked like a holocaust victim and it occured to me
<br>
that if all the Americans dying of cancer were being
<br>
killed by an evil dictator, our society would be totally
<br>
mobilized against that enemy. Disease and death in general
<br>
deserve at least that commitment. Both collectively, to
<br>
support medical research and care, and individually, to
<br>
get lots of exercise and eliminate tobacco (my brother's
<br>
kidney cancer was probably caused by his smoking) and
<br>
unhealthy foods. My parents lived to 85 and 87, but their
<br>
diseases were clearly linked to diet, smoking and lack of
<br>
exercise. They could have lived longer and better with
<br>
different habits.
<br>
<p>I am with you, Eliezer, that it is maddening that so many
<br>
people in our society cling to ancient religous beliefs
<br>
that council acceptance of death and disease, and in some
<br>
cases even council opposition to efforts to defeat death.
<br>
What madness.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Bill
