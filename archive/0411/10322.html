<p>
My little brother, Yehuda Nattan Yudkowsky, is dead.
<br>
<p>He died November 1st.  His body was found without identification.  The 
<br>
family found out on November 4th.  I spent a week and a half with my family 
<br>
in Chicago, and am now back in Atlanta.  I've been putting off telling my 
<br>
friends, because it's such a hard thing to say.
<br>
<p>I used to say:  &quot;I have four living grandparents and I intend to have four 
<br>
living grandparents when the last star in the Milky Way burns out.&quot;  I 
<br>
still have four living grandparents, but I don't think I'll be saying that 
<br>
any more.  Even if we make it to and through the Singularity, it will be 
<br>
too late.  One of the people I love won't be there.  The universe has a 
<br>
surprising ability to stab you through the heart from somewhere you weren't 
<br>
looking.  Of all the people I had to protect, I never thought that Yehuda 
<br>
might be one of them.  Yehuda was born July 11, 1985.  He lived 7053 days. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was nineteen years old when he died.
<br>
<p>The Jewish religion prescribes a number of rituals and condolences for the 
<br>
occasion of a death.  The rituals are pointless and tiring; the condolences 
<br>
are religious idiocies.  Yehuda has passed to a better place, God's ways 
<br>
are mysterious but benign, etc.  Does such talk really comfort people?  I 
<br>
watched my parents, and I don't think it did.  The blessing that is spoken 
<br>
at Jewish funerals is &quot;Blessed is God, the true judge.&quot;  Do they really 
<br>
believe that?  Why do they cry at funerals, if they believe that?  Does it 
<br>
help someone, to tell them that their religion requires them to believe 
<br>
that?  I think I coped better than my parents and my little sister Channah. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just dealing with pain, not confusion.  When I heard on the phone 
<br>
that Yehuda had died, there was never a moment of disbelief.  I knew what 
<br>
kind of universe I lived in, and I knew what I planned to do about that. 
<br>
How is my religious family to comprehend it, working, as they must, from 
<br>
the assumption that Yehuda was deliberately murdered by a benevolent God? 
<br>
The same loving God, I presume, who arranges for millions of children to 
<br>
grow up illiterate and starving; the same kindly tribal father-figure who 
<br>
arranged the Holocaust and the Inquisition's torture of witches.  I would 
<br>
not hesitate to call it evil, if any sentient mind had committed such an 
<br>
act, permitted such a thing.  But I have weighed the evidence as best I 
<br>
can, and I do not believe the universe to be evil, a reply which in these 
<br>
days is called atheism.
<br>
<p>Maybe it helps to believe in an immortal soul.  I know that I would feel a 
<br>
lot better if Yehuda had gone away on a trip somewhere, even if he was 
<br>
never coming back.  But Yehuda did not &quot;pass on&quot;.  Yehuda is not &quot;resting 
<br>
in peace&quot;.  Yehuda is not coming back.  Yehuda doesn't exist any more. 
<br>
Yehuda was absolutely annihilated at the age of nineteen.  Yes, that makes 
<br>
me angry.  I can't put into words how angry.  It would be rage to rend the 
<br>
gates of Heaven and burn down God on Its throne, if any God existed.  But 
<br>
there is no God, so my anger burns to tear apart the way-things-are, remake 
<br>
the pattern of a world that permits this.
<br>
<p>I wonder at the strength of non-transhumanist atheists, to accept so 
<br>
terrible a darkness without any hope of changing it.  But then most 
<br>
atheists also succumb to comforting lies, and make excuses for death even 
<br>
less defensible than the outright lies of religion.  They flinch away, 
<br>
refuse to confront the horror of a hundred and fifty thousand sentient 
<br>
beings annihilated every day.  One point eight lives per second, fifty-five 
<br>
million lives per year.  Convert the units, time to life, life to time. 
<br>
The World Trade Center killed half an hour.  As of today, all cryonics 
<br>
organizations together have suspended one minute.  This essay took twenty 
<br>
thousand lives to write.  I wonder if there was ever an atheist who 
<br>
accepted the full horror, making no excuses, offering no consolations, who 
<br>
did not also hope for some future dawn.  What must it be like to live in 
<br>
this world, seeing it just the way it is, and think that it will never 
<br>
change, never get any better?
<br>
<p>Yehuda's death is the first time I ever lost someone close enough for it to 
<br>
hurt.  So now I've seen the face of the enemy.  Now I understand, a little 
<br>
better, the price of half a second.  I don't understand it well, because 
<br>
the human brain has a pattern built into it.  We do not grieve forever, but 
<br>
move on.  We mourn for a few days and then continue with our lives.  Such 
<br>
underreaction poorly equips us to comprehend Yehuda's death.  Nineteen 
<br>
years of life and memory annihilated.  A thousand years, or a million 
<br>
millennia, or a forever, of future life lost.  The sun should have dimmed 
<br>
when Yehuda died, and a chill wind blown in every place that sentient 
<br>
beings gather, to tell us that our number was diminished by one.  But the 
<br>
sun did not dim, because we do not live in that sensible a universe.  Even 
<br>
if the sun did dim whenever someone died, it wouldn't be noticeable except 
<br>
as a continuous flickering.  Soon everyone would get used to it, and they 
<br>
would no longer notice the flickering of the sun.
<br>
<p>My little brother collected corks from wine bottles.  Someone brought home, 
<br>
to the family, a pair of corks they had collected for Yehuda, and never had 
<br>
a chance to give him.  And my grandmother said, &quot;Give them to Channah, and 
<br>
someday she'll tell her children about how her brother Yehuda collected 
<br>
corks.&quot;  My grandmother's words shocked me, stretched across more time than 
<br>
it had ever occurred to me to imagine, to when my fourteen-year-old sister 
<br>
had grown up and had married and was telling her children about the brother 
<br>
she'd lost.  How could my grandmother skip across all those years so easily 
<br>
when I was struggling to get through the day?  I heard my grandmother's 
<br>
words and thought: she has been through this before.  This isn't the first 
<br>
loved one my grandmother has lost, the way Yehuda was the first loved one 
<br>
I'd lost.  My grandmother is old enough to have a pattern for dealing with 
<br>
the death of loved ones; she knows how to handle this because she's done it 
<br>
before.  And I thought: how can she accept this?  If she knows, why isn't 
<br>
she fighting with everything she has to change it?
<br>
<p>What would it be like to be a rational atheist in the fifteenth century, 
<br>
and know beyond all hope of rescue that everyone you loved would be 
<br>
annihilated, one after another, unless you yourself died first?  That is 
<br>
still the fate of humans today; the ongoing horror has not changed, for all 
<br>
that we have hope.  Death is not a distant dream, not a terrible tragedy 
<br>
that happens to someone else like the stories you read in newspapers.  One 
<br>
day you'll get a phone call, like I got a phone call, and the possibility 
<br>
that seemed distant will become reality.  You will mourn, and finish 
<br>
mourning, and go on with your life, and then one day you'll get another 
<br>
phone call.  That is the fate this world has in store for you, unless you 
<br>
make a convulsive effort to change it.
<br>
<p>Since Yehuda's body was not identified for three days after he died, there 
<br>
was no possible way he could have been cryonically suspended.  Others may 
<br>
be luckier.  If you've been putting off that talk with your loved ones, do 
<br>
it.  Maybe they won't understand, but at least you won't spend forever 
<br>
wondering why you didn't even try.
<br>
<p>There is one Jewish custom associated with death that makes sense to me, 
<br>
which is contributing to charity on behalf of the departed.  I am donating 
<br>
eighteen hundred dollars to the general fund of the Singularity Institute, 
<br>
because this has gone on long enough.  If you object to the Singularity 
<br>
Institute then consider Dr. Aubrey de Grey's Methuselah Foundation, which 
<br>
hopes to defeat aging through biomedical engineering.  I think that a 
<br>
sensible coping strategy for transhumanist atheists, to donate to an 
<br>
anti-death charity after a loved one dies.  Death hurt us, so we will 
<br>
unmake Death.  Let that be the outlet for our anger, which is terrible and 
<br>
just.  I watched Yehuda's coffin lowered into the ground and cried, and 
<br>
then I sat through the eulogy and heard rabbis tell comforting lies.  If I 
<br>
had spoken Yehuda's eulogy I would not have comforted the mourners in their 
<br>
loss.  I would have told the mourners that Yehuda had been absolutely 
<br>
annihilated, that there was nothing left of him.  I would have told them 
<br>
they were right to be angry, that they had been robbed, that something 
<br>
precious and irreplaceable was taken from them, for no reason at all, taken 
<br>
from them and shattered, and they are never getting it back.
<br>
<p>If there should be a monument someday, somewhere on it will be &quot;$1800, in 
<br>
memoriam Yehuda Nattan Yudkowsky, 1985-2004.&quot;  It will not restore him to 
<br>
life.  No sentient being deserves such a thing.  Let that be my brother's 
<br>
true eulogy, free of comforting lies.
<br>
<p>When Michael Wilson heard the news, he said:  &quot;We shall have to work 
<br>
faster.&quot;  Any similar condolences are welcome.  Other condolences are not.
<br>
<p>Goodbye, Yehuda.  There isn't much point in saying it, since there's no one 
<br>
to hear.  Goodbye, Yehuda, you don't exist any more.  Nothing left of you 
<br>
after your death, like there was nothing before your birth.  You died, and 
<br>
your family, Mom and Dad and Channah and I, sat down at the Sabbath table 
<br>
just like our family had always been composed of only four people, like 
<br>
there had never been a Yehuda.  Goodbye, Yehuda Yudkowsky, never to return, 
<br>
never to be forgotten.
<br>
<p>Love,
<br>
Eliezer.
