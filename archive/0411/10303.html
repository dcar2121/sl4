</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'intellectual commons.'
</em><br>
<p><p>Nobody has a 'right' to a thin dime either, nor even the 'right' to 
<br>
live.  We agree to let people acquire a billion dollars by convention 
<br>
because it is beneficial to society, not because any particular person 
<br>
has a 'right' to a billion dollars.
<br>
<p>I would rather give a billion dollars to someone much smarter and more 
<br>
disciplined than the average person (or some facsimile thereof) than 
<br>
give a million dollars to a thousand truly average people.  And that is 
<br>
what free market economics does, putting resources in the hands of 
<br>
those who have proven able to provide the most benefit to society with 
<br>
those resources.
<br>
<p>A lot of people like to say that nobody needs a billion dollars, but I 
<br>
would assert that *society* needs those people to have a billion 
<br>
dollars.  And I would also point out that there are a hell of a lot of 
<br>
valuable and very capital intensive projects that could easily consume 
<br>
a billion dollars.  The vast majority of important research and 
<br>
development is still funded by deep pools of private capital owned by 
<br>
motivated and intelligent individuals.  Even mundane things like 
<br>
medical research can easily cost in the ballpark of a billion dollars 
<br>
for just one decent solution.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; When I mentioned 'socialism' earlier, I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lambasted with bad economic growth stats for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sweden. But I never said Sweden's economy was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; booming; I believe I used the word 'livable,'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which refers to other factors, some intangible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I will simply point out that Sweden has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a higher average life expectancy than the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States. Economic inequality is bad for the health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if you're on the bottom).
</em><br>
<p><p>What is the point of living if your entire life is a cog in a life 
<br>
support system?  I'd rather not go through life marking time so that 
<br>
the next generation can also mark time ad infinitum.  Not just no, but 
<br>
hell no.
<br>
<p>The number of people who might lose a few years of life in a wild and 
<br>
'dangerous' free market capitalist system pales in comparison to the 
<br>
number of lives and years that will be saved by the very rapid advance 
<br>
of technological development under such systems.  I'd rather not force 
<br>
everyone to share the misery for as long as possible under some 
<br>
misguided notion of social equality.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyone who dismisses my comments as the addled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravings of a granola-headed egalitarian naif
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should at least consider that a laissez-faire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian AI might feel no responsibility to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feed *you*. The social contract exists for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.
</em><br>
<p><p>Umm...  This arbitrary 'social contract' only exists insofar as it is 
<br>
forced upon people at gunpoint.  It is not an inviolable law of the 
<br>
universe.  Yet people generally get fed even when people are not forced 
<br>
to feed them.
<br>
<p>Good luck using threats of violence to force a super-intelligent AI to 
<br>
do *anything*.  This is a naive and dangerous view of AI.
