<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The real issue I see is the distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Right now business is moving to countries with low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labor costs like India and China.  If automation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gets good enough, however, cheap labor may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as much a factor.  Business may then pull out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really have a problem with people talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth&quot;.  Do you believe that &quot;wealth&quot; occurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally like fruit on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trees?
</em><br>
<p>I believe that total wealth (in the technical
<br>
economic sense of the term) consists of natural
<br>
resources in place + human capital + stored value
<br>
of manmade improvements to nature.
<br>
<p>The current distribution of these items in the US
<br>
are: 
<br>
<p>Bare land @ $1170/acre avg value x 7.6 acres/person
<br>
= $8.9K/person
<br>
Manmade stuff: $84K/person
<br>
Human capital: $18K/yr rental (i.e. wages)/8% discount
<br>
rate = $225K/person
<br>
<p>So, most of the wealth in the US is in the humans
<br>
and their skills right now.
<br>
<p>When I mentioned the distribution of wealth as an
<br>
issue, I don't mean I am a socialist that wants to
<br>
take stuff from rich people and give it to poor
<br>
people.  What I was talking about is the problem
<br>
that may be caused if large numbers of people are
<br>
first lured to cities in countries like China by
<br>
the prospect of a better life working in a factory.
<br>
<p>Once large numbers of people are in cities and no
<br>
longer on farms, if you then replace them with robots
<br>
because the robots are cheaper, you could then end
<br>
up with very large numbers of unemployed poor
<br>
people.  These people could then get mad at the 
<br>
rich countries or corporations for taking away their
<br>
jobs.  The very speed of technological development
<br>
is what may cause this problem by changing the
<br>
underlying economics faster than the people can
<br>
adapt.
<br>
<p>Lots of unemployed poor people with a reason to hate
<br>
the 'rich' (derserved or not) often leads to nasty
<br>
things like wars and revolutions.  The unresolved
<br>
issue is how the upcoming changes will play out.
