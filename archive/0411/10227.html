</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is done isn't understood yet, but the logic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; airtight--unfortunately.  :-(
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wrong. Evolution has not come to an end. Genes are only _more rational_ than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the iteration which came before.
</em><br>
<p>Using &quot;rational&quot; for a process like evolution is kind of a metaphor, but to 
<br>
put it in more prosaic terms, a gene has done the right thing 
<br>
(the  rational thing) if it builds (takes part in building along with tens 
<br>
of thousands of other genes) a vehicle (body) which succeeds in propagating 
<br>
said gene into the following generation.   It's a binary switch.  Looking 
<br>
into the past, the gene either did the right (rational) thing or it failed 
<br>
(sometimes by just being unlucky).  The genes we have with us today did the 
<br>
rational thing, the right thing (by this standard) every single time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In addition, collective volition would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extrapolate from the volition of the human agents, not their genes,
</em><br>
<p>The problem is the logic that genes build psychological mechanisms into our 
<br>
brains that under some circumstances shuts off rational thinking.  (I bet 
<br>
you could *see* it in action with fMRI, I would expect to see reduced 
<br>
metabolism in the prefrontal cortex.)  There is more than an example a week 
<br>
in the news--suicide bombers.  There is a good reason from our evolutionary 
<br>
past that we should have this mechanism.  This mechanism is part of what 
<br>
contributes to the collective volition of human agents.
<br>
<p>Understand I *don't like* this conclusion but so far I have found it 
<br>
inescapable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(taking the mostly accepted assumption on this list that humans could be ran
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a different substrate than genes) it is entirely possible that part of CV
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be getting rid of genes and genetic evolution.
</em><br>
<p>That's possible.  But if you are going to run humans on a different 
<br>
substrate than meat bodies (something I too think can be done) then you are 
<br>
going to have the same scary psychological mechanisms present--unless you 
<br>
edit them out.  The problem is not the substrate, but the mechanisms that 
<br>
were built into human brains/minds by millions of years of evolution as 
<br>
hunter-gatherers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I hope you are right about this  If you are, I don't think it will be due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the CV of large populations, but because the people who develop AI just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impose their collective ideas on what the AI should value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In which case CV wouldn't have been implemented.
</em><br>
<p>So be it.
<br>
<p>I don't care how long they have had to think about it or how much thinking 
<br>
power they had, I frankly *don't want* the CV of a mess of fundamentalist, 
<br>
rational impaired, suicide bombers contributing to the values of an 
<br>
extremely powerful AI.  Ghod knows I have had enough trouble from rational 
<br>
impaired scientologists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I suspect that Liberal-Democratic memes are a historic anomaly, caused by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a few centuries of tech driven mostly optimistic future prospects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly the effect of large families (see Frank Sulloway).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It doesn't very much matter what causes them, so long as they are deemed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a hyper-rational human with loads of time and knowledge, to be desireable.
</em><br>
<p>Good times, happy people.  Desirable?  Yes.
<br>
<p>The problem (in the past anyway) was that good times led to an expansion of 
<br>
the population which inevitably led to limited resources per person, i.e., 
<br>
bad times.  Unhappy people with a bleak future were a fertile substrate for 
<br>
xenophobic memes . . . .
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In addition, many of the bases for Liberal-Democracy go as far back as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Greece in their provenance. Maybe the situation hasn't been so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Liberal-Democracy (or whatever other &quot;progressive&quot; political system) was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viable in the past, but it would be viable now. Also, the issues of scarcity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would very much change after singularity.
</em><br>
<p>For a while, yes.  But it won't last, not without fundamental changes in 
<br>
human nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You should think about this a bit more.  The &quot;evolutionary detritus of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; past&quot; should be discarded with *extreme* care.  Most of the problems we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have can be solved by enough room rather than changing human nature.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course maintaining the ratio of resources to humans might require
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tinkering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's never enough room. Lightspeed is limited, and humans could expand at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exponential rates. However, if what you say is true (id est, human nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should not be changed)
</em><br>
<p>Didn't say that, just be really careful.  The consequences might be dire 
<br>
indeed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;CV could come to that outcome just as well, and give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us enough room, instead of helping us to live together in the room we have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, within the constraints of the possible.
</em><br>
<p>CV could come to the conclusion that high average happiness required 
<br>
periodic population culls too.
<br>
<p>I just don't know.
