</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population growth has run ahead of economic growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A significant part of the world now has below

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;A successful population model would have to explain

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;has a significantly higher rate.
</em><br>
<p>There are things evolutionary psychology models can't do and this is one of 
<br>
them.  High wealth of the modern kind was not part of the environment of 
<br>
evolutionary adaption, therefore you can't predict how humans are going to 
<br>
react to it.
<br>
<p>As EO Wilson said, we are just darn lucky that the birth rate goes down in 
<br>
high wealth societies.  It could have been quite the opposite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The highest rates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the world (all &gt;6.0) are in Afghanistan, Chad,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Congo, Gaza Strip, Mali, and Uganda.  These are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very poor places.
</em><br>
<p>That's true, and they are also places where the income per capita is 
<br>
declining due to fast population growth and places where there is 
<br>
considerable unrest if not outright wars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Wealth correlates with lower fertility rates, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are other factors at work.  Level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;urbanization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to be another major factor.  Children are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more expensive to raise in cities than on farms, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they can provide free labor.  Level of education
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also seems to contribute.  Former and current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Communist countries that had good education systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tend to have lower fertility rates.
</em><br>
<p>Significant points.  On a related list I recently mentioned Cuba, a bright 
<br>
spot on the population front in all of Latin America.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any case, the world's population growth rate is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slowing overall, with replacement fertility projected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for 2055 AD, at which time the total population
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(9.4 billion) will be less than 50% greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at present (6.4 billion).  Ignoring for a moment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the possibility of a singularity occurring in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next 50 years, automation and productivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improvements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are far outpacing population growth.
</em><br>
<p>That makes assumptions that might not be true.  Some cultures could be 
<br>
highly resistant to reducing their birth rate.  If so, the part of the 
<br>
total population in fast growth mode will increase.  Consider the 
<br>
Huterites, prehaps the most inbred group of people on the planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expect the general living conditions for mankind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a whole to improve.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  Provided we can deal with the consequences of having to switch 
<br>
energy sources.  But according to this EP related theory that's *not* 
<br>
enough.  You are going to get serious problems when there is any 
<br>
substantial sized group that feels *their* future looks bleak.  That 
<br>
unfortunately is the situation for a high fraction of the billion or so 
<br>
Islamics.  Even if only one out of a *thousand* gets involved in war or 
<br>
terrorism that's an awful problem.  Worse yet, it is hard to see how 
<br>
Islamic culture could change enough to accommodate the rise in the status 
<br>
of women needed for them to reduce the birth rate.  For example, birth 
<br>
control is illegal in Saudi Arabia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The real issue I see is the distribution of wealth.
</em><br>
<p>The real issue as I see it is a rise in the number of people trying to 
<br>
share out the wealth, resulting in a falling income per 
<br>
capita.  Distribution's a problem too as I mentioned in another post about 
<br>
the US income distribution.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>The subject isn't as far away from being on topic as I would like.  All of 
<br>
this and much more is going to be obvious to a high powered AI, friendly or 
<br>
not.  What entities more powerful than humans would do about this &quot;human 
<br>
condition&quot; is something to wake you up in the night.  What *humans* are 
<br>
likely to do in the not so distant future isn't much better.
<br>
<p>I am afraid that some cultures are going to have to change/be changed to 
<br>
the point current members of them would say they had been 
<br>
destroyed.  That's not without precedent.  The British wiped out an entire 
<br>
culture/religion in India; the only thing left today is the word 
<br>
&quot;thug.&quot;  Considering the population problem India has, wiping out a 
<br>
predator might not have been the best idea in the long run, but at the time 
<br>
it sure seemed like a good idea.
<br>
<p>The whole subject is really depressing.
