<p>Sitting around fantasizing about building monuments
<br>
post-Singularity won't get us anywhere.  We're
<br>
currently stuck on the other side of the Singularity -
<br>
and what a banal, brutish existence it is!  
<br>
<p>I estimate that any serious AGI project (including
<br>
Sing Inst) needs an income level of at least $US 300
<br>
000 per year to 'ramp up' to full-scale operations. 
<br>
6-8 full-time team members, who would need to be paid
<br>
at least the 'entry level' salary of $US 25 000 per
<br>
year.  That's $US 150 000 per year for a team of 6. 
<br>
Then about the same amount for office space, hardware
<br>
etc.  So at least $US 300 000 per year.  I’m glad
<br>
progress is being made, but I still see no sign that
<br>
Sing Inst is yet near that sort of cash flow.
<br>
<p>Worse, AGI theory seems to be getting more
<br>
complicated.  There is more to CV than to earlier
<br>
versions of FAI theory, and it would appear to my eyes
<br>
that for every AI problem Eliezer is solving, two more
<br>
are popping up.  My suspicion is now overwhelmingly
<br>
strong that (a) CV cannot be calculated by a
<br>
Singleton, (b) that completely selfless AGI is
<br>
impossible, and (c) that real-time general
<br>
intelligence without sentience is impossible.  If I'm
<br>
right, even CV is not the last word, and yet another
<br>
major theoretical change is yet to be made by Eliezer.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, assuming a successful Singularity,
<br>
post-humans are right now poring over the SL4
<br>
archives.  They are no doubt of great interest to
<br>
post-human historians.  Interesting really.  Either
<br>
I'll go down in the history of the galaxy as a total
<br>
clown, or I'll be remembered forever as the guy that
<br>
actually challenged the great Yudkowsky and made
<br>
several key conjectures that were later proven
<br>
correct.    Moral of the story: post to SL4 and the
<br>
post-humans are watching.  The whole galaxy is reading
<br>
these archives.  (Assuming a successful Singularity of
<br>
course).
<br>
<p>Back on topic:  The increasing difficulty, the lack of
<br>
funds and so on.  Let's give Eliezer the benefit of
<br>
the doubt and assume that he now understands all the
<br>
necessary conceptual fundamentals of FAI theory (which
<br>
I'm pretty sure he doesn't).  Even so, formalizing all
<br>
that should take at least 15-20 years.  I base this,
<br>
as I said in an earlier post, on the length of time it
<br>
took other geniuses to move from principles to maths. 
<br>
And the level of difficulty is likely to be 'gut
<br>
busting' - probably the sort of math’s required is at
<br>
the 'Riemann Hypothesis' level of difficulty.  You
<br>
shouldn't kid yourself - even if everything goes
<br>
right, I don't see anyone getting to FAI in less than
<br>
15 years.  So that's 2019 at the earliest. 
<br>
<p>It gets worse.  The existential threats may start
<br>
popping up earlier than I thought.  I was reading some
<br>
stuff from the Center For Responsible Nano (Mike
<br>
Treder's think tank).  I originally thought nano
<br>
wouldn't be threat until 2030 and beyond.  But now
<br>
Treder and others are pretty sure nano's gonna be
<br>
hitting in force as early as 2020.  So the risks are
<br>
going to start going up after 2020.  This date is just
<br>
after the shortest time I think it's possible to get
<br>
to FAI  ;) 
<br>
<p>Eliezer's best years might soon be behind him, as he
<br>
said.  The AI problems are popping up faster than he
<br>
can solve them, and he could soon start slowing down
<br>
with age.  There's no funding.  FAI theory keeps
<br>
getting more complicated.  Formalizing conceptual
<br>
principles takes 15-20 years.  And existential risks
<br>
from nano could be as little as 15 years away.  It's
<br>
not looking good at all.
<br>
<p>So:  Only a small band of dedicated Singulatarians
<br>
know what's going on, long odds, certain death if we
<br>
fail fate of the universe at stake.  I love it :D
