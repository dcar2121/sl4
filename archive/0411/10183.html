Hi Dave,
<br>
<p>I don't have time or inclination for a long conversation on why you think my
<br>
ideas are &quot;bogus&quot;, and why I think you didn't understand them.  I'll respond
<br>
to this message at moderate length but after this one my replies on this
<br>
theme are likely to become very brief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS I took the time to respond to your paper and you obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took offense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take offense to you saying I have a &quot;basic lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding&quot;.  Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really so smart?
</em><br>
<p>You are quoting me out of context.  I didn't say that you had a basic lack
<br>
of understanding in a general sense -- just that you appeared to have a
<br>
basic lack of understanding of the ideas in that particular essay of mine.
<br>
A contention that your follow-up response appears to validate!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You say I &quot;displays such a basic lack of understanding&quot; but I think I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your article quite well.  At least well enough to know that you are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a concept &quot;compassion&quot; which has a well defined English meaning into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fits your concept of programming an AI.
</em><br>
<p>This comment suggests to me that you have a basic lack of understanding
<br>
about the ideas in my essay ;)  Those ideas are not tied to any particular
<br>
theory of AI, and are not even tied to the Church-Turing Thesis.  Their
<br>
validity or not is independent of whether any digital computer program can
<br>
ever be intelligent, whether the Novamente design can ever work, etc.
<br>
<p>If they're &quot;reductionist&quot;, it's not in a computationalist or physicalist
<br>
sense, just in a patternist sense.  They're reductionist in exactly the same
<br>
sense that Nietzschean and Peircean philosophy are reductionist: they try to
<br>
reduce phenomena to &quot;habit-patterns with a tendency to spread&quot; as Peirce put
<br>
it, or &quot;will to power and morphology&quot; as Nietzsche put it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a huge difference to the method I described for creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yours.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to fit a number of different methods into an &quot;agent&quot; context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degenerate and others stick around.  I said that there is some peripheral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefulness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this concept but you have made it the base of your implementation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a set of models the basis for the AI and all of the other useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; update and refine that model as they go.  The models can be arbitrarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple or complex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With your agents coming and going, you have no stable place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even see if your teaching of the AI is progressing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm sorry if you feel it's rude for me to say so, but all these
<br>
statements about my Novamente AI design are completely false and misguided,
<br>
and indicate that either you have not read the overview at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.realai.net/AAAI01.pdf">http://www.realai.net/AAAI01.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>or have not understood it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't appreciate your condescending attitude at all.
</em><br>
<p>And conversely, my friend, I don't particularly appreciate your wildly
<br>
inaccurate characterization of my AI theory ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your paper didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different than others I have read from Marc Geddes.  Eliezer has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him pegged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right in his last few emails.  Marc was castigated for comparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Einstein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and rightly so) but you say &quot;one has to look at evolution and ethics as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intertwined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifestations of the same deeper phenomena.&quot;  You go on to argue your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;deeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena&quot;.  Your document purports to be above the theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I made such a grand statement, I think I would have backed it up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts and rigor (if you will).
</em><br>
<p>Regarding evolution, in my essay I referred to my 1993 book &quot;The Evolving
<br>
Mind&quot; where I dealt with the theory of evolution in detail, with plenty of
<br>
facts and at least a moderate amount of rigor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your document purports to have *arguments* for your hypothesis.  I made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points, IMHO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that showed your hypothesis to be wrong and your arguments to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions or conclusions.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are clearly arguments presented there, in the sense of steps
<br>
leading from assumptions to conclusions.  They are not rigorous arguments,
<br>
they're just qualitative arguments, as one finds in the writings of
<br>
Nietzsche, Peirce, and many other philosophers whom I like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think your take on Natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Selection is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite *novel*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach and my textbooks from University (2000) on *phenotypic selection*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely nothing on &quot;pattern-sympathy&quot;. (Human Evolution An Illustrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Introduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Roger Lewin 1999 or The Origin of Moden Humans by Roger Lewin 1998)
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Pattern-sympath&quot; is an original term.  My take on evolution is original but
<br>
is in the line of many other modern thinkers; see references in &quot;The
<br>
Evolving Mind&quot; (Gordon and Breach, 1993).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wasn't the person that said your document was &quot;it just argues that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of compassion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is natural and inevitable.&quot;, you were.  As my proof that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion is *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call to the stand all the people I see around me that don't help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ladies across the street.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I call all the people in the Western World that have a car and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fancy house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die of starvation all over the world.  If you want to make a hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we can all see around us all the time, don't you think you should at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least be somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convincing?
</em><br>
<p>My argument was not that the world displays an optimal or maximal degree of
<br>
compassion, I believe I made that clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To write something to be potentially convincing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people with opposing points of view would require a lot more time, space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; didacticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you always just write for people who might already agree with you?
</em><br>
<p>Not always.  When I write academic papers, I try hard to be convincing to
<br>
skeptical referees just like everyone else!  But I find it a slow and
<br>
painful process....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you think a pattern is something so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than what the dictionary says, then maybe you can point me to your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary so I can figure it out.
</em><br>
<p>I presented my approach to &quot;pattern theory&quot; in my books The Structure of
<br>
Intelligence (Springer-Verlag, 1993), The Evolving Mind, Chaotic Logic
<br>
(Plenum, 1994) and perhaps most briefly in Section 1.5 of From Complexity to
<br>
Creativity (Plenum, 1997).  A somewhat lossy HTML dump is at:
