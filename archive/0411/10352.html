<p>
Is this SL4 material? Dunno, but it surely seems relevant to models of 
<br>
pre-wired brain localization, which is perhaps salient to any AI design.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From the same source previously cited, another footnote:
<br>
<p>&quot;To take one example from perhaps the most thorough report available, Jean 
<br>
Itard says of a boy who appears to have spent his first eleven years in 
<br>
isolation,… he seemed to be equally indifferent to the odour of the
<br>
finest perfumes, and to the most fetid exhalations…. [He had]… an obstinate 
<br>
habit of smelling at everything which came his way, even bodies which 
<br>
appeared to us inodorous…. A dead canary bird was one day given him, and in 
<br>
an instant he stripped off its feathers, great and small, tore it open with 
<br>
his nails, smelt it,and threw it away…. The articles of food with which 
<br>
this child was fed, for a little time after his arrival at Paris, were 
<br>
shockingly disgusting. He trailed them about the room, and ate them out of 
<br>
his hands that were besmeared with filth.&quot;
