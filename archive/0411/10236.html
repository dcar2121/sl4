----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Dani Eder&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real issue I see is the distribution of wealth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now business is moving to countries with low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor costs like India and China.  If automation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets good enough, however, cheap labor may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much a factor.  Business may then pull out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I really have a problem with people talking about the &quot;distribution of
<br>
wealth&quot;.  Do you believe that &quot;wealth&quot; occurs naturally like fruit on the
<br>
trees?  There was a time, before the 20th century, when wealth mostly
<br>
accrued from farming.  This meant that whoever controlled the land,
<br>
controlled the generation of wealth.  Today, very little overall wealth is
<br>
derived from agriculture in the Western World even though we all have to
<br>
eat.  Even the wealth derived from oil, mining, timber and fishing are
<br>
mostly obtained by technology derived not these natural resources but from
<br>
modern technology.
<br>
<p>Wealth (in the Western World) is primarily generated by thinking minds.  (A
<br>
case in point is the relatively low natural resources available in Japan and
<br>
their relatively high degree of wealth.)  Wealth is not some commodity that
<br>
arrives from &quot;heaven&quot; that people should share as to their need.  Wealth is
<br>
created by the hard work of people like you and me and I highly resent
<br>
anyone trying to re-distribute the small amount of &quot;wealth&quot; that my hard
<br>
work has created.  It has been found that the higher the degree of
<br>
re-distribution of wealth, the less of it is created!
<br>
<p>Socialism has been shown to fail, everywhere it has been tried around the
<br>
world.  There is a huge amount of evidence that shows that the greatest
<br>
&quot;wealth&quot; and highest standards of living for all are created where free
<br>
enterprise reins and socialism is minimized. (I realize that true socialism
<br>
or true free enterprise don't exist anywhere, so I am talking in relative
<br>
terms.)
<br>
<p>Your last point about automation making the &quot;cheap labor&quot; advantage of
<br>
countries like India and China a smaller factor in the future is a good one.
<br>
I just hope I can help make that happen sooner rather than later.
<br>
<p>-- David Clark
