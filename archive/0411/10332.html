I am sorry to hear this. Such a short life.
<br>
Nineteen years is a blink, not enough time to
<br>
learn much more than the rudiments of life. My
<br>
daughter Heidi is a year older than he was.
<br>
<p>George Gurdjieff, a very great Russian
<br>
philosopher, said the human race needed a new
<br>
organ, which he whimsically named the
<br>
kundabuffer, and the purpose of this organ would
<br>
be to remind us each minute of every day that we
<br>
would die, that we had not time to squander.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, find and read Edgar Lee Masters' slim
<br>
book of poetry Spoon River Anthology. A friend
<br>
gave me a copy with the inscription &quot;What do you
<br>
know of loss, that makes you different from other
<br>
men?&quot; I was in a very low place, and that book
<br>
gave me perspective (and it is the least boring
<br>
book of poetry ever written, I think).
<br>
<p>My parents and grandparents are all gone. Almost
<br>
all the optimism I once had for the human race is
<br>
gone. I have told my daughter that I am likely to
<br>
die a political prisoner. At present, I see only
<br>
one bright spot on the horizon. It is your work
<br>
and that of the others in this community (I am
<br>
only a kibitzer).
<br>
<p>re: Your statement &quot;What would it be like to be a
<br>
rational atheist in the fifteenth century, and
<br>
know beyond all hope of rescue that everyone you
<br>
loved would be annihilated, one after another,
<br>
unless you yourself died first?  That is still
<br>
the fate of humans today; the ongoing horror has
<br>
not changed, for all that we have hope.&quot; 
<br>
In a commencement speech of last year, Lewis
<br>
Lapham mentioned a &quot;French noblewoman, a duchess
<br>
in her 80s, who, on seeing the first ascent of
<br>
Montgolfier's balloon from the palace of the
<br>
Tuilleries in 1783, fell back upon the cushions
<br>
of her carriage and wept. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she said,
<br>
&quot;Now it's certain. One day they'll learn how to
<br>
keep people alive forever, but I shall already be
<br>
dead.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is not only our selves who die when our bodies
<br>
die, but even the selves we might have been who
<br>
die when we reject choices, as we must, every
<br>
day. Believe me, this is something I know about.
<br>
I admire you tremendously for not wasting your
<br>
life on trivial things, as so many others seem
<br>
happy to do. With Death on the other side of the
<br>
chessboard, I am glad you are on our side.
<br>
