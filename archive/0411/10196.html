</em><br>
<p>Well, the stress of all those simultaneous questions fried the 
<br>
email-writing module of my brain... oh, you mean the donations campaign.
<br>
<p>56 people donated a total of $8,071 during the Today and Tomorrow campaign. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's more people than donated during all of 2003.
<br>
<p>The country of Denmark is now represented on the monument.  A toast to Denmark!
<br>
<p>Finland continued its steady march toward galactic domination.
<br>
<p>Owing to bad user interface design on our part, many people did not 
<br>
remember to designate their donations as &quot;Challenge Grant&quot;.  Tyler checked 
<br>
with the first 8 people who forgot to say so explicitly.  One didn't reply 
<br>
and 7 said that was what they had intended.  From this sample it looks to 
<br>
me like a factually safe guess to say that everyone who donated during the 
<br>
Today and Tomorrow campaign intended their donation to be matched, but 
<br>
SIAI's Board is still discussing this, which is why no one has posted a 
<br>
summary of the campaign yet.  The figure currently on the website shows the 
<br>
amount that people remembered to explicitly allocate to the Challenge 
<br>
Grant.  Bad user interface, I know, I know, we'll try to come up with some 
<br>
way to fix it next time.  There's also supposed to be another couple of 
<br>
checks in the mail, which should almost entirely fill the Challenge Grant 
<br>
regardless.
<br>
<p>I think it's safe to assume that the Challenge Grant will be filled when 
<br>
the total is added up, though if anyone wants to donate just in case, it 
<br>
wouldn't hurt.  We'll post another, official summary including public 
<br>
support figures and so on, once we do a bit more scribbling and figuring.
<br>
<p>SIAI had 7 donors over the $5K limit when the Today and Tomorrow campaign 
<br>
started.  That total is now up to 9.  Both new major donors had donated 
<br>
before the Today and Tomorrow campaign.  SIAI could still use more major 
<br>
donors to help with our public support situation.
<br>
<p>I will try to start answering at least some of the accumulated questions 
<br>
once my email-writing module recovers.
<br>
<p>Our thanks to everyone!
<br>
