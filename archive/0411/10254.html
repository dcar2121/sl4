Response to Keith Henson:
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Well at one time it *was* the fruit on trees.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>The point I made was, it *isn't* now.  Wealth today in *our* society is the
<br>
result of *hard work* not &quot;manna from heaven&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The point to my stuff was about stressed human populations being a fertile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media for war memes.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>I do not subscribe to this hypothesis.  Throughout the middle ages, there
<br>
were only (almost) rich and very poor.  It was rarely the poor that started
<br>
the wars.  When those wars were started by the noblemen, the poor were the
<br>
ones to die and their lousy lives were better than being dead.  The
<br>
situation of rich versus poor in the US and Canada today is magnitudes of
<br>
difference from those times.  Even those peasants' conditions didn't produce
<br>
war. (The French Revolution is probably an exception but it could have been
<br>
motivated but factors other than a difference is wealth)
<br>
<p><p><p>The fact that some people are hugely more productive (individually and
<br>
through labor magnifiers like invention and business groupings) than other
<br>
people.  The fact that some are hugely more capable of creating wealth than
<br>
others.  The fact that some are hugely more motivated to produce, save and
<br>
reinvest wealth makes the egalitarian idea of *equality* a pipe dream that
<br>
will not happen.  The fact is that people are not born equal in almost every
<br>
important way.  By using families to bring up the children (at least in
<br>
part) also means that children will *not* have an equal upbringing.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; As to how wealth should be distributed, that's a hard question.  Much as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't like it, having the rich pay a lot of taxes might be the least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disruptive method.  The point is to get substantially all of the
</em><br>
population
<br>
<em>&gt; to expect an improving future.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Your *solution* to your theory of a *war meme* is totally mute if your
<br>
theory is incorrect!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But I can also see the side that a substantial fraction of a population is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to feel stressed and seeing a bleak future if the income per capita
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is redistributed away from some parts of the population to other parts.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>I have a different theory of what propagates a *war meme*.  Have you ever
<br>
seen a war started by a country who felt their military was weak relative to
<br>
the country they wished to attack?  It might have happened that a weak
<br>
military attacked a stronger one but did the attacking country believe the
<br>
other country was stronger and attacked anyway.  I don't think so.  People
<br>
perceive wrongs and injustice treatment from other countries and normally do
<br>
nothing about it but they collectively remember such things for generations.
<br>
When they find their adversary weak, the culmination of all the bad blood
<br>
between the countries makes the possibility of war, possible.  It is the
<br>
relative weakness of the other country that allows the possibility of
<br>
*righting the wrongs* by the use of force.  You can substitute individual
<br>
people for the warring nations and get the same result.  People initiate
<br>
physical violence when they feel a wrong and detect weakness in their
<br>
opponent.
<br>
<p>I am sure this is not the case every time but it seems to fit more cases
<br>
than a difference of income within the population which has historically
<br>
always been the case.
<br>
<p><p><p>Your theory is about pacifying your potential opponents by making sure their
<br>
standard of living increases at your expense.  This creates the appearance
<br>
of a kind of weakness that helps to precipitate wars!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; To put a specific example on the table, the US has gone from a nation with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a big bulge in the middle income distribution to one where there more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an hour glass, there being rich folks and poor folks and not much in
</em><br>
between.
<br>
<p><p><p>This might be true (some would disagree) but it is only bad if the top of
<br>
the hourglass didn't deserve to have their favored position.  I am sure some
<br>
don't deserve to be well off (you could give many examples I know) but what
<br>
about the vast majority of high income earners who worked hard and earned
<br>
what they have?  Even though some poor people are poor through no fault of
<br>
their own, productive, useful people will never stay poor for long.  So long
<br>
as they are free to move where useful work can be found, they can always be
<br>
productive if they choose. (For some disabled people this might not be the
<br>
case.)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Regardless of my or your political leanings, this is conducive to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stressed fraction of the population (large!) being susceptible to war
</em><br>
memes
<br>
<em>&gt; and going into war mode.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Most poor people have no inclination to *war* with anyone.  How can a
<br>
relatively small police force is the poorest ghettoes in the US cities keep
<br>
order?  They are organized, trained and have better equipment than the poor
<br>
people they police.  The poorest of the poor in Africa don't wage war even
<br>
when they are starving.  They just die!  If your theory is correct, it
<br>
should hold true everywhere, no?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I think it might be worth adding to having lots of smarts, information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to think about what's desirable, you might want the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing to the CV to have improving income per capita to keep war
</em><br>
mode
<br>
<em>&gt; switched off.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Isn't the idea of CV being &quot;what we would think if we were smart enough&quot; to
<br>
exclude the direct contribution to CV of even the smartest of people?
<br>
Ordinary people wouldn't add anything to the CV from what I can see.  Wouldn
<br>
't expanding the goal of getting to the singularity be complicated many fold
<br>
if we add the obligation to raise the income levels of all people?
<br>
(Regardless of whether they have earned it.)
