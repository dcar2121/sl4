<p>
With the recent talk about how much money it would take to actually
<br>
start programming the seed AI, I remembered something I heard about
<br>
Google: They let their employees spend about 20% of their time at work
<br>
on personal projects. Since they have a very large number of very
<br>
smart people with skills that would be needed to code a seed AI, and
<br>
anyone likely to help would also spend a good deal of their time at
<br>
home as well as their 20% at work on the seed AI, perhaps this could
<br>
greatly cut down on the amount of money needed to actually start the
<br>
project.
<br>
<p>As a completely unrelated point of information, Malcolm Gladwell, of
<br>
&quot;The Tipping Point&quot; fame, has a new book coming out that may be of
<br>
some interest to some of you. There are a few excerpts on his web
<br>
site: <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/blink/index.html">http://www.gladwell.com/blink/index.html</a>
<br>
The third excerpt is on the same subject as one of his articles for
<br>
the New Yorker, titled &quot;The Naked Face&quot;, which is in the articles
<br>
section of his website.
<br>
<p>Perhaps that wasn't such an unrelated point of information as we might
<br>
be able use the ideas in &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; to identify the people
<br>
within Google who could help us spread the word about SIAI and
<br>
persuade others to help.
