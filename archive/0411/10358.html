Brain imaging could spot liars
<br>
Mark Peplow
<br>
Tests reveals patches in the brain that light up during a lie.
<br>
<p>Lying activates tell-tale areas of the brain that can be tracked using 
<br>
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), according to scientists who 
<br>
believe the technique could replace traditional lie detectors
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>Faro and his colleagues asked six volunteers to fire a toy gun. The 
<br>
subjects then lay inside an fMRI scanner and lied about having fired the 
<br>
shot. They also received a polygraph test. Five more volunteers who did not 
<br>
shoot the gun were tested in the same ways to compare their responses.
<br>
<p>Both tests caught out the liars and identified the truth-tellers in every 
<br>
case. The fMRI scan showed that specific areas of the brain were active 
<br>
during lying, including key parts of the frontal, temporal and limbic 
<br>
lobes. Overall, more areas of the subjects' brains were activated when they 
<br>
lied.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>However he points out that the method will need to be made much cheaper 
<br>
before it could be used routinely. Efficient lie detectors are needed to 
<br>
beef up security in airports, he says, but million-dollar fMRI machines are 
<br>
simply not an affordable solution.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p>It is too early to tell whether fMRI can be fooled in the same way as the 
<br>
polygraph, says Faro. However, he says that the results are promising 
<br>
because these characteristic brain patterns may be beyond conscious 
<br>
control, rendering it much more difficult to cheat.
