<em>&gt; &gt; The key to understanding this is that the psychological traits behind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coupling from a bleak outlook to war through xenophobic memes evolved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *stone age* when there wasn't a big technological gap or even a big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size gap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between one tribe and the next.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So when things started to look like the tribe members were not going to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough game and berries to get through the next season, going to war was on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average a 50-50 proposition for the people, and war was a *much* better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the genes of these primitive people than starving.  The worst case was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that all the males in one of the tribes fighting would be killed.  That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still better for the *genes* of the losers than starving because copies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their genes are in the young women of the tribe who are normally booty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; winners.  (A perverse application of Hamilton's inclusive fitness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criteria.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So over a multi million year time frame, genes that made it more likely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tribe facing starvation would go to war with neighbors instead of quitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; starving became standard.  I propose that such genes build psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; traits that increase the &quot;gain&quot; of circulating xenophobic memes in times of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the particular stress of &quot;looming privation.&quot;  You can see where the stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; factor comes in because all the normal inhibitions of not attacking nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strangers who might just as well kill *you* have to be overcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In order for your theory to be testable and critisizable and thus of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use,
</em><br>
<p>Any causal theory, especially one that can be stated from deep principles, 
<br>
is of more use than no theory.  Even if you can't directly test it (and how 
<br>
are you going to do experimental Big Bangs) it allows comparisons you can 
<br>
make with other proposed theories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;how do you propose it could be tested? What methods are there to (try
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to) falsify this theory of yours?
</em><br>
<p>There are ethical problems with experiments provoking wars so that's 
<br>
probably out.  :-)
<br>
<p>Predictions can be made.  One theory about war is that when the proportion 
<br>
of young men goes over some particular percentage, that causes war.  China 
<br>
is at or beyond the prediction percentage as a result of selective 
<br>
abortion/infanticide.  This theory says China will not attack neighbors as 
<br>
long as their income per capita is rising.  (They can still go into war 
<br>
mode as a result of *being* attacked of course.)  We could also take a look 
<br>
at income per capita trends and predict where there are going to be problems.
<br>
<p>The theory would have to be modified or thrown out if there are historical 
<br>
examples of a population in &quot;good times&quot; mode, i.e., rising income per 
<br>
capita and good future prospects, having a random upsurge of xenophobic 
<br>
memes and going to war *without* being attacked.  In favor of the theory is 
<br>
the inverse correlation of neo-nazi memes/activity and economic prospects 
<br>
in the US.  If you could get good data, the timing lag would be a good 
<br>
number to know.
<br>
<p>The theory requires psychological *mechanisms* implemented in neural 
<br>
hardware, that are ultimately the results of genes.  Chimps act enough like 
<br>
humans (genocide of neighbors) that they probably share the psychological 
<br>
mechanism and (versions of) the underlying brain genes.  Bonobos might 
<br>
not.  They have not (so far) been observed carrying out genocidal attacks 
<br>
on neighboring groups.  (Which brings up the question of how bonobo 
<br>
populations are ultimately limited?)  Genetic comparison of human, chimp 
<br>
and bonobo for genes active in brain construction might be useful.
<br>
<p>Failing to find evidence of the mechanisms would certainly throw the theory 
<br>
into doubt.
<br>
<p>My guess is that some clever fMRI work would show that there is a mechanism 
<br>
for inhibiting rational thinking when other modes were in the gene's 
<br>
interest in the EEA.  &quot;Gain&quot; on the spread of xenophobic class memes might 
<br>
be shown this way too, though I don't know exactly how.
<br>
<p>To tie this back into being on topic, it is going to be hard enough for FAI 
<br>
to emerge in humans who are not in &quot;war mode.&quot;   &quot;Friendly&quot; wouldn't be 
<br>
high on the list for researchers in war mode.  Consider the Manhattan 
<br>
project.  <a href="http://www.me.utexas.edu/~uer/manhattan/debates.html">http://www.me.utexas.edu/~uer/manhattan/debates.html</a>
