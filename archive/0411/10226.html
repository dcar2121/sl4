<em>&gt; It does seem rather unlikely that a Islamic fundamentalist and I would
</em><br>
ever
<br>
<em>&gt; come to agree.  Heck, it is unlikely that I would agree on what the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be like with a fundamentalist Christian and I grew up in that
</em><br>
culture.
<br>
<p>I suppose the dangerous idea in CV is that there are _real_ answers to the
<br>
questions of what humans ought to be. Essentially, that just by being more
<br>
intelligent, more rational, more knowledgeable, we would all end up
<br>
cohereing towards the same answers, or a set of answers that would allow us
<br>
to live together, at least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah . . . . You and I and a lot of our friends are likely have such
</em><br>
idealist
<br>
<em>&gt; desires.  I am most reluctant to assume that beyond a rather narrow
</em><br>
segment
<br>
<em>&gt; of western high tech cultures.  I was watching a nature show tonight where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the locals worship rats, about 6000 of them.
</em><br>
<p>It's most often the case, and this goes back as far as ancient Greco-Roman
<br>
cultures, that war is bemoaned as a necessary evil, not aclaimed as a pure
<br>
good.
<br>
However, I admit that people might not come to agree on this principle, even
<br>
with more intelligence, time to think, knowledge, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have come to the horrid realization that wars are what happens when some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant segment of a human population thinks they are facing a bleak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.  We evolved as gene survival machines.  Now *genes* by the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of the process are rational.  But a for a gene to be rational, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is survive into the next generation, in some circumstances it induces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational thinking and behavior into its carriers.  The mechanism by
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; this is done isn't understood yet, but the logic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airtight--unfortunately.  :-(
</em><br>
<p>Wrong. Evolution has not come to an end. Genes are only _more rational_ than
<br>
the iteration which came before. In addition, collective volition would
<br>
extrapolate from the volition of the human agents, not their genes, and
<br>
(taking the mostly accepted assumption on this list that humans could be ran
<br>
in a different substrate than genes) it is entirely possible that part of CV
<br>
would be getting rid of genes and genetic evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope you are right about this  If you are, I don't think it will be due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the CV of large populations, but because the people who develop AI just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impose their collective ideas on what the AI should value.
</em><br>
<p>In which case CV wouldn't have been implemented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect that Liberal-Democratic memes are a historic anomaly, caused by
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; few centuries of tech driven mostly optimistic future prospects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly the effect of large families (see Frank Sulloway).
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't very much matter what causes them, so long as they are deemed by
<br>
a hyper-rational human with loads of time and knowledge, to be desireable.
<br>
In addition, many of the bases for Liberal-Democracy go as far back as
<br>
Greece in their provenance. Maybe the situation hasn't been so that
<br>
Liberal-Democracy (or whatever other &quot;progressive&quot; political system) was
<br>
viable in the past, but it would be viable now. Also, the issues of scarcity
<br>
would very much change after singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You should think about this a bit more.  The &quot;evolutionary detritus of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past&quot; should be discarded with *extreme* care.  Most of the problems we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have can be solved by enough room rather than changing human nature.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course maintaining the ratio of resources to humans might require
</em><br>
tinkering
<br>
<em>&gt; anyway.
</em><br>
<p>There's never enough room. Lightspeed is limited, and humans could expand at
<br>
exponential rates. However, if what you say is true (id est, human nature
<br>
should not be changed) CV could come to that outcome just as well, and give
<br>
us enough room, instead of helping us to live together in the room we have.
<br>
Of course, within the constraints of the possible.
<br>
<p>--David.
