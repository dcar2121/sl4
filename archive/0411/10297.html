</em><br>
<p>If you are interested in this subject, you should take a look at &quot;Constant 
<br>
Battles&quot; by Steven LeBlanc. I'm currently reading on the book and it tells 
<br>
a lot about the constant warfare that people have been going through for a 
<br>
long, long time. For example, in many (most?) stone age tribes living 
<br>
nowadays, 25% of all males die of warfare. It would also seem that times 
<br>
of peace (within stone age people, and before) have only occurred in 
<br>
history when there has been much fewer people than resources. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, as far as I've read, it does not seem to suggest total 
<br>
kind of warfare in those troubled times. Rather the battles that occur 
<br>
within bands tend to be small and often nobody gets killed. It's just that 
<br>
when you sum up the losses through a persons life you get a large amount 
<br>
of casualties. 
<br>
<p>So if these findings are true, then it definitely invalidates the old myth 
<br>
of the 'golden age' of human kind when all was good, etc. It also 
<br>
invalidates Keiths claims, since the bands and tribes tend to fight 
<br>
constantly and suffer small losses all the time and not in a suicidal 
<br>
mood.
<br>
<p>I would also suggest that some ways of testing Keiths hypothesis is to 
<br>
take a look at the record of stone age tribes we know about and how they 
<br>
act. And to take a look at historical and archeological record. Does it 
<br>
seem true that people go for this sort of suicidal rampage? I don't see 
<br>
that when I look at history, so it would be nice, if you (Keith) can come 
<br>
up with specific examples of that happening.

<em>&gt; Until I was motivated to figure it out by having a cult spend a ton of

<em>&gt; psychological traits that could be called forth to make them monsters

</em><br>
<em>&gt; events.
</em><br>
<p>I lived the first 18 years of my life in a cult and saw people doing some 
<br>
pretty nasty things to people. Now I don't think the actions were a result 
<br>
of evolutionary (genetic) behavior patterns. I find it much more plausible 
<br>
that they would be of memetic kind. 
<br>
<p>Religions are good at that; they tend to create a system, which is 
<br>
uncriticisable and gives certain people (the cult leaders) power to 
<br>
control a lot of things within the system. It is the existence of 
<br>
uncriticisable premisses that allows all those montrosities to happen. Now 
<br>
evolutionary origins are needed in explaining them. (Which doesn't mean 
<br>
that they don't exist, but we should go for the simplest explanation á la 
<br>
Occam's Razor, right?). 
<br>
<p><p>In addition you guys should all remember that one of the things that 
<br>
general intelligence is about: it's about being able to respond to a 
<br>
situation, not in a hardwired way, but by analyzing the situation and 
<br>
creating the best answer based on our perception of reality. This means 
<br>
that emergence of general intelligence in humans has necessarily seen lots 
<br>
and lots of genetically defined responses to things disappear. 
<br>
<p>And that from the time that memetic evolution became possible, it became 
<br>
very, very unlikely for any behavioral changes such as those you are 
<br>
talking about, to become from genetic origins. After all, if there was a 
<br>
mutant with beneficial behavioral patterns, others not having that gene 
<br>
would be able to mimic him and the mutated gene would get no benefit to 
<br>
its fitness.
