Response to &quot;Keith Henson&quot;:
<br>
<p>Now it seems *you* are the one lacking understanding.  Your hypothesis was
<br>
that wars are caused by *war memes* that are caused by unequal distribution
<br>
of wealth.  The result of this theory is that singularitarians must reduce
<br>
this uneven wealth distribution or we will be at war.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I said *nothing* about the number of humans that could be maintained in
<br>
their environment in ancient history.  I only said that people were widely
<br>
dispersed and there is no evidence that shows they contained a *war meme*.
<br>
I think they were too busy just surviving.  The fact that the ancient
<br>
environment had many harsh pressures is *not* in dispute, only that there is
<br>
no evidence for a *war meme* in our fossil record.  How is your *momma bear*
<br>
analogy relevant to proving a *war meme*?  I have no problem believing that
<br>
all living creatures try to populate any given environment as much as the
<br>
conditions allow *but* why does that prove that one of those pressures was
<br>
*war*?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In fact your *war meme* hypothesis might be correct but you have not given
<br>
any good reasons why anyone should believe you.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; [Editorial note, I now am wondering if rejecting thinking about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject might be due to _wired in_ censors
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't think I have &quot;rejected thinking&quot; about this topic at all.  The fact
<br>
that I have responded to you should be *proof* of that!
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &quot;Global maturing&quot; may be a lot harder if censor biases keep us from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about this class of knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I guess anyone who disagrees with you has to put up with being called
<br>
&quot;immature&quot;.  I think calling other people names is a sign of weakness!
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Human's generally don't have twins like bears, but in a primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment the typical woman is pregnant or nursing from late teens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early 40s.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I was taught at University (in 2000) that historically, women started
<br>
having children at about 14 and lasted (lived) on average until about 20.
<br>
30 years old was considered almost ancient.  Most men didn't make it past 20
<br>
years old.  At least 50% of children didn't make it to their first birthday.
<br>
There was a cultural practice in South East Asia that a baby was only
<br>
considered human after they have reached the age of 1.  If it died before
<br>
the age of 1, it was discarded in the trash like leftovers.  The reason for
<br>
this was to minimize the grief of the mother and family because so many
<br>
babies died in there first year of life.  Your facts don't seem to jive with
<br>
what I have studied.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I put forward a theory of war that had to do with the perceived relative
<br>
weaknesses of countries.  I have mentioned this twice before and you have
<br>
not even deigned to spend write one line in response.  Why is it ok for you
<br>
to put forward a *controversial* theory and expect everyone to believe it
<br>
without any convincing evidence?  Why so much hostility to the ideas of
<br>
others?
<br>
