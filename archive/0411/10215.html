<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I'm sure this has been covered elsewhere, but since you are
<br>
quite...flexible, I thought you might have a different view now.
<br>
The question is: Are you trying to construct something with CV that is
<br>
provably Friendly, and if so, is that in a mathematical sense,
<br>
or a physical sense?
<br>
<p>The physical sense is much easier to think about (and more likely
<br>
correct). So, supposing we had a very simple universe (only a few
<br>
particles, or perhaps a pseudouniverse with a small system of coupled
<br>
oscillators), what would a FAI want to do in this universe? How would
<br>
this differ from a non-Friendly AI? Though this type of question may
<br>
be silly for a much larger universe, it seems to me that since the
<br>
options for an AI would be so limited, humans with a sense of humor
<br>
could likely approximate what an AI would do without too much trouble.
<br>
<p>I'm going to resist the temptation to bombard you with more questions
<br>
along these lines, so I'll just shut up now.
