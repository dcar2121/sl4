<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having said that, I regard extreme inequality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fear of scarcity as a destabilizing force,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a great current threat. While my attitudes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are generally libertarian, I find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian/Ayn Rand attitude toward economics to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be rather sociopathic. Nobody has a 'right' to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a billionaire, since they do not work a thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times harder than anyone else, nor are they a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand times smarter. Intellectual capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always builds on the efforts of others who went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before, thus taking something from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'intellectual commons.'
</em><br>
<p>Why is *hard work* the criteria for making money?  If I move heavy rocks
<br>
from one side of my yard to the other and then back again (continuously), I
<br>
definitely have worked hard, but did I produce anything of value for myself
<br>
or anyone else?  Value produced is what matters, not effort.  Being smart
<br>
without turning that into value in the eyes of others is also moot.  If
<br>
someone is capable of being productive and decides not to be, my sympathy
<br>
ends at making sure they have food to eat, a dry bed to sleep in, and second
<br>
hand clothes to wear. Agreed that someone faced with the end of their
<br>
existence is *very* dangerous indeed.  People should have the *right* to be
<br>
a billionaire, if they can make such an amount within the law. Business
<br>
efficiencies and tools *can* magnify a person's productivity by a thousand
<br>
times or more! Not all rich people are thieves and cheats!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I will simply point out that Sweden has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a higher average life expectancy than the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States. Economic inequality is bad for the health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if you're on the bottom).
</em><br>
<p>Being poor has always been bad for your health, now and throughout history,
<br>
but staying healthy is costly and therefore should be a reward for those who
<br>
choose to be productive, not a right. (I am not against some free health
<br>
care!)  Sweden is much more ethnically homogeneous than the USA and direct
<br>
economic comparisons are misleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, stratified countries seem to spend a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of money putting guards between the haves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the have-nots (and much of the guards' salaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are paid by the have-nots!) When the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is busy guarding ill-got gains, it gets very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nosey toward social reformers and malcontents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The military writer James Dunnigan (whose books I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly recomment) considers high levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banditry to be a form of low-level warfare, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising but (to me) convincing notion.
</em><br>
<p>The above points are well made, however, I think they apply to &quot;ill-got
<br>
gains&quot; and don't necessarily apply to all countries that have large
<br>
differences in income. (eg Canada, USA etc)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scarcity and inequality, in other words, lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare, but not the (rare) flashy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tanks-at-the-border kind of war so much as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (very common) simmering insurgency and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; syndicalist's bomb.
</em><br>
<p>I have grown up all my life with aboriginals in Canada.  They definitely
<br>
live a much lower standard of living (their choice) than most Canadians,
<br>
however, 90% plus of the violence they commit is done to each other, not
<br>
against better off Canadians.  Black Americans in the ghetto's LA or New
<br>
York seem to commit more violence against their own than on the wealthy. Is
<br>
this statement not correct?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone who dismisses my comments as the addled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravings of a granola-headed egalitarian naif
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should at least consider that a laissez-faire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian AI might feel no responsibility to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feed *you*. The social contract exists for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't lower myself to calling you any of those names.
<br>
