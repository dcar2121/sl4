<em>&gt; &gt;I'm not sure that this is an SL4 topic, but from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this layman's viewpoint, he seems to point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what kind of evidence your hypothesis would require,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and that it seems lacking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I really think he's made a good case that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;may have been no particular selection pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in this direction, since resource depletion is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;distinctly modern (last few thousand years) issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect you and perhaps David just have not thought about this much. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The *general* problem of living things depleting resources goes back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to shortly after life arose.  It's a mathematical property of anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of replication.
</em><br>
<p>It's true that I have not thought about this much,
<br>
however, I'd like to clarify my understanding of
<br>
this.  Most of my limited knowledge of this area
<br>
comes from works such as _Guns, Germs, and Steel_.
<br>
<p>Even as recently as a few hundred years ago in
<br>
Europe, disease was by far the major killer of
<br>
humans who didn't live to, say, 40.  Food and
<br>
water have only rarely been so scarce as to
<br>
trigger widespread die-offs, and if you look at
<br>
places on Earth in the twentieth century where
<br>
they were scarcest, you still don't see humans
<br>
as other humans' primary cause of death, but
<br>
rather, disease and malnutrition.
<br>
<p>I think that in looking at cases where humans
<br>
as a group began killing or attacking other
<br>
humans, you've failed to notice the much more
<br>
common cases where humans quietly resigned
<br>
themselves to less, or had their population
<br>
reduced by disease, lack of resources (directly),
<br>
etc.  That is, I believe you're a victim of a
<br>
selection effect, here, because of a focus on
<br>
figuring out why humans attack others.  The
<br>
conditions which you have determined give rise
<br>
to these behaviors fail to do so in the majority
<br>
of cases, so I would hesitate to assign to them
<br>
any kind of causal mechanism.
<br>
<p>I think that economics (in the broad sense of
<br>
the study of why humans behave as they do) is
<br>
probably a more likely field to produce the
<br>
answers you're looking for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Trying to find the &quot;mama bear&quot; quote, I found that I had already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed this point back in May, here specifically:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8659.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8659.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;begin quote&gt;
</em><br>
[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; But the idea that human line groups killed off neighbors as a regular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feature of life long enough to select for a survival response genes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when things start to get tight . . . . . I wonder if humans generally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have emotional censors to reject such an idea. Perhaps such thoughts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict in with our view of ourselves--at least as that view has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shaped by times of relative plenty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Editorial note, I now am wondering if rejecting thinking about this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject might be due to _wired in_ censors, the kind that keep people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from thinking any more than they absolutely have to about their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mortality.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Global maturing&quot; may be a lot harder if censor biases keep us from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about this class of knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Even if your hypotheses are correct, I wouldn't
<br>
expect anything like &quot;global maturing&quot; due to
<br>
rational ignorance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then again, perhaps humans differ in some way from bears and they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't overfill the environment during the stone age or they had some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way to control populations that didn't involve groups killing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;end quote&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I thought it was clear that the vast majority of
<br>
humans in the stone age died of disease or
<br>
complications from minor injuries which would be
<br>
only a nuisance today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human's generally don't have twins like bears, but in a primitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment the typical woman is pregnant or nursing from late teens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to early 40s.  Five to six kids is typical.  Just like bears, on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average only two of them will survive to reproduce (given a constant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment, which includes technology).  And typically 40% of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adults in present day hunter gatherer groups die from violence.
</em><br>
<p>But comparatively few births reach adulthood, and
<br>
even so, I question whether &quot;violence&quot; here includes
<br>
getting mauled by a hunted animal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know bringing in bad news about our evolved psychological traits is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a popular role, heck, I find the subject really depressing, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone has to do it because we really need to understand ourselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better if we are going to survive into the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there's any particular hope of a
<br>
widespread understanding of human psychology in
<br>
this detail before the singularity.
