<p><em>&gt;  In fact your *war meme* hypothesis might be
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt;  I put forward a theory of war that had to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the perceived relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaknesses of countries.
</em><br>
<p>According to Howard Bloom in &quot;The Lucifer
<br>
Principle&quot;, up-and-comers are more aggressive as
<br>
well as more willing to try new things. Your
<br>
'perceived weakness' scenario is more in line,
<br>
IMHO, with Bloom (whom I revere; I think he's an
<br>
important thinker right now; see
<br>
www.howardbloom.net for more)
<br>
<p>Having said that, I regard extreme inequality and
<br>
the fear of scarcity as a destabilizing force,
<br>
and a great current threat. While my attitudes
<br>
are generally libertarian, I find the
<br>
Libertarian/Ayn Rand attitude toward economics to
<br>
be rather sociopathic. Nobody has a 'right' to be
<br>
a billionaire, since they do not work a thousand
<br>
times harder than anyone else, nor are they a
<br>
thousand times smarter. Intellectual capital
<br>
always builds on the efforts of others who went
<br>
before, thus taking something from the
<br>
'intellectual commons.'
<br>
When I mentioned 'socialism' earlier, I was
<br>
lambasted with bad economic growth stats for
<br>
Sweden. But I never said Sweden's economy was
<br>
booming; I believe I used the word 'livable,'
<br>
which refers to other factors, some intangible.
<br>
However, I will simply point out that Sweden has
<br>
a higher average life expectancy than the United
<br>
States. Economic inequality is bad for the health
<br>
(if you're on the bottom).
<br>
Furthermore, stratified countries seem to spend a
<br>
lot of money putting guards between the haves and
<br>
the have-nots (and much of the guards' salaries
<br>
are paid by the have-nots!) When the government
<br>
is busy guarding ill-got gains, it gets very
<br>
nosey toward social reformers and malcontents.
<br>
The military writer James Dunnigan (whose books I
<br>
highly recomment) considers high levels of
<br>
banditry to be a form of low-level warfare, a
<br>
surprising but (to me) convincing notion.
<br>
Scarcity and inequality, in other words, lead to
<br>
warfare, but not the (rare) flashy
<br>
tanks-at-the-border kind of war so much as the
<br>
(very common) simmering insurgency and the
<br>
syndicalist's bomb.
<br>
<p>Anyone who dismisses my comments as the addled
<br>
ravings of a granola-headed egalitarian naif
<br>
should at least consider that a laissez-faire
<br>
Libertarian AI might feel no responsibility to
<br>
feed *you*. The social contract exists for a
<br>
reason.
