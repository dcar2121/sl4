<p>I really hope you are right about this Eliezer.  Unfortunately, it might be 
<br>
that machines that were able to extrapolate into &quot;more the people we wished 
<br>
we were&quot; who &quot;knew more, thought faster, more the people we wished we were, 
<br>
had grown up farther together&quot; might make CV decisions that would freak out 
<br>
you and me.  How important to our personalities is this ability for a 
<br>
tribe's warriors to go berserk?  How much does it underlie even our 
<br>
unstressed, relatively rational behavior in good times?
<br>
<p>It's not a question that's easy to answer.  You can get a hint of it in 
<br>
functional MRI scans.  My guess is that because war has been such a gene 
<br>
filter at least since the big cats quit being serious predators 2.6 million 
<br>
years ago, it is going to be extremely difficult to change and have 
<br>
anything left we would consider human.
<br>
<p>If you are going to try to keep humans out of war mode by keeping them in 
<br>
&quot;good times&quot; than you just have to mess with their interest or ability to 
<br>
reproduce because while normal reproduction won't keep up with nanotech, it 
<br>
will eventually produce a resource crisis.   To me it is a dicey 
<br>
matter.  Collective volition might conclude that periodically killing each 
<br>
other off with rocks to hold down the population is what people *want.*
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not going to hook up a superintelligence to the decisions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Earthlings the way we are now.  Geeze, do I look that suicidal?
</em><br>
<p>No, but I am not certain that the decisions of improved Earthlings are 
<br>
going to be an improvement.  I find it scary that they might be &quot;improved&quot; 
<br>
in ways that from a godlike stand off would *be* an improvement, but you 
<br>
sure wouldn't want to live there.
<br>
<p>As I say, I hope my misgivings about this are wrong and you are right.
<br>
