</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;Collective Volition&quot; is a nice idea on the path to better ones.  It 
<br>
breaks with reality in at least two major ways.  (1) The extrapolation 
<br>
error  (2) The value of diversity.
<br>
<p>Comprehension of the current collective volition of humanity is a useful 
<br>
ideal, and attainable to a practical approximation, to guide social and 
<br>
political growth in an incremental manner.  However, we cannot predict 
<br>
with any degree of confidence beyond the current horizon, in what 
<br>
direction the growth of human culture and society will take us.  Just as 
<br>
a child's clear and simple wish of growing up to be a 
<br>
&quot;nurse/policeman/fireman/scientist&quot; evolves into something richer and 
<br>
more complex in actuality, we are fundamentally unable to extrapolate 
<br>
the future of such a complex systems due to bounded knowledge and 
<br>
constrained computational resources inherently inadequate to deal with 
<br>
the combinatorial explosion and cumulative error that characterizes such 
<br>
predictive problems.
<br>
<p>However, there are principles of the growth of dynamical systems, 
<br>
illuminated by an understanding of the current, not extrapolated, 
<br>
collective volition of humankind, that can effectively guide us on the 
<br>
next step of our journey.
<br>
<p>One such principle is the value of diversity to the growth and 
<br>
robustness of complex systems.  While a collective vision is essential 
<br>
for setting the direction of policy, it is vital to a robust 
<br>
implementation that diversity be promoted within the overall policy 
<br>
framework.  Just as a robust immune system cannot be predesigned in it's 
<br>
entirety to meet the challenges of an uncertain and evolving 
<br>
environment, a single, complete solution to the &quot;problem&quot; (I consider it 
<br>
a challenge) of human growth and survival must evolve rather than be 
<br>
designed.
<br>
<p>I have argued before, and will argue again here, that the more effective 
<br>
way forward, at this current point in time, is to create and build tools 
<br>
for effective augmentation of human awareness and intelligence within a 
<br>
global network.  Of course, this is already happening, but will benefit 
<br>
from increased participation by intelligent and passionate minds such as 
<br>
we find in this group.
<br>
<p>I am encouraged by Eliezer's more recent comments that he is no longer 
<br>
searching for a &quot;complete&quot; solution, but rather a &quot;correct&quot; partial 
<br>
solution that won't blow up, that perhaps the thinking on SL4 is 
<br>
gradually converging to something  that may bear fruit of a practical sort.
