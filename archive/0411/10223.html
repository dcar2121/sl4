Hi David,
<br>
<p>I'm certainly not harshly opposed to critics of my work, in general; I have
<br>
a lot of respect for many individuals (such as Peter Voss, Eliezer Yudkowsky
<br>
and Pei Wang, to name a few) who have criticized my work.  Pei and I are
<br>
good friends, and Peter and I (though we haven't spent as much time
<br>
together, although I had the pleasure of staying at his AI Commune for a
<br>
couple nights this week) are friends as well, in spite of our mutual
<br>
criticism of each others' AI work.
<br>
<p>Marc Geddes often raises interesting conceptual issues, though like others I
<br>
often get frustrated at the vaguely-phrased formulations that he proposes as
<br>
solutions to these issues.  If you scan the SL4 archives you'll find that
<br>
I've argued with Marc plenty of times!
<br>
<p>I'm sorry I offended you by responding to your criticisms of my work (which
<br>
I still think are ill-founded) too harshly; probably I was in a bad mood
<br>
that day!  As of now I'm still saddled with a human emotional system.
<br>
<p>I'll say this though.  With the critics I respect most, I can argue through
<br>
the difficult issues relating to AGI with mutual understanding, until a
<br>
point is reached where we come to a question of intuition, that can't be
<br>
decided via available data, and that none of us know how to resolve via
<br>
deductive inference. Then we both agree to disagree based on our differing
<br>
intuitions.
<br>
<p>As for Cyc, my criticisms of Cyc are actually much LESS harsh than those
<br>
made by many others on this list (e.g. Eliezer), and many others in the AI
<br>
community.  An awful lot of AI folks think Cyc is totally  off-target and
<br>
useless.  I think it's ill-founded in some ways ,but may be transformable
<br>
into something useful, and I'm (slowly, as a background task) carrying out
<br>
some concrete research in this direction.  I've actually loaded some of Cyc
<br>
into my AI system and worked with it, which is more than most critics of Cyc
<br>
can say.
<br>

<em>&gt; It's funny how you (Ben) can so easily say that &quot;the Cyc AI design is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incapable of achieving a high level of general intelligence&quot; and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded so negatively to my criticism of your own design.  You seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have all kinds of patience for Marc Geddes who refers himself to Einstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not much for critics of your work.

<em>&gt; &gt; Hi Stephen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed, Cycorp has done an excellent job of bringing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately though, as I've expressed  before, I'm pretty sure the Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; design is incapable of achieving a high level of general intelligence...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How are things with Cognitive Cyc?
</em><br>
