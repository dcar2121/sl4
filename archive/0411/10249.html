<em>&gt;&gt;I really have a problem with people talking about the &quot;distribution of

</em><br>
<p>Well at one time it *was* the fruit on trees.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;There was a time, before the 20th century, when wealth mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;accrued from farming.
</em><br>
<p>There was an even early time before farming in which we evolved where it 
<br>
took a lot more land to support a tribe.  When the tribe's populations 
<br>
would exceed the carrying capacity of the land, the tribes fought which 
<br>
reduced the population.  They did this for enough millions of years it 
<br>
became one of our conditionally expressed psychological traits.
<br>
<p>The point to my stuff was about stressed human populations being a fertile 
<br>
media for war memes.
<br>
<p>Now being of a libertarian bent and thinking that I would like to keep it 
<br>
*all* if I became a billionaire, I can see that side of it.
<br>
<p>But I can also see the side that a substantial fraction of a population is 
<br>
going to feel stressed and seeing a bleak future if the income per capita 
<br>
is redistributed away from some parts of the population to other parts.
<br>
<p>To put a specific example on the table, the US has gone from a nation with 
<br>
a big bulge in the middle income distribution to one where there more like 
<br>
an hour glass, there being rich folks and poor folks and not much in between.
<br>
<p>Regardless of my or your political leanings, this is conducive to the 
<br>
stressed fraction of the population (large!) being susceptible to war memes 
<br>
and going into war mode.
<br>
<p>I am not even saying this is *bad*, just if you don't want it, keeping the 
<br>
income per capita steady or rising in all segments of the population is the 
<br>
way to stay out of that psychological mode.
<br>
<p>Now this applies to CV, a subject certainly on topic, because we sure has 
<br>
heck don't want the CV to advocate wars.
<br>
<p>I think it might be worth adding to having lots of smarts, information and 
<br>
time to think about what's desirable, you might want the people 
<br>
contributing to the CV to have improving income per capita to keep war mode 
<br>
switched off.
<br>
<p>As to how wealth should be distributed, that's a hard question.  Much as I 
<br>
don't like it, having the rich pay a lot of taxes might be the least 
<br>
disruptive method.  The point is to get substantially all of the population 
<br>
to expect an improving future.
