Hi Stephe n,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Agreed that Cyc is not designed using the human mind as a model.
</em><br>
<p>My statement was stronger than that, though.  I think that there are
<br>
probably some universal properties of strongly-resource-limited minds, and
<br>
that Cyc
<br>
<p>a) doesn't have many of these properties
<br>
b) is very awkward to incorporate into any system that does have these
<br>
properties
<br>
<p>I have tried to enumerate these properties in my prior writings on cognitive
<br>
science, under the name &quot;the psynet model of mind&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyc uses a philosophical approach (e.g. James Allen's time relations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Davidson's approach to representing events).
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but the philosophy underlying Cyc is sorely limited, missing  out
<br>
for instance on the ideas raised by the complex-systems philosophy of mind,
<br>
by the philosophy of uncertainty-management (localized Bayes net models are
<br>
not philosophically satisfactory, really, are they?), by the  philosophy of
<br>
embodiment and mind-body relations, etc.  Cyc is based on some sound
<br>
philosophy, but only on philosophy that deals with a small and narrow subset
<br>
of mental phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope that the impedance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; match between Cyc's vocabulary and English will be improved after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; import of WordNet 2.0, opening a wide door for practial applications in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the field of text knowledge management.
</em><br>
<p>The mismatch between Cyc and English doesn't  have to do with vocabulary.
<br>
It has to do with things like the meanings of prepositions (not covered in
<br>
WordNet) and subject-argument relationships (not covered in WordNet).  And
<br>
these aspects of linguistics, in which Cyc most badly mismatches English,
<br>
are the precise aspects of linguistics that most closely tie in with the
<br>
mind's relationship with the body and with other minds (see e.g. Calvin and
<br>
Bickerton, &quot;Lingua ex Machina&quot;, for a treatment of the grounding of these
<br>
linguistic phenomena in social psychology.)
<br>
<p>I'm aware that this conversation is being had at too high a level of
<br>
abstraction -- it's really a technical discussion, but getting into the
<br>
nitty-gritty details of linguistic, inferential and perceptual/active
<br>
knowledge representation in emails to SL4 probably isn't going to work...
<br>
<p>-- Ben Goertzel
