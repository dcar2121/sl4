<em>&gt;     I've heard you say this before, Keith, and I must ask: how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would a stressed population dare to war, or be able to?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I will go over it again.
<br>
<p>The key to understanding this is that the psychological traits behind the 
<br>
coupling from a bleak outlook to war through xenophobic memes evolved in 
<br>
the *stone age* when there wasn't a big technological gap or even a big 
<br>
size gap between one tribe and the next.
<br>
<p>So when things started to look like the tribe members were not going to get 
<br>
enough game and berries to get through the next season, going to war was on 
<br>
average a 50-50 proposition for the people, and war was a *much* better 
<br>
chance for the genes of these primitive people than starving.  The worst 
<br>
case was that all the males in one of the tribes fighting would be 
<br>
killed.  That's still better for the *genes* of the losers than starving 
<br>
because copies of their genes are in the young women of the tribe who are 
<br>
normally booty to the winners.  (A perverse application of Hamilton's 
<br>
inclusive fitness criteria.)
<br>
<p>So over a multi million year time frame, genes that made it more likely a 
<br>
tribe facing starvation would go to war with neighbors instead of quitely 
<br>
starving became standard.  I propose that such genes build psychological 
<br>
traits that increase the &quot;gain&quot; of circulating xenophobic memes in times of 
<br>
the particular stress of &quot;looming privation.&quot;  You can see where the stupid 
<br>
factor comes in because all the normal inhibitions of not attacking nasty 
<br>
strangers who might just as well kill *you* have to be overcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about populaces that are up and coming and want theirs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(imperialist nations, say)?  Surely no one will argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Germany was willing to instigate WWI because they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'stressed', or America going whole hog in WWII, or less so in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WWI, was because they were under some stress.
</em><br>
<p>For a starter, you can hardly expect psychological traits evolved in the 
<br>
stone age to be well adapted to modern times.  I make the case that hunter 
<br>
gatherer psychological traits can spell disaster in more technologically 
<br>
advanced cultures and cite the corn farmers of the American Southwest who 
<br>
were wiped out over large areas because their hunter gatherer response to 
<br>
&quot;looming privation&quot; was incompatible with a farming mode of life.
<br>
<p>Second, WWI was before the big drop in birth rates, so there was falling 
<br>
income per capita over much of Europe.  (Due to rising population.)
<br>
<p>Third, you only need one party to start a war.  WWI is confused enough that 
<br>
it is hard to say exactly who started it, but you could argue that the 
<br>
German's didn't.
<br>
<p>I might add that the US enthusiasm for WWII was much higher than 
<br>
WWI.  Being attacked does that.
