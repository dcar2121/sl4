</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree to some extent, but I am unsure whether mimicking human thinking is
<br>
the best approach. Of course, as long as there is not anything better,
<br>
it is a good idea. The nature developed methods which can be inferior under
<br>
slightly different cicrcumstances: if we build roads, cars are superior to
<br>
quadrupeds. Evolutionary methods are slow. Neural networks are inefficient
<br>
on current hardware. We can choose different, more efficient ways than
<br>
nature uses. The human thinking is the result of a long cumbersome emergent
<br>
process. Some parts work efficiently, some are simply workarounds for
<br>
problems that could be eliminated by better overall design.
<br>
<p>I think that the correct approach is to cut the whole deducton problem into
<br>
smaller subproblems,  specify clear goals, meeasurable objective
<br>
functions for the parts and try to find mathematical optimization methods
<br>
to solve the subproblems efficiently. Whether these methods resemble
<br>
human thinking seems to be irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Thus I argue that, although theorem-proving may indeed be part of an AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system, getting advanced theorem-proving to work based on human-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics as an initial knowledge base requires a system that has a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of internal schemata representing basic physical and linguistic phenomena
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(measuring, grouping, building, continuous paths, etc. etc.).  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experientially grounded schemata are what will allow future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advanced-theorem-proving AGI's to create inductive and abductive hypotheses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that guide their deductive inference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Experimental guiding is a natural and good idea, However, I am not sure that
<br>
it is necessary to have &quot;real-life&quot; or simulated phyiscal  experience 
<br>
for pure
<br>
mathematical problem solving.
<br>
<p>My intuition is that an AI that could perform experiments on 
<br>
mathematical objects
<br>
developed by itself, could perform very well. Of course,  pure symbolic
<br>
reasoning like in todays theorem provers is not enough: a theorem prover 
<br>
system
<br>
must be able to test the semantics of the mathematical statement by 
<br>
performing
<br>
mathematical experiments, hence the necessity of the integration of 
<br>
theorem-provers
<br>
and computer-algebra (and optimization) systems. I think that this type 
<br>
of experience
<br>
(plus experience about the performance of internal algorithms) could be 
<br>
enough
<br>
for a good AI.
<br>
<p>This is like a primal-dual optimization approach: the primal world is 
<br>
the world of
<br>
formal statement, the dual is the semantics of those statements. When 
<br>
looking for
<br>
a proof (a path in the primal world), you can eliminate false paths by 
<br>
looking at
<br>
the dual function, just like in mathematical optimization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So advanced theorem-proving will emerge from embodied, experientially-savvey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI.
</em><br>
<p>I think that a good AGI would emerge from a synthesis of different 
<br>
concepts including formal deduction.
