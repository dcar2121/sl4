<p><em>&gt;If you are interested in this subject, you should take a look at &quot;Constant

</em><br>
<em>&gt;long, long time.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent author, read his previous one, have not been able to find a copy 
<br>
of this more recent one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For example, in many (most?) stone age tribes living
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;of peace (within stone age people, and before) have only occurred in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history when there has been much fewer people than resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, as far as I've read, it does not seem to suggest total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of warfare in those troubled times. Rather the battles that occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within bands tend to be small and often nobody gets killed. It's just that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when you sum up the losses through a persons life you get a large amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of casualties.
</em><br>
<p>It depends.  LeBlanc describes the total extermination of something like 23 
<br>
out of 27 groups in the Southwest following a weather upset about 1260 
<br>
which took place over a fairly short time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So if these findings are true, then it definitely invalidates the old myth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the 'golden age' of human kind when all was good, etc. It also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invalidates Keiths claims, since the bands and tribes tend to fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constantly and suffer small losses all the time and not in a suicidal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mood.
</em><br>
<p>I think people who fought with intent to suicide in the stone age were 
<br>
rare.  The worse case, your tribal males are killed and the women made into 
<br>
extra wives for the winners is looking at it from a *gene's* 
<br>
viewpoint.  That still better than all copies being lost from 
<br>
starvation.  But the possibility of getting killed was (as you note) very 
<br>
real.  So genes would be favored that build psychological mechanisms to be 
<br>
optimistic, even stupidly optimistic, about the chances of winning.  I 
<br>
think that is with us to this day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would also suggest that some ways of testing Keiths hypothesis is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take a look at the record of stone age tribes we know about and how they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;act. And to take a look at historical and archeological record. Does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem true that people go for this sort of suicidal rampage? I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that when I look at history, so it would be nice, if you (Keith) can come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up with specific examples of that happening.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  I do seem to have a problem explaining &quot;selfish gene&quot; type 
<br>
thinking.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I lived the first 18 years of my life in a cult and saw people doing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty nasty things to people. Now I don't think the actions were a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of evolutionary (genetic) behavior patterns. I find it much more plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they would be of memetic kind.
</em><br>
<p>The specifics of any particular cult I agree are memetic variations.  The 
<br>
*susceptibility* to cults is a side effect of evolved psychological traits 
<br>
such as attention rewards (same as the susceptibility to addictive drugs).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Religions are good at that; they tend to create a system, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncriticisable and gives certain people (the cult leaders) power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control a lot of things within the system. It is the existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncriticisable premisses that allows all those montrosities to happen. Now
</em><br>
<p>No?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;evolutionary origins are needed in explaining them. (Which doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they don't exist, but we should go for the simplest explanation á la
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Occam's Razor, right?).
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  Especially when you see things like 'nad clipping cults or 
<br>
drug addiction that are *clearly* not going to be favored by evolution, 
<br>
there is a dire need to understand what's going on.  Knowing how these 
<br>
traits came to be might not *solve* the problem, but it should save you a 
<br>
lot of wasted efforts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In addition you guys should all remember that one of the things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general intelligence is about: it's about being able to respond to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation, not in a hardwired way, but by analyzing the situation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creating the best answer based on our perception of reality. This means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that emergence of general intelligence in humans has necessarily seen lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and lots of genetically defined responses to things disappear.
</em><br>
<p>That's hardly the consensus of the people in the field.  You start probing 
<br>
brains with fMRI and social interactions and *all sorts* of specialized 
<br>
modules show up.  Cognitive responses are just way too slow if they can 
<br>
work at all.  Consider the social graces of autistics if you want an 
<br>
example of just how poorly general cognitive are compared to specialized 
<br>
modules.  We can use them if we absolutely have to, but as the AI work to 
<br>
date has shown, the more general something is the poorer it works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And that from the time that memetic evolution became possible, it became
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very, very unlikely for any behavioral changes such as those you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talking about, to become from genetic origins. After all, if there was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutant with beneficial behavioral patterns, others not having that gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be able to mimic him and the mutated gene would get no benefit to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its fitness.
</em><br>
<p>Memetic evolution became possible at least 2.6 million years ago from the 
<br>
evidence of broken rocks.  But for most of that time progress was extremely 
<br>
slow, which gave evolution a chance to enlarge brains by a factor of 4 and 
<br>
work in who knows how many psychological traits.
<br>
<p>If you have not read him, William Calvin is good on the same scale as LeBlanc.
