<br>
<p>Google Groups: Results 1 - 10 of about 47 for &quot;Keith Henson&quot; &quot;evolution of

<br>
<p>And if you look, one of the articles where favorably I cite Axelrod's book

is my 1987 &quot;Memetics and the Modular Mind article in _Analog_.   So, yeah, 
<br>
I've heard about it.  :-)

<p><em>&gt;Prisoner's dilemmas are

<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=cache:UVMm-5oIYtgJ:www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/rational.ps+Prisoner%27s+dilemmas+analyzable+by+game+theory+and+rational+tools.&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.ca/search?q=cache:UVMm-5oIYtgJ:www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/rational.ps+Prisoner%27s+dilemmas+analyzable+by+game+theory+and+rational+tools.&amp;hl=en</a><br>
<p>&quot;Distributed Rational Decision Making
<br>
<p>&quot;Sometimes efficiency goals and stability goals conflict. A simple example 
<br>
of this is the Prisoner's Dilemma game where the unique welfare maximizing 
<br>
and Pareto efficient strategy profile is the one where both agents 
<br>
cooperate, Table 5.1. On the other hand, the only dominant strategy 
<br>
equilibrium and Nash equilibrium is the one where both agents defect.&quot;
<br>
<p>(Dawkin's from Selfish Gene, Second Edition, &quot;Nice Guys Finish First&quot; chapter.)
<br>
<p>&quot;So I have worked out by impeccable logic that, regardless of what you do, 
<br>
I must defect.  And you, with no less impeccable logic, will work out just 
<br>
the same thing.  So when two rational players meet, they will both defect, 
<br>
and both will end up with a fine or a low payoff.  Yet each knows perfectly 
<br>
well that, if only they had both played COOPERATE, both would have obtained 
<br>
the relatively high reward for mutual cooperation ($300 in our 
<br>
example).  That is why the game is called a dilemma, why it has even been 
<br>
proposed that there ought to be a law against it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Above, I didn't say &quot;iterated prisoner's dilemma's game&quot; and I didn't say 
<br>
you could not analyze it with rational tools.  It would take more time to 
<br>
find than I want to put into it this morning, but  one of the studies I 
<br>
read reported the way naive people play the one-round game is deeply 
<br>
influenced by having the &quot;rational&quot; way to play the game explained to 
<br>
them.  (I.e., they defect.)  That's my meaning of &quot;'rational' does not cut it.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As an aside note, a better algorithm than the typical tit-for-tat has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found a while ago, but you probably know about it already, although IMO the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new algorithm is against the spirit of the thing.
</em><br>
<p>That's really interesting.  Does anyone have a pointer?
<br>

<br>
<p>PS.  If you have not read this classic, it ranks high among the canonical 
<br>
AI books.
