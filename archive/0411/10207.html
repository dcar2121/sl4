<em>&gt; Coming at this business from the EP side, I think Collective Volition
</em><br>
might
<br>
<em>&gt; not even be a good idea, though it might be that I don't understand some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special meaning beyond the obvious meaning of the words.
</em><br>
<p>Collective Volition is a technical term, not just an aggregate of people's
<br>
will.
<br>
At the risk of getting it wrong, I'll write why I think you are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is stressed humans.  That includes those who think they see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;looming privation&quot; in the future and the ones who have been switched into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a degraded mode of thinking (non-rational) by a physical attack.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;collective volition&quot; of such people is scary.
</em><br>
<p>Collective Volition is not about what humans want, right now. Doubtless if
<br>
implemented thus, we'd get a machine to print currency. The CV is about what
<br>
humans congruently want if they were more like the person they wish they
<br>
were, id est, knew more, had unbound time to think about it, and unbound
<br>
information about the issue. You may argue that there will be no congruence,
<br>
and I have no counter-argument for that.
<br>
<p>So, even in the worst of times, people have an idealist desire not to wage
<br>
war, etc. This would be picked up by CV, and the extrapolated volition would
<br>
come from agents that would be less prone to war and to irrational thinking.
<br>
Likewise the virtues of tolerance, happiness and Western *Liberal Democracy
<br>
have been thoroughly established as desired by the powers that be, to the
<br>
point that claiming one agrees with them is condition sine qua non to hold
<br>
power, and so it is likely that CV would extrapolate from tolerant,
<br>
happiness-driven Liberal-Democratic individuals. I'm not sure myself this is
<br>
an entirely great thing, but the EP issues are pretty much non-existent for
<br>
CV, as CV considers what we wish we were, and not what we are, and one thing
<br>
we all wish we were is free from the evolutionary detritus of our past,
<br>
correct?
<br>
<p>*1I mean here the traditional, early XX century meaning of Western Liberal
<br>
Democracy, nothing about political orientation itself.
<br>
<p>--David.
