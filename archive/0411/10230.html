<em>&gt;It is prudent to be aware that human mentality is not all sweetness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;light, and you are performing an excellent service by reminding us of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact.  As a broad statement, your &quot;Unhappy people with a bleak future were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fertile substrate for xenophobic memes...&quot; fits some of human history very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well.  However, the explanation you provide: &quot;psychological mechanisms into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our brains that under some circumstances shuts off rational thinking&quot; may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incomplete or perhaps even incorrect.
</em><br>
<p>I am certainly open to other explanations for the stupidity one can see in 
<br>
virtually every war.  Something is inhibiting rational thinking of people 
<br>
in &quot;war mode.&quot;  I could cite countless examples, the most recent being the 
<br>
US attacking Iraq.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The psychological mechanisms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implement xenophobic memes may well be the same ones that implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cooperative memes.
</em><br>
<p>The probably are.  Memes is memes.  The difference is a selective advantage 
<br>
for &quot;hate the neighbor&quot; memes in stressed populations who anticipate bleak 
<br>
times ahead.  We have contemporary examples where the rise and fall in the 
<br>
US membership/activity of neo nazi organizations is inversely correlated 
<br>
with US economics.  I don't understand exactly how this works, however, the 
<br>
evolutionary advantage it gave to hunter gatherers for such a mechanism to 
<br>
exist insures that it *will* exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Evolution is notorious for re-using existing architecture in multiple ways.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly agree with this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps the human meme-machine works the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same way no matter what meme happens to be in a person's mind.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that's the case.  As examples, the meme of how to tie shoes 
<br>
has a rather different effect than the ones inducing suicide bombers to 
<br>
close the switch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the case, then your warning is even more timely because there will almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly be multiple memes that are &quot;scary&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Tell me about it!  If you didn't already know, I have a cult after me that 
<br>
has spent more than a million dollars trying to shut me up.  I think the 
<br>
mechanisms activated in such fanatics are the same as caused a hunter 
<br>
gatherer tribe to attempt to wipe out neighbors.  Cults induce the &quot;we are 
<br>
under attack&quot; feeling in their members to activate war mode/impaired 
<br>
thinking and take advantage of other evolved psychological traits (capture 
<br>
bonding and drug-like attention rewards).  See my sex, drugs and cults 
<br>
article. for more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You wrote: &quot;CV could come to the conclusion that high average happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required periodic population culls too.&quot;  -- This statement is so strange,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and seems so disconnected from how people think, that I cannot see how you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arrived at it.
</em><br>
<p>It depends on assumptions about physical reality that have been with us 
<br>
since before we split from the apes.  Chimp populations grow until they 
<br>
press the ecological limits.  They are reduced through periodic &quot;wars&quot; on 
<br>
neighboring groups, sometimes killing every single one of the attacked 
<br>
group (Jane Goodall and others).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While an analysis of history might allow one to infer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people believe that &quot;high average happiness requires periodic wars&quot;, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unreasonable to suggest that people want the wars.  A more reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inference would be that the people wanted *happiness*, and some leader
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convinced them that the way to get it was thru war.  There have been leaders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who promoted methods other than war, and have done so successfully.
</em><br>
<p>Good times, times of human happiness, were when the population was 
<br>
expanding, you could have lots of kids and feed them well.  But that sowed 
<br>
the seeds of an ecological crunch where the population shrank through 
<br>
starvation or wars.  &quot;Happiness&quot; could be defined at the derivative of 
<br>
population growth, positive as the population is expanding and negative 
<br>
when it is shrinking.  So to keep average &quot;happiness&quot; high over a long 
<br>
period, you want to keep the times of shrinkage short.  I am not advocating 
<br>
wars, far from it, just considering how a god-like CV overview of the 
<br>
situation might come to this conclusion.
<br>
<p>High tech western civilization has not exactly escaped this model, but we 
<br>
have by lower birth rates and high economic growth lengthened the 
<br>
cycle.  It does not protect us from other parts of the world where high 
<br>
population growth has run ahead of economic growth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let us be vigilant, but not paranoid.
</em><br>
<p>As anyone who knows much about my history will tell you that my problem has 
<br>
always been not being paranoid *enough.*
