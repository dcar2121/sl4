<p>The post I was responding to was a critique on how many babies are born in
<br>
what countries and a little socialist plug on the bottom.
<br>
<p>That was *on* topic and my post wasn't?  I thought SL4 thinkers were too
<br>
smart to fall for the socialist crap.
<br>
<p>The heading of this thread is &quot;Memes and War&quot; and the post I responded to
<br>
was not the first I have heard on this list that decribes a future of war
<br>
and the like because of the imbalance in the &quot;distribution of wealth&quot;.  I
<br>
would appreciate at least a reason why my post was off topic and the post I
<br>
responded to was not!
<br>
<p>If political ideas are *off topic*, don't you think that should apply to
<br>
everyone?  How can you talk about the cause of Wars without bringing up
<br>
ideas that could be thought of from a political viewpoint?  Don't just
<br>
snipe, answer the questions.
