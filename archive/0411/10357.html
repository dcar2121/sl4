We always operate within a context beyond our own comprehension.
<br>
<p>Having raised three children and managed teams of very bright technical 
<br>
staff for two decades, I've faced this issue repeatedly at home, work 
<br>
and online, however, I have not discovered any good way to effectively 
<br>
communicate the case-relevant knowledge except through experience.  It 
<br>
seems to be essentially incompressible, although in a sense, it is 
<br>
encoded into the environment in which we've evolved.
<br>
<p>Interestingly (to me, at least), if I reflect on the topics over the 
<br>
last few years that motivate me to post, it's clear they're all linked 
<br>
by the theme of &quot;pragmatic action under intrinsically limited but 
<br>
expanding knowledge.&quot;  They're all about expanding spheres of 
<br>
awareness.  Since I'm a predominately visual thinker, I imagine 
<br>
illustrating the concepts in animated 3D.  Maybe someday I'll get the time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The problem of concept-mapping across noncongruent knowledge
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bases,  AKA &quot;you can't know what you don't know&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The question of rational trust in a system complex beyond one's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own understanding.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The bounds of rationality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The importance of context.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The arrow of morality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The subjective / objective trap.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The &quot;mystery&quot; of qualia.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The illusion of an independent self.
<br>
<p><p>Come to think of it, &quot;pragmatic action under intrinsically limited but 
<br>
expanding knowledge&quot; comes close to what we call intelligent behavior or 
<br>
wisdom.
<br>
<p>So why should this matter to anyone?
<br>
<p>It appears there can be no shortcut to wisdom, but we can and should 
<br>
work to improve the growth of wisdom.  Optimum growth appears to require 
<br>
(1) a fertile environment for interaction (competition) among diverse 
<br>
systems of thought, and (2)  a framework (cooperation) for selection and 
<br>
promotion of successful systems to the next level.
<br>
<p>With the web and its capability to connect communities of thought, we 
<br>
are well on our way with #1 above at global scope.  However, we are 
<br>
lacking the global cooperative framework to accomplish #2 at global 
<br>
scope.  We are still mostly separate and competitive, lacking the 
<br>
overlying cooperative framework necessary for a successful global 
<br>
metasystem of thought.
<br>
<p>&lt;-- insert action plan here --&gt;
<br>
<p>I'm hoping that our ideas and discussions nurture the seeds of the 
<br>
growth we need.
