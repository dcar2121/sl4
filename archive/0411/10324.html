<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I deeply appologize for the incompetence and
<br>
negligence that most of us display in our attitudes
<br>
towards human life. Your brother was an irreplaceably
<br>
unique entity holding a special place within your
<br>
thoughts, as all brothers are. I am with you in your
<br>
thoughts of those gone by always.
<br>
<p>You say that you accept that death removes one
<br>
completely from our existential system and you say
<br>
that you are enlightened enough to strive to avoid the
<br>
occurence. Yet you do not consider an option that must
<br>
require thought patterns of one belonging to Shock
<br>
Level 5, for which you say &quot;if there is one then I do
<br>
not want to know about it&quot; or words to that effect.
<br>
Your brother was what? As all of us are, he was a
<br>
collection of atoms and molecules and electrical
<br>
charge, etc. that combined and interated to make the
<br>
person. Why do you not consider that a matter
<br>
rearranger (a machine that somehow can completely and
<br>
exactly read the states and positions of all matter
<br>
within a given spherical radius) may be able to
<br>
reverse engineer what must have formed your brother?
<br>
The more time passes, the more dissipation shall occur
<br>
and the more work and uncertainty shall be introduced
<br>
into the matter rearrangement. If you succeed at the
<br>
creation of such a device soon enough then the device
<br>
shall be able to &quot;catch&quot; all relevant data before it
<br>
spreads out to unimaginable distances and before it
<br>
alters cohesion to the point of obliteration. Then it
<br>
is a matter of having a matter compositor &quot;build&quot; back
<br>
your brother. I know there are implications of
<br>
catastrophical side effects from such a operation
<br>
should it ever be possible, but it is a way - and it
<br>
should be explored.
<br>
<p>I am sorry again that you had to lose Yehuda - may we
<br>
someday have the capability to not only avoid death
<br>
but also to be able to repair its occurence.
<br>
<p>(I regret that the SIAI and I disagree so much on AGI
<br>
issues)
<br>

<p><em>&gt; My little brother, Yehuda Nattan Yudkowsky, is dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He died November 1st.  His body was found without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identification.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family found out on November 4th.  I spent a week
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a half with my family 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Chicago, and am now back in Atlanta.  I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting off telling my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends, because it's such a hard thing to say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used to say:  &quot;I have four living grandparents and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I intend to have four 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living grandparents when the last star in the Milky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Way burns out.&quot;  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still have four living grandparents, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I'll be saying that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more.  Even if we make it to and through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, it will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too late.  One of the people I love won't be there. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The universe has a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising ability to stab you through the heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from somewhere you weren't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking.  Of all the people I had to protect, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never thought that Yehuda 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be one of them.  Yehuda was born July 11,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1985.  He lived 7053 days. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   He was nineteen years old when he died.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Jewish religion prescribes a number of rituals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and condolences for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasion of a death.  The rituals are pointless and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiring; the condolences 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are religious idiocies.  Yehuda has passed to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better place, God's ways 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are mysterious but benign, etc.  Does such talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really comfort people?  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watched my parents, and I don't think it did.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blessing that is spoken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Jewish funerals is &quot;Blessed is God, the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judge.&quot;  Do they really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that?  Why do they cry at funerals, if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that?  Does it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help someone, to tell them that their religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires them to believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?  I think I coped better than my parents and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little sister Channah. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I was just dealing with pain, not confusion.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I heard on the phone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Yehuda had died, there was never a moment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disbelief.  I knew what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of universe I lived in, and I knew what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planned to do about that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is my religious family to comprehend it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working, as they must, from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the assumption that Yehuda was deliberately murdered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a benevolent God? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same loving God, I presume, who arranges for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of children to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow up illiterate and starving; the same kindly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribal father-figure who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arranged the Holocaust and the Inquisition's torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of witches.  I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not hesitate to call it evil, if any sentient mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had committed such an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act, permitted such a thing.  But I have weighed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence as best I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can, and I do not believe the universe to be evil, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reply which in these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days is called atheism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it helps to believe in an immortal soul.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that I would feel a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot better if Yehuda had gone away on a trip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere, even if he was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never coming back.  But Yehuda did not &quot;pass on&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yehuda is not &quot;resting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in peace&quot;.  Yehuda is not coming back.  Yehuda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't exist any more. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yehuda was absolutely annihilated at the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nineteen.  Yes, that makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me angry.  I can't put into words how angry.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be rage to rend the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gates of Heaven and burn down God on Its throne, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any God existed.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no God, so my anger burns to tear apart the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way-things-are, remake 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pattern of a world that permits this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder at the strength of non-transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheists, to accept so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrible a darkness without any hope of changing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But then most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheists also succumb to comforting lies, and make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excuses for death even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less defensible than the outright lies of religion. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They flinch away, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuse to confront the horror of a hundred and fifty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand sentient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings annihilated every day.  One point eight lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per second, fifty-five 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million lives per year.  Convert the units, time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, life to time. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The World Trade Center killed half an hour.  As of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, all cryonics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations together have suspended one minute. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This essay took twenty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand lives to write.  I wonder if there was ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an atheist who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted the full horror, making no excuses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offering no consolations, who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not also hope for some future dawn.  What must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it be like to live in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this world, seeing it just the way it is, and think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it will never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change, never get any better?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yehuda's death is the first time I ever lost someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close enough for it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurt.  So now I've seen the face of the enemy.  Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand, a little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, the price of half a second.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it well, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human brain has a pattern built into it.  We do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not grieve forever, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move on.  We mourn for a few days and then continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with our lives.  Such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underreaction poorly equips us to comprehend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yehuda's death.  Nineteen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years of life and memory annihilated.  A thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, or a million 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millennia, or a forever, of future life lost.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sun should have dimmed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when Yehuda died, and a chill wind blown in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place that sentient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings gather, to tell us that our number was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diminished by one.  But the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sun did not dim, because we do not live in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensible a universe.  Even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the sun did dim whenever someone died, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't be noticeable except 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a continuous flickering.  Soon everyone would get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to it, and they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would no longer notice the flickering of the sun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My little brother collected corks from wine bottles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Someone brought home, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the family, a pair of corks they had collected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Yehuda, and never had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a chance to give him.  And my grandmother said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Give them to Channah, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someday she'll tell her children about how her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brother Yehuda collected 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corks.&quot;  My grandmother's words shocked me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretched across more time than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it had ever occurred to me to imagine, to when my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fourteen-year-old sister 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had grown up and had married and was telling her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children about the brother 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she'd lost.  How could my grandmother skip across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all those years so easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I was struggling to get through the day?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard my grandmother's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words and thought: she has been through this before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This isn't the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loved one my grandmother has lost, the way Yehuda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the first loved one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd lost.  My grandmother is old enough to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern for dealing with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the death of loved ones; she knows how to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this because she's done it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.  And I thought: how can she accept this?  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she knows, why isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she fighting with everything she has to change it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would it be like to be a rational atheist in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fifteenth century, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and know beyond all hope of rescue that everyone you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loved would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilated, one after another, unless you yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; died first?  That is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still the fate of humans today; the ongoing horror
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not changed, for all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we have hope.  Death is not a distant dream,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a terrible tragedy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that happens to someone else like the stories you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read in newspapers.  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day you'll get a phone call, like I got a phone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call, and the possibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seemed distant will become reality.  You will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mourn, and finish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mourning, and go on with your life, and then one day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll get another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phone call.  That is the fate this world has in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store for you, unless you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a convulsive effort to change it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since Yehuda's body was not identified for three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days after he died, there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no possible way he could have been cryonically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspended.  Others may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be luckier.  If you've been putting off that talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with your loved ones, do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Maybe they won't understand, but at least you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't spend forever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wondering why you didn't even try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is one Jewish custom associated with death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes sense to me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is contributing to charity on behalf of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departed.  I am donating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eighteen hundred dollars to the general fund of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity Institute, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because this has gone on long enough.  If you object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute then consider Dr. Aubrey de Grey's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Methuselah Foundation, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes to defeat aging through biomedical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering.  I think that a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensible coping strategy for transhumanist atheists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to donate to an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-death charity after a loved one dies.  Death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurt us, so we will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmake Death.  Let that be the outlet for our anger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is terrible and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just.  I watched Yehuda's coffin lowered into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground and cried, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I sat through the eulogy and heard rabbis tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comforting lies.  If I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had spoken Yehuda's eulogy I would not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comforted the mourners in their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loss.  I would have told the mourners that Yehuda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been absolutely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilated, that there was nothing left of him.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have told them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were right to be angry, that they had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robbed, that something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precious and irreplaceable was taken from them, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no reason at all, taken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from them and shattered, and they are never getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there should be a monument someday, somewhere on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will be &quot;$1800, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memoriam Yehuda Nattan Yudkowsky, 1985-2004.&quot;  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not restore him to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  No sentient being deserves such a thing.  Let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that be my brother's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true eulogy, free of comforting lies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When Michael Wilson heard the news, he said:  &quot;We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shall have to work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster.&quot;  Any similar condolences are welcome. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other condolences are not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goodbye, Yehuda.  There isn't much point in saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, since there's no one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear.  Goodbye, Yehuda, you don't exist any more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Nothing left of you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after your death, like there was nothing before your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth.  You died, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your family, Mom and Dad and Channah and I, sat down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the Sabbath table 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just like our family had always been composed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only four people, like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there had never been a Yehuda.  Goodbye, Yehuda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yudkowsky, never to return, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never to be forgotten.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Love,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer.
