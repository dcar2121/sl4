<em>&gt; &gt; Coming at this business from the EP side, I think Collective Volition might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not even be a good idea, though it might be that I don't understand some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; special meaning beyond the obvious meaning of the words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Collective Volition is a technical term, not just an aggregate of people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will.  At the risk of getting it wrong, I'll write why I think you are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem is stressed humans.  That includes those who think they see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;looming privation&quot; in the future and the ones who have been switched into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a degraded mode of thinking (non-rational) by a physical attack.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;collective volition&quot; of such people is scary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Collective Volition is not about what humans want, right now. Doubtless if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implemented thus, we'd get a machine to print currency. The CV is about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans congruently want if they were more like the person they wish they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were, id est, knew more, had unbound time to think about it, and unbound
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information about the issue. You may argue that there will be no congruence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I have no counter-argument for that.
</em><br>
<p>It does seem rather unlikely that a Islamic fundamentalist and I would ever 
<br>
come to agree.  Heck, it is unlikely that I would agree on what the world 
<br>
should be like with a fundamentalist Christian and I grew up in that culture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, even in the worst of times, people have an idealist desire not to wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Ah . . . . You and I and a lot of our friends are likely have such idealist 
<br>
desires.  I am most reluctant to assume that beyond a rather narrow segment 
<br>
of western high tech cultures.  I was watching a nature show tonight where 
<br>
the locals worship rats, about 6000 of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This would be picked up by CV, and the extrapolated volition would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come from agents that would be less prone to war and to irrational thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I have come to the horrid realization that wars are what happens when some 
<br>
significant segment of a human population thinks they are facing a bleak 
<br>
future.  We evolved as gene survival machines.  Now *genes* by the very 
<br>
nature of the process are rational.  But a for a gene to be rational, that 
<br>
is survive into the next generation, in some circumstances it induces 
<br>
irrational thinking and behavior into its carriers.  The mechanism by which 
<br>
this is done isn't understood yet, but the logic is 
<br>
airtight--unfortunately.  :-(
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Likewise the virtues of tolerance, happiness and Western *Liberal Democracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been thoroughly established as desired by the powers that be, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point that claiming one agrees with them is condition sine qua non to hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power, and so it is likely that CV would extrapolate from tolerant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happiness-driven Liberal-Democratic individuals.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you are right about this  If you are, I don't think it will be due 
<br>
to the CV of large populations, but because the people who develop AI just 
<br>
impose their collective ideas on what the AI should value.
<br>
<p>I suspect that Liberal-Democratic memes are a historic anomaly, caused by a 
<br>
few centuries of tech driven mostly optimistic future prospects and 
<br>
possibly the effect of large families (see Frank Sulloway).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure myself this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an entirely great thing, but the EP issues are pretty much non-existent for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CV, as CV considers what we wish we were, and not what we are, and one thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we all wish we were is free from the evolutionary detritus of our past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct?
</em><br>
<p>You should think about this a bit more.  The &quot;evolutionary detritus of our 
<br>
past&quot; should be discarded with *extreme* care.  Most of the problems we 
<br>
have can be solved by enough room rather than changing human nature.  Of 
<br>
course maintaining the ratio of resources to humans might require tinkering 
<br>
anyway.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt;*1I mean here the traditional, early XX century meaning of Western Liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Democracy, nothing about political orientation itself.
