<p>Sigh.
<br>
<p>EP says that if humans have any psychological traits at all (and I make the 
<br>
case they do) these traits were almost entirely selected in the stone age.
<br>
<p>So it should be no surprise that people have psychological traits that make 
<br>
it easy to learn to fear snakes and spiders, and don't have traits to make 
<br>
it easy to fear wall sockets.
<br>
<p>The problem is accounting (where you can) for modern behavior that is 
<br>
rooted in mechanisms selected a million years ago.
<br>
<p>As an example, modern day behaviors of frat hazing, army basic training, 
<br>
battered wife, SM and B&amp;D are probably rooted in capture-bonding, otherwise 
<br>
known as Stockholm Syndrome.  The psychological trait of being able to bond 
<br>
to captors was selected over the millions of years where something like 10% 
<br>
of our ancestors were violently captured from another 
<br>
tribe. 
<br>
<p><p>Re wars as the result of evolved psychological traits, wars don't happen 
<br>
all the time.  That leaves only two choices for why, they are either random 
<br>
or causal.  If you believe they are random, please make the case.  If not:
<br>
<p>1.  War is a species typical human behavior.
<br>
<p>2.  Species typical behaviors are the result of evolutionary selection (per 
<br>
EP, in the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness.)
<br>
<p>There is more, but no point in going further if we disagree at the 
<br>
fundamental level.
<br>
<p>************
<br>
<p>There are two points where this is relevant to sl4/AIs friendly or 
<br>
not.  First, uploading humans is far more dangerous than I would have 
<br>
thought a few years ago, though it might be safe enough if we know how to 
<br>
keep some psychological traits switched off.
<br>
<p>Second, humans in war mode are likely to do extremely stupid things, like 
<br>
creating seed AIs that grow up hostile.
