Subject: Re: META: Memes and War [was: Tomorrow is a new day]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Predictions can be made.  One theory about war is that when the proportion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of young men goes over some particular percentage, that causes war.  China
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is at or beyond the prediction percentage as a result of selective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortion/infanticide.  This theory says China will not attack neighbors as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as their income per capita is rising.  (They can still go into war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode as a result of *being* attacked of course.)  We could also take a
</em><br>
look
<br>
<em>&gt; at income per capita trends and predict where there are going to be
</em><br>
problems.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Since when does the income level of the average Chinese affect *any*
<br>
decision at all, in their government.  And especially war?  When students
<br>
protested the speed of implimentation of some free enterprise institutions,
<br>
they were casually shot in Tiananmen Square.  Do you read a different
<br>
history book?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theory would have to be modified or thrown out if there are historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples of a population in &quot;good times&quot; mode, i.e., rising income per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capita and good future prospects, having a random upsurge of xenophobic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes and going to war *without* being attacked.  In favor of the theory
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; the inverse correlation of neo-nazi memes/activity and economic prospects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US.  If you could get good data, the timing lag would be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Whether or not there actually are &quot;xenophobic war memes&quot;, what does this
<br>
show about countries going to war.  Since when does the USA go to war with
<br>
anyone based on &quot;income levels&quot;?  Did Bush invade Iraq because of
<br>
unemployment in the USA?  Since when do the politicians of any country
<br>
consult the *people* to decide on going to war?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theory requires psychological *mechanisms* implemented in neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware, that are ultimately the results of genes.  Chimps act enough
</em><br>
like
<br>
<em>&gt; humans (genocide of neighbors) that they probably share the psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism and (versions of) the underlying brain genes.  Bonobos might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.  They have not (so far) been observed carrying out genocidal attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on neighboring groups.  (Which brings up the question of how bonobo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populations are ultimately limited?)  Genetic comparison of human, chimp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bonobo for genes active in brain construction might be useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Are you suggesting that humans act like apes but not bonobos?  If apes and
<br>
humans are genetically 97% the same, don't you think apes and bonobos are
<br>
more like 99% the same?  How can you make such suggestions without any
<br>
evidense.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To tie this back into being on topic, it is going to be hard enough for
</em><br>
FAI
<br>
<em>&gt; to emerge in humans who are not in &quot;war mode.&quot;   &quot;Friendly&quot; wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high on the list for researchers in war mode.  Consider the Manhattan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project.  <a href="http://www.me.utexas.edu/~uer/manhattan/debates.html">http://www.me.utexas.edu/~uer/manhattan/debates.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This problem only arises *if* your theory is correct.  I see no historic
<br>
evidence to suggest that it is!
<br>
<p>In one of my posts I suggested an alternative theory based on an imbalance
<br>
of power between countries.  You ignored my post.  Tell me why my theory is
<br>
worse than yours?  I believe I have a huge amount of evidence to back my
<br>
theory. (Imbalance of power causing war theory was not originated by me.
<br>
This theory has been around for at least thousands of years.)  You seem to
<br>
quote others &quot;big advances in evolution theory over the last 30-40 years by
<br>
William Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and George Williams&quot; but does quoting
<br>
others make an argument for your theory?
<br>
<p>I took Anthropology at University (2000) and it is news to me that there is
<br>
fossil evidence that ancient man warred often.  It was thought that
<br>
hunter/gathers lived a very scattered and lonely existence and
<br>
overpopulation was definitely not a problem.  They came together in
<br>
friendship on a year or two basis to exchange things, (women, tools etc) and
<br>
didn't stay together long because of the quickly depleted resources.
<br>
<p>The following is an excerpt from Roger Lewin's &quot;The Origin of Modern
<br>
Humans&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;Even in earlier times, between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago, indications of
<br>
violence can sometimes be seen in paintings and engravings.  But go back
<br>
beyond the beginning of the agricultural revolution and depictions of war in
<br>
art virtually vanish. ... Warfare, so important a part of human history, is
<br>
associated with the need for territorial possession that arose once
<br>
populations became agricultural and necessarily sedentary.  Violence became
<br>
an  obsession once populations started to expand and the ability to organize
<br>
large military forces developed.  Is violence, then, a necessary and
<br>
inevitable characteristic of humankind or merely an adaptation to certain
<br>
circumstances?  It may have occurred when modern humans replaced archaic
<br>
populations, but it is not yet possible to be sure one way or the other.&quot;
<br>
<p>I say again, if your theory of *war memes* is incorrect then we don't have
<br>
to worry about &quot;income levels&quot; precipitating a war.  We do *not* have to
<br>
worry about the financial well being of everyone to have a successful
<br>
singularity.  I think we might have to worry about the government enforcing
<br>
rules on us if we ever get powerful enough for it to matter but that is a
<br>
different conversation.
<br>
<p>-- David Clark
<br>
<p>PS  Just because I am quoting a book does *not* make my case.  I am only
<br>
showing that your theory is not backed by fossil evidence.
