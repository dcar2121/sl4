</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;what kind of evidence your hypothesis would require,

</em><br>

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I really think he's made a good case that there

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;in this direction, since resource depletion is a

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;distinctly modern (last few thousand years) issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I suspect you and perhaps David just have not thought about this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;much.  The *general* problem of living things depleting resources goes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;back to shortly after life arose.  It's a mathematical property of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;anything capable of replication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's true that I have not thought about this much,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however, I'd like to clarify my understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this.  Most of my limited knowledge of this area
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comes from works such as _Guns, Germs, and Steel_.
</em><br>
<p>The most spectacular depletion I can think of is the plants taking 
<br>
virtually all the carbon dioxide out of the air.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even as recently as a few hundred years ago in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Europe,
</em><br>
<p>To evolutionary psychology, nothing since the introduction of agriculture 
<br>
is significant.  With extremely rare exceptions, there just has not been 
<br>
enough time for selection to take place.  Evolution is a *slow* process for 
<br>
animals with generation times in decades.  100,000 years is just getting 
<br>
started.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;disease was by far the major killer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans who didn't live to, say, 40.
</em><br>
<p>Disease as we know it in historical times is largely a side effect of large 
<br>
communicating populations.  A world of hunter gatherers was not infested 
<br>
with measles for example.  (Measles came from cattle IIRC and is not 
<br>
sustained in small populations.)  Large populations are a direct result of 
<br>
agriculture.  Farmers pushed out hunter gatherers because (if it were 
<br>
suitable for farming) a given area of land could support a hundred times a 
<br>
many farmers as it did hunter gatherers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Food and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;water have only rarely been so scarce as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trigger widespread die-offs,
</em><br>
<p>That depends on what you mean by &quot;rarely.&quot;  Human generations times are 
<br>
such that you would expect die-offs from whatever cause to be some multiple 
<br>
of generation times just to give the population a chance to build back 
<br>
up.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine</a>

<br>
<p>Results 1 - 10 of about 530,000 for famine europe.
<br>
<p>What happened to the Mayan people is instructive as well as similar events 
<br>
that happened in the American Southwest, where a war mode response to 
<br>
shortages depopulated a huge area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and if you look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;places on Earth in the twentieth century where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were scarcest, you still don't see humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as other humans' primary cause of death, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather, disease and malnutrition.
</em><br>
<p>Results 1 - 10 of about 18,700 for Yanomamo
<br>
<p>Take the Yanomamo as an example.  They aren't entirely hunter gatherers 
<br>
since they raise a substantial fraction of their food in gardens.  Today 
<br>
disease rapidly killing them off.  But before they had a lot of contact 
<br>
with the rest of the population war between the villages was a more 
<br>
important source of mortality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think that in looking at cases where humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a group began killing or attacking other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans, you've failed to notice the much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;common cases where humans quietly resigned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves to less, or had their population
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduced by disease, lack of resources (directly),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.
</em><br>
<p>That does happen.  The Irish potato famine 150 years ago can be cited as an 
<br>
example.  The mechanism, by requiring a time for xenophobic memes to build 
<br>
up, says that a disaster which comes on fast won't provoke a war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That is, I believe you're a victim of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selection effect, here, because of a focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;figuring out why humans attack others.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions which you have determined give rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to these behaviors fail to do so in the majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of cases, so I would hesitate to assign to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any kind of causal mechanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that economics (in the broad sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the study of why humans behave as they do) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably a more likely field to produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answers you're looking for.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  By tying the trigger mechanism to changes in &quot;income per capita&quot; or 
<br>
game and berries in the days when that was the measurement of economic 
<br>
activity, this is  economics.
<br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I thought it was clear that the vast majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans in the stone age died of disease or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complications from minor injuries which would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only a nuisance today.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have any cites for this?  I have read widely and not seen it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Human's generally don't have twins like bears, but in a primitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;environment the typical woman is pregnant or nursing from late teens to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;early 40s.  Five to six kids is typical.  Just like bears, on average 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;only two of them will survive to reproduce (given a constant environment, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which includes technology).  And typically 40% of the adults in present 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;day hunter gatherer groups die from violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But comparatively few births reach adulthood, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even so, I question whether &quot;violence&quot; here includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting mauled by a hunted animal.
</em><br>
<p>Once the human line started using stand off hunting methods, even back to 
<br>
hand axes, injuries don't seem to be that common.  The exception might be 
<br>
the Neanderthals who most likely didn't contribute to our genetics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I know bringing in bad news about our evolved psychological traits is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a popular role, heck, I find the subject really depressing, but someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;has to do it because we really need to understand ourselves better if we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are going to survive into the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think there's any particular hope of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widespread understanding of human psychology in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this detail before the singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Possibly you are correct.
