Just thought I'd post a copy of this article for any that might not be
<br>
aware of this new research tool:

<p>Web Search--Google
<br>
Big News: &quot;Google Scholar&quot; is Born
<br>
By Shirl Kennedy and Gary Price
<br>
<p>The world of online &quot;scholarly&quot; research is changing today as Google
<br>
introduces Google Scholar. This specialized new interface -- which
<br>
will NOT be linked from Google's main search page -- will allow users
<br>
to search a treasure chest of &quot;scholarly material.&quot;
<br>
<p>As you've read here many times, Google is brilliant (that is,
<br>
ingenious at marketing and trying new things), and this is yet another
<br>
example of their savvy. This is something that some other large web
<br>
engine(s) could have done years ago to help separate themselves from
<br>
other players and also provide a useful service. No one did it. Now,
<br>
others will likely play catch-up with Google.
<br>
Basically, users of Google Scholar can, via a single search location,
<br>
access content from &quot;scholarly&quot; materials found on the OPEN WEB that
<br>
they've found in the Google crawl of the web.
<br>
<p>Some basic facts:
<br>
+ In a nutshell, Google has built an algorithm that makes a
<br>
calculated guess at to *what it thinks* is a scholarly content mined
<br>
from the OPEN WEB, and then makes it accessible via the Google Scholar
<br>
interface.
<br>
+ Precisely what makes something &quot;scholarly&quot; enough to be included
<br>
in Google Scholar, Google will not say. And this is not an
<br>
insignificant omission. Librarians, especially academic librarians,
<br>
are *always* being asked to provide &quot;scholarly&quot; material, even if
<br>
customers aren't quite sure what this means. Their instructor told
<br>
them they needed articles from &quot;scholarly journals,&quot; so this is
<br>
precisely what they ask for at the library. As librarians, we may try
<br>
to educate them about how &quot;refereed publications&quot; work, but let's face
<br>
it. What most of these folks really want is to quickly download an
<br>
appropriate article and beat feet out of the library.
<br>
And if they think they can get what they need from Google, the odds
<br>
are slim that they will bother with library resources at all.
<br>
College students AND professors might not know that library databases
<br>
exist, but they sure know Google.
<br>
<p>The database vendors don't always make it easy for us, either. For
<br>
example, when searching Gale databases such as InfoTrac OneFile or
<br>
Expanded Academic ASAP, you see a check box that you can fill in if
<br>
you want to restrict your search to &quot;refereed publications.&quot; How many
<br>
of our customers know what a &quot;refereed publication&quot; is? Does any
<br>
instructor ever ask his or her students to find articles from
<br>
&quot;refereed publications&quot;? What's up with this?
<br>
<p>More facts:
<br>
+ Material accessible via Google Scholar can also be in the main
<br>
Google index.
<br>
+ Google Scholar results pages *will not contain advertising* -- at
<br>
least for now.
<br>
+ Some examples of material from major publishers whose material
<br>
you'll find (we know Google has been working with many)? Google will
<br>
not provide us with a complete list, but look for content from ACM,
<br>
IEEE, and yes, Open Worldcat material from OCLC. We also don't know
<br>
precisely what is and is not available, date ranges, etc.
<br>
* In some cases Google will be crawling and searching the full text of
<br>
an article but users will either have to have a subscription to the
<br>
content or pay for access to an individual articles.
<br>
+ VERY COOL! For many citations, you'll find a direct link to other
<br>
articles in the Google Scholar database that cite the article you've
<br>
selected. Yes, Google Scholar is a citation database too! This reminds
<br>
me of two specialized databases that focus on specific types of
<br>
scholarly content accessible on the open web that have been online for
<br>
many years and remain EXCELLENT tools.
<br>
1) CiteSeer (focuses on computer science material, info tech content)
<br>
2) SmealSearch (focuses on business material)
<br>
+ Some material, let's say from Open Worldcat, isn't always
<br>
scholarly in the way many people think of it.
<br>
For example:
<br>
++ Here are many John Grishman books.
<br>
++ Although we're honored, we don't consider this blog to be
<br>
a &quot;scholarly&quot; resource.
<br>
++ Academic librarians will be sad to learn that it's impossible to
<br>
limit to only &quot;peer-reviwed&quot; material.
<br>
+ How big is the Google Scholar database? Google isn't saying.
<br>
<p>As Google makes this announcement and word spreads about a &quot;scholarly
<br>
search tool&quot; -- ESPECIALLY in the academic community -- we think the
<br>
use of specialty databases (the ones university libraries offer and
<br>
spend $$$ for) will drop. It's worth watching to see if people begin
<br>
paying for material located via Google Scholar that they can get
<br>
*free* from a specialty database they may not know is available via
<br>
their public or academic library.
<br>
<p>Might this be a golden opportunity for the library community to tell
<br>
people -- look, we have access to this stuff and MUCH MUCH MORE? We
<br>
have better ways to search it, and you might not even have to pay for
<br>
it? Well, yeah...but if what we've seen in the past is any indication,
<br>
this is not going to happen. Maybe this time it will be different.
<br>
Bottom line: It's very difficult to compete with the Google marketing
<br>
machine. In the meantime, we'll be extremely interested in the
<br>
response to Google Scholar from fee-based database publishers. Some
<br>
might ask, are specialized database tools still necessary? Info pros
<br>
know they are but we sure haven't done a good job of explaining why.
<br>
<p>It will also be interesting to see if *any* of the press/chatter about
<br>
Google Scholar makes even a small mention of specialized subscription
<br>
databases, free access to these via libraries, and the fact that what
<br>
Google is offering is merely the tip of the &quot;scholarly&quot; info iceberg.
<br>
<p>Is all of this yet another nail in the coffin for library resources
<br>
and maybe librarians? Too early to tell, of course. However, we have
<br>
to ask yet again, why wasn't the library community developing this
<br>
kind of tool in 1999 and 2000? Kudos to Google for doing so.
<br>
<p>When big announcements come from Google and web engines, we often get
<br>
nervous and...sometimes upset with our profession. Not this time,
<br>
however. It's just not worth it. This is BIG news and something that
<br>
should have been around for years. It's going to be interesting what
<br>
transpires moving forward.
<br>
<p>Finally, specialized databases are still valuable for many types of
<br>
seaching, including searching for &quot;scholarly material.&quot;
<br>
Why? A few examples:
<br>
+ Limit to material published by date
<br>
+ Ability to view more than 1000 results. The Google cutoff of 1000
<br>
results is still in place with Google Scholar.
<br>
+ Searching using a controlled vocabulary/subject searching Ability to
<br>
+ limit by publisher affiliation You can limit by author with author:
<br>
+ but you can only use a last
<br>
name.
<br>
First names and initials are not searchable when using author:
<br>
+ Proximity operators
<br>
+ Gobs and gobs of content, Google Scholar still doesn't have it all
<br>
Example: While you're find John Grisham books, you will NOT find
<br>
material (both current and archived) from MANY newspapers, trade
<br>
publications, and general interest periodicals.
<br>
+ I'm sure you can add many more examples of what's NOT there
<br>
<p>Again, it's one thing for the info pro to understand all of this, it's
<br>
something else for the typical searcher. Stay tuned, this is going to
<br>
be interesting.
<br>
See Also: Google Plans New Service for Scientists and Scholars From
<br>
the article, &quot;While the great majority of recent scholarly papers and
<br>
periodicals are indexed on the Web, many have not been easily
<br>
accessible to the public.&quot; This is again an example of not
<br>
understanding that libraries both public, private, and, academic have
<br>
offered access to databases with this content for many years and that
<br>
they can be accessed without having to visit the library building.
