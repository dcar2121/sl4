</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Spoken like a true free-market capitalist
<br>
believer. I believe that we are looking at the
<br>
same economy and seeing two very different
<br>
things. What I see (here in the US) is a takeover
<br>
of the government by corporate interests which do
<br>
not want a true free market at all, except where
<br>
it furthers their goals. In a true free market,
<br>
can one not buy all the Canadian medicine one
<br>
needs? Should airlines get bailed out on the
<br>
public dime? And so on. They seek freedom for
<br>
themselves and interference for the competition
<br>
(did you know that marijuana was outlawed after a
<br>
PR campaign by the Hearst papers, which also
<br>
owned wood pulp interests? Hemp makes better
<br>
paper, which doesn't need chemical bleaching,
<br>
while obviating deforestation, produces useful
<br>
oil from the seeds, etc.) The common good is
<br>
served haphazardly, when there's a profit.
<br>
Tip O'Neil used to tell a parable about a
<br>
constituent who went to school on the G.I. Bill,
<br>
drove to work on federally built roads, in a car
<br>
that was safe because the gov't mandated it,
<br>
after dropping the kid off at a free public
<br>
school, etc. etc., then called Tip to complain
<br>
that &quot;the government never did a thing for me.&quot;
<br>
The US owes much of its prosperity to
<br>
universities built with tax bucks.
<br>
But: the way the US is going now, the innovation
<br>
is pretty well guaranteed to go overseas. There
<br>
are many reasons, but a lot of it comes back to
<br>
the infrastructure being weakened by greed.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyone who dismisses my comments as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ravings of a granola-headed egalitarian naif
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should at least consider that a laissez-faire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarian AI might feel no responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feed *you*. The social contract exists for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Umm...  This arbitrary 'social contract' only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists insofar as it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced upon people at gunpoint.  It is not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inviolable law of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe.  Yet people generally get fed even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when people are not forced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to feed them.
</em><br>
Contradictory statements: &quot;People generally get
<br>
fed&quot; by magic? You are saying that the 'social
<br>
contract' is not the social contract? When Enron
<br>
uses fraud to suck billions out of California,
<br>
and elsewhere, is it not 'gunpoint' that prevents
<br>
Ken Lay's house from being sacked by a mob? See,
<br>
I *thought* the social contract referred to those
<br>
things we agreed to do *without* physical
<br>
coercion. 
<br>
<em>&gt; Good luck using threats of violence to force a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligent AI to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do *anything*.  This is a naive and dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of AI.
</em><br>
That is not my view at all. Straw man fallacy. We
<br>
will not be able to force a SAI to do anything.
<br>
My point is that if the SAI thinks as many CEO's
<br>
and world leaders do today, well, *gulp.* It's
<br>
like Somoza once said: &quot;I don't want educated
<br>
citizens, I want oxen!&quot;
<br>
The whole point of CFAI is to give the SAI
<br>
something resembling a conscience toward us. If
<br>
it has none, cogs are the *best* we can hope to
<br>
be.
