</em><br>
<p>I suspect you and perhaps David just have not thought about this much.  The 
<br>
*general* problem of living things depleting resources goes back to shortly 
<br>
after life arose.  It's a mathematical property of anything capable of 
<br>
replication.
<br>
<p>Trying to find the &quot;mama bear&quot; quote, I found that I had already discussed 
<br>
this point back in May, here specifically:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8659.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8659.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt;begin quote&gt;
<br>
<p>. . . at a psychology workshop this last weekend . . .
<br>
<p>They are the kind of people who understand the &quot;Mamma bear&quot; problem that 
<br>
William Calvin discusses in the first chapter of The Ascent of Mind: Ice 
<br>
Age Climates and the Evolution of Intelligence.
<br>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, a little arithmetic shows that this story doesn't have a 
<br>
happy ending. How many bears can the environment feed? Obviously, that's 
<br>
the average bear population. And that means, on average, only two babies 
<br>
per mother get to grow up and become a parent, out of the dozen or two that 
<br>
she produces. The maximum population level is not set by the birth rate but 
<br>
by the number of job slots afforded by the environmental niche occupied by 
<br>
bears. . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That means the average Mama Bear is raising five-to-ten times more baby 
<br>
bears than can possibly survive, absent, of course, miracles -- . . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>The opposition I got to asking how far back it was that humans became their 
<br>
own major predator was really interesting (at a meta level). It is obvious 
<br>
that hominid lines were able to fill the environment to capacity and then 
<br>
some. The simple fact that our line spread so far into Asia so long ago 
<br>
indicates population pressure on groups at the population edges. Behind
<br>
that edge *something* (or things) held the population to the numbers the 
<br>
environment can feed. Obviously diseases were a factor, but probably not 
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>But the idea that human line groups killed off neighbors as a regular 
<br>
feature of life long enough to select for a survival response genes when 
<br>
things start to get tight . . . . . I wonder if humans generally have 
<br>
emotional censors to reject such an idea. Perhaps such thoughts conflict in 
<br>
with our view of ourselves--at least as that view has been shaped by times 
<br>
of relative plenty.
<br>
<p>[Editorial note, I now am wondering if rejecting thinking about this 
<br>
subject might be due to _wired in_ censors, the kind that keep people from 
<br>
thinking any more than they absolutely have to about their own mortality.]
<br>
<p>&quot;Global maturing&quot; may be a lot harder if censor biases keep us from 
<br>
thinking about this class of knowledge.
<br>
<p>Then again, perhaps humans differ in some way from bears and they didn't 
<br>
overfill the environment during the stone age or they had some other way to 
<br>
control populations that didn't involve groups killing each other.
<br>
<p>&lt;end quote&gt;
<br>
<p>Human's generally don't have twins like bears, but in a primitive 
<br>
environment the typical woman is pregnant or nursing from late teens to 
<br>
early 40s.  Five to six kids is typical.  Just like bears, on average only 
<br>
two of them will survive to reproduce (given a constant environment, which 
<br>
includes technology).  And typically 40% of the adults in present day 
<br>
hunter gatherer groups die from violence.
<br>
<p>I know bringing in bad news about our evolved psychological traits is not a 
<br>
popular role, heck, I find the subject really depressing, but someone has 
<br>
to do it because we really need to understand ourselves better if we are 
<br>
going to survive into the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Looking to see if I had ever used the word &quot;Krell,&quot; I found I had started 
<br>
another thread back in May with the subject line &quot;Forbidden Planet.&quot;  I 
<br>
don't think anyone made a comment directly on the subject line and now 
<br>
wonder how large a fraction of the list &quot;got it.&quot;  That's one of the 
<br>
problems of a text only interface because you can't see the baffled looks 
<br>
when you cite something which might not be as widely known as you think.
