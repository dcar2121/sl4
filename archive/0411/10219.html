<p>Ben,
<br>
<p>Correspondence with James Albus at NIST was encouraging but they are short 
<br>
of sponsorship funds due to the war in Iraq.  At Cycorp there is modest 
<br>
low-level interest in my work so far with an Albus-inspired 
<br>
hierarchical, learning control structure, but I hope to get some 
<br>
effort-hours allocated from a sponsored project in the next few months.  I 
<br>
have already developed an agent control language that can implement Albus 
<br>
nodes in java.  The language statements are represented in CycL (predicate 
<br>
calculus) as scripts, then compiled out into a java classes for 
<br>
execution.  The behavior methods are organized into scalable nodes having 
<br>
sensations and performing actions through message-passing.  The upper 
<br>
levels of the node hierarchy implement a Friendship Architecture, i.e.  
<br>
BeFriendly is the uppermost node.
<br>
<p>Currently, I am excited about importing all of WordNet 2.0 into Cyc as 
<br>
concepts.  That's part of a DARPA sponsored project we call Accessible 
<br>
Research Cyc, that will deliver a very large subset of Cyc to Universities 
<br>
and companies under a research license.  Importing WordNet is attractive 
<br>
because our text parsers will then have much better recall (percent 
<br>
coverage), with the drawback of much more word-sense ambiguity to deal 
<br>
with.  I expect that we will add 80,000 concepts (lexicon plus some 
<br>
definitional assertions) to Cyc in this effort.
<br>
<p>Agreed that a commonsense knowledge base is incapable of achieving a high 
<br>
level of general intelligence, provided that a deductive inference engine 
<br>
is its only active facility.  But Cycorp believes that the hard part of AI 
<br>
is constructing a fleshed-out commonsense conceptual vocabulary, whose 
<br>
later additions (hopefully soon) include scripts for intelligent behaviors.  
<br>
<p>As we have discussed, other AI designs, given a certain maturity, could 
<br>
simply read Cyc to acquire all that we have hand coded, as a short cut to 
<br>
understanding dictionaries and encyclopedias.  On the other hand, we think 
<br>
that once Cyc is capable of learning by reading, learning by being taught 
<br>
by us using dialog, and capable of learning from experience, then we can 
<br>
subsequently plug in probabilistic adapters to ground out symbolic 
<br>
concepts from real-word sensations (robotics).
<br>
<p>There are AI projects based on probabilistic  learning working towards 
<br>
knowledge richness, and alternatively there is Cyc, based upon first 
<br>
achieving commonsense knowledge richness (e.g. recently we added a 
<br>
sophisticated temporal reasoner) including how-to knowledge, and then 
<br>
working towards self-improvement and probabilistic learning.  
<br>
<p>The beauty of our approach is that knowledge base improvement is a 
<br>
virtuous circle attracting sponsors.
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
-Steve
