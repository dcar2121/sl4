You misunderstand me here- I'm not talking about a middle man on
<br>
the totem pole, or a top ape, I'm talking about the low monkey,
<br>
the ones who are worst off. Simply by being worse off they don't
<br>
have much ability to wage war (for instance, you don't worry
<br>
about the outcast cripple taking on the alpha male and winning,
<br>
or about, say, the Bahamas conquering North America). Its the
<br>
ones at the top moving up and down who will wage war.
<br>
And for a band, if they really were on the brink, a war would
<br>
either make or break them, and wouldn't tribes keep having bad
<br>
luck and being wiped out over time?  (I think of this as
<br>
gambling- you'll lose less money by taking small lowrisk wagers
<br>
rather than many chancy high reward wagers.)
<br>
And the point about Germany in WWI was that they didn't try to
<br>
stop it, they welcomed their chance to take their 'rightful'
<br>
place in the hierarchy, since they saw themselves as having taken
<br>
the torch from England (which I think was right, the british
<br>
empire seems to decline around this time.)

<em>&gt; &gt;     I've heard you say this before, Keith, and I must ask:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would a stressed population dare to war, or be able to?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; So when things started to look like the tribe members were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough game and berries to get through the next season, going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to war was on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average a 50-50 proposition for the people, and war was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *much* better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance for the genes of these primitive people than starving. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The worst 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case was that all the males in one of the tribes fighting would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed.  That's still better for the *genes* of the losers than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because copies of their genes are in the young women of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribe who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally booty to the winners.  (A perverse application of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamilton's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclusive fitness criteria.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So over a multi million year time frame, genes that made it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribe facing starvation would go to war with neighbors instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quitely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starving became standard.  I propose that such genes build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traits that increase the &quot;gain&quot; of circulating xenophobic memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in times of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the particular stress of &quot;looming privation.&quot;  You can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the stupid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factor comes in because all the normal inhibitions of not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacking nasty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strangers who might just as well kill *you* have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;about populaces that are up and coming and want theirs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(imperialist nations, say)?  Surely no one will argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Germany was willing to instigate WWI because they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'stressed', or America going whole hog in WWII, or less so in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;WWI, was because they were under some stress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a starter, you can hardly expect psychological traits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stone age to be well adapted to modern times.  I make the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that hunter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gatherer psychological traits can spell disaster in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced cultures and cite the corn farmers of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Southwest who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were wiped out over large areas because their hunter gatherer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;looming privation&quot; was incompatible with a farming mode of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, WWI was before the big drop in birth rates, so there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was falling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income per capita over much of Europe.  (Due to rising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third, you only need one party to start a war.  WWI is confused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is hard to say exactly who started it, but you could argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; German's didn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might add that the US enthusiasm for WWII was much higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WWI.  Being attacked does that.
