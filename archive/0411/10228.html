Keith Henson;
<br>
<p>It is prudent to be aware that human mentality is not all sweetness and 
<br>
light, and you are performing an excellent service by reminding us of this 
<br>
fact.  As a broad statement, your &quot;Unhappy people with a bleak future were a 
<br>
fertile substrate for xenophobic memes...&quot; fits some of human history very 
<br>
well.  However, the explanation you provide: &quot;psychological mechanisms into 
<br>
our brains that under some circumstances shuts off rational thinking&quot; may be 
<br>
incomplete or perhaps even incorrect.  The psychological mechanisms that 
<br>
implement xenophobic memes may well be the same ones that implement 
<br>
cooperative memes.  Evolution is notorious for re-using existing 
<br>
architecture in multiple ways.  Perhaps the human meme-machine works the 
<br>
same way no matter what meme happens to be in a person's mind.  If this is 
<br>
the case, then your warning is even more timely because there will almost 
<br>
certainly be multiple memes that are &quot;scary&quot;.
<br>
<p>You wrote: &quot;CV could come to the conclusion that high average happiness 
<br>
required periodic population culls too.&quot;  -- This statement is so strange, 
<br>
and seems so disconnected from how people think, that I cannot see how you 
<br>
arrived at it.  While an analysis of history might allow one to infer that 
<br>
people believe that &quot;high average happiness requires periodic wars&quot;, it is 
<br>
unreasonable to suggest that people want the wars.  A more reasonable 
<br>
inference would be that the people wanted *happiness*, and some leader 
<br>
convinced them that the way to get it was thru war.  There have been leaders 
<br>
who promoted methods other than war, and have done so successfully.
<br>
<p>Let us be vigilant, but not paranoid.
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
