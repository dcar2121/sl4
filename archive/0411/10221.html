Hi,
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As we have discussed, other AI designs, given a certain maturity, could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply read Cyc to acquire all that we have hand coded, as a short cut to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding dictionaries and encyclopedias.  On the other hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that once Cyc is capable of learning by reading, learning by being taught
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by us using dialog, and capable of learning from experience, then we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequently plug in probabilistic adapters to ground out symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts from real-word sensations (robotics).
</em><br>
<p>Well, a while ago we made some preliminary experiments loading in knowledge
<br>
from OpenCyc, and trying to do probabilistic inference to connect this with
<br>
knowledge obtained via
<br>
<p>a) natural language parsing
<br>
b) analysis of quantitative data
<br>
<p>Our tentative conclusion was that the style in which Cyc represents
<br>
knowledge is highly awkward when compared with natural language and also
<br>
with natural representations for quantitative data patterns.  In principle
<br>
one can do automated reasoning to link Cyc knowledge in with knowledge
<br>
acquired through these other mechanisms, but it's much harder than it needs
<br>
to be, because of the various choices made in designing the Cyc
<br>
representational style.
<br>
<p>Our tentative conclusion was that -- if we want to explicitly load knowledge
<br>
into Novamente -- it would be better for us to simply enter a dictionary
<br>
into Novamente through our interactive natural language understanding
<br>
interface.  This way the knowledge of word meanings (an important kind of
<br>
commonsense knowledge) would  automatically and initially be represented in
<br>
a style compatible with linguistically expressed knowledge.  And our way of
<br>
representing NL knowledge has been designed to match up naturally with
<br>
knowledge derived via perception and action.
<br>
<p>So, my hypothesis is that formally encoding knowledge in a style designed
<br>
without careful attention to both natural language and perception/action, is
<br>
not a very good idea.   The different parts of the mind are highly
<br>
interdependent and each component needs to be thought of in terms of its
<br>
relationship with the others.  In the case of Cyc, abstract  declarative
<br>
knowledge and crisp inference on such knowledge was thought of basically in
<br>
isolation from all other aspects of mind, which seems to have resulted in a
<br>
knowledge base that is at best highly awkward to integrate into a coherent
<br>
overall mind-framework.  I think this is the reason why not much practical
<br>
use has resulted from Cyc so far -- rather than the reason being that Cyc
<br>
hasn't yet reached some magical &quot;critical size.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, it *may* be possible, through carefully writing scripts and doing
<br>
probabilistic inference and using other tricks, to transform Cyc via a
<br>
sophisticated batch process into a mutant-Cyc that uses a different
<br>
representational style that is more compatible with integration  into a
<br>
coherent mind-framework.  I thought about this a bit 6 months ago and
<br>
haven't returned to the notion for a while.
<br>
<p>[A note for those not familiar with Novamente: unlike Cyc, my own AI system
<br>
Novamente is not fundamentally based on formal-language knowledge encoding.
<br>
However, Novamente is capable of making use of formal language knowledge
<br>
encoding, as an augmentation to its experience-based and linguistics-based
<br>
learning processes.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are AI projects based on probabilistic  learning working towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge richness, and alternatively there is Cyc, based upon first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving commonsense knowledge richness (e.g. recently we added a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated temporal reasoner) including how-to knowledge, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working towards self-improvement and probabilistic learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The beauty of our approach is that knowledge base improvement is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtuous circle attracting sponsors.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... Well, I see the beauty of this *economically* as a business model
<br>
focused on securing ongoing government funding, much more so than the beauty
<br>
in terms of achieving AGI... ;-)
