<p>
<em>&gt; I'd be surprised if AGI is developed in less than 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.  I'm looking at a 50 year time-frame actually.
</em><br>
<p>Hm.... I had a long argument about this with my girlfriend (who is also
<br>
a Novamente programmer/scientist), a couple weeks ago.
<br>
<p>She at first argued for a 30-40 year timeframe, whereas I argued for
<br>
5-10
<br>
<p>She agreed that my estimate was possible if things went reasonably
<br>
smoothly with the rest of implementing, testing and teaching Novamente
<br>
-- and IF, sometime in the next couple years, enough funding is obtained
<br>
for 5-7 of us to spend full-time on nothing but Novamente AGI.
<br>
<p>However, her point was that things don't usually go reasonably smoothly,
<br>
that there will likely be a long series of errors and corrections, even
<br>
if the underlying ideas are correct.  
<br>
<p>In the end she agreed that 8-10 years was plausible and 15 years was
<br>
fairly likely -- assuming the focused team of 5-7 people really has
<br>
total focus on the project, and assuming hardware continues to advance
<br>
as projected, making the running of multiple simultaneous complex tests
<br>
more feasible than it is today.  (We have the right 5-7 people, but
<br>
they're mostly working on commercial apps of the NM codebase.)
<br>
<p>Of course, our conversation assumed that the general Novamente approach
<br>
makes sense ;-)  ... But the points made also follow if there is some
<br>
other sensible approach at a roughly comparable level of development...
<br>
<p>I still believe that 5 years from now or even 3 years from now is not
<br>
absurd to think about.  But we certainly have no chance of getting there
<br>
that fast with Novamente, given the current situation of only part-time
<br>
attention to the AGI potential of the Novamente software system.
<br>
