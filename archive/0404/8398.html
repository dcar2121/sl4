At a conference the other day in Barcelona, Ken said:
<br>
<p><a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/">http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/</a>
<br>
<p>Is it possible for human personalities to be recreated in computer systems? 
<br>
Personally, I doubt it. To create a software model of the brain and its 
<br>
body and environment is difficult enough even in principle, let alone in 
<br>
any foreseeable practice. To enable that programme to run, to iterate, to 
<br>
take even one step, is a difficulty of a far greater order. Perhaps I'm 
<br>
just being stubborn, but I remain unconvinced that it's possible at all. To 
<br>
claim that human personalites, with real continuity with those they've been 
<br>
copied from, can exist in a virtual environment raises philosophical 
<br>
questions far deeper than most stories on the subject even consider, and 
<br>
far too deep for me to go into here.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, I think it's worthwhile and legitimate to write science 
<br>
fiction stories that assume it is possible, as I've done in The Stone Canal 
<br>
and elsewhere. As the American SF writer Kim Stanley Robinson points out in 
<br>
this context, science fiction provides us with metaphors for the mundane, 
<br>
and for the changes in our daily lives. When aviation was changing the 
<br>
world, science fiction wrote about space travel. When space travel was not 
<br>
changing the world, and medicine and drugs were, science fiction wrote 
<br>
about Inner Space. When computers were changing the labour process in 
<br>
factories and offices, science fiction wrote about cyberspace. Now that 
<br>
much of our work and leisure and relationships are mediated by computer 
<br>
networks, and much our lives lived online, science fiction talks about 
<br>
'uploading' human personalities into virtual reality. It's a metaphor for 
<br>
what has already happened. In emails and newsgroups, websites and weblogs, 
<br>
many of us - deliberately or otherwise - project an 'online persona' which 
<br>
has a far from simple relationship with our actual selves. How many of us 
<br>
have had the experience of meeting someone we have come to know online and 
<br>
found them quite surprisingly different from the person we had imagined? As 
<br>
used to be said back in the early nineties, on the Internet nobody knows 
<br>
you're a dog.
<br>
<p>But it's not simply a question of dissembling, of faking an identity, of 
<br>
anonymity or pseudonymity. To the extent that it has real effects, on other 
<br>
people and on the world, your online persona is your real self. You are 
<br>
responsible for it. There is no evading that. And these effects can be 
<br>
serious, can be very much 'part of the real world'. We're often reminded of 
<br>
the dark side of this, in fraud and entrapment and so forth, but we should 
<br>
also remember the bright side. Think of Salam Pax, the famous 'Baghdad 
<br>
Blogger'. As a young gay man in Iraq, he was able to use the Internet to 
<br>
both conceal his personal identity, and to reveal it, to come out before 
<br>
thousands and thousands of readers - and to affect quite profoundly the way 
<br>
in which many people saw the war. Here for the first time was somebody 
<br>
writing, almost intimately, in real time, to people in the attacking 
<br>
countries as the bombers took off from England and he - and we - could 
<br>
count the hours until they arrived, and worry when his messages stopped. 
<br>
Think of how emails and newsgroup messages directly affected how people 
<br>
outside the United States experienced the September 11 attacks and their 
<br>
consequences - many them anxiously seeking news of people they had never 
<br>
met in person, only online, but who were their friends or acquaintances 
<br>
nonetheless.
<br>
<p>On the other side of the screen, so to speak, the Internet has changed many 
<br>
people's very personalities and identities - 'identity' this time meaning 
<br>
how they see themselves, and what they identify with. Again, we are often 
<br>
reminded of the dark side - of how people with warped and anti-social 
<br>
characters, ideas and impulses can find each other. But here, as in the 
<br>
real world, misanthropy is misguided. As the English historian Henry Thomas 
<br>
Buckle said, acts of virtue must far outnumber acts of vice, or humanity 
<br>
would long ago have perished. There are online communities of evil or 
<br>
disturbed people, for sure. But they are far outnumbered by the online 
<br>
communities of good people, whose interests are innocent. If you're 
<br>
innocent and isolated, discovering that you're not alone is an immense 
<br>
relief and can be the beginning of liberation. Minorities - sexual and 
<br>
political, religious and anti-religious, intellectual and artistic - can 
<br>
share their interests and legitimise themselves in their own eyes and those 
<br>
of the rest of the world. Not all of this is good, but most of it is.
<br>
<p>Even the science-fiction idea of electronic immortality for digitized 
<br>
personalities is a metaphor for real life. We can't be sure, but we may 
<br>
suspect, that everything sent across the Internet is stored somewhere. Our 
<br>
newsgroup postings are now permanently archived in public, there to 
<br>
entertain or embarrass us for the rest of our lives. Perhaps the dark 
<br>
archives of the security services hold all our private messages, and 
<br>
represent the only immortality most of us will ever have. Who knows what 
<br>
intelligences, human or artificial, will in some distant future study these 
<br>
scraps of our souls as we study cave-paintings and bone-carvings, and 
<br>
wonder about the strange people who created them, back in the dawn?
