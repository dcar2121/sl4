<em>&gt; May be, but I project MASSIVE white-collar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployment and social disruption on the way,
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; At some point an economic crisis will result from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few people actually being able to earn money to buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder whether this economic disruption is going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere with AGI development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
We've gone from 90% farmers to 2% farmers since
<br>
the industrial revolution, and 33% manufacturing
<br>
employment in 1950 to 11% today.  Lately the
<br>
fastest growing sectors of personal consumption
<br>
have been medical care and recreation.  So the
<br>
issue isn't whether a massive shift in occupation
<br>
can be handled.  That's been done several times
<br>
already.  The issue is whether the shift in
<br>
employment patterns will be too fast for society
<br>
to adapt.
<br>
<p>If we get to the rioting in the streets level
<br>
again (the mid 1960s was the last time in this
<br>
country), I would expect another 'War on Poverty',
<br>
that would address the problem by taxing the
<br>
well off to placate the not so well off.  I
<br>
would also expect actions like reductions in the
<br>
standard work week, job sharing, etc. to spread
<br>
the available jobs more evenly.
<br>
<p>I also think the assumption that you need a job
<br>
to earn money to buy stuff may become invalid in
<br>
a high-automation society.  In my area (N. Alabama)
<br>
it is common to have customer-owned electric
<br>
cooperatives to provide electricity.  I can
<br>
imagine customer-owned 'stuff' factories, where
<br>
the customers pitch in some work time for the
<br>
non-automated tasks, and get a share of the
<br>
output.
<br>
<p>Our present social structure comes from the fact
<br>
that everyone is better off if people specialize
<br>
in one task each, then trade for the other stuff
<br>
they need.  But if productivity gets high enough,
<br>
then small groups or individuals can be productive
<br>
enough to live decently without external trade.
<br>
In that case you don't need a conventional job.
<br>
<p>So, the unanswered question is whether the rate
<br>
of job shifts caused by technology, offshoring, etc.
<br>
will outpace the rate of absorbtion by job
<br>
growth in new fields, by political action to
<br>
redistribute things, and by developing other ways
<br>
of getting by besides the traditional wage type
<br>
job.
