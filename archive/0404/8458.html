<p><p>The development of Strong AI brings out the control freak in most

technology like AI means that the person who wins the race is likely 
<br>
the person who managed to avoid the controls.
<br>
<p>IMO, one shouldn't spend too much time dwelling on who develops it 
<br>
first.  Not only will you have little control over it, but it probably 
<br>
won't have *that* big of an impact on the final outcome.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; IMHO, the best way to guarantee this being the case is by assuring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency of the research efforts coupled with independent 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Nope, definitely not.  Nothing ever progressed well or fast with 
<br>
bureaucratic oversight of any type.
<br>
<p>All this transparency and oversight means is that some other private or 
<br>
governmental organization will run with the technology ball while the 
<br>
developing research organization is burning time and resources dealing 
<br>
with bureaucracy.
<br>
<p>To a certain extent, whoever gets there first wins.  Period.  Anything 
<br>
that hinders the process and lets others tinker with the internals 
<br>
creates an opportunity for other private organizations to quietly 
<br>
emerge which have no such hinderances.  Worse, there is a LOT of 
<br>
motivation for people involved in both the oversight AND primary 
<br>
research team to defect in this manner, and the likely motivations of 
<br>
the defectors would make them precisely the people you don't want doing 
<br>
this.  Bad, bad, bad.
<br>
<p>The best bet is probably relatively secretive private research.  It 
<br>
minimizes the pool of defectors and minimizes the risk of defection to 
<br>
the extent that such risks can be minimized.  Outside individuals won't 
<br>
have much input on the process, but then I see very little good that 
<br>
can come of that unless one takes an improbably optimistic perspective.
