<em>&gt; The other issues are that Eliezer doesn't have a lot of time and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively little actual coding or architecture experience. You may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to write a million words and throw them away to be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writer, but you certainly need to write a million lines of code and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throw them away to be an excellent programmer.
</em><br>
<p><p>In general, I think the importance of this is often underestimated.  A
<br>
great many things that sound simple in computer science in theory are
<br>
very difficult to implement well in practice on real systems with real
<br>
limits and real asymmetries.  Elegant theoretical models often run into
<br>
the barrier of not having a useful elegant implementation in practice
<br>
for anything but toys.
<br>
<p>One can easily spend more than a decade steeped in algorithms and code
<br>
and still be discovering new deep patterns in that allow tractable and
<br>
elegant software implementation.  And there is little substitute for
<br>
jumping in and getting one's hands dirty.  There are a great many things
<br>
I can design today that I could not have designed even five years ago,
<br>
despite having a ton of real-world experience at the time.  You never
<br>
know just how many important things you don't know until you actually
<br>
have to do them.  Software system design is very hard to do right and do
<br>
well, and the real trick is knowing the patterns of how theory
<br>
translates into implementation, which is typically non-obvious.
<br>
<p>I would go as far as to say that even if someone came up with a complete
<br>
theoretical and mathematical model for AGI, they could not design an
<br>
implementation unless they had a strong background in software systems
<br>
implementation.  In theory this shouldn't be the case, but in practice
<br>
there is because the theory maps poorly to real world machines in a
<br>
great many respects.
