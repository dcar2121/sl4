<p><p>Yeah, I meant &quot;secretive&quot; in the sense that any business with trade

secrets is, not in the sense of &quot;a lone nut in a bunker&quot;.  I 
<br>
communicated that poorly.
<br>
<p>A relatively small, closely-held, non-public organization is probably a 
<br>
better description of what I had in mind.

<p><p><em>&gt; About private vs. governmental -- this really isn't a key point.  The

</em><br>
<p><p>I would argue that the government is only ever an effective catalyst 
<br>
when a specific line of research requires inordinate amounts capital 
<br>
AND needs to be accomplished in a short time frame.  The Manhattan 
<br>
project is an example of this, as was early space flight.  In almost 
<br>
all other cases, private industry sprints ahead and one can argue to 
<br>
what extent it would have happened with or without the government 
<br>
trying to involve itself.
<br>
<p>If the government decided tomorrow that they absolutely, positively had 
<br>
to have fully functional AGI in the next five years, you would see 
<br>
remarkable things happen in a relatively short period of time.  If you 
<br>
extend that to ten years, you end up with an organization that gets 
<br>
strangled by bureaucratic kudzu before it even gets started.  It is the 
<br>
nature of the thing.
<br>
<p>The thing is, I don't see the US government (or most others for that 
<br>
matter) being sufficiently motivated in a results-oriented way to 
<br>
execute a Manhattan Project type AGI endeavor.  A big part of the 
<br>
problem is that it is hard to define an indisputable concrete need for 
<br>
the result of such a project that the government can put its weight 
<br>
behind -- the use of such a thing for the government is nebulous at 
<br>
best and nefarious at worst -- except for perhaps inside the larger 
<br>
Department of Defense (which I doubt most people want).  Manhattan 
<br>
Projects don't materialize out of thin air, they are the result of the 
<br>
government feeling intense external pressure.
