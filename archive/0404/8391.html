News from FutureHi.net:
<br>
<p>According to the worlds leading experts in artificial intelligence, the 
<br>
singularity is scheduled to occur today at approximately 5:45pm PST.  They 
<br>
are recommending that everyone get their affairs in order quickly, and only 
<br>
pack  those items they'll need to get them thru until the Singularity has 
<br>
uplifted everyone, which should occur shortly after 5:45pm.
<br>
<p>According to Dr. Beeblebrox over at the Self-Augmenting Intelligence 
<br>
Institute, a Yudkowsky Seed AI was initiated at 11:59pm PST last night at 
<br>
the Institutes ultra-secure research facility in Palo Alto.  The 
<br>
super-secure quarantine conditions of the facility was not to keep people 
<br>
out, but to keep the seed-AI in.  However, according to intermet security 
<br>
experts, the seed AI unintentionally escaped through its triple firewall, 
<br>
and has already compromised 80% of the worlds connected computers.  How it 
<br>
was able to go from an isolated system to the larger internet remains 
<br>
unknown.
<br>
<p>The 3:45 timeframe of the singularity is an estimate based on the Institutes 
<br>
previous simulations.  They expect chaos to insue for the remainder of the 
<br>
day, but not to worry, as the benevolent seed-AI should come to the rescue 
<br>
before things get too out of hand. This is assuming of course that every 
<br>
single line of code in the seed AI is perfect, and that their benevolent 
<br>
algorithms were coded accurately. Only time will tell.
<br>
<p>In other news,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html">http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html</a>
<br>
<p>Google announced it is interviewing candidates for engineering positions at 
<br>
their lunar hosting and research center, opening late in the spring of 2007.
<br>
<p>However, now that the singularity is imminent, Google has said it is 
<br>
suspending any hiring and economic expansion until this whole &quot;singularity 
<br>
thing&quot; is sorted out.
<br>
<p>UPDATE: Due to overwheming demand, the Singularity will be delayed by one 
<br>
hour, so that those wanting to finishing watching the latest Buffy episode 
<br>
can do so.
