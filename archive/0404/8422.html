</em><br>
<p>;-)
<br>
<p>Well, this does not surprise me at all.
<br>
<p>I think that documents on the level of CFAI and LOGI are important and
<br>
necessary, but that they need to come along with more formal, detailed
<br>
and precise documents.  There are a lot of ideas that *look* sensible on
<br>
the abstract conceptual level of CFAI/LOGI, but don't actually
<br>
correspond to any sensible detailed design.  And then, one level down,
<br>
there are a lot of ideas that look sensible on both the conceptual level
<br>
and the detailed-design level, but don't actually work for reasons that
<br>
are only seen in the course of experimenting with the implementation of
<br>
the design.  (The only way to avoid this latter problem is to do a full
<br>
formal, mathematical analysis of one's detailed design, but I doubt that
<br>
is possible.)
<br>
<p>In the case of Novamente we have a conceptual picture and a fairly
<br>
detailed design (which still has some gaps at the low-to-intermediate
<br>
level of precision), and a working codebase implementing some of the
<br>
design --- but we understand that we *still* may get taught some
<br>
unwelcome lessons during further implementation and experimentation...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that CFAI etc provide (dangerously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outdated and flawed) principles but not a HOW TO. 
</em><br>
<p>My worry is that, even if the successor to CFAI provides Friendliness
<br>
principles that are not obviously flawed on the *conceptual* level,
<br>
they'll still fall apart in the experimental phase.
<br>
<p>Thus my oft-repeated statement that the true theory of Friendliness will
<br>
be arrived at only:
<br>
<p>A) by experimentation with fairly smart AGI's that can modify themselves
<br>
to a limited degree
<br>
<p>B) by the development of a very strong mathematical theory of
<br>
self-modifying AGI's and their behavior in uncertain environments
<br>
<p>My opinion is that we will NOT be able to do B within the next few
<br>
decades, because the math is just too hard.
<br>
<p>However, A is obviously pretty dangerous from a Friendliness
<br>
perspective.
<br>
<p>My best guess of the correct path is a combination of A and B, in which
<br>
one builds
<br>
<p>A) a collection of sub-human-level self-modifying AI's, with strict
<br>
limits on the ways they can self-modify and careful observation
<br>
<p>B) a smart non-self-modifying AI which is customized for data analysis
<br>
and automated theorem-proving, with a modicum of general intelligence as
<br>
well
<br>
<p>One then uses B to help one model A, and obtain a high-quality theory of
<br>
the dynamics of AGI's under self-modification.  This theory then tells
<br>
one how to proceed next.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It looks like Eliezer is in fact making good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress towards a scientifically well justified and feasible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to engineer constructive theory. I look forward to his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publication of the details. 
</em><br>
<p>I guess we all do ;-)
