Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Essentially, a shaper network requires a workable, learnable, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason-able representation of abstract content, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows abstract 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bits of uncertain knowledge to interact with each other, to modify 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; each other, to spawn actions, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unsurprisingly that sounds like an agent-based active memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation, which is too general and powerful a system to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to say much from that one sentence description. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes of course, that description covers a lot of possible things!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started with a classic probabilistic inference network in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which inconsistencies were removed by heuristic repair (I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried various approaches); the repair heuristics are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles for reasoning about the morals (this layering can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be repeated indefinitely). I then started modelling cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressures to allow context-sensitive biasing of the general 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness function (FARGish I know), and when that wasn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flexible enough tried adding inference heuristics to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited amounts of production-system-esque network extension 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an alternative method of improving happiness. If I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling kind I might describe this sort of messing about as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'open-ended experimentalism'; if not 'poorly thought out hack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and patch session' might be more appropriate.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're certainly grappling with the right issues here.
<br>
<p>The Probabilistic Term Logic framework, used in Novamente, attempts to
<br>
address the issues you describe (and other) in a more principled and
<br>
systematic way.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are several interesting ways to combine Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference and directed evolution, but most of them have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility tree (goal system) risks in a utilitarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LOGI/CFAI-derived AGI. I hate to think what they'd do in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that doesn't have a conceptually unified utility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function; I've heard rumours on the grapevine that you've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been revising Novamente to have a more conventional goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system and I sincerely hope they're correct.
</em><br>
<p><p>Hmmm... Is there a &quot;conventional goal system&quot;???  A convention according
<br>
to whom?  There are no conventions in AGI yet!!
<br>
<p>The Novamente architecture in itself is pretty flexible; it could work
<br>
with a lot of different goal system architectures.
<br>
<p>However, I revised the NM design last year so that the &quot;attention
<br>
allocation&quot; subsystem (not yet implemented except in a simplistic form)
<br>
will operate based on the probabilistic inference module rather than
<br>
(like before) using neural net like heuristics.  This makes the system's
<br>
behavior a little more predictable in some ways, hence increasing the
<br>
odds of goal-system stability, and increasing the tractability of
<br>
STUDYING the issue of goal-system stability in the system.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But my point is that Eli's architecture gives a grand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall picture, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but doesn't actually give a workable and *learnable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modifiable* way to represent complex knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The constructive details are what the Flare project was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on. 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, Flare is a programming language, which might  make
<br>
implementing Eli's AI designs easier, but seems to me to have little to
<br>
do with the details of those designs.  You could program an expert
<br>
system or a neural net in Flare, for example...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In the end she agreed that 8-10 years was plausible and 15 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fairly likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really think it's possible to make that sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prediction without a deep knowledge of performance of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candidate architectures on all the relevant cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competence hurdles?
</em><br>
<p>Well what's possible is to estimate the time required for success
<br>
CONDITIONAL on the assumption that some reasonably-close relative of the
<br>
current NM design will bring us success.  If you remove this
<br>
conditionality then estimation becomes total kurzweilian extrapolatory
<br>
guesswork...
<br>
<p>Given how much of the NM design is unimplemented, and given the
<br>
trickiness we've found in implementing and tweaking earlier parts, we
<br>
can set a LOWER BOUND at 2-3 years.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the NM design is not THAT big, and every possible way
<br>
of tweaking it will be explorable in a 10-15 year period.  So if it
<br>
really can't be made to yield true AGI in that time period, then almost
<br>
surely the design is badly inadequate.
<br>
<p>In practice, if the NM design doesn't start yielding true-AGI-ish
<br>
results after 2-3 years of serious pure-AGI research effort [as opposed
<br>
to the current part-time-focus on AGI], I will strongly consider whether
<br>
the framework is badly inadequate, and will start thinking about
<br>
alternatives (like Hebbian Logic Networks, a speculative and still
<br>
poorly fleshed out neural net based design I conceived).  But of course
<br>
I'm betting NM will work ;-)
