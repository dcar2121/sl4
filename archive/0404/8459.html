<p>
James,
<br>
<p>I partly agree with you, but not entirely.  
<br>
<p>About secrecy... One thing you miss by being highly secretive is the
<br>
ability to easily draw brilliant new minds into your project.  AGI is
<br>
not a problem that lends itself to a LARGE team, but it is a problem
<br>
that lends itself to a team consisting of a number of highly intelligent
<br>
and insightful people, all working together, and with different &quot;angles&quot;
<br>
and insights.  There have been a couple really great additions to the
<br>
Novamente team that would not have been made if we were more secretive.
<br>
Even though I think the NM design is basically sound, there are still a
<br>
lot of details to be worked out, and it's valuable to attract the best
<br>
possible people to help with this process.  In reality this can be done
<br>
better via NOT being totally secretive, than by drawing only one one's
<br>
personal circle of acquaintances (though at any given time my personal
<br>
circle does contain a lot of really clever people...).
<br>
<p>About private vs. governmental -- this really isn't a key point.  The
<br>
government, at times, is capable of funding research in a way that gives
<br>
control to the scientists and doesn't weight them down with bureaucratic
<br>
nonsense.  The Manhattan Project is one example.  The Human Genome
<br>
Project is an example where the government's open process succeeded
<br>
pretty damn well, even though Celera Genomics' parallel private process
<br>
arguably succeeded a little better (in terms of development speed, and
<br>
accuracy of results).  In the case of the Manhattan Project, the
<br>
government was spurred to efficiency via desperation; in the Human
<br>
Genome Project, it was spurred to efficiency largely by the presence of
<br>
Celera as a competitor.
<br>
<p>-- Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The best bet is probably relatively secretive private research.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimizes the pool of defectors and minimizes the risk of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defection to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extent that such risks can be minimized.  Outside 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals won't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have much input on the process, but then I see very little good that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can come of that unless one takes an improbably optimistic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.
