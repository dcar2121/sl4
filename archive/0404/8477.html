<p><p>Absolutely.  Russia was on my short list of likely contenders.

<p>IMO, the countries with the clearly top notch engineering cultures 
<br>
required to pull this type of thing off are:   Germany, Japan, USA, 
<br>
Russia, UK, and perhaps Scandinavia.
<br>
<p>Other possibles are countries like Australia/New Zealand and Israel 
<br>
which are capable but suffer from relatively small populations, 
<br>
lowering the probabilities that it will come from there.
<br>
<p>That isn't to say that AI couldn't happen elsewhere, but it would be 
<br>
very hard to acquire the talent in one place to have a fair chance to 
<br>
pull it off.  One of the things that makes Silicon Valley what it is, 
<br>
is that there is a seemingly bottomless pool of highly competent and 
<br>
specialized science/engineering talent here.  I have had the problem of 
<br>
being in other parts of even the US, and not being able to find a 
<br>
person with the required engineering skills to do a job.  This kind of 
<br>
availability will invariably impact any major AGI project, as 
<br>
implementation will be a multi-disciplinary effort and requiring many 
<br>
things to be very well designed.
<br>
<p>Regardless of the country of origin of whoever develops the theory, I 
<br>
expect the implementation to actually occur in one of the major 
<br>
countries listed above as a practical matter.  Theory and abstract 
<br>
design does not require a significant engineering footprint and could 
<br>
be done almost anywhere, at least in theory.
