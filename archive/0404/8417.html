Given the amount of directed evolution cheerleading going on, here is a
<br>
follow-up to my previous excerpt. I've been there, yes it looks good to start
<br>
with, yes you think you can control it, no you really can't. Reply
<br>
to Ben's comments at the end.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>An AGI-relevant example of this is emergent competition between
<br>
representational paradigms in the human brain. Concept frameworks and
<br>
belief systems gain strength as they are used to form more concepts; the
<br>
more extensive and useful-seeming the paradigm, the quicker we are to
<br>
represent new information in that mold (strengthening the source
<br>
paradigm). As with generalised meme competition, representational systems
<br>
can leverage general intelligence to supress rivals and build defences
<br>
against competitors. This is usually but not always adaptive for the host
<br>
intelligence; how much of our tendency towards closed-mindedness and
<br>
strong cognitive disonance is genetic adaptation and how much of it is
<br>
internal conflict between self-reproducing neural patterns, or
<br>
meta-patterns?
<br>
<p>Since genes survive the host and until very recently neural patterns
<br>
didn't, genes used to keep on top of the situtation by manipulating the
<br>
neural substrate to maximise the benefits and minimise the penalties
<br>
(more gene-directed DE). However the invention of language and rise of
<br>
memetic (cultural) evolution has obsoleted these mechanisms. As well as
<br>
engaging in unadaptive behaviour (like spending all day every day holding
<br>
a sign saying 'Sinners Repent!') as a result of memes trying to infect 
<br>
other hosts and defend their own hosts, we /also/ get the fallout from
<br>
memetic competition within our own brains. As with extrahost competition,
<br>
memes have adapted to exploit all of our evolved brainware to gain an
<br>
advantage over rivals in the fight to control the brain.
<br>
<p>There are even parallels of body/cell and cell/chromosome interlevel
<br>
competition; meme complexes have to resist being weakened by mutinities
<br>
of their constituent selfish memes and taking over more of one host's
<br>
brain might actually reduce the chances of spreading to other hosts (not
<br>
least due to genetic level defences against rampantly parasitic memes; we
<br>
have an instinctive dislike for monomaniacs). Fortunately for our sanity
<br>
co-operative effects dominate here to the same extent that they do when
<br>
genes build cells and cells build bodies; meme complexes within the
<br>
K-line plane of Minsky's society of mind have ample opportunities for
<br>
non-zero-sum interactions. When this results in adaptive behaviour we call
<br>
it synthesis and cross-fertilisation of ideas (spot the unintentionally
<br>
apt reproductive metaphor); when unadaptive memes scramble [1] for every
<br>
possible source of support to try and survive we call it rationalisation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a (naieve) humanistic viewpoint the situation just keeps getting
</em><br>
worse; not only are we robots hardwired by our genes to replicate them at
<br>
all costs, our software consists of a collection of viruses and worms
<br>
downloaded from the social network (which combines peer-to-peer and
<br>
client/server dynamics; Slashdot your local priest today!) and our
<br>
central processors are running a complex version of Core Wars [2]. It
<br>
should be obvious by now AGIs that replicate even part of this mess are
<br>
Unsafe By Definition. Bayesian AGIs that prevent this resource-wasting
<br>
memetic competition (strict utilitarianism is both an optimal fitness
<br>
function, a superior design strategy and with pervasive causal validation
<br>
the recursive version of memory protection) are not only much safer,
<br>
they're more efficient too. The moral of the story is to check your
<br>
proposed cognitive dynamics very carefully; emergence is insidious,
<br>
difficult to spot and (without recursive causal validation) regenerative
<br>
as system complexity increases.
<br>
<p>Eliezer nearly destroyed the world by rouding up thousands of half-bright
<br>
monkeys, pointing them in the right general direction and setting them to
<br>
the task of typing out AGI source. I was on the path to destruction (no
<br>
pun intended) when I started implementing a cognitive supersystem with
<br>
multilayer Bayesian directed evolution several orders of magnitude more
<br>
complex than any existing genetic algorithms and more efficient than
<br>
anything in nature (I was a half-bright moneky, but I got better [3]).
<br>
Hopefully there will be humans or human-derived intelligences left after
<br>
the Singularity to forgive us.
<br>
<p>[1] These days I like to open discussions with religious types with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line 'Please allow me to euthanise your unadaptive meme complex...'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result I waste a lot less time talking to religious people ;&gt;
<br>
<p>[2] Core Wars is a fight for survival between machine code programs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;running on a simulated OS with no (or optionally very little) memory
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection. It is the ultimate test of viral coding ability; see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.koth.org">http://www.koth.org</a> . As a student I proposed but never implemented
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Network Core Wars, with tens to hundreds of compute nodes in a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulated network with corruptible routers (cynics might suggest that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to play the real thing instead :).
<br>
<p>[3] I would like to stress that subjunctive planet kill is /not/ a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prerequisite for being a SIAI seed AI programmer. Two negative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examples are quite enough; anyone who reads this and still does
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something potentially terminal for the species is definitely trying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to disqualify themselves, not to mention kill everyone. After all,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third time unlucky.
<br>
<p>[4] Yet another example of genes exploiting directed evolution at a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate level of organisation; the dynamics of the human immune
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system. As Ridly points out 'The whole system is beautifully designed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that the self-interested ambitions of each cell can only be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfied by the cell doing its duty for the body... It is as if our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood were full of Boy Scouts running around looking for invaders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because each time they found one they were rewarded with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chocolate.' DE can be used safely and effectively, but in AGI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contexts this only works if you know exactly what you are doing; in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vast majority of cases it is much more likely that you merely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think you know what you are doing.

</em><br>
<p>Recent history; I attempted to implement a prototype of LOGI and CFAI over
<br>
the November -&gt; February period this year. In the process I discovered just
<br>
how vauge the two documents were; I had to fill in a lot of details myself
<br>
in order to produce a constructive account that would server as a blueprint.
<br>
I agree that CFAI etc provide (dangerously outdated and flawed) principles
<br>
but not a HOW TO. I have decided to suppress publication of my results and
<br>
commentary for the time being, but it was certainly a highly informative,
<br>
not to mention hair-raising experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concepts outlined in his writings do NOT constitute &quot;engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions&quot; according to any recognizable interpretation of this term!
</em><br>
<p>I agree. This personal assessment is based on extended personal
<br>
conversations, with a limited input from SL4 and Wiki posts that need the
<br>
right context to be interpreted correctly. It looks like Eliezer is in fact
<br>
making good progress towards a scientifically well justified and feasible to
<br>
engineer constructive theory. I look forward to his publication of the
<br>
details. In the mean time I have been learning Friendliness and broadening
<br>
my knowledge of AGI theory as fast as I can.
