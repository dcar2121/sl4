Hi Marc,
<br>
<p>I have some comments about AGI and mathematical reasoning, and also
<br>
about fundraising strategy for your project.
<br>
<p>About AGI and mathematical reasoning...
<br>
<p>I have long been interested in using the Mizar corpus (www.mizar.org) as
<br>
a resource for helping teach AGI's  mathematics.
<br>
<p>Mizar is a knowledge base that consists of a large amount of
<br>
mathematical knowledge, encoded in a purely formal language.  (Comparing
<br>
Mizar articles with typical mathematics research papers is very
<br>
instructive in terms of how *informal* typical mathematical discourse
<br>
is.)
<br>
<p>However, the formal language of Mizar is large and complicated; a first
<br>
step would be merely to translate Mizar into a simpler formal language,
<br>
such as some kind of variant of predicate calculus.  (Note: My own AI
<br>
system, Novamente, does not use predicate calculus or anything terribly
<br>
similar, but, predicate calculus is commonly understood, and it's simple
<br>
enough that converting predicate calculus into Novamente node-and-link
<br>
structures or pretty much anything else isn't a big trick.)
<br>
<p>The purpose of translating Mizar into a simpler formalism is that one
<br>
can then feed Mizar -- this vast corpus of mathematical reasoning --
<br>
into one's AI system, and allow one's AI system to learn how
<br>
mathematical reasoning has been done in many past cases.  The  main
<br>
point isn't the *theorems* per se, it's the *proof patterns*, both
<br>
low-level and abstract.
<br>
<p>At any rate, this is my best bet regarding how to get an AI system to do
<br>
mathematics really well.  
<br>
<p>The alternative to a Mizar-based approach, in my opinion, is to begin
<br>
not with mathematics but with *natural language processing*, so that the
<br>
AI system can be taught mathematics by humans.
<br>
<p>Without Mizar (or something similar) or NLP, you're asking an AI system
<br>
to learn mathematics by all by itself, and that's very very hard.  By
<br>
&quot;learn mathematics&quot; here, I mean &quot;learn the subtle patterns of
<br>
demonstration and hypothesis that characterize creative mathematical
<br>
thinking&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, about fundraising. 
<br>
<p>My guess is that you'll have a better chance at raising the funds you
<br>
want if you can first demonstrate some notable success at a simpler
<br>
mathematical theorem-proving task.  The Riemann Hypothesis is a big
<br>
goal, obviously.
<br>
<p>The current state of mathematical theorem-provers is not very
<br>
impressive, so if you have a genuinely innovative and high-quality AGI
<br>
design with a theorem-proving orientation, it shouldn't be sooooo hard
<br>
to beat the state of the art.  Current theorem-provers really only
<br>
perform adequately when given continual human guidance regarding the
<br>
choice of which &quot;proof path&quot; to take.
<br>
<p>In the Mizar-based approach, mentioned above, it would probably be
<br>
fairly simple to make unprecedented progress in mathematical
<br>
theorem-proving just by loading Mizar into a reasonably robust
<br>
AGI-oriented architecture and letting it lern some proof-patterns, and
<br>
setting it loose to prove theorems in a relatively compactly
<br>
formalizable domain like set theory or topology.
<br>
<p>Without demonstrable preliminary results, my guess is that in order to
<br>
raise funding you'll need to get someone with some record of success in
<br>
automated theorem-proving involved.  Unfortunately, everyone I know in
<br>
that community is rather conservative in orientation and would be
<br>
unlikely to get involved in a project they viewed as highly speculative.
<br>
But perhaps my constacts are not representative of that community!
<br>
<p>Best of luck!
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: I'm making my move! A new AGI Project is born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm posting a brief outline: this is a sketch of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm thinking of putting on the web-site when I get one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.  Hopefully I can get this thing off the ground. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm the new player on the block in the race for AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm making a big power play!  ;)  Watch the sl4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list for further news.  Meantime comments or private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e-mails are welcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Riemann Artificial Intelligence Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mission Statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Riemann Artificial Intelligence Institute aims to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research artificial general intelligence, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis on developing software capable of reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about mathematics.  The long-term goal is to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true artificial general intelligence in a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True AGI would be AI with a general capacity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning exceeding that of a human.  Smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human intelligence could help solve problems and make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthroughs which would enormously improve the quality of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life for humanity.  Such a thing is regarded as possible by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts because our best current scientific theories indicate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is a sensible proposition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The shorter-term goals are to develop software which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can assist in solving problems in mathematics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significance and propriety value.  The purpose of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shorter-term goals is to try to ensure results of definite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value to society and to secure sufficient on-going interest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and funding to achieve the long term goal.  Since mathematics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the language of science, there is also the possibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that software capable of reasoning about mathematics will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful for artificial general intelligence research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The specific mathematical problem initially selected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be attempted was 'The Riemann Hypothesis' (Named
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the great German mathematician Berhard Riemann).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Not only is this the most famous unsolved problem in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics, a cash prize of $US 1 million is currently being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute for its solution.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A solution to the Riemann Hypothesis could solve the deepest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystery of pure mathematics - the secret to the distribution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of prime numbers - and provide insights of great value to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics community.  It would also generate enormous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest and result in immediate financial reward to assist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with further research.  The reason for thinking that success 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a fair possibility is that some experts feel that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge has progressed to the point where a solution may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be far off, and the computer-assisted approach is one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has been neglected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plan and estimates:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Staff and budget:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Institute aims for 5 full-time paid team members,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each of which would have a salary of $US 20 000 per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year (Total annual cost of team salary:  $US 100 000).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This is obviously fairly low pay, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient.  One of the team members would double as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the director.  There could also be any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional part-time team members, but these would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be volunteers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Institute aims for a budget of an additional $US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 000 annually, in order to rent living space and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy equipment.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Total annual budget:  $US 200 000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is probably the minimum budget required for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full-time AGI project capable of getting anywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Time frames:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The shorter-term goals of creating software capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deep mathematical reasoning would be expected to begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yielding results within 2 years.  A solution to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific 'hard problem' selected (the Riemann
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis) could be to hand within 2-5 years. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initial software design related to the problem could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take around a year of full-time research by the team,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and another 1-4 years of coding and refinements.  Note
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that on a budget of $US 200 00 per year, 5 years work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to solve the Riemann hypothesis would cost $US 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million, which would be fully reimbursed upon payment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the prize offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The longer term goal of true general artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence in a computer system could take anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from 2-50 years of full-time work.  There are too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowns to be able to estimate a more precise time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frame with any confidence.  All one can really say is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that AGI will probably be achieved some time within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the next 50 years.  A 'consensus' guesstimate by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts is for AGI circa 2030.  The task is thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely monumental, speculative and truly long-term. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More modest (slight irony!) goals such as software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of assisting in finding solutions to hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical problems such as the Riemann Hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are needed for a realistic chance of shorter term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefulness.  The Institute will have achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something if it can contribute but a little towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the grand goal of AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute Background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Institute was born on 4th April, 2004.  Its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founder was Marc Geddes, Free-Lance Writer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanist and paid member of the WTA (World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanist Organization) since 2002.  Transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a rationalistic philosophy of the world advocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the responsible use of science, technology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical thinking to improve the human condition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute Status as of:  4th April, 2004
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; News of the Institute's founding was posted to the Sl4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Shock Level 4) Mailing List.  A dedicated web-site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not yet been created on the World-Wide-Web.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is being planned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Institute has no legal status.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only person working for the Institute is Marc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geddes.  He has begun research pertinent to Artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; General Intelligence, Pure Mathematics, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Riemann Hypothesis.  This work is currently only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part-time and unpaid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Institute currently has no funding or physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location.  Businessmen and philanthropists in New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zealand and Australia are being approached.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical location in Australia is preferred.          
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other AGI Projects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although 'Artificial intelligence' is a field which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now attracts large interest and a great deal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding around the world, circa 2004 there are few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects which have the aim of achieving true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial general intelligence in a computer system. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True AGI would be AI with a general capacity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning comparable to humans or better.  There are 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main dedicated players (the names of the founders are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in brackets):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity Institute (Eliezer Yudkowsky)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Artificial General Intelligence Institute (Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goerztel)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adaptive AI Inc. (Peter Voss) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Riemann A.I Institute strongly supports the work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the three named organizations.  A wealth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about the long-term promises and perils of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI is available on the Singularity Institute web-site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it is recommended that those interested in AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read the materials available there.  Where possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Riemann A.I Institute is prepared to donate funds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other support to these projects.
