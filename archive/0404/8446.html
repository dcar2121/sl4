<p><em>&gt; Neither document is a constructive account, as I

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why don't we take a different tact?  I suggest, and
<br>
have already informed Eli and Tyler, that a good way
<br>
to approach this going forward, would be to place a
<br>
high priority on *friendliness* design and public
<br>
relations.
<br>
<p>At the moment, the Singularity movement is ripe for
<br>
some serious misunderstanding in the public’s eye. 
<br>
Already most Transhumanists have some serious
<br>
reservations about the whole seed-AI concept.  Imagine
<br>
how magnified such misunderstanding will occur as
<br>
these ideas begin to percolate outside of our small
<br>
community.
<br>
<p>So far the main theme of the Singularity movement has
<br>
been towards creating a seed-AI with friendliness. 
<br>
Although ultimately creating the right kind of seed-AI
<br>
is our aim, wouldn't it behoove us to start a more
<br>
practical lets-built-it-now approach to engineering
<br>
friendliness into our intelligent systems as soon as
<br>
possible?
<br>
<p>What I'm talking about is a shift, a moderate change
<br>
in perspective, in theme and perspective, towards
<br>
friendliness being our main goal (for now).
<br>
<p>Starting with Friendly UI, moving on to:
<br>
<p>Friendly Avatar
<br>
Friendly Believable Intelligent Agents
<br>
Friendly Intelligent Agents
<br>
Friendly Human-like Intelligent Agents
<br>
Friendly Above-Human Like AI
<br>
<p>and finally, 
<br>
<p>Friendly Seed-AI.
<br>
<p><p>I think such a shift would also shift the dialog away
<br>
from the seed AI, and most everyone’s fears of a
<br>
premature seed-AI launch, and towards focusing on how
<br>
to start engineering friendliness into everything NOW.
<br>
<p>If we make friendliness our priority, then the
<br>
argument will be contained in the HOW, not the why, or
<br>
when, or if.
<br>
<p>Lets built friendliness into our increasingly
<br>
intelligent systems now, and lets start discussing how
<br>
to do this. There are thousands of researchers working
<br>
on making AI smarter, but not necessarily more
<br>
friendly.  This should be our call to arms, this
<br>
should be our mission, and this should be our goal.
<br>
Meanwhile, keep working on making the systems more
<br>
intelligent, but lets make friendliness are mission.
