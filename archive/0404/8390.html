I just came across this at
<br>
<p><a href="http://futurehi.net/">http://futurehi.net/</a>    :-)
<br>
<p>According to the worlds leading experts in artificial
<br>
intelligence, the singularity is scheduled to occur
<br>
today at approximately 5:45pm PST.  They are
<br>
recommending that everyone get their affairs in order
<br>
quickly, and only pack  those items they'll need to
<br>
get them thru until the Singularity has uplifted
<br>
everyone, which should occur shortly after 5:45pm.
<br>
<p>According to Dr. Beeblebrox over at the
<br>
Self-Augmenting Intelligence Institute, a &lt;a
<br>
href=&quot;<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/seedAI/seedAI.html">http://www.intelligence.org/seedAI/seedAI.html</a>&quot;&gt;Yudkowsky
<br>
Seed AI&lt;/a&gt; was initiated at 11:59pm PST last night at
<br>
the Institutes ultra-secure research facility in Palo
<br>
Alto.  The super-secure quarantine conditions of the
<br>
facility was not to keep people out, but to keep the
<br>
seed-AI in.  However, according to intermet security
<br>
experts, the seed AI unintentionally escaped through
<br>
its triple firewall, and has already compromised 80%
<br>
of the worlds connected computers.  How it was able to
<br>
go from an isolated system to the larger internet
<br>
remains unknown.
<br>
<p>The 3:45 timeframe of the singularity is an estimate
<br>
based on the Institutes previous simulations.  They
<br>
expect chaos to insue for the remainder of the day,
<br>
but not to worry, as the benevolent seed-AI should
<br>
come to the rescue before things get too out of hand. 
<br>
This is assuming of course that every single line of
<br>
code in the seed AI is perfect, and that their
<br>
benevolent algorithms were coded accurately.  Only
<br>
time will tell.
<br>
<p>In other news,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html">http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html</a>
<br>
<p>Google announced it is interviewing candidates for
<br>
engineering positions at their lunar hosting and
<br>
research center, opening late in the spring of 2007.
<br>
<p>However, now that the singularity is imminent, Google
<br>
has said it is suspending any hiring and economic
<br>
expansion until this whole &quot;singularity thing&quot; is
<br>
sorted out.
<br>
<p>UPDATE: Due to overwheming demand, the Singularity
<br>
will be delayed by one hour, so that those wanting to
<br>
finishing watching the latest Buffy episode can do so.
