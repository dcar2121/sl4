Needless to say, that sorta thing is a lot easier than proving the
Riemann hypothesis!
In general, &quot;proving program correctness&quot; is of interest to a lot of
people in the software industry, especially in the military where
reliability is considered critical.  For instance, some people use the Z
specification language to formalize software designs: one then has a
problem of efficiently proving a complex software design, formalized in
Z, is correct.  There are also variants like Object-Z (or something like
that .. I haven't studied this stuff for a while).
Among well-known theorem provers, I like Otter
<a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/otter/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/otter/</a>
because it uses combinatory logic, which is related to the knowledge
representation inside Novamente. 
However, the results obtained with Otter or any other theorem-provers to
date are far, far short of prove-the-Riemann-hypothesis level!
A review of Otter and some other contemporary systems is here:
<a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~dliang/CSci8980/Projects/TheoremProvers.htm">http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~dliang/CSci8980/Projects/TheoremProvers.htm</a>
The TPTP problem set
<a href="http://www.cs.jcu.edu.au/~tptp/">http://www.cs.jcu.edu.au/~tptp/</a>
is a standard collection of theorem-proving problems for automated
theorem-provers....  Before you think about the Riemann hypothesis you
should definitely be able to handle this stuff with ease...
&gt; I'll see what I can do before the end of the year to
&gt; raise some interst in N.Z and Australia.  At the very
&gt; least there will be a new Institute with a team of one
&gt; working away part-time ;)
Sounds like fun ;-)
