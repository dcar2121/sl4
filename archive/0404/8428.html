Tyrone Pow:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I guess metaphors and not-so-subtle abstractions are lost on some people.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer is stating the views of physicist Julian Barbour. He believes in a
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;dualistic picture of Platonia, the collection of all possible 
<br>
configurations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the universe, and the completely different wave function, conceived
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of as 'mist' over Platonia... In answer to the question 'what is real?', I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;answer 'configurations'. (Barbour, &quot;The End of Time&quot;, p.228 or so)
<br>
<p>So Barbour believes in a many-worlds theory in which time is an illusion.
<br>
This is what exists: all possible spatial (not space-time) geometries, and
<br>
a complex number attached to each one (the 'probability amplitude').
<br>
<p>In ordinary quantum mechanics, you take the absolute value of that
<br>
complex number and square it, to get a probability. But in a many-worlds
<br>
theory, all the possibilities are equally real. So those numbers attached
<br>
to all the worlds can't be probabilities. But then what are they? Well,
<br>
maybe they're a &quot;measure&quot;, such as is used in integration - a way to
<br>
&quot;count&quot; a continuous infinity of objects. If so, I'd like to see an argument
<br>
that the proposed wavefunction of the universe makes sense as a measure,
<br>
but okay, I could accept that. But then don't call those mystery numbers
<br>
&quot;probabilities&quot;!
<br>
<p>And then there's the part about time being an illusion. I don't know
<br>
what to call that... Implausible? Outlandish? Absurd? It is hard to think
<br>
of a phenomenon more basic than &quot;Things change&quot;, except perhaps
<br>
for &quot;Something exists&quot;. So I object very strongly when a bizarre metaphysics
<br>
like Barbour's is passed off as what physics says and as something that is
<br>
proven. And let's be a little clearer than &quot;Life is a mist of probability
<br>
amplitudes&quot;. How about: &quot;Life is an infinite number of disconnected and
<br>
unchanging universes, each with an extraneous number attached; and
<br>
each moment of your life is located in a different one, and not actually
<br>
connected to any other such moment.&quot;
