<p>
I'm posting a brief outline: this is a sketch of what
<br>
I'm thinking of putting on the web-site when I get one
<br>
up.  Hopefully I can get this thing off the ground. 
<br>
I'm the new player on the block in the race for AGI
<br>
and I'm making a big power play!  ;)  Watch the sl4
<br>
list for further news.  Meantime comments or private
<br>
e-mails are welcome.
<br>
<p><p>The Riemann Artificial Intelligence Institute
<br>
<p>Mission Statement:
<br>
<p>The Riemann Artificial Intelligence Institute aims to
<br>
research artificial general intelligence, with an
<br>
emphasis on developing software capable of reasoning
<br>
about mathematics.  The long-term goal is to create
<br>
true artificial general intelligence in a computer
<br>
system.  
<br>
<p>True AGI would be AI with a general capacity for
<br>
learning exceeding that of a human.  Smarter than
<br>
human intelligence could help solve problems and make
<br>
breakthroughs which would enormously improve the
<br>
quality of life for humanity.  Such a thing is
<br>
regarded as possible by experts because our best
<br>
current scientific theories indicate that it is a
<br>
sensible proposition.
<br>
<p>The shorter-term goals are to develop software which
<br>
can assist in solving problems in mathematics of
<br>
significance and propriety value.  The purpose of the
<br>
shorter-term goals is to try to ensure results of
<br>
definite value to society and to secure sufficient
<br>
on-going interest and funding to achieve the long term
<br>
goal.  Since mathematics is the language of science,
<br>
there is also the possibility that software capable of
<br>
reasoning about mathematics will be useful for
<br>
artificial general intelligence research.
<br>
<p>The specific mathematical problem initially selected
<br>
to be attempted was 'The Riemann Hypothesis' (Named
<br>
after the great German mathematician Berhard Riemann).
<br>
&nbsp;Not only is this the most famous unsolved problem in
<br>
mathematics, a cash prize of $US 1 million is
<br>
currently being offered by the Clay Mathematics
<br>
Institute for its solution.  A solution to the Riemann
<br>
Hypothesis could solve the deepest mystery of pure
<br>
mathematics - the secret to the distribution of prime
<br>
numbers - and provide insights of great value to the
<br>
mathematics community.  It would also generate
<br>
enormous interest and result in immediate financial
<br>
reward to assist with further research.  The reason
<br>
for thinking that success is a fair possibility is
<br>
that some experts feel that knowledge has progressed
<br>
to the point where a solution may not be far off, and
<br>
the computer-assisted approach is one which has been
<br>
neglected.
<br>
<p>Plan and estimates:
<br>
<p>Staff and budget:
<br>
<p>The Institute aims for 5 full-time paid team members,
<br>
each of which would have a salary of $US 20 000 per
<br>
year (Total annual cost of team salary:  $US 100 000).
<br>
&nbsp;This is obviously fairly low pay, but it's
<br>
sufficient.  One of the team members would double as
<br>
the director.  There could also be any number of
<br>
additional part-time team members, but these would
<br>
have to be volunteers.
<br>
<p>The Institute aims for a budget of an additional $US
<br>
100 000 annually, in order to rent living space and
<br>
buy equipment.  
<br>
<p>Total annual budget:  $US 200 000
<br>
<p>This is probably the minimum budget required for a
<br>
full-time AGI project capable of getting anywhere.
<br>
<p>Time frames:
<br>
<p>The shorter-term goals of creating software capable of
<br>
deep mathematical reasoning would be expected to begin
<br>
yielding results within 2 years.  A solution to the
<br>
specific 'hard problem' selected (the Riemann
<br>
hypothesis) could be to hand within 2-5 years. 
<br>
Initial software design related to the problem could
<br>
take around a year of full-time research by the team,
<br>
and another 1-4 years of coding and refinements.  Note
<br>
that on a budget of $US 200 00 per year, 5 years work
<br>
to solve the Riemann hypothesis would cost $US 1
<br>
million, which would be fully reimbursed upon payment
<br>
of the prize offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute
<br>
for the solution.
<br>
<p>The longer term goal of true general artificial
<br>
intelligence in a computer system could take anywhere
<br>
from 2-50 years of full-time work.  There are too many
<br>
unknowns to be able to estimate a more precise time
<br>
frame with any confidence.  All one can really say is
<br>
that AGI will probably be achieved some time within
<br>
the next 50 years.  A 'consensus' guesstimate by
<br>
experts is for AGI circa 2030.  The task is thus
<br>
likely monumental, speculative and truly long-term. 
<br>
More modest (slight irony!) goals such as software
<br>
capable of assisting in finding solutions to hard
<br>
mathematical problems such as the Riemann Hypothesis
<br>
are needed for a realistic chance of shorter term
<br>
usefulness.  The Institute will have achieved
<br>
something if it can contribute but a little towards
<br>
the grand goal of AGI.
<br>
<p>Institute Background
<br>
<p>The Institute was born on 4th April, 2004.  Its
<br>
founder was Marc Geddes, Free-Lance Writer,
<br>
Transhumanist and paid member of the WTA (World
<br>
Transhumanist Organization) since 2002.  Transhumanism
<br>
is a rationalistic philosophy of the world advocating
<br>
the responsible use of science, technology and
<br>
critical thinking to improve the human condition.
<br>
<p>Institute Status as of:  4th April, 2004
<br>
<p>News of the Institute's founding was posted to the Sl4
<br>
(Shock Level 4) Mailing List.  A dedicated web-site
<br>
has not yet been created on the World-Wide-Web.  One
<br>
is being planned.
<br>
<p>The Institute has no legal status.
<br>
<p>The only person working for the Institute is Marc
<br>
Geddes.  He has begun research pertinent to Artificial
<br>
General Intelligence, Pure Mathematics, and the
<br>
Riemann Hypothesis.  This work is currently only
<br>
part-time and unpaid.
<br>
<p>The Institute currently has no funding or physical
<br>
location.  Businessmen and philanthropists in New
<br>
Zealand and Australia are being approached.  A
<br>
physical location in Australia is preferred.          
<br>
<p>Other AGI Projects
<br>
<p>Although 'Artificial intelligence' is a field which
<br>
now attracts large interest and a great deal of
<br>
funding around the world, circa 2004 there are few
<br>
projects which have the aim of achieving true
<br>
artificial general intelligence in a computer system. 
<br>
True AGI would be AI with a general capacity for
<br>
learning comparable to humans or better.  There are 3
<br>
main dedicated players (the names of the founders are
<br>
in brackets):
<br>
<p>Singularity Institute (Eliezer Yudkowsky)
<br>
Artificial General Intelligence Institute (Ben
<br>
Goerztel)
<br>
Adaptive AI Inc. (Peter Voss) 
<br>
<p>The Riemann A.I Institute strongly supports the work
<br>
of the three named organizations.  A wealth of
<br>
information about the long-term promises and perils of
<br>
AGI is available on the Singularity Institute web-site
<br>
and it is recommended that those interested in AGI
<br>
read the materials available there.  Where possible,
<br>
the Riemann A.I Institute is prepared to donate funds
<br>
and other support to these projects.
