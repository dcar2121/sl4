<p>Better by what measure? Depending on what yardstick you're using, there 
<br>
may be any number of other governments which could be considered 
<br>
'better'. I'm under the impression that this isn't really the forum for 
<br>
that discussion so, if you would like to debate this further (and I 
<br>
welcome friendly, informed exchange of information, ideas and differing 
<br>
viewpoints), let's take it off list.
<br>
<p>Within the context of my original post, all I was saying is that 
<br>
*governments in general* have been anything but benign with respect to 
<br>
their applications of cutting edge technologies. I'd be happy to supply 
<br>
support for this position, but I'd like to believe that the evidence 
<br>
stands on it's own without my assistance. The reason I mentioned the US 
<br>
in particular was due to your original assertion &quot;that the US government 
<br>
has no other choice, than to start a Manhattan size SAI project, before 
<br>
someone else&quot; and your subsequent statement that you would &quot;have no 
<br>
problems with this scenario.&quot; [1]
<br>
<p>After reading James' and Bens' input on the subject, I'm now somewhat on 
<br>
the fence wrt governmental/private control of such a project and am 
<br>
inclined to agree that it may make little difference. Yet, given the 
<br>
impact of such a project, I find it unlikely that the government could 
<br>
keep their hands out of the pot beyond a certain level of development. 
<br>
Hence I've found myself reaching the conclusion that we may expect the 
<br>
government to become involved, in whole or in part, before any SAI 
<br>
project reaches fruition.
<br>
<p>My reflecting on the idea, however, has brought me to another, 
<br>
potentially more important, question: Is it reasonable to assume that a 
<br>
successful SAI project can be controlled? (Apologies if this has been 
<br>
well hashed over, I've not had the time to read the entire four years of 
<br>
archived postings!) Physically isolating the system from outside 
<br>
networks may be a viable approach to keeping SAI contained but this is 
<br>
not the same thing as controlled, and coercion of any intelligence will 
<br>
likely breed resentment... James made the assertion [2] that one could 
<br>
not control the results and I imagine that this may be a road well 
<br>
traveled for him - if you have the time, could you expand some more on 
<br>
this point (or provide some appropriate references)?
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
Elias
