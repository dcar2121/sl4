Hi Ben,
<br>
<p>I just got back from four days camping in Death Valley and read your 
<br>
email. I think you and I are talking about slightly different things here.
<br>
<p>[As an aside, but somewhat relevant to the current discussion, Death 
<br>
Valley is an interesting place; it is supremely inhospitable and 
<br>
uncaring toward human life, but inspires great awe and humility and 
<br>
those who visit are enriched by the experience.]
<br>
<p>I agree with your assertion that the human experience, &quot;getting hurt, 
<br>
dying, having children, falling in and out of love&quot;, is most effectively 
<br>
understood through the folk psychology that you describe.  We experience 
<br>
our lives as humans, with much in common with other humans, and make 
<br>
sense of our lives and derive meaning within this context.
<br>
<p>I was referring to something different, the &quot;paradox&quot; that people can 
<br>
encounter during meta-thinking about thinking.  They wonder how it can 
<br>
be that the experience of self, what it actually *feels* like to smell a 
<br>
rose, in all its undeniable immediacy, can arise from matter that is not 
<br>
itself conscious.
<br>
<p>My point was that this paradox is explained simply (as described in my 
<br>
earlier post), not that human experience with all its rich meaning is 
<br>
explained simply.

<em>&gt; I don't accept the idea that empirical science and the &quot;third-person

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;consciousness.&quot;   Science provides interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanations for various features of my mental life, but folk psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tells much far more about experiences like getting hurt, dying, having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, falling in and out of love, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, you might respond, &quot;Sure, explanations involving experience and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness may be USEFUL in some contexts, even though the phenomena
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; don't &quot;exist&quot; in a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, you could adopt a Nietzschean criterion of truth, in which &quot;true&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined as &quot;useful to a given organism in achieving its goals.&quot;  In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, experience and consciousness are definitely part of human truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I view the relationship between &quot;human understanding&quot; -- of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which folk psychology is a part -- and empirical science as one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interdependency.  Science enhances and modifies our mutual human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.  But human understanding underlies our belief in science,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by providing a prior distribution based on &quot;human judgments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplicity&quot;, which we use to ground the comparison of various scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This feedback between science and human understanding has, as a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, the feedback between the scientific and experiential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (human-understanding-based) views of the mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Among other things the Singularity may result in the resolution of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialectic between scientific and human understanding, via the creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of minds for which there is no dichotomy between scientific and innate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural/psychological understanding.  I suspect that the &quot;theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind&quot; possessed by such posthuman minds will incorporate -- and discard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- aspects of our current first-person AND third-person theories, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporate new aspects as well.
</em><br>
