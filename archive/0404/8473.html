<p><p>China is a very interesting case, but I think it unlikely for two 
<br>
reasons.  (And I discount the opinion of an investor as to what 
<br>
constitutes &quot;good AI&quot; prima facie.)
<br>
<p>First, even though China has a large population at its disposal, it is 
<br>
extremely under-utilized from the standpoint of being a technological 
<br>
competitor such that it has, at best, the effective technological 
<br>
development footprint of something like a medium-sized European 
<br>
country.  And it will be at least two decades before they really get 
<br>
past this.  Very little of China can be categorized as &quot;modern&quot; in any 
<br>
normal sense of the word e.g. the tap water isn't safe to drink in the 
<br>
best parts of Beijing and donkey carts abound in much of the country.
<br>
<p>Second, while the Chinese do come up with some interesting ideas, they 
<br>
are famously poor at execution.  I don't see this changing any time 
<br>
soon, as the problems with execution seem to be largely structural and 
<br>
systemic.
<br>
<p>The important issue that is covered in these two points is that by the 
<br>
time China could hope to really become a major player, I think most of 
<br>
us fully expect the game to already be over.  Japan easily stands to be 
<br>
a more important player in any timeframe that matters.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; They're making some first-rate electronics over there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I have a couple of Chinese-made Behringer audio
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices, a small mixer and a digital guitar effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box. They cost little and do things that used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require a cart load of pedals &amp; such).
</em><br>
<p><p>Behringer.  The same Behringer that has been sued by just about 
<br>
everyone in the audio electronics industry for blatantly stealing 
<br>
designs and cloning other companies' circuit boards.  The Behringer 
<br>
that is synonymous with third-rate quality in the audio electronics 
<br>
industry.
<br>
<p>Behringer is *not* what you want to use as a shining example of Chinese 
<br>
quality or ingenuity.   But it does hint at another point:  It is very 
<br>
slow and difficult to develop a world-class engineering culture, there 
<br>
are no shortcuts.  Because of the likely overall nature and complexity 
<br>
of engineering a practical AGI, I find it highly improbable that it 
<br>
will be successfully developed in a country that does not have a 
<br>
pervasive native engineering culture (US, Japan, and a small subset of 
<br>
Europe).   It could happen elsewhere, but the odds do not favor it.  
<br>
You need a broad, extremely capable, and highly experienced engineering 
<br>
team to have a good shot in implementation, which you can't just throw 
<br>
together in most parts of the world.
<br>
<p>Another tantalizing idea:  Someone may have already solved AI, but did 
<br>
not have the engineering competence to realize it well enough to prove 
<br>
the concept.  The algorithm space is very unforgiving of mediocre 
<br>
implementation...
