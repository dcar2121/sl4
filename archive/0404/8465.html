</em><br>
<em>&gt; large-team enterprise.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned that the hard way!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>First of all, the proper name of the atomic bomb
<br>
program was the &quot;Manhattan District&quot;.  It was so
<br>
named by the general put in charge of the program.
<br>
He had previously been in charge of building the
<br>
Pentagon, and the Army Corps of Engineers names
<br>
their project districts after the location of the
<br>
headquarters office.
<br>
<p>The early work on the atomic bomb was centered at
<br>
Pupin Hall, the physics building at Columbia
<br>
University, which is in Manhattan.  I studied
<br>
physics there as an undergraduate. According
<br>
to the older professors, the basement of the
<br>
building was slightly radioactive from the
<br>
prototype reactors they built there, but it
<br>
was okay to go down there because they painted
<br>
everything over with lead-based paint  :-).
<br>
Later the majority of the work moved to other
<br>
places, but the name stuck.
<br>
<p>The number of physicists involved in the program
<br>
was rather small.  What made it a massive project
<br>
was the huge facilities required to separate
<br>
Uranium isotopes (Oak Ridge and Hanford).
<br>
<p>In the computer field, the huge facilities
<br>
required to produce chips already exist, funded
<br>
by private companies.  And when the economics of
<br>
AI make sense, there are lots of well funded
<br>
companies that can work the problem.  The
<br>
US government is slow to react to these types
<br>
of challenges absent a major goad.  Witness the
<br>
2-3 years it takes to repair the Shuttle each
<br>
time it crashes.  In that time computers
<br>
quadruple in performance.
<br>
<p>It would take something like discovering China
<br>
has a major AI &amp; robotics program aimed at 
<br>
developing weapons of mass instruction and
<br>
construction respectively, for the US government
<br>
to react on a time scale that would have much
<br>
of an impact.  In the case of nanotechnology,
<br>
it has taken 15-20 years from when Drexler
<br>
published &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; to the point
<br>
where significant government programs exist, and
<br>
nanotech is similar to AI in having world-
<br>
changing potential.
