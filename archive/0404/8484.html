<p>
Over the last week people have been discussing some of the drivers 
<br>
for take-off of advanced general artificial intelligence. This is an area 
<br>
that would benefit from the application of some AGI mental power as 
<br>
complex systems modelling is a key area where human minds do not 
<br>
perform that well.
<br>
<p>On Friday 9 April James/Andrew Rogers proposed a scenario where 
<br>
commercial competition could lead to an AGI development 'arms race' 
<br>
- this scenario seems quite plausible to me.  But clearly the take-off 
<br>
would lead to a wildly unpredicable and possible highly unstable 
<br>
change process.
<br>
<p>At such a time of rapid change many players will be seeking ways to 
<br>
make the change process managable.  The notion of &quot;manageable 
<br>
change&quot; doesn't imply that we or in fact any advanced intelligence can 
<br>
predict the actual changes or that anyone can control the change in a 
<br>
determinisitic way.  All that it suggests is that the players involved in 
<br>
real time in the change process might have a sense that the change 
<br>
process is (somewhat) manageable.  (like successfully navigating 
<br>
through rapids in a canoe going down an unknow river)
<br>
<p>I think the achievement of something that could be described as 
<br>
&quot;manageable change&quot; will only be possible if a significant % of the AGI 
<br>
mental power is actually directed towards making the change process 
<br>
manageable.  ie. one of the chief drivers of change also needs to be an 
<br>
agent of for making that change manageable.  However, how the 
<br>
resources could be generated to make this possible is an interesting 
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
