</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we are living in a simulation, the universe

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; world. This may for 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a giant SOS sign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (although I'm sure the SI will come up with a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better idea than this).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose the SI never finds any evidence that it is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; less-than-perfect simulation. It still cannot rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is living in a perfect simulation. Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not it continues to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. But where does this prior come from? I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curious if anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else has thought about this problem.
</em><br>
<p><p>I have been ramming my poor head against this problem
<br>
for years, too, and without the sort of math mind
<br>
Eliezer (or the rest of this forum) has. I am more of
<br>
an artist/layman. So I play with visual metaphors and
<br>
thought experiments based on what I can grasp of what
<br>
the various experts seem to think. 
<br>
We can all agree that there is at least one logical
<br>
system that creates the universe we know. Otherwise we
<br>
wouldn't be having this conversation. Seen as
<br>
software, our physical reality is isomorphic to an
<br>
emulation run on several nested levels, each with its
<br>
own rules.
<br>
One may disagree where to draw the boundaries between
<br>
levels, but it looks a bit like this:
<br>
<p>Neurology: living cells use chemical and electrical
<br>
signals to create our minds.
<br>
Biology:organisms made of single or multiple cells.
<br>
Biochemistry: various chemicals combine in sustained
<br>
patterns (proteins, DNA, cells, etc.) using compounds
<br>
and energy found in the environment.
<br>
Chemistry: different elements interact to create more
<br>
complex compounds according to how electrons organize
<br>
in their outer shells.
<br>
Physics: atoms are made up from elementary particles
<br>
which interact and are equivalent to energy.
<br>
Mathematics?: physicists regard energy and matter as
<br>
reified mathematical constructs.
<br>
Logos?: in other words, does mathematics 'just exist'
<br>
even if nothing else does?
<br>
This is what I meant with the
<br>
man-drawn-on-a-chalkboard metaphor. Everything we
<br>
consider real is part of the chalk drawing; but we
<br>
know there is a blackboard of some sort, even if
<br>
experimentally it lies forever out of reach (even,
<br>
perhaps, to minds unimaginably exceeding ours).
<br>
<p>It is as if each level of reality were a software
<br>
emulation running on the level below it, so that you
<br>
can't run 'Physics' unless you first run
<br>
'Mathematics', you cannot run 'Chemistry' unless
<br>
'Physics' is running, and so to the top. Our minds are
<br>
emulations atop emulations, or else they are
<br>
'something else' functionally and the lower levels are
<br>
like Ptolemaic epicycles, plausible explanations but
<br>
not correct.
<br>
<p>Each level of emulation has its own rules which do not
<br>
apply on other levels (this is how we can
<br>
differentiate levels) and it is worth noting that
<br>
paradoxes usually occur when a question is asked of an
<br>
inappropriate level on any multileveled phenomenon.
<br>
Example: 'impossible' geometrical objects such as
<br>
shown in Escher illustrations are only paradoxical
<br>
because 2-dimensional lines on paper are interpreted
<br>
by the eye/brain according to rules applicable to
<br>
3-dimensional spaces and objects.
<br>
Likewise, paradoxes in physics, cosmology,
<br>
consciousness, etc. are indicators that wrong
<br>
questions are being asked.
<br>
<p>There are a number of researchers covering related
<br>
areas at the intersection of physics/cosmology, so
<br>
that I sense we are seeing one thing from many
<br>
different views (the elephant metaphor). Max Tegmark's
<br>
Sci Am article of last spring gives us the idea of
<br>
different orders of universes, even purely
<br>
mathematical constructs (not entirely a surprise as I
<br>
had read Tipler). Julian Barbour proposes that time is
<br>
discontinuous and 'grainy' (I think this is
<br>
experimentally verified)so that we move through
<br>
'ticks' (the Planck time interval, presumably) and
<br>
each moment is a static pattern in Platonia.
<br>
Everything is made up of vibrating strings. No, it's
<br>
all caused by colliding branes. Inflation. No,
<br>
ekpyrosis. Determinism is absolute (because there are
<br>
only n possible patterns of atoms). No, there is free
<br>
will (because of quantum effects). Our universe is a
<br>
computer program controlled by Wolfram's Rule 110
<br>
(pat. pend.) Hmmmm.
<br>
<p><p>Now I happen to believe that Wolfram is right that
<br>
every thing is created by some simple rule and its
<br>
iterations, but I don't see why it has to be that
<br>
particular rule. Rule 110 seems to assume that
<br>
existence is laid out on graph paper. Call me a
<br>
jackhole for doubting someone with a thousand times my
<br>
expertise, but I'll do it anyway.
<br>
One big lesson I took from Godel, Escher, Bach by
<br>
Hofstadter was that patterns can be coded into other,
<br>
seemingly unrelated patterns (as Godel found a way to
<br>
use the formal system of Principia Mathematica to
<br>
express the Epimenides Paradox).
<br>
<p>Let us assume that we do live in Barbour's Platonia
<br>
and that each moment is a frozen universe unto itself.
<br>
Each Planck tick since the Big Bang is an eternal
<br>
snapshot. Let us also assume that a panoply of other,
<br>
quite separate universes also exist with similar or
<br>
very different rules and arrangements of matter,
<br>
energy, or entities that have no equivalent here. But
<br>
whatever their forms, they must be created by the same
<br>
primordial mechanism.
<br>
<p>For each moment in Platonia we have an arrangement of
<br>
particles and energies in its space. Assume that each
<br>
possible arrangement is encoded by an unique number.
<br>
Is it the opinion of others here that numbers would
<br>
exist even if nothing else did? A friend who went to
<br>
see Wolfram speak (and someone else, can't remember
<br>
who) said they strike him as 'way out Platonists.' How
<br>
about you?
<br>
One can, if I'm not mistaken, generate all these time
<br>
slices simply by (for example) running an infinite
<br>
nonrepeating decimal (pi, let's say) and taking
<br>
sequences from the decimal. Each unique sequence can
<br>
code for its unique isomorphic moment in our universe.
<br>
Other algorithms might generate all possible patterns
<br>
in Platonia. A simple count of all integers, perhaps;
<br>
or a pattern generatro such as Ben describes in one of
<br>
his papers (alas, I didn't bookmark that one and can't
<br>
find it again, but Ben will know which one I refer
<br>
to).
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Notice that within the very large unique number that
<br>
would code for this exact moment in our universe,
<br>
there exists a smaller sequence that codes for the
<br>
pattern that is you at this exact moment.
<br>
<p>Now if we can accept the existence of a vast (if not
<br>
infinite) number of possible arrangements, we then
<br>
need some sense of the rules which create time. It's
<br>
like chess: a knight can dogleg, a pawn go only
<br>
forward or en passant, a queen travel in any
<br>
unobstructed straight line, and so on.
