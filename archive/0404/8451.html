</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as projected, making the running of multiple
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's the 40th anniversary of IBM's introduction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first general purpose mainframe family, the 360
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series.  It's worth considering what made such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainframes so popular and predicting how AI may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow a similar path.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was generally a young lady who operated a mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculator.  There were legions of them working in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industries like banking and insurance that required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of arithmetic to be done.  There were also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large numbers of them working in payroll and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accounting departments of most companies.  Prior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the 360 series, electronic computers were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally special purpose.  The 360 series had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a consistent machine code and OS across a range
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of models, and the machines were capable of running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a wide range of programs.  They were expensive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but less expensive than the large number of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers they replaced.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, there are software systems that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been developed to do specific tasks, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuit layout or flagging unusual credit card
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transactions.  These are hand crafted for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific task.  Software systems that are trainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a wide variety of tasks are not yet available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once hardware is available that is adequate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the job at a competitive cost, there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong incentive for the software to be developed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, a voice recognition call center
</em><br>
<em>&gt; package that can be trained much as the humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who do the job to reply to product-specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions might sell for a lot of money if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaces dozens or hundreds of humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The more generally trainable a system is, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more potential customers there are, and thus the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount that can be invested in developing it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I estimate sufficiently powerful hardware needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be in the range of $30K to $30 per teraflop,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a factor 5 to 5000 less than at present, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4 to ~20 years of continued cost reductions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers at recent rates, plus 5-10 years for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of 'trainable software' of increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generality once the financial incentive exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus I project a range of 10-30 years in total from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Daniel
</em><br>
<p>May be, but I project MASSIVE white-collar
<br>
unemployment and social disruption on the way, because
<br>
we are still operating under the old economic model.
<br>
If a factory owner can lay off N employees while still
<br>
producing and selling the same quantity of product, do
<br>
the ex-employees get to share the extra profit? Of
<br>
course not. We are starting to see the result with the
<br>
'jobless recovery' which is getting blamed partly on
<br>
overseas outsourcing and partly on increased
<br>
productivity.
<br>
At some point an economic crisis will result from too
<br>
few people actually being able to earn money to buy
<br>
products (even bare necessities like food which
<br>
requires precious energy to produce and precious
<br>
insects to pollinate) and we can expect to see
<br>
dirt-cheap computers and other tech products the way
<br>
we see cheapo digital watches and  $1 pocket
<br>
calculators now. I would not be surprised to see
<br>
people starve to death surrounded by supercomputers. I
<br>
wonder whether this economic disruption is going to
<br>
interfere with AGI development.
