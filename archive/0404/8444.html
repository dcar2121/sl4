<em>&gt; &gt; I'd be surprised if AGI is developed in less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years.  I'm looking at a 50 year time-frame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually.
</em><br>
<p>Ben G. said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the end she agreed that 8-10 years was plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 15 years was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly likely -- assuming the focused team of 5-7
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people really has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total focus on the project, and assuming hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues to advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as projected, making the running of multiple
</em><br>
<p>It's the 40th anniversary of IBM's introduction of
<br>
the first general purpose mainframe family, the 360
<br>
series.  It's worth considering what made such
<br>
mainframes so popular and predicting how AI may
<br>
follow a similar path.
<br>
<p>In the first half of the 20th century, a computer
<br>
was generally a young lady who operated a mechanical
<br>
calculator.  There were legions of them working in
<br>
industries like banking and insurance that required
<br>
a lot of arithmetic to be done.  There were also
<br>
large numbers of them working in payroll and
<br>
accounting departments of most companies.  Prior
<br>
to the 360 series, electronic computers were
<br>
generally special purpose.  The 360 series had
<br>
a consistent machine code and OS across a range
<br>
of models, and the machines were capable of running
<br>
a wide range of programs.  They were expensive,
<br>
but less expensive than the large number of human
<br>
computers they replaced.  
<br>
<p>Similarly, there are software systems that have
<br>
been developed to do specific tasks, such as
<br>
circuit layout or flagging unusual credit card
<br>
transactions.  These are hand crafted for the
<br>
specific task.  Software systems that are trainable
<br>
for a wide variety of tasks are not yet available.
<br>
<p>Once hardware is available that is adequate for
<br>
the job at a competitive cost, there will be a
<br>
strong incentive for the software to be developed.
<br>
For example, a voice recognition call center
<br>
package that can be trained much as the humans
<br>
who do the job to reply to product-specific
<br>
questions might sell for a lot of money if it
<br>
replaces dozens or hundreds of humans.
<br>
<p>The more generally trainable a system is, the
<br>
more potential customers there are, and thus the
<br>
amount that can be invested in developing it can
<br>
increase.
<br>
<p>I estimate sufficiently powerful hardware needs
<br>
to be in the range of $30K to $30 per teraflop,
<br>
or a factor 5 to 5000 less than at present, or
<br>
4 to ~20 years of continued cost reductions for
<br>
computers at recent rates, plus 5-10 years for
<br>
development of 'trainable software' of increasing
<br>
generality once the financial incentive exists.
<br>
<p>Thus I project a range of 10-30 years in total from 
<br>
now.
