Why would you assume that all AIs are going to only be in a conventional box with a power cord? We are headed into a space fairly quickly where computers of vastly more power than we have today may be in the very air. Long before we get there there will be computer/human or computer/robot beings that are independent of needing to be plugged into the wall and are capable of self-protection. 

For truly human or better grade AI at full computer speeds what makes you think you could "pull the plug" or in any way control it when it thinks a million times faster than you and sees you coming miles away?

Nuke the sucker. Make sure it isn't mobile. Riddle it with bullets. Melt it. EVAPORATE IT. Unleash nanobots. Include a remote fail-safe shutoff the AI can't modify. Don't give it access to nanotech. Make it human (or upgraded human) dependant in some way so it doesn't eradicate us.

Or am I just not getting it? ^_^
