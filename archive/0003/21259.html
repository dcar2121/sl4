<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;From Internet Scientist, a Preview of Extinction
</em><br>
By Joel Garreau
<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer
<br>
Sunday, March 12, 2000; Page A15
<br>
<p><p>A respected creator of the Information Age has
<br>
written an extraordinary critique of accelerating
<br>
technological change in which he suggests that new
<br>
technologies could cause &quot;something like
<br>
extinction&quot; of humankind within the next two
<br>
generations.
<br>
<p>The alarming prediction, intended to be
<br>
provocative, is striking because it comes not from
<br>
a critic of technology but rather from a man who
<br>
invented much of it: Bill Joy, chief scientist and
<br>
co-founder of Sun Microsystems Inc., the leading
<br>
Web technology manufacturer.
<br>
<p>Joy was an original co-chairman of a presidential
<br>
commission on the future of information
<br>
technology. His warning, he said in a telephone
<br>
interview, is meant to be reminiscent of Albert
<br>
Einstein's famous 1939 letter to President
<br>
Franklin Delano Roosevelt alerting him to the
<br>
possibility of an atomic bomb.
<br>
<p>In a 24-page article in the Wired magazine that
<br>
will appear on the Web Tuesday, Joy says he finds
<br>
himself essentially agreeing, to his horror, with
<br>
a core argument of the Unabomber, Theodore
<br>
Kaczynski--that advanced technology poses a threat
<br>
to the human species. &quot;I have always believed that
<br>
making software more reliable, given its many
<br>
uses, will make the world a safer and better
<br>
place,&quot; Joy wrote in the article, which he worked
<br>
on for six months. &quot;If I were to come to believe
<br>
the opposite, then I would be morally obligated to
<br>
stop this work. I can now imagine that such a day
<br>
may come.&quot;
<br>
<p>Joy enjoys a level-headed reputation in the
<br>
industry. &quot;Nobody is more phlegmatic than Bill,&quot;
<br>
said Stewart Brand, an Internet pioneer.
<br>
<p>&quot;He is the adult in the room.&quot;
<br>
<p>Joy is disturbed by a suite of advances . He views
<br>
as credible the prediction that by 2030, computers
<br>
will be a million times more powerful than they
<br>
are today. He respects the possibility that robots
<br>
may exceed humans in intelligence, while being
<br>
able to replicate themselves.
<br>
<p>He points to nanotechnology--the emerging science
<br>
that seeks to create any desired object on an
<br>
atom-by-atom basis--and agrees that it has the
<br>
potential to allow inexpensive production of smart
<br>
machines so small they could fit inside a blood
<br>
vessel. Genetic technology, meanwhile, is
<br>
inexorably generating the power to create new
<br>
forms of life that could reproduce.
<br>
<p>What deeply worries him is that these technologies
<br>
collectively create the ability to unleash
<br>
self-replicating, mutating, mechanical or
<br>
biological plagues. These would be &quot;a replication
<br>
attack in the physical world&quot; comparable to the
<br>
replication attack in the virtual world that
<br>
recently caused the shutdowns of major commercial
<br>
Web sites.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can let something loose that can make more
<br>
&nbsp;copies of itself,&quot; Joy said in a telephone
<br>
&nbsp;interview, &quot;it is very difficult to recall. It is
<br>
&nbsp;as easy as eradicating all the mosquitoes: They
<br>
&nbsp;are everywhere and make more of themselves. If
<br>
&nbsp;attacked, they mutate and become immune. . . .
<br>
&nbsp;That creates the possibility of empowering
<br>
&nbsp;individuals for extreme evil. If we don't do
<br>
&nbsp;anything, the risk is very high of one crazy
<br>
&nbsp;person doing something very bad.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What further concerns him is the huge profits from
<br>
&nbsp;any single advance that may seem beneficial in
<br>
&nbsp;itself. &quot;It is always hard to see the biggerimpact while you are in the vortex of a change,&quot; Joy wrote. &quot;We have long been driven by the
<br>
&nbsp;overarching desire to know that is the natural science's quest, not stopping to notice that the progress to newer and more powerful technologies
<br>
&nbsp;can take on a life of its own.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;Finally, he argues, this threat to humanity is
<br>
&nbsp;much greater than that of nuclear weapons because
<br>
&nbsp;those are hard to build. By contrast, he says,
<br>
&nbsp;these new technologies are not hard to come by.
<br>
&nbsp;Therefore, he reasons, the problem will not be
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;rogue states, but rogue individuals.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Joy acknowledges that to some people, this may all
<br>
&nbsp;sound like science fiction. &quot;After Y2K didn't
<br>
&nbsp;happen,&quot; he said, &quot;some people will feel free to
<br>
&nbsp;dismiss this, saying everything will work out.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Joy is less clear on how such a scenario could be
<br>
&nbsp;prevented. When asked how he personally would stop
<br>
&nbsp;this progression, he stumbled. &quot;Sun has always
<br>
&nbsp;struggled with being an ethical innovator,&quot; he
<br>
&nbsp;said. &quot;We are tool builders. I'm trailing off
<br>
&nbsp;here.&quot;
