</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Len(P2)=4. You can encode any other TM to run on this UTM, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it'll be at least of length 10: for all P that stop, P&lt;&gt;P1, P&lt;&gt;P2,

<em>&gt; Len(P)&gt;=10. Let's say, the output of running P1 is Run(P1)=P3, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; output of P2 is Run(P2)=P4, but we make sure that also Run(P3)=P4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, clearly Kolmogorov complexity of P3 is 3 (length of P1), and of

<p><p>Yes, the complexity of the state will vary -- a simple counter with no  
<br>
other behavior is sufficient to see that this is true -- but that is  
<br>
not the complexity of the machine. What does this have to do with  
<br>
Peter's original assertion? It was very late when I responded, but he  
<br>
did write something like:
<br>
<p>&quot;Suppose you have a machine that outputs a copy of itself, except that
<br>
somewhere in its memory it contains a model number, and each time it
<br>
makes a copy, it increments the model number on the copy.
<br>
<p>This machine and all of its descendants comprise an infinite set of
<br>
distinct machines...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>It looked kind of like someone confusing machine complexity with state  
<br>
complexity with some ambiguous handling of the complexity of the  
<br>
control function, and it still does to me this morning.  I could be  
<br>
wrong, I was having trouble parsing his point.
<br>
<p>The focus should have been on the very first line, since that had no  
<br>
ambiguity: Exactly how does a machine output a copy of itself (with or  
<br>
without the counter)?
