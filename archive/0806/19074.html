<p>I'm not so sure about that. I get awesome performance out of my 
<br>
software. It's how I'm able to do so much, really. I ruthlessly 
<br>
eliminate overhead, and this sometimes means getting rid of the gui.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;What we know,

</em><br>
<p>Okay, so let's work with this. Suppose that 750 kilobytes of DNA. The 
<br>
information that is encoded in the codons is specifying amino acids, 
<br>
which is somehow deterministically specifying the proteins that are 
<br>
constructed. Supposedly it should be possible to use our knowledge of 
<br>
protein folding in order to simulate all of the proteins being 
<br>
constructed. But. The functionality that the proteins provide isn't 
<br>
necessarily encoded in the genome itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For an AI to compete with man it should probably run at at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man's thinking speed.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what compete means in this context.
<br>
<p>And I don't know what thinking speed means. Thoughts per second?
<br>
<p>How are you measuring a thought in a man?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; One major driver will be the need for practical intelligence as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; robots leave the factory and start to interact with the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No, that's more a 'driver' for people to come to terms with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems and realize that they might be interested in working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them, it's nothing about the actuality of solving them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.  And then by trying probably having some success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In particular cars can already drive themselves over rough desert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; tracks and down freeways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You're talking about physical manufacturing and mechanics, tasks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that machines can already do. Intelligence isn't really needed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, the machine needs to be able to see/sense the environment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine a route through it, react to changes.  Certainly not full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI but much, much smarter than the program that tots up your bank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but there's other available solutions for those problems, like 
<br>
automated transportation systems and so on. Having ai solve the driving 
<br>
problem is a major hack. And I know it's starting to work, but it's all 
<br>
backwards. The idea is to get ai, not a driving machine. There are many 
<br>
intelligent people who can't drive, for instance. But if I throw in a 
<br>
cpu into my 2005 Mustang, and it starts driving itself, I wouldn't be 
<br>
complaining. But I wouldn't also be shouting ai.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Who cares if you are out of work? The machines are taking care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the necessities of life anyway, yes? Then what's the big deal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People pay me because I can do valued work.  If they do not pay me I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may starve.  Socialism is all very well, but I would prefer not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bet on it.
</em><br>
<p>You'd have machines that give you food. Much like they do now. Actually, 
<br>
at the moment, I think the agricultural industry is still using 
<br>
human-powered vehicles.
