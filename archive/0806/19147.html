</em><br>
Goals come in many varieties:  Short term, long term, in between.  High 
<br>
priority, low priority, in between.  High importance, low importance, in 
<br>
between.  Probably a few dimensions I left out.  (Priority says how quickly 
<br>
it needs to be achieved, importance says the value placed upon achieving the 
<br>
goal.)
<br>
<p>Naturally, these dimensions aren't usually pure.  Eating breakfast is a short 
<br>
term, medium-low importance, high priority goal when you're normally well fed 
<br>
and late for work.  We more commonly, here, talk about primary (top level) 
<br>
goals and derived goals, but I tend to think of that as an 
<br>
oversimplification.  Basic goals won't have meaningful symbolic names, 
<br>
they'll be things like achieve this or that internal state, where the state 
<br>
will be a complex transform of external sense images &amp; world model, and it 
<br>
will be &quot;felt&quot; that achieving this by modifying the state map directly 
<br>
was &quot;cheating&quot;.  Which means that the planning for how to achieve the goal 
<br>
won't plan on directly modifying the state map.  (This is difficult, but you 
<br>
need to allow a model of the state map to be directly modified to allow 
<br>
modeling of the future, the past, or the actions of other entities.  I.e., it 
<br>
needs to be able to be used analogously to the way mammals use mirror 
<br>
neurons, to construct a &quot;theory of mind&quot;.)
<br>
<p>N.B.:  I think that a large part of the oversimplification with how we 
<br>
consider goals has to do with the serial nature of language.  Internally 
<br>
goals aren't serial, but simultaneous, with values and priorities that shift 
<br>
with both internal and external state.  A stack won't work, though in a 
<br>
processor deficient system (i.e., any likely actual implementation) a queue 
<br>
might be used, with lots of time-slicing.  (Priority Queue generally doesn't 
<br>
quite capture the meaning of priority that I'm using

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axioms determine what is possible but they don’t tell you anything, you

</em><br>
They aren't supposed to.  And the &quot;axioms&quot; are directly understood internally.  
<br>
They're like a list of operations.  Different operations require different 
<br>
input values and yield different transforms of the data.  What they &quot;mean&quot; is 
<br>
somethine like apply(&quot;+&quot;, 2, 2) yields 4, but with the 2's and 4 replaced by 
<br>
variables, and the &quot;+&quot; being the &quot;axiom&quot;.  They're the things that you could 
<br>
try to do.  Note that some axioms won't be possible to apply in some 
<br>
situations because they will require inputs that aren't available.
