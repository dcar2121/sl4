<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, most of the tests for above-human intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned earlier, like winning an election or producing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blockbuster movie require judgment by a large group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (voters or movie goers), which is collectively more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent than any individual. How do you collectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test for intelligence greater than the collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence of all humanity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the ones that do not require human intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to test it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - being the first to build a copy of Manhattan on the moon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Uranus,
</em><br>
<p>How would you automate such a test without at least human level intelligence? Someone has to look through a telescope and recognize Manhattan. Someone has to build a telescope powerful enough to see the buildings?
<br>
<p>Also, it is a test of collective intelligence. Passing the test depends on the ability of others to build a rocket and the the necessary equipment. A test of *individual* intelligence would be to build a spear out of sticks and rocks and kill an antelope, having been raised in a tribe that has never hunted. Most people would fail this test.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or assembling a living copy of a certain human being from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inert materials?
</em><br>
<p>How much intelligence does it take to walk into a clone-o-matic center, insert a DNA sample, and push the &quot;copy&quot; button? Whose intelligence are we testing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sceptical of any one problem to use as a test (especially the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical ones). By &quot;intelligence&quot;, we refer to a wide variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities, not just mathematical skill; we would need several tests to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage what we mean by intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Agree, but for a simple model we need a simple definition of intelligence. If we can't solve the simple case, I doubt that adding complexity will help, so much as it will hide the fact that our solution won't work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are no provably hard problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is another issue: there may be problems where superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence cannot result in better result. If we were to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing Tic-tac-toe as a test, this would not help, as Tic-tac-toe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully solved, even for us. Maybe some of these suggested tests are of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same nature; any entity with an &quot;IQ&quot; of 400
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can fully solve it as fast as it can be done, so increases in &quot;IQ&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't help (and it may be true, but unprovable, that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements exist).
</em><br>
<p>This is also a problem for chess, as I mentioned.
<br>
<p>One approach (dangerous IMHO) is that whenever a problem is solved, the agent chooses a harder problem. It is dangerous because you no longer have a stable goal passed to offspring. How do you code &quot;harder&quot;?
