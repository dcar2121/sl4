<p><em>&gt; OF COURSE it does not mean that everything in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe that is &quot;true&quot; (on whatever theory of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth you like) can be proven in pure first order logic 
</em><br>
<p>The trouble with first order logic isn’t that it can’t prove EVERYTHING,
<br>
the problem is that it can do almost NOTHING. It is a toy logical system
<br>
weak as tea invented long ago by professional logicians because at the
<br>
time a grown up logical system was too complicated to think about. But
<br>
yes it’s true, Gödel himself proved in his PHD that it’s consistent and
<br>
complete, that is to say any true statement that can be expressed within
<br>
it can be derived from its axioms and rules of inference and no false
<br>
statements can be. When Gödel discovered his completeness proof it
<br>
caused little splash because for years most assumed it was probably true
<br>
and most didn’t care a lot about first order logic one way or the other
<br>
because it’s so weak it can’t even do arithmetic.
<br>
<p>About a year later Gödel came out with his incompleteness proof that
<br>
showed any logical system with a finite number of symbols that was
<br>
powerful enough to do arithmetic can’t be consistent and complete.
<br>
Nobody was expecting that and it did make a splash.
<br>
<p>So regarding mind your objections would be correct if Mr. Jupiter Brain
<br>
worked according to first order logic, but Babbage couldn’t even make
<br>
his Analytical Engine if he used that. You also say that Gentzen came up
<br>
with a system that could do arithmetic that was consistent and complete,
<br>
and that’s true, but Gentzen’s system needs an infinite number of
<br>
symbols; so unless you’re postulating an infinite and not just
<br>
astronomically large mind Gentzen is irrelevant. For any mind you
<br>
actually expect to build Gödel’s Incompleteness theorem is very relevant
<br>
indeed.
