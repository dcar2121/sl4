</em><br>
<p>That sounds like a biased metric.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Make what decisions? I suspect you are going back to the idea of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dictatorship of an ai? I don't understand. :-/ More on this below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No needed to be a dictator; any interaction needs some information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the being interacted with.
</em><br>
<p>I was rather questioning all of the silly Holy Ai scenarios on the list, 
<br>
not the point about information and models.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Looks like you're assuming a spectrum with democracy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dictatorship at two opposite ends of the line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linguistically, and in most societies, they are. Hence to get people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that the best gov &quot;might not be a democracy! really!&quot;, is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say &quot;it might be a dictatorship!&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My stick is bigger than yours? That's the best we can come up with?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep. Depressing, really.
</em><br>
<p>How is it that you are certain that it is the best that we can do ? 
<br>
By 'we' I refer to everyone on sl4.org.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No, it could be no government at all. Have you considered that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these technologies are liberating ? That they don't force us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rely on governments? That they allow us to live our lives without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the restrictions that governments used to be there to help face up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to? etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still fail to see how some people are going to be disuaded from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using violence (or, more likely, the threat of violence), unless by
</em><br>
<p>No, disuasion is not the point. Let's engineer the problems out of the 
<br>
system, the problems that violent tactics are exploiting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; some semi-organised grouping that can resort to greater violence, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some dramatic reprogramming of the human condition. It's not the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are bad; it's that &quot;bad&quot; people get ahead.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure how dramatic a change it would be to start having organ 
<br>
farms or nightly backups etc.
