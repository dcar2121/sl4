<em>&gt;&gt; -polynomial bound on resources assumes finite energy in a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; volume of space, and the light-speed limit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know. The bigger the star gets, the more it gravitationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attracts even more resources towards it, or itself towards others, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Light barrier. Whatever the star attracts, if there is an upper limit
<br>
to the amount of ressources possible in a finite volume of space, then
<br>
the amount of ressources available cannot increase faster than a
<br>
quadratic polynomial (as that is the increase in accessible volume for
<br>
an entity growing at the speed of light).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't necessarily be anywhere near you. I would have firewalls. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have multiple copies. I would let you assume you killed me. Be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done with it all, and such. Have your say, kill me if you wish, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's only a minor set back in the bigger scheme of things.
</em><br>
<p>I repeat, I would never threaten to kill you; that is not the issue.
<br>
And any technological advances you'd have, I would also have. Are you
<br>
claiming that there is no way I can inflict a large cost on you? (I
<br>
say large, because of human psychology; but if I was dealing with a
<br>
rational maximiser or a corporation, I only need to be able to a cost,
<br>
no matter how small).
