</em><br>
<p>Your caveat (below) is appreciated, but I do have a question
<br>
here, probably because I didn't start following this thread 
<br>
until very lately. 
<br>
<p>What about this objection to  &quot;If the AI is designed to be ecstatically
<br>
happy...&quot;?  Don't we often assume here that the AI manages to get
<br>
hold of its own source code?  Doesn't this allow that, given time,
<br>
the AI may deviate from its initial programming, i.e., that even though
<br>
it's being guided as it does consider and rewrite, it still has the potential
<br>
of sooner or later deviating from any initial characterization.
<br>
<p>As a concrete example of what I mean, we humans are very close
<br>
to getting to hack our own &quot;source code&quot;, and it will be unsurprising
<br>
to me if thirty years from now people are undergoing therapies
<br>
involving their genes that cause very fundamental changes to their
<br>
natures, e.g., entirely subverting the anger module or the hatred
<br>
module (two currently very unfashionable behavior components).
<br>
I don't see any reason a similar kind of thing can't happen to some
<br>
AI we devise or cause to be evolved.

<p><em>&gt; I apologise to the list, this post is littered with simplifications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and assumptions and simplistic ways of talking about AI's; I feel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do not detract from the point I was making, and are necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make that point in a reasonable space.
