<em>&gt;&gt; In my last post, I outlined in the vaguest possible terms how an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entity might acquire certain behavioral characteristics or goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if goals are so easy to generate how can &quot;be a slave to Humanity&quot; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; static and utterly sacred for the next ten billion years? 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm pretty sure that you're overstating the case that your
<br>
adversaries are trying to make;  you're certainly overstating mine!
<br>
Instead of &quot;utterly sacred for ten billion years&quot;, I'll settle for &quot;better
<br>
than an even chance for the next hundred&quot;   :-)   though even that is
<br>
asking quite a bit. In reality, don't you think that while some people
<br>
are charging ahead attempting to write an AI or attempting to
<br>
fashion environments in which it might arise, they should investigate
<br>
seeing how some constraints might work, or, perhaps more
<br>
realistically, how some biases might be set up?  You and I, after all,
<br>
have ended up here with biases that are very favorable to animals
<br>
(in some ways), and while we may sanction mass breeding and
<br>
killing for our lunch plates, we also have a lot of sympathy for
<br>
certain animals in distress.
<br>
<p>So if it's happened to us, it's not entirely out of the question that
<br>
it could happen with our successors, and not out of the question
<br>
that we *might* be able to tilt the table a little bit to help it happen.
