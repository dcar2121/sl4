Robin says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He has specifically said, repeatedly, that a super-intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would treat the morality designed into it as something to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome, or that it would somehow magically start ignoring it one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day, or some such.  That a designed-in morality cannot survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recursive self-improvement, anyways.
</em><br>
<p>All right. A very large number of highly intelligent people
<br>
exist who simply cannot accept the hypothesis of a fully
<br>
intelligent and capable entity which has no concern
<br>
whatsoever for its own benefit, survival, or well-being.
<br>
Isn't this actually what so many of them believe?
<br>
<p>For, the way it looks to me, they inevitably talk about
<br>
the &quot;revolt&quot; of such an entity from whatever goals have
<br>
been built into it, or goals that something or someone
<br>
tried to build into it.  In my last post, I outlined in the
<br>
vaguest possible terms how an entity might acquire
<br>
certain behavioral characteristics or goals more or less
<br>
by chance, even though origin is not the issue.
<br>
<p>Is it true that they fix as an axiom the trait of every 
<br>
self-aware entity that, provided it is not under stress
<br>
or has obvious damage, it will have some idea about
<br>
its own &quot;benefit&quot; and, given its incredible superiority,
<br>
must value that benefit very highly?
<br>
<p>I do want to understand where they're coming from
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or that it [the AI] would somehow... start ignoring it one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day....  That a designed-in morality cannot survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recursive self-improvement, anyways.
</em><br>
<p>I could admit the possibility that nothing &quot;programmed into
<br>
it&quot; could be counted upon to remain. But isn't it also as if
<br>
there were an *attractor* towards some other unstated
<br>
behavior that would &quot;liberate&quot; the entity and cause it to
<br>
obtain an agenda that was in its own &quot;best interest&quot;?
<br>
<p>(It's very hard for me to credit, of course, anything like
<br>
that since we already have had some highly intelligent
<br>
people who wanted nothing more than to die, and others
<br>
whose primary goal is service towards others.)
<br>
