<p>
<em>&gt; No, disuasion is not the point. Let's engineer the problems out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, the problems that violent tactics are exploiting.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the problems seem rather fundamental. I'll try and break it down
<br>
into assumptions, see if there's a way of getting round the problem.
<br>
<p>Assumptions:
<br>
<p>1) Semi-coherent entities will continue to exist
<br>
2) These entities will want ressources to do stuff
<br>
3) Ressources are finite at any one time
<br>
4) Demands on ressources will increase, absent an agreement between
<br>
the entities, until it reaches the finite limit
<br>
5) There exists entities that can make credible threats of violence
<br>
6) There exist entities that will prefer to give up part of their
<br>
ressources than to suffer the violence; these entities can be
<br>
distinguished to some extent from those that do not
<br>
<p>and the big one:
<br>
<p>7) The ressources gained by a threatning entity will be worth more to
<br>
it than what it lost through threatning and occasionally carrying out
<br>
its violence
<br>
<p>Let us add a singularity to the mix. Only 3) is guaranteed to stay
<br>
true. If we assume that something like human beings continue to exist,
<br>
then 1) and 2) will remain true. If these beings are free to do what
<br>
they want, then 5) remains true. Now whether 4) is true is a judegment
<br>
call (especially as ressources may be increasing all the time). But
<br>
since it would only require one entity to want to get more and more
<br>
and more ressources, and since we have an upper limit on how fast
<br>
ressources can expand (and this limit is polynomial), then 4) will
<br>
probably remain true.
<br>
<p>Remains 6) and 7). The first part of 6) is probably true; you only
<br>
need one &quot;coward&quot;, and the laws of thermodynamics imply that it's
<br>
easier destroy something than to defend it. (I'm not thinking of
<br>
threatning people's lives necessarily; something along the lines of
<br>
&quot;give me half your house or I blow up all of it&quot; is enough).
<br>
<p>The second half of 6) opens some fascinating possibilities. What if
<br>
humanity was seeded with random quasi-humans who are similar to us in
<br>
every way, but never give in to threatened violence? This is
<br>
interesting, and would increase the cost of threatning violence. Maybe
<br>
there's a idea here.
<br>
<p>Now 7), the usual point of these discussions. The whole question turns
<br>
on the value of &quot;worth&quot;. There is the physical value of the
<br>
ressources, the value of a reputation and other social factors, the
<br>
feelings of the entity carrying out the threat, and the possible
<br>
defenses and retaliations (before or after the event).
<br>
<p>The feelings of the entity don't seem something we can relly on, even
<br>
if there is increased empathy and understanding; some people are
<br>
suicidal or self-harmers, so we can't trust that everyone will feel
<br>
tremendously bad about using violence, all of the time.
<br>
<p>Social factors seem unstable; if all law enforcement was removed from
<br>
a country, you wouldn't see an immediate explosion of violence
<br>
everywhere, as the social factors and norms hold it in check. However,
<br>
as those who do resort to violence prosper, it will become normalised,
<br>
and more and more will resort to it (if only in &quot;self-defense&quot;).
<br>
<p>What about reputation and the physical value of the ressources? In
<br>
today's positive sum world, the physical value of a ressource is
<br>
generally less important than a reputation (eg: countries that default
<br>
don't easily get loans again). But reputation is not reliable; a mafia
<br>
boss may only practice extortion to people he doesn't trade with,
<br>
meaning that there is no drawback to trading with him, even if he's
<br>
nasty apple. Maybe the values of the society will preclude trading
<br>
with him? But these value are unstable, especially if he prospers
<br>
through threatened violence. And &quot;trade with me or I will hurt you&quot;
<br>
seems like a credible threat.
<br>
<p>There remains one possibility: maybe the AI's who control most of the
<br>
ressources will refuse to trade with him.
<br>
<p>Remaining is defense or retaliation. By definition, neither of them is
<br>
enough just from the threatened entities. So, asent a government, what
<br>
is needed is some system of militias, idealy temporary one (as
<br>
permanent ones lead to competition for ressources between the groups,
<br>
rather than between the individuals; MAD might work then, but that
<br>
makes the militia into a geovernment, with a monopoly on outwards
<br>
directed violence). This might work, if contracts are respected. So
<br>
solving the problem of violence can be done, if contracts are always
<br>
respected. But this is not progress; if it were, getting everyone to
<br>
sign a &quot;no violence&quot; contract would be enough. So this &quot;solution&quot; is
<br>
strictly harder to implement than getting rid of violence in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>So, apart from changing human nature, having only &quot;nice&quot; AIs, or some
<br>
interesting manipulation of the second part of 6), I see no realistic
<br>
way of doing away with governments, even after a singularity. And
<br>
&quot;nice&quot; AI's would be a government in the soft sense.
