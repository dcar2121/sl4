<em>&gt;&gt; Personality may be pop psychology, but it's not a concept devoid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information. It's useful in assigning certain people to certain jobs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It /is/ devoid of information. It's folk psych. You need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressing the basis of the brain and what allows the variation that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed (or not allowed) by the architectures and such, not going the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way around.
</em><br>
<p>It is useful information. I use it all the time when deciding which
<br>
friends to invite to which events; so far, it's track record is good,
<br>
certainly better than random guessing. Hence it contains information.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; for instance. Assuming the AI could not just brute force the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and predict everyone's actions in every circumstances (chaos would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probably forbid this), then the AI would have to rely on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simplified model that gives it enough information to make decisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Make what decisions? I suspect you are going back to the idea of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorship of an ai? I don't understand. :-/ More on this below.
</em><br>
<p>No needed to be a dictator; any interaction needs some information
<br>
about the being interacted with.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Looks like you're assuming a spectrum with democracy and dictatorship at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two opposite ends of the line.
</em><br>
<p>Linguistically, and in most societies, they are. Hence to get people
<br>
thinking that the best gov &quot;might not be a democracy! really!&quot;, is to
<br>
say &quot;it might be a dictatorship!&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My stick is bigger than yours? That's the best we can come up with?
</em><br>
<p>Yep. Depressing, really.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, it could be no government at all. Have you considered that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies are liberating ? That they don't force us to rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments? That they allow us to live our lives without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions that governments used to be there to help face up to? etc.
</em><br>
<p>I still fail to see how some people are going to be disuaded from
<br>
using violence (or, more likely, the threat of violence), unless by
<br>
some semi-organised grouping that can resort to greater violence, or
<br>
some dramatic reprogramming of the human condition. It's not the most
<br>
people are bad; it's that &quot;bad&quot; people get ahead.
<br>
