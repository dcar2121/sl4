<em>&gt; By the way, if the AI has any long-term goals, then it will want to

<em>&gt;...my calculator seems to display a tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;urge to finish any computation I key into it, but doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to be the least bit reluctance toward being turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off or even thrown away.  Why do most people here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appear to never to entertain the idea that an AI might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather similar?
</em><br>
<p>Most existing AI systems are like that.
<br>
<p>I think the subtext here is that people are interested in the Friendly
<br>
AI problem.
<br>
<p>If the AI you're talking about is willing and competent to correctly
<br>
answer general questions, then we do have something that pertains to
<br>
Friendly AI even though the device has no long term plan or even no
<br>
ability or desire to do anything more than answer questions.
<br>
Eventually someone asks it &quot;How can I get a lot of money?&quot; or anything
<br>
else pertaining to a long-term plan or complex wish.  The answer might
<br>
have the form &quot;Buy computer X from vendor Y, connect it to the
<br>
internet, run this 100MB program on it, and type in the username and
<br>
password for your brokerage account&quot;.  Then there would be
<br>
Friendliness issues with the program running on the new computer X.
