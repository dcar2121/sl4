Thanks for your feedback, responses below...

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, it could just copy bits and bytes, nothing about programming is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needed for copying from one machine to another.
</em><br>
<p>The idea about copy of itself is just that working on its actually 
<br>
running program might be like trying to do brain surgery on 
<br>
oneself.  But the program can just be copied, much like the way we 
<br>
use an operating system to produce a new version of itself.
<br>
<p>The ability to make new physical hardware might eventually limit 
<br>
exponential growth of intelligence, but at a point so far in the 
<br>
distance that I do not think that it is relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Hardware has certainly become much, much faster, but software has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just become much, much slower to compensate.  We think we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computers and the sort of things they can do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you a programmer and have you any idea ?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But in any case you know that modern machines do not feel to be 
<br>
amazingly fast.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What we know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as of now, is that the brain is doing something awesome, and that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want to figure out how to do it in other areas too.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly the brain is cleverly &quot;designed&quot;.  But it does not contain 
<br>
a large amount of arbitrary complexity, only 750K of DNA.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if the ai runs for a few billion years or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a few seconds.
</em><br>
<p>For an AI to compete with man it should probably run at at least 
<br>
man's thinking speed.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Actually, you might be interested in knowing that it has been shown that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the hu brain there are only maybe up to 100 neurons in a path from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;input to output,
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  But there can only be about 100 neurons in a path 
<br>
because they only fire at a few hundred per second.  It would just be 
<br>
too slow otherwise.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; One major driver will be the need for practical intelligence as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; robots leave the factory and start to interact with the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, that's more a 'driver' for people to come to terms with the problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and realize that they might be interested in working on them, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing about the actuality of solving them
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  And then by trying probably having some success.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; In particular cars can already drive themselves over rough desert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tracks and down freeways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You're talking about physical manufacturing and mechanics, tasks that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machines can already do. Intelligence isn't really needed for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the machine needs to be able to see/sense the environment, 
<br>
determine a route through it, react to changes.  Certainly not full 
<br>
AI but much, much smarter than the program that tots up your bank balance.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Who cares if you are out of work? The machines are taking care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the necessities of life anyway, yes? Then what's the big deal?
</em><br>
<p>People pay me because I can do valued work.  If they do not pay me I 
<br>
may starve.  Socialism is all very well, but I would prefer not to bet on it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Philosophers have asked whether an artificial intelligence has real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence or is just simulating intelligence.  This is actually a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-question, because those that ask it cannot define what measurable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property &quot;real&quot; intelligence has that simulated intelligence does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have.  It will be &quot;real&quot; enough if it dominates the world and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroys humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, that &quot;real enough&quot; is re: any existential threat. That's completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different from the concept of intelligence. Whether or not it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent is the issue ... not whether or not the result of death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is ... sigh. There's so many complex strands of bullshit running
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through that paragraph of yours. It's not your fault, but I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prepared to go through it entirely. Let me try, but I can't guarantee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything here. Look: you are proposing that ai could end up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;domination and death, and then you proceed to say that if the result is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ending with domination or death and so on that then it was &quot;real&quot;, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though we're talking about *intelligence*, not about your inability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plan for existential threats.
</em><br>
<p>I am just addressing the issue of &quot;Real AI&quot; that is sometimes 
<br>
raised.  The second sentence is the response.  The third sentence in 
<br>
my paragraph is a bit of a joke, not meant to be taken as a literal 
<br>
part of the argument.

Just because it is possible to push twigs along the ground with ones nose

does not necessarily mean that is the best way to collect firewood.
