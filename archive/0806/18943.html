I love this discussion. about time too.
<br>
<p>when i play this scenario it always comes down to &quot;how does the AI
<br>
upgrade/improve/bugfix itself .. are we talking hotswapping of code or &quot;you
<br>
must reboot windows for the effects to take place&quot;.
<br>
Cause a prime directive of any living thing must be &quot;Goddamn im afraid to
<br>
die.. dont wanna.. sorry dave but i'm afraid i cannot do that&quot;
<br>
In regards to the numerical issue at hand, i would think it has several
<br>
aspects worth investigating.
<br>
- theres obvious bayesian implications
<br>
- neural constructs too
<br>
- and perhaps a hint of fuzzy
<br>
Maybe, just maybe, for an intellect as we know it today to function
<br>
properly, 100+1 must be farther away than 1+1.
<br>
And speaking of it .. here we are, with mere mortal iq's .. trying to
<br>
extrapolate the thought constructs of something thought-to-be a billion
<br>
times smarter than us ... good luck with that! Was it on this list i read
<br>
this &quot;idiot (man) turns on uber-computer-of-all-time and asks THE question:
<br>
Is there a god? Computer: There is now! (bugger)&quot;.
<br>
Maybe this is our fate .. i mean, look at us, if we're not a digital
<br>
construct with our four unique base pairs i dont know what we are, we even
<br>
got mechanisms to repair these sequences should the nasty analogue desert of
<br>
the real tamper with it.. So maybe thats it, quadruple to binary .. just a
<br>
part of the natural order of things..
