<em>&gt; -the existence of backups is not a boon here. It reduces the threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of death, but I phrased my threat as a threat against property, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. And the laws of thermodynamics seem to imply that it is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaper (ressource wise) to blow something up than it is to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing from getting blown up.
</em><br>
<p>I am more interested in processes than objects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -polynomial bound on resources assumes finite energy in a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume of space, and the light-speed limit.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know. The bigger the star gets, the more it gravitationally 
<br>
attracts even more resources towards it, or itself towards others, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -the only properties of governments I'm discussing is their law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcement and their monopoly on violence.
</em><br>
<p>It's not violence if the rate of exploitation is equivalent to the 
<br>
typical background noise anyway, so that's why I'm talking about 
<br>
backups, redundancy, and making sure that people can't stab you [unless 
<br>
you're ok in a certain environment and reasonably like the people 
<br>
around you].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ultimately, after a singularity, I want something from you, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threaten you with the destruction of your resources. What purely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological development will prevent this from happening?
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't necessarily be anywhere near you. I would have firewalls. I 
<br>
would have multiple copies. I would let you assume you killed me. Be 
<br>
done with it all, and such. Have your say, kill me if you wish, but 
<br>
that's only a minor set back in the bigger scheme of things.
