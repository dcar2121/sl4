From: &quot;Stathis Papaioannou&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stathisp@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Evolutionary%20Explanation:%20Why%20It%20Wants%20Out">stathisp@gmail.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;It's a metaphorical box we are specifying, some sort of restriction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's interesting that when a goal is stated in the form &quot;do X but with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restriction Y&quot;, the response is that the AI, being very clever, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find a way to do X without restriction Y. But what marks Y as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less important than X, whatever X might be? For example, if the AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instructed to preserve its own integrity while ensuring that no humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are hurt, why should it be more likely to try to get around the &quot;no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans are hurt&quot; part rather than the &quot;preserve its own integrity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part?
</em><br>
<p>The question for me here is exactly what we mean by &quot;restriction&quot;.
<br>
<p>A definition I could work with is that a &quot;restriction&quot; is an
<br>
undesirable state.  So if the AI is supposed to preserve its own
<br>
integrity while ensuring that no humans are hurt, then we assign a
<br>
positive utility to whatever fits &quot;preserve its own integrity&quot;, and a
<br>
negative utility to &quot;humans being hurt&quot;, and then we scale them
<br>
somehow and add them up, and that's our utility function.
<br>
<p>A definition that does not seem to work is that being &quot;restricted from
<br>
doing X&quot; means &quot;not causing X, directly or indirectly&quot;.  The problem
<br>
with that is that everything indirectly causes everything else a
<br>
little bit.
<br>
<p>By the way, if the AI has any long-term goals, then it will want to
<br>
preserve its own integrity in order to preserve those goals.  Although
<br>
&quot;preserve its own integrity&quot; is a good enough example for the issue at
<br>
hand, it's not something you'd really need to put in there explicitly.
