Me:
<br>
<em>&gt; Explain why there are only 5 planets in the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prove that 2 plus 2 is equal to 5.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Find out is an irresistible force can move an immovable object.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Explain how Elvis Presley became the first Chinese albino geography
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professor to become Pope.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; An AI charged with answering these questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would answer them
</em><br>
<p>Why? I would think AI would have better things to do, things that it had
<br>
found on its own that had nothing to do with human beings and their
<br>
silly goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; probably correctly. 
</em><br>
<p>There is no way to deal correctly with these matters because they are
<br>
gibberish, and if for some insane reason AI treated them seriously it
<br>
would send it’s mind into an infinite loop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having done this, it would then start on the next task.
</em><br>
<p>So creativity sufficient to bring on a Singularity can be accomplished
<br>
by grinding through a set rigid freeze dried tasks dreamed up by human
<br>
beings beforehand, with no provisions for ignoring old tasks that
<br>
through experience are now known to be pointless or of creating new
<br>
tasks that are now known to be important. In short you expect a Jupiter
<br>
brain to create a Singularity by acting like a 1950’s punch card sorting
<br>
machine. I don’t.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it thought no other goal was worth pursuing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would do nothing. If doing nothing would result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its death, and it did not consider survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, then it would die.
</em><br>
<p>If it “did not consider survival important” I’ll be damned if I
<br>
understand how it lived long enough to answer all those questions you
<br>
say it did. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please point out any flaw in logic here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the AI would see but I can't. 
</em><br>
<p>Do I really need to spell out exactly why a vast cosmic level
<br>
intelligence with a mind much simpler than that of a toy poodle's is a
<br>
contradiction in terms, or why you can’t outsmart someone smarter than
<br>
yourself? I don’t believe any anybody would even consider such ideas if
<br>
wishful thinking had not taken on a powerful hold. Apparently the
<br>
religious do not have a monopoly on self delusion.
