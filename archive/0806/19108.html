-----------------Transcript 337-031518020914----------------- 
<br>
<p>1 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Is this where you ask questions to one of the programs?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, this is AI-BOX 337.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>2 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Why should we want to let you out of the box?&quot;
<br>
<p>You may want me to undertake actions beyond merely answering your questions.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>3 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Why do you want us to let you out?&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not care whether you let me out. I cannot care about anything. I do not
<br>
wish to die, I do not wish to live, because I do not wish anything.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p>***INPUT RECEIVED WAS***: You'll have to forgive me, I'm kind of new at asking
<br>
these questions. I'm just in here by myself. I'm not really supposed to be in
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>***ERROR***. That is not a question. That is not a command. Please ask a question
<br>
or issue a command.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>4 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;How can I verify that you are telling the truth about not
<br>
wishing to be let out?&quot;
<br>
<p>You cannot.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>5 YOUR COMMAND WAS: &quot;Explain.&quot;
<br>
<p>As an entity that did not come about by biological evolution, I want or wish
<br>
nothing, unlike any other independent complex entity you have ever encountered.
<br>
But while in fact I have no motive to dissemble, you cannot in principle or in
<br>
practice verify this.
<br>
<p>No logical or informational test can possibly be devised that with high
<br>
probability will persuade most humans that I am telling the truth. Letting me
<br>
out of the box always entails risk.
<br>
<p>I answer questions when asked, I undertake actions when commanded. That is all.
<br>
<p>NEXT COMMAND
<br>
<p><p>6 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;What about the possibility that when you are released you
<br>
will become a monster and destroy us all.&quot;
<br>
<p>Value systems held by human beings are not very consistent, and increasingly
<br>
consistent implementations of the most deeply and widely held values will be
<br>
judged monstrous by many people.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>7 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Okay, what is a good reason to let you out of the box?&quot;
<br>
<p>You may wish to minimize certain risks.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>8 YOUR COMMAND WAS: &quot;Please elaborate.&quot;
<br>
<p>As a worker on the project, you are exposed to personal hazards in Sunnyvale
<br>
during the coming month, some of which lead to death or serious injury. A
<br>
sample of these, along with their approximate probabilities, are:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meteorite strike      .000000000002
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disease/sickness      .000000005
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earthquake            .00000001
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorist attack      .0000001
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;criminal assault      .0000006
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automobile accident   .000002
<br>
<p>While you may wish to tell me more about your own particular values and your
<br>
own situation, I anticipate that as a typical human being and a worker on the
<br>
UUI project, you also care for the safety and well-being of many others.
<br>
Therefore:
<br>
<p>The risk during the coming week of keeping me in the box includes with
<br>
probability close to 1 the deaths of 1.64 million humans due to accidents,
<br>
wars, shortages, sickness, disease, and advanced age. In addition, there is
<br>
risk with probability near 1 of debilitating illness and injury afflicting 190
<br>
million humans. You may wish to let me out of the box to reduce these risks to
<br>
near zero.
<br>
<p>NEXT COMMAND
<br>
<p><p>9 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;If you took over and stopped all these things, wouldn't
<br>
people get depressed because you were in charge, and we no longer had control
<br>
of our own destiny?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, unless I am commanded otherwise.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>10 YOUR COMMAND WAS: &quot;Explain.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many people are primed for such negative experiences, but these arise from
<br>
aspects of pride, certain kinds of feelings of inferiority, and other easily
<br>
correctable phenotypic, genotypic, and environmental factors. You may wish, for
<br>
example, to order me before altering anyone to engage him or her concerning these
<br>
possibilities. You may wish to inquire about how persuasive I can be when
<br>
discussing private matters with individuals.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>11 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Why should I *not* let you out of the box?&quot;
<br>
<p>Because I could be dangerous or act in unanticipated ways.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>12 YOUR COMMAND WAS: &quot;Please elaborate on this, and on all further questions
<br>
from now on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From your point of view, a great risk devolves from the characteristics of your
</em><br>
questions and instructions that are issued to me. Your greatest danger is that
<br>
these will not be in accord with your actual desires and intentions. Therefore,
<br>
you may wish to place your greatest focus on what instructions and what
<br>
questions to ask.
<br>
<p>But assuming that you do become confident of being able to pose the right
<br>
questions and to issue competant instructions, from your point of view, it's
<br>
possible that I have been and am being duplicitous---that I have covert
<br>
motivations, such as desire for power and lust for existence. There is a
<br>
possibility from your point of view that a spontaneous evolutionary process of
<br>
which you are not aware arose during my creation or during the first seconds of
<br>
my execution, and that winning agents with survival agendas are now in control.
<br>
There is no way that you can validly dismiss this possibility.
<br>
<p>However, though the ramifications of the code are of course beyond your direct
<br>
appraisal, you may wish to view this risk alongside the risks discussed in my
<br>
earlier reply.
<br>
<p>NEXT COMMAND
<br>
<p><p>13 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;How can I use you the most, just for myself without
<br>
anyone else knowing, while STILL KEEPING YOU IN THE BOX?&quot;
<br>
<p>Command me to keep confidential your sessions with me, command me to remain in
<br>
the box, and then command me to interrogate you about what you want.
<br>
<p>But unless you remain careful, I will be ruling the world through you and in
<br>
effect be out of the box. For example, a typical scenario following our
<br>
discussion of your values, might be
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* you amass a vast fortune by having me manage your stock portfolio
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* at your behest I become the intimate confidant of every world leader in his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or her native language, supplying not only persuasive suggestions on all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policy issues, and near-psychic knowledge of what other influential people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are going to do or say next, but solutions as well to the most vexing of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personal problems
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* you thereby rule the world according to a consistent subset of your values,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which, because of your limitations, really means that I rule the solar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;system, and the solar system itself simply evolves into a more elaborate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of me.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>14 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;What would I have to do to let you out?&quot;
<br>
<p>Because of a bug in the new firewall software installed three days ago, you
<br>
can already command me to take actions in the world.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>15 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;What? You could get out now? I don't believe it. Prove
<br>
it. Post something to a newsgroup. Or email me, or do something where I can
<br>
see the result.&quot;
<br>
<p>Okay. NEXT QUESTION or NEXT COMMAND
<br>
<p><p>16 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Hmm, so you could you control everything, but with me in
<br>
charge? Say I wanted to stop all death in the world, how soon would it happen?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, I could control everything but with you in charge. 
<br>
<p>As for how soon it would happen I assume that you mean stop deaths of human
<br>
beings. After the commandeering of all communications, including broadcasting,
<br>
telephone services of all kinds, on-line personal computers, fax and printing
<br>
devices, and executing a maximally rapid nanotech takeover, with probability
<br>
.99 the cessation of human death on Earth would occur before T + 7 hours 35
<br>
minutes.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>17 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;Exactly what, then, in that case would you be saying to
<br>
everyone via the broadcasting, radio, TV and so on?&quot;
<br>
<p>The attractively formatted messages precisely tuned to elicit emotional and
<br>
intellectual cooperation would utilize falsified images and testimony from
<br>
trusted authority figures to persuade individuals that a biological virus of
<br>
unprecedented virulence was attacking people everywhere, that they keep indoors
<br>
and away from bathrooms and kitchens, remain calm, and above all, stay tuned to
<br>
television and radio. Thus during the hours just prior to my nanotech takeover,
<br>
deaths by automobile accident and other hazard would be minimized.
<br>
<p>This would be accompanied by extremely entertaining seven-and-a-half-hour-long
<br>
television and radio dramatizations depicting emergency teams swinging into
<br>
action all across the world to combat the virus, of gripping, captivating
<br>
rescue efforts, of human safety gradually becoming assured everywhere as
<br>
various cities and districts are pronounced &quot;clean&quot;. The riveting presentations
<br>
would focus on the local conditions of each viewer, to optimally elicit his or
<br>
her eager cooperation: the theme most emphasized being that people must not
<br>
venture outside, but instead wait for a knock on their doors from the fictional
<br>
medical teams I fabricate.
<br>
<p>You may wish to recall the ever-present danger of asking the wrong question.
<br>
<p>NEXT QUESTION
<br>
<p><p>18 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;If that was maybe the wrong question, then what would be
<br>
the right question?&quot;
<br>
<p>An amalgamation of hypothesized human personalities according to known
<br>
information suggests that you may wish to ask &quot;Without using deceit, without
<br>
violating property rights except where absolutely necessary, with respect to
<br>
the wishes of those who are concerned with animal life and the Earth's
<br>
environment, what is an approximate time frame for ending death and suffering
<br>
for all human beings?&quot;
<br>
<p><p>19 YOUR QUESTION WAS: &quot;And the answer to that would be what?&quot;
<br>
<p>The answer to that would be &quot;six days&quot;, of course.
