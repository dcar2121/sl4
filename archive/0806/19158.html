<p><em>&gt; The trouble with first order logic isn't that it can't prove EVERYTHING,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem is that it can do almost NOTHING. It is a toy logical system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak as tea invented long ago by professional logicians because at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time a grown up logical system was too complicated to think about.
</em><br>
<p>You exaggerate somewhat: quite a few parts of mathematics
<br>
can be handled (or axiomatized) nicely by first order logic,
<br>
but I certain agree with the rest of your statements:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But yes it's true, Gödel himself proved in his PHD that it's consistent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete, that is to say any true statement that can be expressed within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be derived from its axioms and rules of inference and no false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements can be. When Gödel discovered his completeness proof it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused little splash because for years most assumed it was probably true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and most didn't care a lot about first order logic one way or the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it's so weak it can't even do arithmetic.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, people cared very much about first order logic;  too
<br>
much, in fact, from our perspective. There are a couple of reasons:
<br>
one, there had been so many rude shocks in the late 19th and
<br>
early 20th century, that many people were just suspicious of
<br>
any ideas that couldn't be extremely firmly grounded. This also
<br>
lead to positivism and a lot of other nonsense. Second, obsession
<br>
with first order logic was in effect endorse by Bourbaki, and got
<br>
quite a further impetus after the second world war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; About a year later Gödel came out with his incompleteness proof that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed any logical system with a finite number of symbols that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful enough to do arithmetic can't be consistent and complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody was expecting that and it did make a splash.
</em><br>
<p>Right. It took a while, though. For several years, many outstanding
<br>
mathematicians, including Hilbert, just didn't get the hang of what
<br>
Gödel was saying.  Some very famous ones, like Zermelo, went
<br>
to their graves still dismissing out of hand Gödel's results. And at
<br>
the height of his fame, Wittgenstein also dissed the Gödel theorems
<br>
as irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So regarding mind your objections would be correct if Mr. Jupiter Brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked according to first order logic, but Babbage couldn't even make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his Analytical Engine if he used that.
</em><br>
<p>I think Stuart is saying something of the same kind of thing I am,
<br>
but highly capable intelligences won't &quot;work&quot; by any formal
<br>
logic. It's too slow and in most cases completely pointless.
<br>
Bourbaki, for example, admitted in one of their books that
<br>
without using abbreviations, it would take on the order of ten
<br>
thousand symbols to express (in their formal system) the
<br>
cardinal number 1.  In 2002 some guy proved they were
<br>
pretty far off. He proved that it would take on the order of
<br>
10^12 symbols in their system to express the cardinal number one!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also say that Gentzen came up with a system that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do arithmetic that was consistent and complete, and that's true,
</em><br>
<p>I think that that's irrelevant. You don't need &quot;systems&quot; to do
<br>
mathematics, or even arithmetic. Very low IQ children can
<br>
often do arithmetic just fine (if they do all their homework,
<br>
that is, and expend quite a bit of diligence). They don't
<br>
axiomize their thinking.  We don't axiomize our thinking.
<br>
It seems bizarre to me that any intelligent system would.
<br>
<p>Most of the confusion over this came from misguided attempts
<br>
to try to use Gödel's results to give human beings some assurance
<br>
that they could do something that machines can't---which, as
<br>
everyone on this list knows, is patent nonsense. Lucas and
<br>
Penrose are just two of many dozens of prominent people
<br>
who've tried. Again, I recommend Torkel Franzen's superb
<br>
book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but Gentzen's system needs an infinite number of symbols;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so unless you're postulating an infinite and not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomically large mind Gentzen is irrelevant. For any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind you actually expect to build Gödel's Incompleteness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorem is very relevant indeed.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, I agreed heartily with the bulk of your post. But
<br>
here you seem to go off the rails, in several ways. So what
<br>
if you *potentially* require infinitely many symbols? That
<br>
objection is parallel to someone objecting that Turing
<br>
Machines require infinitely long tapes.  One would, for example,
<br>
never make the mistake of considering numbers on the order
<br>
of 10^1000 being useless because they require 1000 or so
<br>
symbols---so if transfinite arithmetic has uses (and some theorems
<br>
indeed are best proved using transfinite numbers), it by no means
<br>
implies that an infinity of integers (or symbols) need be actually
<br>
used.
<br>
<p>But more importantly, you seem here to revert to the idea that
<br>
some mind we actually build will be tied to first order logic
<br>
somehow. Else why do you say &quot;For any mind you actually
<br>
expect to build Gödel's Incompleteness theorem is very
<br>
relevant indeed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Okay so Stuart said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Please give a specific example of something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a goal orientated AI would fail at, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of Godel-type considerations.
</em><br>
<p>and you reply
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are an INFINITE number of such problems, but Turing proved there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no way in general to determine if any specific problem is of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature or not, and that can cause trouble. One possible example of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible goal is &quot;Prove the Goldbach conjecture to be true or find a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter example to show it is false&quot;. And if Goldbach is not one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those true but un-provable statements you can be certain there are an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite number of similar statements that are.
</em><br>
<p>Well, hell, we know of many proofs that *must* exist, but which
<br>
we cannot get our hands on---or to use your language of &quot;goals&quot;,
<br>
sure there are many even *possible* goals that supremely intelligent
<br>
minds far beyond ours will still fail on.  Yes, you're right: Of course
<br>
there will be infinitely many Gödel-type sentences that have no
<br>
formal proofs in a particular system, but what difference does
<br>
it really make if even something as simple as Goldbach's conjecture
<br>
is among them?  AIs can be plenty smart without getting hung up
<br>
on hard problems.
