<em>&gt;&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While it has many expressions in literature (Chaitin has his own quaint

<em>&gt; pedestrian expressions of the concept), let us work from the fact that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are arguing against a trivial consequence of the Invariance Theorem, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which opens Chapter 2 of my copy of Li &amp; Vitanyi. It is prefaced with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the following quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The following 'Invariance Theorem' is the cornerstone for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequent development of the [algorithmic information] theory. In fact, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for many later applications it embodies the entire  theoretical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundation.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yup, it sure is a theorem. It doesn't contradict anything I've said.
<br>
<p>I think I know what's confusing you. The claim I'm refuting is that a 
<br>
machine can't output another machine which is more complex than itself 
<br>
(you may suppose the input tape is blank; the program I gave doesn't 
<br>
look at any input).
<br>
<p>Now, if I had said &quot;here's a program which outputs a *string* which is 
<br>
more complex than itself&quot;, then that would sound pretty weird to you, 
<br>
because you're automatically applying different definitions of 
<br>
complexity to the program and the string. When I talk about the 
<br>
complexity of a program, you might be thinking of the program's length, 
<br>
but if I talk about the complexity of a string, you think of the length 
<br>
of the shortest program which generates that string.
<br>
<p>Of course, a program is nothing but a string. But you need to apply the 
<br>
same definition of complexity to both strings; String 1 is a program and 
<br>
String 2 is its output (in this case another program). If you assert 
<br>
that S2 can't have greater Kolmogorov complexity than S1 then you're wrong:
<br>
<p>Try running my lisp program. It'll output another program that you can 
<br>
run. If you keep running them, you'll notice that each program outputs a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;brand new program, distinct from all the previous ones. Since there 
<br>
are infinitely many programs in this sequence, their complexity must 
<br>
grow without bound. Thus one of them must output a program more complex 
<br>
than itself.
