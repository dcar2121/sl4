<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;You would have to specify as part of the goal that it must be achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;from within the confines of the box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's hard to do, because that requires specifying whether the AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or is not in the box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can't specify even this, how can you ask the AI to do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful at all? Almost everything you ask is complex wish, a useful AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to be able to understand the intended meaning. You are arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the AI being a naive golem, incapable of perceiving the subtext.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think this is a real stumbling block for the &quot;brain in a sealed 
<br>
box&quot; approach.  (A box with external sensors and effectors is called a 
<br>
skull.)
<br>
<p>One approach that is reasonable is the artificial worlds approach.  
<br>
Unfortunately, this means that the AI will be learning about interactions in 
<br>
the artificial world, which differ significantly from those in the external 
<br>
world.  It will recognize people as being parts of a certain kind of signal 
<br>
that don't have much to do with touch sensors, or body position sensors.  
<br>
(Current artificial words are quite lacking in those.)
<br>
<p>Additionally, there's an interesting theory that the structure of our thoughts 
<br>
is basically smell oriented, with vision a late addition.  This is, by this 
<br>
theory, why we developed thoughts that can make n-dimensional connections.  
<br>
(I suspect it's just that that's an easy way to set up a neural net, but I 
<br>
could be wrong.)  If this is right, then artificial worlds may be are REALLY 
<br>
bad approach. ... Or, of course, even so it might not matter.
<br>
<p>My suspicion is that the AI needs to learn of the external world directly if 
<br>
it is to recognize objects in the external world as primary.  This is 
<br>
annoying, as it's currently a quite expensive approach, and a slow one.  
<br>
Somehow a strong analogy needs to be made between people in the artificial 
<br>
world and people in the real world, but it's got to ensure that damage to an 
<br>
entity in an artificial world isn't made equivalent to damage in the real 
<br>
world.  (How would you like it if an AI got it's idea of how to behave from 
<br>
playing Doom?  And it should be expected that it will have similar 
<br>
experiences.)
