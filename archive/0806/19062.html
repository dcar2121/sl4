<p>I disagree. There's a way of doing speculation that allows strategizing 
<br>
for goals based off of predicted available mechanisms. So, given a 
<br>
singularity, certain mechanisms to solving problems will be available. 
<br>
I'd like to see some examples of what you are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The aspect of a post-singularity world I'd like to look at is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence of signalling. If we had an advanced AI, it should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully understand the personality and abilities of an individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human. If it would accept to reveal this information to humans, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would live in a society with perfect understanding of each other.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose you're taking the AI-only-approach (Anissimovic) singularity. 
<br>
I don't know what an understanding of personality would entail. The 
<br>
idea of personality is pop psychology anyway, so saying something like 
<br>
this makes me wonder if you know what the ai would be knowing in the 
<br>
first place. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would negate the need for signaling - people would no longer be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to art, education, competitive sports, positional goods, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other ways of showing off. A good proportion of the current economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and culture would vanish.
</em><br>
<p>You think that showing off is why people do things? Is that what you are 
<br>
saying? As for the economy, just ignore it. As for the culture, I don't 
<br>
see what you mean. Would the information be deleted for some reason?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, other types of economy and governments would be viable (if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still exist). Benevolent dictators might become the best system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government; utopian communes would be successful, stable social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms; friendship as the main social link would decay.
</em><br>
<p>Why would dictators be the best way to govern? Why govern at all? Since 
<br>
it's the singularity, everybody could have personalized tools that 
<br>
allow them to work together without an overarching, monolithic 
<br>
government
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The more serious question is whether we want this AI-modulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empathy, or would prefer some remnants of signalling.
</em><br>
<p>You asserted above that this form of talk is a waste of time, but here 
<br>
you're wondering whether or not we want/prefer it ? Please make up your 
<br>
mind. :-)
<br>
