Oh, I like the this post!

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arguments in favor of RSI:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Humans can improve themselves by going to school, practicing skills,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading, etc. (arguably not RSI).
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, not exactly RSI, I would just say its assimilating external complexity.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Moore's Law predicts computers will have as much computing power as human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains in a few decades, or sooner if we figure out more efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms for AI.
</em><br>
<p><p>I've always wondered about moore's law. It may be exponential as long as
<br>
computing architecture complexity does not rival some function of collective
<br>
or relevant human complexity. Of course the two are not strictly distinct
<br>
however.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Increasing machine intelligence should be a straightforward hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upgrade.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not sure. We currently do not really treat calculations / second as a
<br>
determiner of IQ. It may not be strictly qualitative. Also keep in mind that
<br>
the interior complexity of our brains is describable with a very low
<br>
complexity (some subset of whats in our DNA plus the contextual complexity
<br>
of the cellular environment) with respect to acquired knowledge. I suppose
<br>
though that the term 'hardware upgrade' isn't really overly specific in that
<br>
sense. There should be a correlation of intelligence with a function of the
<br>
density of interconnections in the hardware and the total complexity of the
<br>
information that is stored in the hardware. Again though, as I've mentioned
<br>
before, I dont know if distinctions such as 'hardware/software' or 'RAM/HD'
<br>
or even 'storage/processing' we often make here are all that applicable to
<br>
our own minds.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Evolution produced human brains capable of learning 10^9 bits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge (stored using 10^15 synapses) with only 10^7 bits of genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. Therefore we are not cognitively limited from understanding our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own code.
</em><br>
<p><p>If you mean our 'code' as in our genetic information, I would agree with
<br>
you. If you mean our 'code' as in the sum total of genetic + acquired
<br>
knowledge, I may have to disagree. I cannot simulate myself in my own brain,
<br>
and if I could it wouldnt be a real simulation since I would need to also
<br>
simulate myself simulating myself etc.
