From: &quot;Peter C. McCluskey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:pcm@rahul.net?Subject=Re:%20Wanting%20vs%20Happiness%20(was%20Re:%20AI%20Boxing:%20http://www.sl4.org/archive/0207/4977.html)">pcm@rahul.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; But it isn't clear that &quot;wants&quot; refers to a logically consistent concept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much less a concept that is simple in all circumstances. For example, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible to create conditions under which asking a person about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happiness during an experience reveals preferences which differ from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the preferences revealed by asking how he remembers it afterward (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the book Stumbling Upon Happiness for more on this subject).
</em><br>
<p>The example isn't relevant.  I'm talking about what people want.  I'm
<br>
not talking about what makes them happy, what they say makes them
<br>
happy, or anything having to do with their memory.  I agree that all
<br>
of those other things are not simple.  Emotions aren't part of
<br>
defining what people want because I don't need to make statements
<br>
about someone's emotions to say that from their actions it appears
<br>
that they are trying to get the world into one state rather than
<br>
another.  This stand makes it possible to ascribe purpose to things
<br>
that don't have emotions, such as plants and chess playing robots.
<br>
&quot;The vine is growing that way to get more sunlight.&quot;
<br>
<p>To figure out what someone wants, you have to first estimate:
<br>
<p>* what voluntary actions they are taking and have taken, and
<br>
* what they believe (that is, their estimated state of the universe), and
<br>
* how cause-and-effect works.
<br>
<p>There is uncertainty in all of these things: we may not know what they
<br>
did, the person may not have a firm opinion about what is true at any
<br>
moment, and the best-guess laws of physics may be either not known
<br>
with certainty or inherently nondeterministic.
<br>
<p>We represent what they want as a utility function mapping a
<br>
world-state to a utility.  &quot;What they want&quot; is any utility function
<br>
that explains their actions in the sense that their actions, if taken
<br>
in the world they believe themselves to be in, gives an optimal value
<br>
for their utility.
<br>
<p>The judgement of what they want has uncertainty as well, both because
<br>
the output of the algorithm inherits uncertainty from the inputs, and
<br>
because even if the inputs are known with certainty there will in
<br>
general be multiple utility functions that explain the behavior.
<br>
Prefer the simpler utility functions in the usual way, based on a
<br>
simplicity metric.  If you want a decision procedure, use the speed
<br>
prior, or if uncomputability is acceptable use the universal prior.
<br>
<p>Details are on my website.  The a-priori likelihood stuff is from
<br>
Schmidhuber, Hutter, and Kolmogorov before them.
