<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; By the way, if the AI has any long-term goals, then it will want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; preserve its own integrity in order to preserve those goals.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;preserve its own integrity&quot; is a good enough example for the issue at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; hand, it's not something you'd really need to put in there explicitly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strong sense of identity and self-modifying are somewhat contradictions.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but we know of many devices (e.g. us) that live with contradictions.
<br>
It can be put in &quot;society of mind&quot; terms: a single entity may still have
<br>
competing agents (e.g. a human being barely able to make up his mind
<br>
in some particular case, a well-formed highly unified nation or group
<br>
that has internal dissent but manages to keep from displaying its dirty
<br>
laundry in public, or a simple apparatus with a built-in governer that
<br>
shudders and shakes unable to quite settle into a steady course of
<br>
action).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (similar to drugs that change the personality) 
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But people often do use them. And as illogical as it is to me
<br>
(and I'm in a *really* small minority here), many people don't have
<br>
a problem with becoming quite different over time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That might even lead to the point that a self-aware AI does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to modify itself to preserve its current state of being.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it would then have to &quot;care&quot; about its existence---and
<br>
that still seems to be a hot point of contention here about how
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; or &quot;necessary&quot; it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise a friendly AI might be aware that the next-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI it's supposed to develop might not be guaranteed friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore refuse to develop it at all.
</em><br>
<p>Yes  :-)   much like we wonder if we should develop AI.
<br>
(Of course, since our six billion people are not in a single
<br>
high-integrity group that can come to a meaningful decision
<br>
about it, AI will be developed by someone, like it or not.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [obligatory new poster and foreign speaker disclaimer]
</em><br>
<p>Welcome!  I don't think I'd be able to tell that you weren't
<br>
a natural English speaker from the above writing. Thanks
<br>
for the effort.
<br>
