an algorithm with a complexity that is a function of N.  Neither case

</em><br>
<p><p>Eh? I'm not following this.

<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; All that aside, your assertion is contrary to some pretty

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>While it has many expressions in literature (Chaitin has his own  
<br>
quaint pedestrian expressions of the concept), let us work from the  
<br>
fact that you are arguing against a trivial consequence of the  
<br>
Invariance Theorem, which opens Chapter 2 of my copy of Li &amp; Vitanyi.  
<br>
It is prefaced with the following quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;The following 'Invariance Theorem' is the cornerstone for the  
<br>
subsequent development of the [algorithmic information] theory. In  
<br>
fact, for many later applications it embodies the entire  theoretical  
<br>
foundation.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is old territory, so I don't see a reason to rehash it here. You  
<br>
are failing to grok elementary algorithmic information theory. Li &amp;  
<br>
Vitanyi is the canonical text for such things, so I would recommend  
<br>
buying a copy.  In any case, it is far too basic to justify dedicating  
<br>
a thread to it if you do not understand it.  There are other AGI  
<br>
related lists that will gladly humor such things.
<br>
<p>Algorithms do not create information, they *are* information.
