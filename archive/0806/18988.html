<em>&gt;&gt; So all comments most welcome, especially as to what the paper does not need

<em>&gt;&gt; to say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So this paper proposes a moratorium on producing faster computers. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if it works now (it won't), in the future, when nanotechnology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matures, you won't be able to ban it anyway, just as you can't ban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information now.
</em><br>
<p>One can't ban information right now -- technical and political
<br>
structures that would be required are not in place -- but high-tech
<br>
societies where the flow of information is strictly controlled and/or
<br>
monitored are actually quite feasible. Mostly just a matter of having
<br>
a huge amount of surveillance. A society where the use of advanced
<br>
technology, such as freely programmable computers, is banned
<br>
everywhere except in a relatively few strictly controlled facilities
<br>
is also a non-impossibility.
<br>
<p>If in the next few decades we get destructive near-human intelligence
<br>
computer viruses running around on the net, or something like that, it
<br>
is also politically realistic that we'll see stuff like the outlawing
<br>
of all computers that don't have advanced government spyware on them,
<br>
including e.g. the feature to send a live screen capture to government
<br>
agents whenever they feel like it. Administrations such as currently
<br>
in power in major countries such as China, U.S. and Russia would rub
<br>
their hands with glee at any political excuse to implement such
<br>
systems of control. And I for one would not even oppose if they
<br>
proposed such things, if the only alternative was to have no defenses
<br>
against powerful AI technologies. (In reality, there is the
<br>
alternative of a Transparent Society, where all surveillance
<br>
information is available to everyone and not just government
<br>
agencies.)
<br>
<p>This is actually what I consider the highest-probability scenario for
<br>
the pre-singularity future. We will see extremely pervasive
<br>
surveillance, either of the Transparent Society or the Big Brother
<br>
variation. Friendly AI advocates will probably start to lobby for that
<br>
as the necessary Plan A, once the difficulty of solving FAI has become
<br>
sufficiently apparent. I certainly expect a solution to FAI to take
<br>
more time than we would have if we didn't build pervasive
<br>
surveillance.
<br>
<p><p>(On the paper that started this thread, I'll also make note here of
<br>
the core error that earlier comments also touched on, that it is
<br>
assumed in the paper that AIs would necessarily have human-unfriendly
<br>
motivations. Friendly AI is very difficult, but not impossible.)
