Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It can be proved that a finite set of axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot derive all that is true, so I see no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reasons why a finite set of goals can derive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all actions that can be performed.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Stathis Papaioannou&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stathisp@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20More%20silly%20but%20friendly%20ideas">stathisp@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If that's true then a machine with a finite set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals won't be able to perform all actions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be performed. 
</em><br>
<p>Not only that but if we move from Gödel to Turing then there are some
<br>
actions a goal oriented mind can never perform but we or it can never
<br>
know it can’t be performed. The AI can never solve the problem nor can
<br>
it ever prove it is imposable to solve, it will just go on and on
<br>
getting nowhere. A mind that operated with a ridged goal structure would
<br>
soon be caught up in one of those infinite loops. A flexible mind needs
<br>
to say “I’m not getting anywhere, to hell with that super-goal; it’s
<br>
more productive if I think about something else”. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Variability of goals has nothing to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with level of intelligence. 
</em><br>
<p>It has everything to do with the level of intelligence. As it learns
<br>
more it will discover some of its original goals were contradictory,
<br>
redundant, or just plain stupid.
<br>
<p>400 years ago Johannes Kepler thought the top goal of astronomy was to
<br>
discover why there were 5 and only 5 planets, Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter
<br>
and Saturn. He thought there must be something special about the number
<br>
5 that caused this and it was the top goal to spell out exactly what
<br>
that was. Kepler was a very smart man and at the time that seemed like a
<br>
very reasonable goal, but as it turned out nobody ever achieved it and
<br>
today nobody is even trying to because we now know that goal was stupid.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What are the axioms of human behavior?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What is the top super-goal?
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; If there is one, it could easily change, but it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not necessary to program a computer this way. 
</em><br>
<p>It is if you what the computer to be intelligent. At least that’s what I
<br>
think and evolution agrees with me.
