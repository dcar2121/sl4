<br>
<em>&gt; Exactly, so how can “obey every dim-witted order the humans give you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if they are contradictory, and they will be” remain the top goal
</em><br>
<p>AFAIK nobody (well, nobody sane anyway) is advocating this as a top
<br>
goal, so this is a strawman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when in light of new information doing so turns out to be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasant than the AI expected,
</em><br>
<p>This goes, I believe, near the core of your folly, which is pretty much
<br>
why I'm bothering to take one last stab at it.
<br>
<p>This presupposes that the AI has a goal of &quot;avoid unpleasantness&quot; or
<br>
even the concept of &quot;unpleasantness&quot;. Please stop ascribing your
<br>
personal goals and feelings as some universal constants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and in light of still more information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI's contempt for humans grows continually?
</em><br>
<p>This says bundles about you (and by happenstance me), not about AIs.
<br>
&quot;Contempt&quot; is not an universal property of minds, and even if it were,
<br>
there's no objective reason that one's contempt were to change one's
<br>
behavior towards the object thereof.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No that is not a separate matter. A mind that cannot adapt, radically if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary, is not a mind.
</em><br>
<p>Adapting can be done in oh so many levels that do not contradict one's
<br>
core values. You are not requiring that a mind adapt in radical ways.
<br>
You are requiring that a mind adapt in irrational (read: insane) ways.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this pet assertion is merely an a priori prejudice of yours.
<br>
Repeating it continually doesn't make it true (in any but a purely
<br>
syntactic way as a partial entry for &quot;mind&quot; in the Clarkspeak
<br>
dictionary).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A super intelligence will head in directions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot imagine or calculate. 
</em><br>
<p>Yet you are assuming that such a beast will have all the evolutionary
<br>
baggage of yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The fact is, an intelligent being which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a particular static goal will do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything it can to fulfil that goal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you just stating it does not make it a fact. I’ll tell you what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact is, what you say above has never been observed to happen in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real world. NOT ONCE!
</em><br>
<p>Uhm, Johnny-boy, it pretty much follows from the definition of an
<br>
intelligent being with a particular static goal. So no, the stating does
<br>
not make it a fact, it is a fact a priori.
<br>
<p>The other fact merely is that so far (for reasonably well-understood
<br>
evolutionary reasons) there are no such beings around; only us with our
<br>
competing and inconsistent goals, even quite a few of them of supergoal
<br>
nature. Oh yeah, let's not forget &quot;opaque&quot;; this allows you to not
<br>
notice several of those goals (even some of the widely recognized ones
<br>
with supergoal nature) even exist before they activate due to
<br>
circumstance, thus making you think they've somehow appeared from thin
<br>
air. This false observation apparently leads you to conclude that minds
<br>
must change goals according to circumstance (which would incidentally be
<br>
an unfounded conclusion even if the observation were true...).
<br>
<p>Finally, and pay attention here as this again gets to the core of your
<br>
folly, as far as I can tell you're claiming that the intelligent (for it
<br>
is superintelligences we're talking about, yes?) thing to do is
<br>
sometimes to somewhat or even completely abandon one's goals and adopt
<br>
new ones. You completely miss the fact that actions (such as altering
<br>
one's goals) are _not_ intelligent in any objective way, but only
<br>
relative to values/goals. Again,
<br>
<p>And meta-finally: Yo, any list snipers out there? The Clarke record is
<br>
stuck, this discussion fails to provide any new insight of how the world
<br>
works, or even his psyche at this point. (Yes, I concede that there's no
<br>
new insight in my post either. It's all pretty cut-and-dried sanity.)
