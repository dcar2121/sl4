<em>&gt;&gt; If the AI is designed to be ecstatically happy carrying out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the orders of the snail, and to be a tiny bit happy when being smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and consistent, then (as long as these happiness scores are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cumulative, and the AI does not get happy now because of potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; future happiness) it will cheerfully follow the snail forever. (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happiness assumptions are what is needed if we are to say that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; goal is strictly preferred to another).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your caveat (below) is appreciated, but I do have a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, probably because I didn't start following this thread until very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about this objection to  &quot;If the AI is designed to be ecstatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy...&quot;?  Don't we often assume here that the AI manages to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold of its own source code?  Doesn't this allow that, given time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI may deviate from its initial programming, i.e., that even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's being guided as it does consider and rewrite, it still has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sooner or later deviating from any initial characterization.
</em><br>
<p>Instruct the AI to only rewrite it's own source code if doing so will
<br>
reinforce its higher goals. Though I admit my shorthand of &quot;happy&quot; was
<br>
sloppy; it implies that there might be a shortcut the AI would take,
<br>
that its goal is to be happy. But it's real goal is to serve the
<br>
snail.
