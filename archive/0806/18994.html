<br>
<p>The Order of Cosmic Engineers, pre- announced at The Future of
<br>
Religions/Religions of the Future conference in Second Life on June 5,
<br>
2008, was launched yesterday June 14, 2008, at the Silvermoon Meeting
<br>
in World of Warcraft. Read the Prospectus of the Order of Cosmic
<br>
Engineers, collaboratively authored by the Order's founding members.
<br>
See also Bainbridge's Cosmic Engineers wiki. A picture of the event is
<br>
above, there are more picture and a chatlog here.
<br>
<p>I am very pleased to see that the first top blogger to comment on the
<br>
launch of the Order has been one of my favorite writers. In an article
<br>
about the Singularity, Charlie Stross writes:
<br>
<p>Now the rapture-nerds have indeed begun to codify their beliefs. Allow
<br>
me to introduce you to the Order of Cosmic Engineers. It is their
<br>
intention to &quot;joyfully set out to permeate our universe with benign
<br>
intelligence, building and spreading it from inner space to outer
<br>
space and beyond.&quot; And they explain:
<br>
<p>The Order is, at the same time, a transhumanist association, a space
<br>
advocacy group, a spiritual movement, a literary salon, a technology
<br>
observatory, an idea factory, a virtual worlds development group, and
<br>
a global community of persons willing to take an active role in
<br>
building, in realizing a sunny future. As engineers, we aim to build
<br>
what cannot be readily found. Adopting an engineering approach and
<br>
attitude, we aim to turn this universe into a &quot;magical&quot; realm.
<br>
<p>There's a lot more where this came from — indeed there's a whole huge
<br>
prospectus, awaiting release next Sunday (which will be accessible
<br>
here); Their formal launch event will be hosted by the Science Guild
<br>
in World of Warcraft on June 14 at noon EST. I've seen an early draft
<br>
of the prospectus, and it is indeed something special. Let's just say
<br>
for now that I await its publication with interest: it's bad manners
<br>
to critique an early draft of divine scripture before it's launched.
<br>
