<p>
<em>&gt; My question is not whether such a thing is possible (I think it is), but whether a *non-evolutionary* RSI is possible.
</em><br>
<p>Let's try and build a simple model. A lone agent in some simplified
<br>
grid with simple &quot;move, eat, look&quot; commands. Assume for the moment (I
<br>
know this isn't what you are looking for, but bear with me) that there
<br>
is a unique ideal behaviour for the agent. The agents programming
<br>
consists of:
<br>
1) The ideal behaviour algorithm (just a list of the right commands).
<br>
2) Lots of complicated subroutines that always produce the same
<br>
answer, whatever the input possible imput.
<br>
3) A small program that looks for, and deletes, any subroutine that
<br>
always produces the same answer, replacing it with just the answer. It
<br>
does this one subroutine per trial.
<br>
<p>Now the agent is sent repeatedly through exactly the same situation.
<br>
Its reward is zero if it fails to find the ideal behaviour; if it
<br>
finds the ideal behaviour, its reward is inversely proportional to the
<br>
time taken.
<br>
<p>Then this very simple model will display RSI, in that it will get
<br>
faster and faster, hence better and better, at its job (admitedly this
<br>
&quot;job&quot; is the reverse of what we mean by intelligence, but it is
<br>
improving in its narrow sense). So non-evolutionary RSI is definitely
<br>
possible, in some situations.
<br>
<p>So let's look at the other part of your question:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The crucial difference is whether the parent chooses the fitness function (e.g. intelligence), or the environment chooses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you distinguish an IQ of 1000 from an IQ of 2000?
</em><br>
<p>The problem doesn't seem insoluble in principle - I can feel &quot;she's
<br>
smarter than me&quot; or &quot;she's waaaay smarter than me&quot;, and rank the two,
<br>
even if I'm dumber than both. I'm sure the people who designed the IQ
<br>
test didn't have the highest possible IQ's. A problem with IQ tests is
<br>
that they are limited, short, and have correct answers. IQ 1000 and IQ
<br>
2000 would both ace the test.
<br>
<p>But I can design &quot;IQ&quot; tests that can differentiate even advanced AI's.
<br>
Something along the lines of &quot;run a command economy&quot; to maximise some
<br>
result. Run and win an election campaign (against each other). Build a
<br>
living copy of a certain human being from scratch, for the least cost.
<br>
Find a shorter proof of the Shimura-Tanyama conjecture, using only
<br>
basic symbols. Create a blockbuster movie, more sucessful than your
<br>
competitor's (and any other). Be the first to build a reproduction of
<br>
Manhattan on one of Uranus's moons. Select among all living humans,
<br>
the six hundred who would self-organise into the most successful
<br>
mini-economy if they were all abandonned on a desert island.
<br>
<p>We don't know exactly what intelligence is, or what higher
<br>
intelligence is. That doesn't mean we have no idea.
<br>
<p>Hope this is useful!
<br>
