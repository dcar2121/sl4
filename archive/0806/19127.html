<p><em>&gt; By the way, if the AI has any long-term goals, then it will want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve its own integrity in order to preserve those goals.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;preserve its own integrity&quot; is a good enough example for the issue at
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I see that; an urge for survival could come as a consequence 
<br>
of other things.
<br>
<p>Is it predicated in these discussions that the AI is utterly 
<br>
rational and will be much more successful than we humans
<br>
at rooting out internal contradictions?
<br>
<p>I have in mind a hypothetical (but doubtless very real)
<br>
person I described the other day:  this person has no
<br>
further wish to live, and would hardly put up any resistance
<br>
at all to a killer who came suddenly into his presence. Yet
<br>
at the same time that this person finds it too inconvenient
<br>
to actually take the steps to end his own life, he can be
<br>
momentarily amused by certain kinds of chat with his
<br>
friends or acquaintances, lives from moment to moment,
<br>
watches lots of TV, reads cheap novels, and probably
<br>
*would* take the steps to end his own life were his tax
<br>
accountant to perish and he had to go through the terrible
<br>
inconvenience of trying to find a new one or doing his
<br>
taxes himself.
<br>
<p>Equally well, my calculator seems to display a tremendous
<br>
urge to finish any computation I key into it, but doesn't
<br>
seem to be the least bit reluctance toward being turned
<br>
off or even thrown away.  Why do most people here
<br>
appear to never to entertain the idea that an AI might be
<br>
rather similar?  In other words, does the rabid urge to
<br>
finish a certain command or kind of task need to be
<br>
impossible for a programmed entity that is also indifferent
<br>
to its fate?  I know there is an inconsistency there, but we
<br>
are just one example of devices that live with inconsistency.
