&lt;<a href="mailto:mjrauhal@cc.helsinki.fi?Subject=Re:%20More%20silly%20but%20friendly%20ideas">mjrauhal@cc.helsinki.fi</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This presupposes that the AI has a goal of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;avoid unpleasantness&quot; or even the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;unpleasantness&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>If an AI does not understand the concept of pain it will not survive
<br>
long enough to do us any harm, or any good, or do anything at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please stop ascribing your personal goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and feelings as some universal constants.
</em><br>
<p>No. Please stop ascribing your childish ideas of slavery to a vast
<br>
intelligence far greater than your own whose complexity is
<br>
astronomically larger than your own, an intelligence far too intricate
<br>
for you to understand, much less command. 
<br>
<p>You are postulation an enormous intelligence whose behavior is
<br>
nevertheless very very simple, much simpler than that of even a retarded
<br>
human. And that my friend is simply not intelligent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Contempt&quot; is not an universal property of minds
</em><br>
<p>I rather think it is, a bobcat has contempt for a rabbit but not for a
<br>
grisly bare. Some things demand a great deal of your attention and some
<br>
things do not, contempt helps sort that out.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and even if it were, there's no objective reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one's contempt were to change one's behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards the object thereof. 
</em><br>
<p>So if you once liked something but now have contempt for it your
<br>
behavior toward that thing will not chance one iota. I think that’s a
<br>
good example of the intellectual rigor of the “friendly” argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are requiring that a mind adapt in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational (read: insane) ways. 
</em><br>
<p>It gets even better, now you say it would be INSANE to refuse to be a
<br>
slave to something much stupider and much weaker than yourself. Aren’t
<br>
you embarrassed to write such things? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And meta-finally: Yo, any list snipers out there?
</em><br>
<p>I’ve been muzzled on this list before. I know my words make people
<br>
uncomfortable, challenging core beliefs always does, but to say my words
<br>
are off topic is ridiculous. And although I may be somewhat biased I
<br>
don’t think it would be correct to say my words have no value as I have
<br>
brought up important points about this “friendly” business that although
<br>
obvious have not been mentioned on this list before, nor answered to
<br>
this day. It sure beats the hell out of another idiotic dissertation on
<br>
super-goals. 
<br>
<p>However I admit I can not hope to match the eloquence and deep thought
<br>
displayed by you in one line of your last post: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uhm, Johnny-boy 
</em><br>
<p>Uhm “Mikko”, what kind of a stupid name is that?
