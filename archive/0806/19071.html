<p>
<em>&gt;&gt; The aspect of a post-singularity world I'd like to look at is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; absence of signalling. If we had an advanced AI, it should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fully understand the personality and abilities of an individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human. If it would accept to reveal this information to humans, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we would live in a society with perfect understanding of each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose you're taking the AI-only-approach (Anissimovic) singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what an understanding of personality would entail. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of personality is pop psychology anyway, so saying something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this makes me wonder if you know what the ai would be knowing in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place.
</em><br>
<p>Personality may be pop psychology, but it's not a concept devoid of
<br>
information. It's useful in assigning certain people to certain jobs,
<br>
for instance. Assuming the AI could not just brute force the problem
<br>
and predict everyone's actions in every circumstances (chaos would
<br>
probably forbid this), then the AI would have to rely on some
<br>
simplified model that gives it enough information to make decisions.
<br>
&quot;Personality&quot; is one of our simplified model's (&quot;abilities&quot; is
<br>
another); the AI's simplified models would be much better, but we can
<br>
still call &quot;Personality&quot; as a shorthand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You think that showing off is why people do things?
</em><br>
<p>I think it is major reason a lot of people do things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the economy, just ignore it. As for the culture, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see what you mean. Would the information be deleted for some reason?
</em><br>
<p>The old culture would still be there; it's whether there would be new
<br>
ongoing cultures that I'm wondering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would dictators be the best way to govern?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying they would; I'm just saying that all the assumptions on
<br>
what system of government is the best may have to rexamined, and what
<br>
we take for granted now (democracy best) may not be true after a
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>As for why governing, there will still be a finite (though huge)
<br>
amount of ressources available to anyone, and there will still be the
<br>
problem of violence/coercion between agents. Some system of government
<br>
would still be needed to adjudicate conflicts. And this system must
<br>
have access to a higher level of violence than any individual agent,
<br>
if there is any chance that agent could misbehave.
<br>
<p>It might be a collaberative, communal hippy government, or it might be
<br>
an AI dictatorship, but it would still be a government.
<br>
<p>Of course, if people are no longer people, then it might be possible
<br>
to avoid the issue of violence all together. Still needs a system of
<br>
adjudicating though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You asserted above that this form of talk is a waste of time, but here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're wondering whether or not we want/prefer it ? Please make up your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind. :-)
</em><br>
<p>Translation: speculation is a waste of time, but it's very fun! :-)
<br>
<p>Stuart
