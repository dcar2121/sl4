<em>&gt; Let me rehash what I think I've been hearing. You're claiming that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere possibility of a small cost provided by anyone therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessitates some sort of either ai or governing system to impose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater force on everyone else to level the playing field as it were?
</em><br>
<p>Basically yes. If threatning people to get their ressources is a
<br>
successful strategy, then those who persue it will become more and
<br>
more powerful - until the cost is no longer small, and the villain is
<br>
able to demand, with devastating threats, pretty much anything they
<br>
want. Or, alternatively, the only productive industry becomes
<br>
threatning people for their ressources...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is that what this was getting at? I've lost track of how this 'small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost' is done away with by a government -- you can just as easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the ai or the government as a damaging entity who does you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm in one way or another.
</em><br>
<p>The cost (small and large) is done away by the government because the
<br>
government offers the possibility of retatilation on anyone threatning
<br>
or using violence - so they don't do it. And of course the AI or
<br>
government can become a highly damaging entity; that's why the present
<br>
model is to have a liberal democracy with strongish property rights
<br>
and individual rights. This seems to be the best model so far in
<br>
practice, for enforcing contracts, maintaining law, and causing the
<br>
minimum of suffering to the population. There might be superior models
<br>
after a singularity, but I still don't see how you can do without the
<br>
basic outline of a government.
<br>
