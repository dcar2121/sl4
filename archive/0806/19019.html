<p>Have added a paragraph.  One source would be the bureaucrats that 
<br>
initially control it.  It may be spontaneous.  But once it arrives it is there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;For evolution consumes all that is good and noble in mankind and

<em>&gt;effective for breeding children.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All of our impulses were generated by evolution, not just the bad
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproduce is.
</em><br>
<p>My initial paragraph was to say that what we consider to be the good 
<br>
impulses come from Evolution. That is what is sad.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You're confusing the goals of evolution with the desires of evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organisms. We *know* that it's an evolutionary advantage for everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to not simply pump out kids as fast as possible.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is an evolutionary advantage for everyone to pump out 
<br>
kids as fast as possible.  But where pump out means to be able to 
<br>
rear them to the age where they can breed.  Contraception got in the 
<br>
way, confused goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It isn't really important, but this isn't accurate. The Intel 286
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(introduced 1982) could address 16 MB of RAM and was later clocked up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to around 25 MHz. These enhancements were, admittedly, expensive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unwieldy, so they weren't generally used by the mass market.
</em><br>
<p>Clarified, thanks.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;The force of evolution is just too strong.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is no evolution without reproduction over large numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successive generations. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/no-evolution-fo.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/no-evolution-fo.html</a>.
</em><br>
<p>Actually no.  Obviously the normal sex based evolution that we 
<br>
experience does not apply.  Bacteria evolve differently, by inter 
<br>
species sharing of bits of DNA.
<br>
<p>The core principle of evolution is simply that those that are 
<br>
successful at being are successful at being.
<br>
<p>Corporations are subject to it, and rise and fall even though the 
<br>
risers tend to consume the people expelled by the fallers.
<br>
<p>Generations are just a result of our bodies having use by dates.  If 
<br>
there are several AIs in a world, then Evolution will select the most 
<br>
successful at being selected.
<br>
<p>(Incidentally, are Bacteria immortal?  When they divide, they are 
<br>
peers, not parent/child.  If one of them dies, there is no reason to 
<br>
call it the parent and the other the child.  So in some sense every 
<br>
bacteria alive to day IS the first one that ever existed, it has just 
<br>
morphed itself over the eons.)

Just because it is possible to push twigs along the ground with ones nose
<br>
does not necessarily mean that is the best way to collect firewood.
