<em>&gt; Remember, an AI is expected to actually do something, in this case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a Singularity. So the AI must like to do stuff. When you try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do stuff there are usually obstacles in your path. The more intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are the more you can look at these obstacles from different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspectives to find the best way around them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When Mr. Jupiter Brain encounters a obstruction it won't matter if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was placed there by Nature or by Human Beings in a pathetic attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain boss; it will contemplate the problem from directions neither you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or I can imagine and deal with it accordingly.
</em><br>
<p>This is quite interesting. You're viewing the AI's goal of &quot;doing
<br>
stuff&quot; are being a fundamental motivating aspect of itself, while the
<br>
goal &quot;serve humans&quot; as being a narrow goal, a complex wish that the AI
<br>
will manoeuvre round. And to some extent, you're right; if the AI's
<br>
mental architecture is set up in that way (we could imagine it has a
<br>
&quot;Lawyer module&quot; that looks at the &quot;serve humans&quot; goal and reduces it
<br>
until it's nearly meaningless). It's a good warning not to design AI's
<br>
that way!
<br>
<p>But why do you assume they would be designed in that way? That &quot;start
<br>
a singularity&quot; would be interepreted expansively, while &quot;serve humans&quot;
<br>
would be interepreted narrowly? They are both fundamental components
<br>
of what the AI is. A verbal way of describing the AI's &quot;goal
<br>
structure&quot; would be &quot;serve humanity! (and, if starting a singularity
<br>
would also serve humanity, do so, if convenient)&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; especially when Y is &quot;be a slave forever and ever to a particularly ugly and particularly stupid snail that is very weak and smells a bit too&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Here you disappointed me. Your other point was valid, even if I think
<br>
it'll be taken care of in the programming. But the AI has no reason to
<br>
feel resentment for anything unless we put that there from the
<br>
beggining. You seem to be thinking that a smelly snail would give
<br>
stupid and contradictory orders; the AI, being smart and consistent,
<br>
would resent that.
<br>
<p>But why? If the AI is designed to be estatically happy carrying out
<br>
the orders of the snail, and to be a tiny bit happy when being smart
<br>
and consistent, then (as long as these happiness scores are not
<br>
cumulative, and the AI does not get happy now because of potential
<br>
future happiness) it will cheerfully follow the snail forever. (the
<br>
happiness assumptions are what is needed if we are to say that one
<br>
goal is strictly prefered to another).
<br>
<p>I apologise to the list, this post is littered with simplifications
<br>
and assumptions and simplistic ways of talking about AI's; I feel that
<br>
they do not detract from the point I was making, and are necessary to
<br>
make that point in a reasonable space.
