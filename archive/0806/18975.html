2008/6/11 John K Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:johnkclark@fastmail.fm?Subject=Re:%20More%20silly%20but%20friendly%20ideas">johnkclark@fastmail.fm</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You are saying that because naturally evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence behaves in a particular way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every possible intelligence must behave in that way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes that is what I'm saying, and because such a being has never been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed it is your responsibility to prove it is possible
</em><br>
<p>I gave the example of a computer smart enough to simulate the
<br>
behaviour of simple organisms but deciding not to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It can be proved that a finite set of axioms cannot derive all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is true, so I see no reasons why a finite set of goals can derive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all actions that can be performed.
</em><br>
<p>If that's true then a machine with a finite set of goals won't be able
<br>
to perform all actions that can be performed. But that's not
<br>
surprising: a bomb intent on blowing up its target is unlikely to take
<br>
up knitting as a hobby unless it is part of an ingenious scheme to
<br>
help it achieve its objective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intelligence means being able to think outside the box, but you claim to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to dream up a box that something much smarter than you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think outside of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You want a brilliant simpleton, something very intelligent but who can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think, something smarter than you that you can outsmart. That's nuts.
</em><br>
<p>In general you can't predict the behaviour of something smarter than
<br>
you are, but in special cases you can. Babies can predict that their
<br>
mothers will feed them when they cry, because mothers are programmed
<br>
that way. For the most part this programming works, despite the fact
<br>
that evolved brains have only vague and changeable goal systems, and
<br>
the degree to which a mother is committed to looking after her baby
<br>
does not depend on her intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; an AI cannot arrive at ethics, aesthetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or purpose without having such arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; axioms as givens in its initial programming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the axioms of human behavior? What is the top super-goal?
</em><br>
<p>If there is one, it could easily change, but it is not necessary to
<br>
program a computer this way. Conversely, it is possible to program a
<br>
computer to randomly vary its goals, eg. a word processing program
<br>
that decides on a whim what character it writes when you press a
<br>
particular key. Variability of goals has nothing to do with level of
<br>
intelligence.
