<p>You are assuming a rather simplistic goal structure + logic.  (I tend to 
<br>
oversimplify those also, but not to that extent.)
<br>
<p>Having contradictory goals doesn't mean that you decide one of them isn't a 
<br>
goal.  It means that you need to choose between them.  This involves both 
<br>
pleasure and pain, but an intelligent entity does it all the time.  It does 
<br>
contain a danger, what I might call the &quot;One armed bandit trap&quot;.  I don't 
<br>
really understand that, but people, at least, seem prone to getting addicted 
<br>
to &quot;painful&quot; activities.  It seems that the thought of winning provides such 
<br>
a huge reward that the cost is discounted.  This, however, is a clear 
<br>
counterexample to your assertion as to how an Intelligent Entity would 
<br>
behave.  (Yeah, it looks kind of stupid to me, too.  But it doesn't appear so 
<br>
to some normally rational people that I've known.  I knew an accountant that 
<br>
would ride to Las Vegas every 3-day weekend on a bus.  She was a good 
<br>
accountant, so she must have known the odds.  And another of her goals was 
<br>
saving money.  She allocated how much she would spend on every visit to Las 
<br>
Vegas.  She didn't surrender either of her contradictory goals...she just 
<br>
accomplished each of them a bit less completely.)
