<em>&gt; The first is the creation of a formalized database of knowledge about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms, programming languages and AI.  At www.mizar.org, there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalized database of knowledge about undergraduate and some graduate-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics.  But it's scanty on CS.  Now, I am well aware that formalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorems and proofs are not the essence of mathematics.  But they're an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important component, which a young AI will more easily absorb from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalized treatments than from journal math articles, which have their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiar social and psychological assumptions underlying them, different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the patterns underlying the math itself.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a valid approach. One word of caution is that they've been
<br>
working on this for 28 years. Even with 20,000 formalized theorems, they still
<br>
have a way to go.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mizar syntax is not sophisticated enough for codifying CS knowledge
<br>
(admittedly, you can accomplish a hell of a lot with it)... and there isn't an
<br>
Office of Naval Research funding the project. It's a great idea, but I'm
<br>
interested in hearing more ideas on how to accomplish it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second is the creation of an efficient &amp; scalable programming language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a purely formal semantics.  C# may fulfill this criterion; Peter Voss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is evaluating it for this purpose.  Java is formal but not yet efficient and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scalable enough; an improved JVM could solve the problem, particularly a JVM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized for large-scale AI.  C is efficient and scalable but its use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointers means that its formal semantics needs to include a formal model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heap memory, which  makes the task of inference-driven self-modification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MUCH more difficult for a C program.  [When I say C I include C++]
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think your concerns about Java's performance are based on two things.
<br>
First, your were using it for a high performance application just before it
<br>
was really ready for it - you saw a lot of blood. Second, you were trying to
<br>
use it on cheap hardware.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure based on the bills you paid you don't think x4 processor PCs with
<br>
4GB of RAM is cheap, but you are also aware that much better alternatives
<br>
exist.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These short papers introduce some high performance Java projects:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.developer.ibm.com/java/j2/IBM_Java_2_Intel.pdf">http://www.developer.ibm.com/java/j2/IBM_Java_2_Intel.pdf</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://himalaya.compaq.com/docs/IO/4791/ATT/javaprb.pdf">http://himalaya.compaq.com/docs/IO/4791/ATT/javaprb.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building an AI with Java, you have a lot riding on high performance Java. IBM
<br>
and COMPAQ have tens of billions riding on high performance Java.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, I would not rely on x4 PCs to accomplish any difficult task. I
<br>
would buy or steal better hardware, namely 64 bit hardware such as alphas.
<br>
They have had a functional JVM since, I think, 1996, running at 64 bits with
<br>
64 bit memory addressing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More work accomplished on each machine means fewer messages between machines
<br>
for the same amount of work. That coupled with IBM's (or whoever's) object
<br>
serialization performance improvements greatly reduces the problems you met. A
<br>
caveat, though, is that distributed object systems always take a performance
<br>
hit, there's nothing you can do about this architectural reality.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory space goes to 64 bit. That's more RAM than you're likely to stuff into
<br>
a computer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage collection is greatly sped up, with options to tweak.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also consider switching from RMI to CORBA for your message-passing
<br>
needs (a lot of this work could be done by people who understand RMI and
<br>
CORBA, but not AI, saving yourself a lot of trouble finding people.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of staying with Java and switching to CORBA and a 64 bit
<br>
architecture are that you keep a lot of your code: you do have many years'
<br>
effort already accomplished in terms of code. Write system components in
<br>
languages other than Java when you need to.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A note on C#:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also intrigued with C#. It tests nicely, though there are some problems
<br>
and it will take a couple of years before all the kinks are worked out. And
<br>
that's one problem you must consider: all the headache you got from going with
<br>
Java early, you will get again with C#.

<em>&gt; I think that this picture of the path to the Singularity is a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from that of Eliezer.  But I'm not sure.  My sense is that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views self-modification as entering into the picture earlier, perhaps in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage 1, as the best way of getting to the first &quot;fairly intelligent AI.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not 100% sure this is wrong, but after a lot of thought I have not seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good way to do this, whereas I have a pretty clear picture of how to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Singularity according to the steps I've outlined here.
