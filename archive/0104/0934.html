<p><p>&nbsp;I think that you miss my point. I agree that it is vitally important to read
<br>
all the background materials to be involved in the discussions on this list.
<br>
I'm working through the material right now myself. My comments refer more to
<br>
those members of the general public who have yet to be exposed to any of these
<br>
ideas. They may be willing to do the work as they gain more of an awareness of
<br>
the issues and ideas involved, but an easy-to-digest statement of the goals and
<br>
intentions behind all this would go a long ways towards helping to promote
<br>
understanding of the Singularity, and perhaps even help to bring it about much
<br>
sooner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A 'Singularity for Dummies' sounds like a joke to me. Do not get me wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but with all due respect: why should dummies need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to understand the Singularity ?  More importantly with threats such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Military-grade Nanotech etc... why should Eliezer (and the SingInst)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spend time on ANYTHING but what they're already busy with now ?
</em><br>
<p>This attitude is EXACTLY why it is important to explain these ideas to
<br>
laypeople as we approach the Singularity. The kind of arrogant attitude that
<br>
says, &quot;Why should we be obligated to explain our important work to others, when
<br>
they won't understand it in the first place?&quot;, is elitist, and goes against the
<br>
very concept of Friendliness that is VITALLY IMPORTANT to the successful
<br>
completion of this little endeavor. Making the general public aware of the very
<br>
scary things that are possible as technology advances so quickly, (such as the
<br>
consequences of out-of-control nanotech) will only help us to reach the
<br>
Singularity, ultimately.
<br>
<p>I agree that Eliezer shouldn't be expected to spend his time appearing on talk
<br>
shows or anything, but it is important for someone to provide a bridge between
<br>
the general public, and these very important ideas and goals. The Singularity
<br>
is supposed to help EVERYONE, not just those who got in line first. Elitist
<br>
attitudes help no one in this instance, and ultimately may harm everyone.

<em>&gt; Greetings to each and everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've only posted to this list once or twice (I never read any archives up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; till a few months ago), however:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It did not take me much to realize that Eliezer HAS GOT SOMETHING which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others (software engineers, AI coders etc...) do not have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The details of which are explained (at least that was enough for me) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI 1/2&quot; and &quot;Algernon's law&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Eliezer has already covered some of these topics at various points in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;writing, but it might be a good idea to condense this stuff into one place,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;introduction to the subject, perhaps. (the Singularity for Dummies?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that anyone interested should read ALL the material on Low Beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; + archives + do some digging on their own to start with.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kind regards,
</em><br>
