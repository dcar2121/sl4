</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not present in the AI.  But some of that complicated behavior and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditioning is also the bed of universal compassion and utter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Lot of ifs there...
<br>
<p>What it seems to come down to is you are either relying on objective
<br>
morality (in which an AI should do better since it has less evolved
<br>
crap to deal with), or a natural convergence to the &quot;Friendly zone&quot;. In
<br>
which case we also argue that a properly designed AI should easily
<br>
outperform a human attempting to upgrade him/herself. The reason I think
<br>
is easy to see: you can't really predict in advance which particular
<br>
human will become utterly Friendly vs. which particular human will become
<br>
the next Hitler when presented with the total power uploading/becoming a
<br>
SI would give them. History has shown a tendency for power to corrupt
<br>
humans. At least with an AI we can sharply reduce the risks by a) designing
<br>
it right b) testing testing testing
<br>
<p>You want to talk about who designs the first AI? Well who decides who gets
<br>
to be the first upload?
