Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p>May I ask what the reason we need infinite computing is?  This is not
<br>
meant to be a troll type of question but I actually am curious.  Of
<br>
course, I am assuming that finite computing (ie. classical and quantum)
<br>
on earth or nearby is adequate for super human AI.
<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: Infinite computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By request, I'm posting a summary of the known proposals for achieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite computing power.  Since it's easy to demonstrate that
</em><br>
physical
<br>
<em>&gt; law permits computing elements that operate millions of times faster
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; neurons, and this quite suffices for superintelligent, far-transhuman
</em><br>
AI,
<br>
<em>&gt; I no longer have a need to speculate about Moore's Law literally going
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; *forever*, with transhuman smartness finding loopholes in any and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;physical limits&quot;.  Which doesn't mean that I think infinite computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power is implausible; just that I got sick of hearing catcalls about
</em><br>
it.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most famous way of achieving infinite computing power is, of
</em><br>
course,
<br>
<em>&gt; the Omega Point proposed by Tipler; as temperatures rise ever faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the Big Crunch, the asympotically increasing energy densities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permit the performance of an asymptotically increasing number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational operations, such that an infinite number of computations
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; performed before the Universe ends.  Unfortunately, this requires
</em><br>
waiting
<br>
<em>&gt; until the end of our Universe, which now appears to be open rather
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; closed anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can perform infinite computation during a Big Crunch, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably also perform infinite computations during a Big Bang.  Thus,
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; proposal for infinite computing power involves pinching off a section
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; spacetime from our own Universe and creating a new Universe, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanying Big Bang.  When this new Universe began to cool off,
</em><br>
perhaps
<br>
<em>&gt; after 1e-43 seconds (post-Planck-time), another Universe could be
</em><br>
created
<br>
<em>&gt; and so on (&quot;Alpha Line&quot; computing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Less ambitiously, the &quot;Linde Scenario&quot; would involve opening up a
</em><br>
series
<br>
<em>&gt; of basement Universes connected to our own via wormholes.  &quot;Each new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe could be the parent of many new universes, so that the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population would grow exponentially, the gradual entropic degradation
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; old universes playing only a negligible role in slowing down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.&quot;  (Nick Bostrom.)  This does not achieve actual infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing speeds at any given point, but it does permit life and
</em><br>
growth to
<br>
<em>&gt; continue indefinitely, and the performance of an unboundedly large
</em><br>
number
<br>
<em>&gt; of computations as time goes on.  Which is all we really care about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linde Scenario:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/linde.html">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/linde.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our Solar System contains a limited amount of mass, and Conservation
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Mass and Energy says that we can't just make more.  However, the laws
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; physics contain no statement asserting Conservation of Material.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative energy can be manufactured, then positive matter and negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter could be produced in paired amounts - in theory, in indefinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantities.  Furthermore, because the total mass would be zero,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interlacing negative and positive matter would permit the construction
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; arbitrarily large dense megastructures without those megastructures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collapsing into black holes.  Thus, rather than life running into hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits when all the matter in our Solar System is consumed, growth
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; continue indefinitely.  Since negative energy would also permit FTL,
</em><br>
time
<br>
<em>&gt; travel, wormholes, and the violation of the second law of
</em><br>
thermodynamics,
<br>
<em>&gt; many people postulate that Cosmic Censorship prevents the manufacture
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; negative energy.  (Frankly, I think this is a rather warped way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning about the laws of physics; the only way to find out whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative energy can be manufactured is to try it.  When did it start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming permissible to reason from a-priori philosophical constraints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of experiment?  Oh, never mind.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As long as you're constructing arbitrarily large computers, why
</em><br>
construct
<br>
<em>&gt; them from mere molecules, which have a maximum theoretical switching
</em><br>
speed
<br>
<em>&gt; of 1e15 hertz before the energies used tear them apart?  Neutronium,
</em><br>
being
<br>
<em>&gt; far denser, permits much faster computing speeds from a given amount
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; mass, with a maximum switching speed of 1e21 hertz.  An even denser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material is Higgsium, produced using the negative Higgsino at the
</em><br>
center
<br>
<em>&gt; of the nucleus, and orbiting protons serving the function now served
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; electrons.  Higgsium is 1e18 times denser than water; a thimbleful
</em><br>
weighs
<br>
<em>&gt; as much as a mountain.  Monopolium uses a light monopole of one
</em><br>
polarity
<br>
<em>&gt; (North) bound to a heavy monopole of the opposite polarity (South);
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; density is 1e25 times that of water, and a thimbleful weighs as much
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; the Moon.  (Hence the need to use interlaced positive and negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopolium structures, to prevent the collapse into a black hole of
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; reasonably-sized structures.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neutronium, Higgsium, and monopolium:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Moravec-H/HDPSF.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Moravec-H/HDPSF.html</a>
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if you keep on manufacturing more and more zero-mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;interlaced matter&quot;, you eventually run out of *space* in your Solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; System.  I believe that I was the first one to propose solving this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem using Van Den Broeck's &quot;micro-warp&quot; adaptation to Alcubierre's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warp drive - also known as the &quot;tardis warp&quot; or &quot;warp bubble&quot;.  Van
</em><br>
Den
<br>
<em>&gt; Broeck found a solution to the General Relativity equations which
</em><br>
permits
<br>
<em>&gt; a large space, say 100 meters in diameter, to be connected to the rest
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; our Universe through a tiny bottleneck, much smaller than an atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diameter.  Thus, you can pack a very large number of Van Den Broeck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bubbles into a volume the size of our Solar System.  Furthermore, as
</em><br>
far
<br>
<em>&gt; as I know, there's no theoretical reason why you can't open up one Van
</em><br>
Den
<br>
<em>&gt; Broeck bubble inside another one, which would permit total living
</em><br>
space to
<br>
<em>&gt; keep growing exponentially forever.  You'd probably want to use a
</em><br>
wormhole
<br>
<em>&gt; network to keep all the bubbles in communication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, this is a design for a galaxy-sized computer built of pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopolium that fits inside your pocket and weighs as much as a
</em><br>
Kleenex.
<br>
<em>&gt; As far as I know, I was the first to propose &quot;fractal tardis
</em><br>
computing&quot; as
<br>
<em>&gt; a means of achieving indefinite exponential growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alcubierre warp drive:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0009013">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0009013</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Van Den Broeck tardis pocket (&quot;micro-warp&quot;):

<em>&gt;   <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9905084">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9905084</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Googling will uncover plenty of less technical explanations.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, of course, there's the idea of using a closed timelike curve
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; send the result of a computation back to before the computation
</em><br>
started,
<br>
<em>&gt; permitting an infinite number of iterations to be performed in what
</em><br>
looks
<br>
<em>&gt; to the outside Universe like a finite amount of time.  Of course, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only works if you can construct a closed timelike curve, which IIRC
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; proved to require negative energy.  Cool stuff, negative energy.  (Ha
</em><br>
ha
<br>
<em>&gt; ha!  Sorry.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think someone also claimed infinite computing power using black
</em><br>
holes,
<br>
<em>&gt; but I haven't heard any specifics on that one.
