<p>You were the one who used the word &quot;perfect&quot;; I, in turn, defined that to
<br>
mean &quot;without coming close to the boundary of the first set of safety
<br>
margins&quot;.
<br>
<p>Does that sound like I'm assuming that all the code works the first time? 
<br>
Like I said, the reason &quot;Friendly AI&quot; is so long...
<br>
<p>Note the phrase &quot;safety margins&quot;.  Note the phrase &quot;first set of&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The slightest error in architecture, implementation or knowledge

</em><br>
<p>If you're in a situation like that, you've *already* screwed up.  You
<br>
screwed up for the first time when you proposed an architecture that was
<br>
that sensitive to errors, you screwed up for the second time when you
<br>
decided to implement it anyway, and you screwed up for the third time when
<br>
you failed to retreat and regroup after seeing how fragile it was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Software is simultaneously incredibly complex and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Only the human kind, and it's only the human kind of software while the AI
<br>
is young and infrahuman and non-self-improving.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See my previous point in this message.  Plus, I repeat what I replied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian, if you have thought of all this please educate me.  If you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend the time to write a paper specifically covering why we (the human
</em><br>

<p>Probably the closest thing is:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/PtS/navigation/contents.html">http://sysopmind.com/sing/PtS/navigation/contents.html</a>
<br>
Of course, the whole of PtS is now just a tad obsolete, but it should
<br>
serve as a first approximation.
<br>
<p>In any case, what I object to is *not* your asking the question, but
<br>
rather chiding us for having never thought about it.  If you have a
<br>
question, then just *ask* it and I'll try to direct you to the appropriate
<br>
webpages, quod erat demonstrandum.
