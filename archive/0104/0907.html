<em>&gt; &gt;Ok James, so what exactly is your ideal future scenario? If you insist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;having some mystery left in the Universe I'm sure the Sysop will oblige
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you by modifying your memories and dumping you permanently into a simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reality of medieval Europe. If you request such a thing of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Who says that isn't what has already happened?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;If you prove it, I might be interested.  Otherwise, the dominant
</em><br>
probability - in goal system terms, dominant source of differential
<br>
desirability - is the world taken at face value.&lt;
<br>
<p>If I told you I had proof, I'd probably be wearing a tin-foil hat, too. I was being a
<br>
little facetious with that first bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This (and the rest of the post) show a misunderstanding of the nature of a
</em><br>
Sysop.  Sysops are not there to protect you from yourself - not against
<br>
your own wishes, at any rate; that's not what a Sysop is for. &lt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to you,that is. Again, this is why I hope that whoever is finally
<br>
responsible for the birth of AI gets it right. It's hard for me to have blind faith
<br>
that all this stuff will just work out. Obviously, our best chance is with the folks
<br>
on this list. But if someone else, with a very different philosophical outlook,
<br>
manages to make that breakthrough first, we could be living in a very different
<br>
place. I don't want to spend the rest of my post-Singularity life wearing a Dallas
<br>
Cowboys uniform, just because the guy who creates the first AI is a big football fan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You
</em><br>
can still instruct the Sysop matter to act like a rickety Model T and then
<br>
try to land on a neutron star and die, if that's your taste. &lt;
<br>
<p>I'd prefer a 1959 Cadillac, please. My previous comments weren't meant to imply that
<br>
I have a death wish.I was just trying to point out that the possibility of death is
<br>
part of dealing with the unknown. Take that out of the equation, and the challenge
<br>
might not be as, well, challenging. As Samantha suggested, a Sysop that keeps backup
<br>
copies on file, allowing us to do stupid and dangerous stuff without permanent loss,
<br>
while still gaining some wisdom from breaking our transhuman necks,  might be an
<br>
acceptable alternative.
<br>
<p>COOP
