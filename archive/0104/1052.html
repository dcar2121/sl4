<em>&gt; &gt; This doesn't seem quite right.  You are basically describing something that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wide at 8-terahertz) to feed the processor core in the best case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you assuming a &quot;processor core&quot;? Is there an assumption of basically

</em><br>
<em>&gt;parallel with much of the processing distributed amoung the memory bits

<em>&gt;and along the interconnections between memory nodes and processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nodes?  These processors could be relatively simple and quite diverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This would largely obviate the need for a super super fast memory bus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Given the tech for this kind of memory bus, the memory required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (which would fit snugly in a 64-bit address space) and the processor core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would already be solved problems.  Massive distributed computing won't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because the effective memory bandwidth is so low that the actual throughput

<em>&gt; &gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, but obviously, massively parallel processing systems with even

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>That may be the way it ends up getting done.  But the problem is that I 
<br>
believe the common AI techniques generally require for a huge, 
<br>
interconnected knowledge store.  This knowledge core is then used by 
<br>
software that generally doesn't get horribly complex.  The KS pretty much 
<br>
controls what happens by the software analyzing &amp; modifying (for learning) 
<br>
it in various ways.  This can further get more complex in that some AI 
<br>
systems actually store the knowledge as program fragments that are written 
<br>
by the system itself.
<br>
<p>Such an architecture was be very difficult to map on a highly parallel 
<br>
system which had very limited RAM access per CPU.  Massive parallel 
<br>
programming is a very different beast than the programming the vast 
<br>
majority of programers do, and it requires a different set of tools and 
<br>
ways to look at problems.  If we were forced to use this type of a system 
<br>
it would probably have a serious impact on the implementation timeline, 
<br>
possibly making the availability of actual hardware irrelevant for a short 
<br>
while.
<br>
<p>Of course Eliezer has a much better idea on this, I'm certain, since he 
<br>
knows about the software they intend to create.
