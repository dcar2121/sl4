<p><p>There are also a lot of disadvantages.  I personally would be strongly

inclined to at least keep the initial implementation limited to a small

number of competent engineers.  Having an initial implementation that is 
<br>
superbly engineered sets the  architecture standard for when the unwashed 
<br>
programming masses get their hands on it, making it much easier to control 
<br>
down the road if nothing else.  I believe that this is also a tenet of the 
<br>
Open Source doctrine.

<p><p><em>&gt;2) It would pull in some of the rogue groups who would go it alone.
</em><br>
<p><p>In this particular instance, I suspect this would not be the case.  There 
<br>
is way too much religion involved for most groups that attempt to do this 
<br>
type of thing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;3) Open Source could massively speed up the process.  Instead of having a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few coders working on it, thousands or more would be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribute.  (with very high quality control, of course)
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a somewhat naive view of the software engineering process.  At a 
<br>
minimum, the first release of the core application really needs to be done 
<br>
totally &quot;in house&quot;.  Quite frankly, few people are competent enough to 
<br>
contribute to this type of development; the cost of maintaining QC with a 
<br>
large number of wanna-be contributors would almost certainly exceed the 
<br>
potential benefit to the codebase.  Also, initial development (i.e. in the 
<br>
absence of a prior development context) is a lot easier when you have a few 
<br>
engineers because you are far more likely to create or have a common 
<br>
context for development between a few people than between hordes of them.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I don't think that the code for something like this could be 
<br>
easily broken down into a lot of independent pieces that you can throw 
<br>
hundreds of developers at.  I expect the core codebase would be relatively 
<br>
small and functionally very dense.  There might be a use for outside 
<br>
developers on software components peripheral to the core engine, but you 
<br>
wouldn't want more than a half-dozen good developers working on the core 
<br>
engine itself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;4) Probably the #1 biggest benefit is improved quality.  Open Source in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many ways is the pinnacle of code reviews.  Having so many ideas study the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;source would reveal far more errors and problems than an isolated team 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could ever accomplish.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is too simple a view.  Code reviews are useful, but not just for the 
<br>
sake of doing a code review.  I've seen a lot of code reviews that add no 
<br>
value to the process, frequently because the reviewer isn't sufficiently 
<br>
competent to evaluate (both structurally AND contextually) the code they 
<br>
are reviewing.  The best kind of code review is when you have a small 
<br>
number of very competent individuals working on the same project that code 
<br>
review each other -- it keeps the S/N very high.
<br>
<p>But that is just my opinion.  I don't really want to dwell on the topic.
