<em>&gt; &gt;For me, the superiority of AI over uploading lies chiefly in two facts:

<em>&gt; &gt;First, uploading is a technology years ahead of AI *or* military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nanotechnology...
</em><br>
<p>ASME is the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, a very
<br>
conservative bunch of gearheads for which I once served as the
<br>
student chapter president in college.  In January this group had
<br>
its annual conference, with nanotechnology being one of the
<br>
topics.  As it turned out it was *by far* the most popular
<br>
session, overloading the facility by such a margin they had to
<br>
move the venue into the much larger commons area.
<br>
<p>As sometimes happens with a bunch of engineers, they seemed
<br>
totally focussed on *how* to bring about nanotech, without any
<br>
apparent vision of the consequences or who shall control the
<br>
processes under what conditions, etc.  I found this unsettling
<br>
event as evidence that military use of nanotech is as inevitable
<br>
as its eventual development.
<br>
<p>ASMEs behavior pretty much demonstrates the futility of
<br>
Bill Joy's approach to AI/nanotech/GM.  Engineers will say
<br>
&quot;This is new, this is cool, lets do it.&quot;  Generals will say &quot;This
<br>
could ruin the commies for good, lets do it.&quot;  Lunatic fringe
<br>
teens will say &quot;This is faaar superior to shooting up the
<br>
local high school, lets do it.&quot;  etc.
<br>
<p>I am led to a conclusion similar to what I believe is
<br>
Eliezer's: that we must have a strong and friendly AI
<br>
in place before nanotech, otherwise...
