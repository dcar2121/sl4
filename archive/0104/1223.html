<em>&gt; 	I think this is a valid approach. One word of caution is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on this for 28 years. Even with 20,000 formalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorems, they still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a way to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Mizar syntax is not sophisticated enough for codifying CS knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (admittedly, you can accomplish a hell of a lot with it)... and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there isn't an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Office of Naval Research funding the project. It's a great idea, but I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in hearing more ideas on how to accomplish it.
</em><br>
<p>Mizar syntax can be used for codifying CS knowledge, but, it's not specially
<br>
tuned for it.
<br>
<p>Defining a Mizar dialect specialized for CS would be a valuable project.
<br>
Anyone care to undertake it?
<br>
<p>I also have a half-finished, now-abandoned project at converting Mizar into
<br>
KNOW, Webmind's much simpler KR language.  The completion of this would
<br>
allow the WM AI Engine to read Mizar...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 	I think your concerns about Java's performance are based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, your were using it for a high performance application just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was really ready for it - you saw a lot of blood. Second, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use it on cheap hardware.
</em><br>
<p>We used a variety of hardware, including some decent Solaris boxes but no
<br>
supercomputers
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would buy or steal better hardware, namely 64 bit hardware such as alphas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have had a functional JVM since, I think, 1996, running at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 64 bits with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 64 bit memory addressing.
</em><br>
<p>Is there really a 64 bit JVM out there, available right now?  Please give me
<br>
a reference!!!
<br>
<p>thanks

<p><p><em>&gt; 	I am also intrigued with C#. It tests nicely, though there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are some problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it will take a couple of years before all the kinks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked out. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's one problem you must consider: all the headache you got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from going with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java early, you will get again with C#.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  that's why for now we're using Java for most things, but experimenting
<br>
with ANSI C, which at least is well tested, for some  ;&gt;
