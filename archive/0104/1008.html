<p><em>&gt; So you think Foresight's effort to come up with some nanotech guidelines

<p>No, never futile.  Being very much of the never-give-up school
<br>
of thought, and being a Foresight Institute senior associate, I feel that
<br>
all effort to bring about a &quot;safe&quot; version of nanotech is worthwhile.
<br>
Such effort as trying to relinquish technology *is* futile,
<br>
and very dangerous, for it opens the field to those
<br>
who really are antagonistic to humanity and post-humanity.
<br>
<p>There are nanotech researchers who will have no  interest in
<br>
Foresight's guidelines.  Note that the name Drexler is seldom
<br>
mentioned in the increasingly mainstream study of nanotech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you think SIAI spending time to promote FAI to other AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designers would also be a waste of time, and that we should stay almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100% focused on working on our own code (assuming a very harsh limit on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our available resources) ?
</em><br>
<p>I commend all efforts to bring about the inevitable coming
<br>
spike in a way most conducive to the salvation of post-humanity,
<br>
however I do not claim to have the foggiest idea what that future
<br>
will be, or exactly what is meant by &quot;safe&quot; implementation of
<br>
AI/nanotech.  Perhaps this is an inappropriate admission for this
<br>
group, dedicated to post-singularity discussions, but it is an
<br>
honest one, for which I have received some mild off-list
<br>
scolding:  I havent a clue what kind of future is waiting for
<br>
us post-AI, post singularity, and post nanotech.  Hell, I cannot
<br>
even define exactly what I mean by the term &quot;us&quot;.
<br>
<p>But there are certain futures I do know I do wish to avoid, such as
<br>
malicious agents seizing on nanotech to destroy life, to return
<br>
mankind to his natural state (whatever that means), military
<br>
nanotech, etc.
<br>
<p>I am not advocating the AI vs nanotech scenario, for I feel
<br>
these technologies will bootstrap each other, I hope to the
<br>
benefit (or perhaps &quot;salvation&quot; if you don't mind the religious
<br>
sounding term) of post humanity.
<br>
<p>Brian, keep on coding, and keep thinking.  spike
