<em>&gt; Understood.  There's a 370-page book that describes how our system works,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's currently available only to people who need to see it, and under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NDA....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, most of our experimentation with various parts of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has ~not~ been systematically recorded.  But it's all there in our brains,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the code isn't going to run away (yet ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Does the NDA prohibit those who have seen it from working on similar
<br>
approaches independently?  If so then it would be poisonous to the
<br>
efforts
<br>
of others. 
<br>
<p>Doesn't almost everyone with reasonable technical ability and a desire
<br>
to contribute to building such a beast &quot;need to see it&quot;?  The reason I
<br>
ask this is that I am worried when I see a strong effort toward real AI
<br>
held proprietary and subject to the vagaries of corporations, economics
<br>
and business manuevering.  I have personally seen too much of my own
<br>
work end up being the property of some company that either folded and
<br>
sold it off or turned it into shelf-ware for either strategic reasons or
<br>
simply for reason of not knowing what to do with it..  This could very
<br>
well happen to WebMind and much of the fine and crucially important work
<br>
that has gone into it.   
<br>
<p>I consider the painful experiences of such occurrences and the
<br>
criticality of producing an SI a strong argument for open sourcing of
<br>
concepts and code as much as possible.
