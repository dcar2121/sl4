<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>Having posted some peripheral stuff to the list lately, I feel obliged to
<br>
post something on-topic ;&gt;
<br>
<p>This follows up a conversation that Eliezer, Peter Voss and some others and
<br>
I had over dinner at the Foresight conference
<br>
<p>I proposed the following sequence of events leading up to the Singularity
<br>
<p>1) Someone [perhaps Eli, perhaps little old me, perhaps both of us together,
<br>
perhaps some unknown hacker from the barren plains of Tadzikistan] creates a
<br>
fairly intelligent AI, one that can be taught, conversed with, etc.
<br>
<p>2) This AI is taught about programming languages, is taught about algorithms
<br>
and data structures, etc.
<br>
<p>3) It begins by being able to write and optimize and rewrite simple programs
<br>
<p>4) After it achieves a significant level of practical software engineering
<br>
experience and mathematical and AI knowledge, it is able to begin improving
<br>
itself ... at which point the hard takeoff begins.
<br>
<p><p>My intuition is that, even in this picture, the hard takeoff takes months or
<br>
a few years, not minutes.  But that's still pretty fast by the standards of
<br>
human progress.
<br>
<p>If this is the way it goes, then I have a concrete proposal for two things
<br>
that would probably speed up step 2.
<br>
<p>The first is the creation of a formalized database of knowledge about
<br>
algorithms, programming languages and AI.  At www.mizar.org, there is a
<br>
formalized database of knowledge about undergraduate and some graduate-level
<br>
mathematics.  But it's scanty on CS.  Now, I am well aware that formalized
<br>
theorems and proofs are not the essence of mathematics.  But they're an
<br>
important component, which a young AI will more easily absorb from
<br>
formalized treatments than from journal math articles, which have their own
<br>
peculiar social and psychological assumptions underlying them, different
<br>
from the patterns underlying the math itself.
<br>
<p>The second is the creation of an efficient &amp; scalable programming language
<br>
with a purely formal semantics.  C# may fulfill this criterion; Peter Voss
<br>
is evaluating it for this purpose.  Java is formal but not yet efficient and
<br>
scalable enough; an improved JVM could solve the problem, particularly a JVM
<br>
specialized for large-scale AI.  C is efficient and scalable but its use of
<br>
pointers means that its formal semantics needs to include a formal model of
<br>
heap memory, which  makes the task of inference-driven self-modification
<br>
MUCH more difficult for a C program.  [When I say C I include C++]
<br>
<p>I think that this picture of the path to the Singularity is a little
<br>
different from that of Eliezer.  But I'm not sure.  My sense is that he
<br>
views self-modification as entering into the picture earlier, perhaps in
<br>
stage 1, as the best way of getting to the first &quot;fairly intelligent AI.&quot;
<br>
I'm not 100% sure this is wrong, but after a lot of thought I have not seen
<br>
a good way to do this, whereas I have a pretty clear picture of how to get
<br>
to the Singularity according to the steps I've outlined here.
<br>
