</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOBODY is proposing reprogramming ANYONE.  This is some kind of sick

</em><br>
<p>Sorry Eliezer.  I completely understand that this is NOT what Friendly AI 
<br>
is supposed to be in any form.  However, can you guarantee me with any 
<br>
degree of certainty whatsoever that the version of Friendly AI that you 
<br>
advocate is the one that will ultimately come to exist?
<br>
<p>As long as the Friendly AI people want to keep making it sound like 
<br>
everything is going to go like clockwork and be perfect, I'm going to 
<br>
continue to point out the opposite viewpoint.  I do not share your faith in 
<br>
Friendly AI.  I'm not even certain that I share your goals.  However, you 
<br>
are trying to do what you feel is best for mankind.  That I 
<br>
understand.  And we can debate the fine details of that for the next 
<br>
several years, I'm sure.
<br>
<p>But you do not have this under control.  You can't even reasonably predict 
<br>
how this will turn out.  Even if you design the perfect seed AI, it may 
<br>
still end up completely differently than you imagine.  What I am asking is 
<br>
that you please stop trying to sounding so dam confidant about all of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I now understand the fact that induction of an Orwellian scenario tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lead to perseverant hostility, and that it is my duty as an evangelist to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avoid triggering this chain of causality in the future.  However, the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remains that you appear to have decided that we are advancing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposal TOTALLY UNRELATED to any proposal which we are, in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advancing, and you are offering criticism on that basis; that is to say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are advancing criticism of a proposal which exists only in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagination and the paranoid fantasies of Hollywood writers.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probability that your criticism will be useful or relevant to our ACTUAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PROPOSAL thus effectively approaches zero.
</em><br>
<p>Just to make certain that you understand my point.  At no time have I ever 
<br>
thought that YOU wanted such &quot;Orwellian&quot; scenarios to occur.  You have good 
<br>
intentions, that I do not question.  But, as they say, the road to hell is 
<br>
paved with good intentions.
<br>
<p>We are playing with incredibly dangerous technology here.  Not once have I 
<br>
seen the powers that be on this list stop and ask &quot;should we do this?&quot;  You 
<br>
seem to have a conviction that you MUST do this and it MUST be some certain 
<br>
way.  Please admit that you may be totally wrong or that, even if you are 
<br>
not, there is still a good chance that you will fail to produce what you 
<br>
have planned.
<br>
<p>(NOTE: For the record, I am committed to the fact that either AI or human 
<br>
uploads will happen.  My present thoughts are focused on which would be 
<br>
better and why.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you want to read through Friendly AI, look at the ACTUAL ACTIONS WE ARE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PROPOSING, and then explain how they will backfire in some specific way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's one thing.  Right now, you are just making stuff up and saying we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plan to do it.
</em><br>
<p>I sincerely apologize, since you took this the wrong way.  Sometimes it is 
<br>
hard to make your point without screwing it up in cyberspace.  If only we 
<br>
had discussed this in person...
