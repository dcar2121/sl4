<em>&gt;When I do not understand something, I go to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> and it
</em><br>
finds related links for me. Why should it not find those same links for
<br>
everyone ? The Singularity is nothing complex. How do you dumb down
<br>
something which is not dumd-down-able ?&lt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Arona,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to fight about something that is just a difference in outlook.
<br>
However, I will at least point out that not everyone in the world has access to
<br>
the internet just yet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Just because something is easily grasped by your mind, don't assume that
<br>
everyone else will have no problem. For instance, I can tear down and re-build
<br>
a Chevy 350 engine quite easily, why can't you? That doen't mean that you're
<br>
stupid, it just means that you haven't yet acquired a specialized area of
<br>
knowledge and skill. Just because some folks (most, probably) might need to
<br>
take baby steps to the Singularity, don't condemn then outright.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I do agree with you that if the information is available, and if someone is
<br>
interested in learning it, then they have no excuse not to learn. In the case
<br>
of the Singularity, however, the vast majority of people out there have
<br>
probably never even heard of such a thing. They have to at least be aware of
<br>
the Singularity before they can type the words into a search engine. I myself
<br>
stumbled into this while exploring the subject of memes on the 'net. I'm very
<br>
pleased to have discovered this information, but it was a happy accident. Not
<br>
everyone can be so lucky.
<br>
<p>COOP
