<p><p>You are somewhat missing the point.  The comparisons are in fact typically
<br>
between a 800-MHz P3 and 1.5-GHz P4, but the difference in clock speed is
<br>
immaterial if you actually look at the benchmarks (mostly because the
<br>
benchmarks show *why* clock speed is immaterial).  In fact, the article
<br>
squares perfectly with what I've been hearing on the hardware lists where
<br>
people have been running their own benchmarks.
<br>
<p>In short:
<br>
<p>For fp and vector codes *where the data fits in the cache*, you generally
<br>
get much better performance with the P4 than the P3 i.e. Better than
<br>
suggested by the clock speed difference.  Since it fits in the cache, memory
<br>
bandwidth and latency is mostly irrelevant.
<br>
<p>For fp and vector codes that have data sets substantially larger than the
<br>
cache, the speed of the processor is irrelevant: a P3 will be memory limited
<br>
and the P4 will be memory limited.  The P4 has a poor memory architecture
<br>
and benchmarks as a dog compared to similarly clocked Athlon chips, due
<br>
solely to differences in memory architecture; the Athlon has more bandwidth,
<br>
so for memory limited problems it is faster, even at slower clock speeds.
<br>
Note that the P4 has 15-20% *worse* memory latency than the P3, so cache
<br>
efficiency is even more important on the P4 than on the P3.  What the P4
<br>
represents is one of the first times where the inter-generational
<br>
differences in processor performance are based almost solely on the memory
<br>
bus chipsets, not on the processor clock.
<br>
<p>As for having a botched design, you are mostly correct -- the memory
<br>
architecture is much worse than it has to be (addressed in the article).
<br>
The problem is that Intel doesn't have a huge amount of room to improve it.
<br>
For those classes of problem where everything (or most everything) fits in
<br>
the high-speed cache, it screams.  Unfortunately, we aren't talking about
<br>
those types of problems.
<br>
<p>The point to all this being that if you are running an AI, which presumably
<br>
will be churning on vast quantities of data, the clock speed doesn't matter.
<br>
What the benchmarks between the P3 and P4 show is that memory bandwidth is
<br>
already a serious crisis for data hungry apps.  The situation on the P4 is
<br>
so bad that they expect faster versions of the P4 to show no performance
<br>
improvement for cache killers, whereas it used to be that you got *some*
<br>
minor improvement with increased clock speeds even for these apps.
