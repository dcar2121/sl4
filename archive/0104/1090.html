<p>
I've been giving some thought to what a balanced
<br>
design for a future 'brainchip' would be.  By about
<br>
2014, the Semiconductor Industry Association projects
<br>
technology would allow a single chip with about 8
<br>
Gbytes of memory and 8 simple CPU cores that put out
<br>
about 8 GFlop each.  Such a chip should cost about
<br>
$12 (the same as a high end memory chip today), and
<br>
a complete system built with these chips could cost
<br>
around $30 per chip.
<br>
<p>I previously determined that an engineer-replacing
<br>
system would be worth around $3M, so we can afford
<br>
to incorporate about 100K of these chips in a system.
<br>
If we are running a simulated human cortex type AI,
<br>
allow 3 bytes of description per synapse.  Then each
<br>
neuron would require about 32K, and therefore each
<br>
chip would model 0.25 million neurons.  The whole
<br>
system would model 25 billion neurons, or roughly
<br>
a human cortex's worth.
<br>
<p>Simulating 2.5 billion synapses at 100 Hz with 1 byte
<br>
of calculation per synapse requires 64 GFlops, which
<br>
is what our 8 processor cores can provide.
<br>
<p>To get an idea of off-chip I/O requirements, assume
<br>
that neurons are arranged in a block of 63 x 63 x 63
<br>
units (63 being the cube root of 250,000).  And
<br>
assume that all 10,000 synapses of the surface neurons
<br>
are connected to neurons outside the block.  This
<br>
requires off chip I/O in the model.  The minimal
<br>
data carried off chip is &quot;I'm firing now&quot;, which
<br>
requires 1 bit per synapse.  Therefore 24 Gbits of
<br>
data need to move off chip, and presumably the same
<br>
coming in.
<br>
<p>The SIA projects being able to support up to 1500
<br>
data lines per chip package, so each data line would
<br>
be running at 32 Mhz, which is well within current
<br>
technology.  Even if every synapse of every neuron
<br>
leads off chip, the data lines would need to run at
<br>
333 Mhz, which is only slightly above current data
<br>
bus speeds.
<br>
<p>It may be required to carry more than 1 bit of data
<br>
per synapse firing off chip, or it may be possible
<br>
to do some data compression, but at least the numbers
<br>
seem to indicate a brain-simulating AI is not
<br>
completely out of the question for 2014 technology.
