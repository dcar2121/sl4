PREFACE:
<br>
<p>(I stopped reading FAI when I got to the references to Greg Egan's Diaspora.
<br>
Why? I don't want to have the book spoiled for me (yes, I'm that silly). 
<br>
I've finished &quot;The Origins of Virutue&quot; Sunday (BIG thumbs up!), and 
<br>
started Permutation City (also BIG thumbs up!). So if my understanding of
<br>
FAI is shallow, you'll know why). 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Fragile%20Feelings%20of%20an%20AI%20WAS:%20Gender%20Neutral%20Pronouns">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you implement &quot;fragile feelings&quot;, anyway?  An AI's evaluation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong Bayesian binding between others' images of verself and the AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual self?  Peculiar pictures held by others resulting in sharp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-reevaluations in ways that have strong qualitative effects on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior?  I just don't see that happening, and certainly not in ways that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are understandable or predictable using human emotional intuitions.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs that have large effects on behavior are not *always* the ones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are most confirmed by immediate experience (and hence too confirmed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flipped around by others' opinions) - but as a general rule, yes.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those *non*-experientially-confirmed beliefs that affect immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior were almost certainly put there by programmer affirmation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning that it would take sensory information at least as strong as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberate programmer affirmation to trash them.
</em><br>
<p><p>So let me ask, will the nascent FAI have a &quot;sense of self&quot;, which can have 
<br>
a positive or a negative emotional attachment? When the AI is young and still
<br>
working on self optimization, it is conceivable to me that one parameter to
<br>
tweak is &quot;propogation of self worth&quot;. When ver human teacher/programmer/role
<br>
models tells ver that something ve did was wrong, that lesson should be 
<br>
incorporated and used to affect future behavior. Is there a middle step, 
<br>
though? Is there an internal sense of failure, of having done something
<br>
wrong before the attempt to correct the problem? Humans have this. Do AI's
<br>
need it?
<br>
<p>At that point we can ask about the speed of the change and the depth the 
<br>
the effect of negative self worth in a &quot;fragile&quot; AI. Will AI's have feelings
<br>
to hurt? (this is a very basic question that's probably answered somewhere
<br>
in FAI, so you can send me a link that I'll read after FAI, after Diaspora,
<br>
after Permutation City :-)
