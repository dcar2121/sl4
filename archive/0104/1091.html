<em>&gt; &gt; What, do you think that corporate spies or government ones won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be able to acquire your code on way or another?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that by the time they want to acquire the code, &quot;the code&quot; will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of defending itself, will be capable of figuring out that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been kidnapped, and will be too complex (or deliberately self-obscured) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be passively modifiable in the face of self-created safeguards, by any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unassisted human programmer who steals it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before that time period, &quot;the code&quot; may be doing a few cool things, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing that would make anyone want to take the risk of illegal action to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire it.  Any AI that can't rewrite verself is probably not a threat to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity, even if stolen and corrupted.
</em><br>
<p>This seems naive.
<br>
<p>The risk would be something like this.
<br>
<p>Suppose, in 2005, you have a system that is 3/4 of the way to being
<br>
productively self-improving, AND, does enough useful things that some rich
<br>
crooked company wants to steal it.
<br>
<p>Then, the company may steal your code for its currently useful functions.
<br>
Their researchers may then take it to the point of productive
<br>
self-improvability.  Having more resources, perhaps they'll finish the thing
<br>
before you do.  And perhaps they'll edit out the Friendliness module,
<br>
replacing it with an &quot;Obey our Board of Directors at all costs&quot; module.
<br>
<p>There is a real future risk, though it's not a current one...
