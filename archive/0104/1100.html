</em><br>
<p>Ok I read the article now, and stick by what I said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are somewhat missing the point.  The comparisons are in fact typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a 800-MHz P3 and 1.5-GHz P4, but the difference in clock speed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immaterial if you actually look at the benchmarks (mostly because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benchmarks show *why* clock speed is immaterial).  In fact, the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squares perfectly with what I've been hearing on the hardware lists where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have been running their own benchmarks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For fp and vector codes *where the data fits in the cache*, you generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get much better performance with the P4 than the P3 i.e. Better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested by the clock speed difference.  Since it fits in the cache, memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth and latency is mostly irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>Except that the P4 fp unit is so badly done that a P3 will kill it on most
<br>
any straight fp app, UNLESS you recode to use SSE2 instead of normal fp
<br>
instructions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For fp and vector codes that have data sets substantially larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cache, the speed of the processor is irrelevant: a P3 will be memory limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the P4 will be memory limited.  The P4 has a poor memory architecture
</em><br>
<p>Well where does the &quot;Vortex&quot; benchmark mentioned in the article fit in?
<br>
Apparently it is larger than cache, yet the behavior demonstrated does not
<br>
scale based on the bandwidth. Rather it seems to be limited in the P4 case
<br>
by bad CPU design (bad penalties of branch prediction misses + filling up
<br>
cache with unneeded data) and higher latency memory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and benchmarks as a dog compared to similarly clocked Athlon chips, due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely to differences in memory architecture; the Athlon has more bandwidth,
</em><br>
<p>Actually no I believe even PC2100 DDR-SDRAM used on Athlon systems is far
<br>
lower bandwidth (2.1GB/sec) than the P4 theoretical maximum of 3.2GB/sec.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so for memory limited problems it is faster, even at slower clock speeds.
</em><br>
<p>I just don't see how your argument is stacking up here. Clearly the P4 is
<br>
a lame horse not because of the memory situation, unless you have an app
<br>
that requires low latency. Primarily the P4 is lame because it just plain
<br>
sucks itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that the P4 has 15-20% *worse* memory latency than the P3, so cache
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency is even more important on the P4 than on the P3.  What the P4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represents is one of the first times where the inter-generational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences in processor performance are based almost solely on the memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bus chipsets, not on the processor clock.
</em><br>
<p>Total BS IMO. The P4 primarily sucks due to its own totally radical differences
<br>
compared to the P3. The P4 has 20+ pipeline stages! And many other oddities
<br>
that trip it up. The memory actually is quite nice except for the latency. It
<br>
even has hardware prefetch and other goodies that the Athlon has yet to get.
<br>
Yet it can't do anything with it in many cases because the P4 is so unbalanced.
<br>
In some specific cases it screams along, and in others it is worse than an a
<br>
sub-ghz P3.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for having a botched design, you are mostly correct -- the memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture is much worse than it has to be (addressed in the article).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that Intel doesn't have a huge amount of room to improve it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For those classes of problem where everything (or most everything) fits in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the high-speed cache, it screams.  Unfortunately, we aren't talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those types of problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point to all this being that if you are running an AI, which presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be churning on vast quantities of data, the clock speed doesn't matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the benchmarks between the P3 and P4 show is that memory bandwidth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already a serious crisis for data hungry apps.  The situation on the P4 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so bad that they expect faster versions of the P4 to show no performance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement for cache killers, whereas it used to be that you got *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor improvement with increased clock speeds even for these apps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Here I can agree. Personally I hope they eventually move to some kind of
<br>
optical interconnect that would allow for much higher levels of bus performance.
<br>
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much demand for such things. Most
<br>
applications do just fine, and with upcoming hacks like large level 3 caches
<br>
being added to northbridges, the set of applications constrained by memory
<br>
bandwidth will shrink further.
