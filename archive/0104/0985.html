<p>&lt;&lt; Actually all this chatting on public mailing lists may not be the best
<br>
&nbsp;thing. I expect as time goes on we may feel the need to retreat even
<br>
&nbsp;farther. This list might become restricted membership, or we might kind
<br>
&nbsp;of disown it and leave it to be a higher level Extropians list. We'll see.
<br>
&nbsp;It's really up to Eliezer of course, but I think he agrees with this? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The sense of this statement seems to be, &quot;we (Brian and Eliezer) are moving 
<br>
to the high beyond&quot;. Also, as a technology, something will have to be 
<br>
produced, tangibly, before one can frighten or awe people with it. That, I 
<br>
will happily leave to you alphas and betas, while you chaps do what is 
<br>
deemed, necessary; to promote friendly AI
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;1. Chat with other smart people to see if there are any holes in our work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now this list helps with that, but as we get more staff this list
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will likely become less relevant to this concern. In latter stages of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research most likely none of our internal work will be available publicly.
<br>
<p>2. Spread the word to other AI developers about Friendly AI, and help them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrate it into their designs. Since the AI &quot;community&quot; is relatively
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small we think that once we become a bit more established no more real
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publicity will be required since pretty much everyone should have heard
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of us.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>These plans of action seem eminently, sensible, as long as you take into 
<br>
account the notion that it may be upended, perhaps, by a crack, team of AI 
<br>
tweakers, from Brazil or Bollywood; beating you to the punch. That always is 
<br>
possible with new inventions, such as Bell's telephone being patented, just a 
<br>
few hours before some other inventor brought in the same invention.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil's taking his concepts to a public forum, as well as Hugo DeGaris's 
<br>
websites, are actually a decent idea, since all the public may have, 
<br>
informationally, is Bill Joy, the Kill Joy, making the world safe for 
<br>
bio-colapse.  Joy sort of reminds me of a Citizen Cane billionaire, whining 
<br>
to the public about how bad technology is, while collecting the fat checks. 
<br>
Kind of a techno, &quot;let em' eat cake&quot;.
