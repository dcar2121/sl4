<em>&gt; It would not be friendly if it did.  I don't think any processing in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human could match a full SI.  However, I am more interested in what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens when every human who wishes is augmented to have the equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a 200 IQ and is plugged seamless into a network of such humans as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as AIs.  This is quite doable technically in the near term.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would think that such augmentation would take us to creating true SI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help tremendously in managing our ramp-up to Singularity.  There will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also be high pressure in many professions to augment.  Unaugmented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans will have a hard time keeping up with constantly wired, super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory equipped competitors with extra semantic analysis, reasoning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational and bayseian analysis built in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;High pressure to augment&quot;..this is already true.  The two professions
<br>
that immediately come to mind are medicine and law. Physicans who
<br>
work in areas other than very generalist family practice tend to work
<br>
with their hard drives and med-CDROMs as much as their steths.
<br>
Defining the etiology of a array of symptoms is less the problem than
<br>
adhering (and in some cases, rationally extending)  the standard of care
<br>
&nbsp;once you've figured out what you are going to call it :) Of all the
<br>
professions physicans seem the most likely to augment quickly and first,
<br>
&nbsp;they have the money, the motivation, and the requisite arrogance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyers similarly, though look-up functions would be more useful to them
<br>
I think...I'll ask my friend about this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha I dig constantly wired and super memory...please define
<br>
(preferably in lay terms) what you mean by &quot;extra semantic analysis&quot;
<br>
and &quot;computational and bayseian analysis&quot;.  I can imagine a wireheaded
<br>
doc having a databank onboard, or drawing a diagnosis differential in
<br>
&quot;the mind's eye&quot;...by &quot;semantic analysis&quot; are you meaning highlighting
<br>
all the nonsense words like absolutisms in speech/text taken in or something
<br>
completely different? Or are you talking about the mods you'd like to
<br>
have as a coder mistress? :)
