<em>&gt;You are somewhat missing the point.  The comparisons are in fact typically

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In short:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For fp and vector codes *where the data fits in the cache*, you generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get much better performance with the P4 than the P3 i.e. Better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggested by the clock speed difference.  Since it fits in the cache, memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bandwidth and latency is mostly irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For fp and vector codes that have data sets substantially larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cache, the speed of the processor is irrelevant: a P3 will be memory limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the P4 will be memory limited.  The P4 has a poor memory architecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and benchmarks as a dog compared to similarly clocked Athlon chips, due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solely to differences in memory architecture; the Athlon has more bandwidth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so for memory limited problems it is faster, even at slower clock speeds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Note that the P4 has 15-20% *worse* memory latency than the P3, so cache
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficiency is even more important on the P4 than on the P3.  What the P4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represents is one of the first times where the inter-generational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences in processor performance are based almost solely on the memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bus chipsets, not on the processor clock.
</em><br>
<p>I got the exact opposite conclusion from the article.  When discussing the 
<br>
SWIM benchmark the P4 outperformed the P3 by 2.5x.  The article states this 
<br>
is clearly due to the P4s 2.5x higher memory bandwidth.  Thus the P4 does 
<br>
much better on tasks which are constrained by memory bandwidth.  It goes on 
<br>
to say that such applications are uncommon (thus this result should not 
<br>
weigh as heavily).  However, AI software would most likely fall into this 
<br>
category since it requires a huge amount of data.  Thus the *should* P4 
<br>
perform much better than the P3 for AI software.
<br>
<p>Not to say that the P4 is a great chip design.  Reading further it appears 
<br>
that if the AI software was really performing well, the dam P4 would cut 
<br>
back to 750MHz to reduce heat buildup!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The point to all this being that if you are running an AI, which presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be churning on vast quantities of data, the clock speed doesn't matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What the benchmarks between the P3 and P4 show is that memory bandwidth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already a serious crisis for data hungry apps.  The situation on the P4 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so bad that they expect faster versions of the P4 to show no performance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improvement for cache killers, whereas it used to be that you got *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minor improvement with increased clock speeds even for these apps.
</em><br>
<p>Increasing the MHz of the P4 would have little to no effect on &quot;cache 
<br>
killer&quot; apps because they are bandwidth limited.  But this does also 
<br>
indicate that the P4 with its higher memory bandwidth (significantly higher 
<br>
than Athalon) would perform the best.  Plus, depending on which motherboard 
<br>
the tests used the P4 can utilize dual RDRAM busses for double the memory 
<br>
bandwidth.  I wonder which one the benchmark used.
