</em><br>
<p>I don't believe it is futile.  It would be bad policy to place all our
<br>
future eggs in the FAI basket alone.  Having MNT development within a
<br>
set of acceptable safety guidelines will give room for andvancement in
<br>
this area with perhaps more safety for longer than would otherwise be
<br>
the case.  In addition fforts to design blue goo, nanotech to fight off
<br>
nanotech level attacks or to build nanotech defense shields could be
<br>
quite essential to our future safety and well-being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are nanotech researchers who will have no  interest in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned in the increasingly mainstream study of nanotech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not the individual researchers but the heads of the countries,
<br>
corporations and grant committees that need to be convinced that these
<br>
protocols are necessary for the safety of themselves as much as everyone
<br>
else.  
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think SIAI spending time to promote FAI to other AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; designers would also be a waste of time, and that we should stay almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 100% focused on working on our own code (assuming a very harsh limit on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our available resources) ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Working on your own code is very, very important.  But preparing the
<br>
people, in and outside of AI, for what is coming is also important. 
<br>
Those that have an idea or two about this and some notion of
<br>
sociological structures and memes that might make the coming transitions
<br>
less chaotic and dangerous are also very needed.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I commend all efforts to bring about the inevitable coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spike in a way most conducive to the salvation of post-humanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however I do not claim to have the foggiest idea what that future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be, or exactly what is meant by &quot;safe&quot; implementation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI/nanotech.  Perhaps this is an inappropriate admission for this
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it is not that we have much idea of what the future will be as
<br>
it is that we project what kind of future we desire to have and look for
<br>
the the technological and other means to bring that into reality.  I
<br>
think it is up to us to design and create a future more than to be come
<br>
expert prognosticators. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; group, dedicated to post-singularity discussions, but it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest one, for which I have received some mild off-list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scolding:  I havent a clue what kind of future is waiting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us post-AI, post singularity, and post nanotech.  Hell, I cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even define exactly what I mean by the term &quot;us&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That is simply honest.  But we don't need to see into the future but see
<br>
how to create a future that is viable.
