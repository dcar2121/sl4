<p>I receive an angry, badly-spelled letter every month or so regarding one

of my personal sites; so far, SIAI hasn't even had that level of problem.
<br>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean there isn't a threat.

<br>
<p>If you were to ask me this as an entirely theoretical question involving
<br>
some *other* AI project, then I'd say that it would be seriously difficult
<br>
to take it underground in such a way that the world at large knew nothing
<br>
about it, and you'd probably have to wait for at least another few
<br>
iterations of Moore's Law before you could work on AI with that level of
<br>
diminished resources.  A cloning laboratory can relocate to the Third
<br>
World but people will probably still know where it is; running a seed AI
<br>
project over FreeNet would be possible but very, very difficult until
<br>
Moore's Law caught up.  So &quot;relinquishment&quot; wouldn't work forever, but it
<br>
wouldn't be a trivial obstacle either.
