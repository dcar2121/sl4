The inability of tech companies to cope adequately with new technologies is
<br>
discussed in Clayton Christenson's classic business book &quot;The Innovator's
<br>
Dilemma&quot;
<br>
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-9880361-6163150">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-9880361-6163150</a>)
<br>
<p>This isn't talking about wild new things like real AI or the Singularity,
<br>
it's talking about things like the move to 3 inch rather than 5 inch floppy
<br>
disks.
<br>
<p>In the tech industry like anywhere else, people build businesses around
<br>
particular products and niches, and then have difficulty thinking about
<br>
anything else.
<br>
<p>Look what happened to Xerox, a huge tech company.  They had the vision to
<br>
start PARC, a lab that developed all sorts of fantastic things, but not the
<br>
breadth of understanding to work these innovations into their product line.
<br>
So they're ailing while others have profited from PARC's innovations.
<br>
<p>What about Autonomy, a company that was worth $9 billion and is now worth
<br>
around a $600M.  They made their business selling document management
<br>
software -- search &amp; categorization, basically.  Were they ever interested
<br>
in incorporating any kind of software intelligence into their products,
<br>
beyond simple Bayesian statistics?  No.  Why not?  Because their marketing
<br>
people told them that it's not intelligence that sells products, it's
<br>
packaging and marketing.
<br>
<p>There were of course many visionary people at Xerox, and possibly at
<br>
Autonomy as well (OK, I doubt it, but you never know).  But to deploy
<br>
long-term vision in a business context is hard.  Very few people even try.
<br>
I tried and failed at that, frankly.  I excelled at the vision but failed to
<br>
build a workable business around it.  I feel I could have if this or that
<br>
stroke of bad luck hadn't happened, but that's sort of beside the point, at
<br>
this point....  I do feel like I know a lot more now, so that I'd have a
<br>
higher chance of success a second time around...
<br>
<p>I note that Microsoft has been exceptionally willing &amp; able to think out of
<br>
the box and shift its direction radically in response to changes it observes
<br>
in the environment.  They're not willing to look 5 years into the future,
<br>
but at least they're willing to look 1-2 years into the future instead of
<br>
just looking at the past.  This is part of the reason for their phenomenal
<br>
success (obviously there are many, many other ingredients).  They rarely
<br>
innovate themselves, but they look at what others are doing, guess which of
<br>
others' activities have the most future potential, and then buy or steal
<br>
others products accordingly.  Of course, they also got some exceptional
<br>
strokes of ~good~ luck early on...
