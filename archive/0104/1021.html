<p>Thanks Samantha.  Since the formation of the sl4 group, I
<br>
have been giving the post-singularity world a lot of thought,
<br>
but I don't seem to have any real insights.  That future seems
<br>
hidden behind a foggy veil of chaos.
<br>
<p>For instance, regarding an earlier comment on chess software,
<br>
we didn't really know that human-like chess was a mechanical
<br>
task until it was demonstrated.  Likewise, most chess playing
<br>
programmers might now argue that writing software is a task
<br>
that can be accomplished by software in an overgrown
<br>
calculator.  When that occurs, then the process goes open
<br>
loop, and what happens after that is a mystery to me.
<br>
<p>The first example of this might be already upon us: again
<br>
in the chess world.  A version of chess software has adjustable
<br>
parameters.  A uber-program selects the parameters, plays
<br>
the software against itself a bunch of times, adjusts the
<br>
parameters, plays again, etc, thus discovering the most optimal
<br>
configuration.  Rumor has it that the software discovered a truth
<br>
millions of humans found in 500 years of play: that knights are
<br>
better than bishops in a closed board with lots of pieces, but
<br>
as the game progresses and the board clears out a little, the
<br>
bishops are better than the knights.  There is a computer-
<br>
generated algorithm now that adjusts the relative value of
<br>
bishop vs. knight, making for a slightly better program.
<br>
