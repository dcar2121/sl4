</em><br>
<p><p>I should have mentioned that I have never tried to apply these constructs on
<br>
a global basis, as there are obvious problems with computational
<br>
intractability.  I had already developed an interesting adaptive
<br>
partitioning algorithm (something completely outside that paper), that
<br>
allows the problems to be computationally tractable in implementation.
<br>
<p>Human brains appear to partition from a blank substrate at birth into a
<br>
cluster of specialized partitions created as a consequence of the
<br>
environment they are subjected to.  You create domains as needed on the fly,
<br>
adding depth of specialization where necessary.  This is a rather
<br>
conservative approach to learning (learning only what is forced on you by
<br>
the environment), but it creates the type of specialization that allows
<br>
intelligence to be feasible and creates areas of intelligence that have
<br>
proven utility to the human/AI.  I don't know anybody who is a universal
<br>
intelligence; humans seem to be large collections of specialization of
<br>
varying depth, which judging from the consequences of the mathematics in
<br>
question here, grants a strong evolutionary advantage over being a Universal
<br>
Intelligence (which *can't* specialize significantly for most intents and
<br>
purposes).
<br>
<p>My history on this is kind of backwards.  I developed an interesting and
<br>
unusual adaptive partitioning algorithm for some data mining research, and
<br>
while doing related research, tripped across some interesting papers on
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity and universal predictor functions.  I immediately
<br>
noticed the potential relationship between algorithmic complexity and AI,
<br>
and after further research, realized that I also had an algorithm that
<br>
allowed the AI model I had developed to become tractable.  Basically I took
<br>
a Universal Intelligence model and derived a functionally equivalent
<br>
specialization model that is computationally constrained by
<br>
experience/environment.
<br>
<p>The theory of Universal Intelligence isn't so valuable because it is a
<br>
solution to the problem of AI (although it does give it an excellent
<br>
mathematical basis), rather it is valuable because it gives us specific
<br>
implementation problems to solve, that when solved, should theoretically
<br>
result in a functional AI.  Being able to know what needs to be done is a
<br>
big step in the right direction.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
