</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Presumably, this fairly intelligent AI will run on hardware that is affordable
<br>
to you and Eli and the great masses of AI researchers like you, which means
<br>
that it needs to be able to run on a cluster costing $100,000-$1,000,000.
<br>
<p>If you get something like that working, you can almost certainly get major
<br>
funding to quickly put 1,000 of these in service, all communicating with each
<br>
other in a higher-bandwidth way than we humans can concretely imagine.  That
<br>
is, you can more or less instantaneously communicate new research findings of
<br>
the group throughout the entire group.
<br>
<p>Investment in this sort of thing is likely to be *enormous* in the coming years,
<br>
making this little old Internet bubble look quaint by comparison.  As a businessman,
<br>
if I can buy 1,000 engineers who work 24x7 with a degree of communication among them
<br>
several orders of magnitude greater than a similarly-sized human staff, I can 
<br>
make a LOT of money fast.  I'll just have some subset of them work on writing
<br>
software that we can sell, or on redesign of manufacturing processes, etc.
<br>
<p>I don't think it makes sense, economically speaking, to imagine some lone researcher
<br>
(or institute) somewhere will make the major leaps forward needed to get to strong
<br>
AI.  Instead, in the years leading up to that, we'll see an ever increasing amount
<br>
of investment in it, in all kinds of companies and contexts.  There are markets for
<br>
incresingly intelligent products and services of all kinds, all the way up to strong
<br>
AI.
