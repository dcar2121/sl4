<p>
Okay, sorry if we've touched on this before or if it's covered 
<br>
elsewhere, but I couldn't remember doing so, which leads me to bring 
<br>
this up now.  If it's all been done before, just post some links and 
<br>
I'll come back if there is something to respond to therein.
<br>
<p>My thought is that we don't need a Sysop, but an alternative that 
<br>
will have the same effect.  See, my problem with the Sysop is that it 
<br>
is an actual intelligence.  I see this as a problem because it should 
<br>
act the same way as all other SIs will.  In that case, the Sysop is 
<br>
going to have to be pretty damn bug free to work.  Sure, all code has 
<br>
bugs and they get fixed, but the Sysop is given enough power that one 
<br>
little bug could cause major problems.  Thus, in my opinion, we need 
<br>
to change how the system works by not creating an intelligence to 
<br>
take care of matters of morality (because the Sysop is enforcing 
<br>
morality through the ethics of Friendliness) and instead work on 
<br>
implimenting morality directly.
<br>
<p>But first, and introduction to where I'm coming from.  :-)
<br>
<p>My thinking stems from natural laws.  The quick run down is that 
<br>
natural laws make morality a facet of the nature of a system.  Lions 
<br>
have certain morals because their nature requires it.  Now, humans 
<br>
are a funny animal.  Unlike other animals, for whom morals == natural 
<br>
laws, humans can use their intelligence to create artificial morals. 
<br>
The more intelligent we get, the stronger (therefore, worse) the 
<br>
artificial morals.  Much of the trouble of the world today can be 
<br>
ascribed to such artificial morals that have supplanted the natural 
<br>
ones.
<br>
<p>For those interested, humans are naturally selfish, just like all 
<br>
other animals, and everything done is in respect to that (well, at 
<br>
least when not supplanted).  Respect for the desires of others is 
<br>
another (Eliezer has a good v word for this that I keep forgetting), 
<br>
which is really an outgrowth of selfishness but I figured that I 
<br>
should point out for the list's benefit.  Also, humans have a concept 
<br>
of property and is naturally highly respected, but it has been 
<br>
supplated by plenty of societies with leaders who want to violate 
<br>
your property.  Also, in some societies, a lack of scarcity was 
<br>
experienced for long enough to abandon the idea of property (since 
<br>
scarcity and better survival are reasons for having property).
<br>
<p>Also, just to clear up one more thing before I go on, stop thinking 
<br>
of selfishness as being the same thing as being greedy.  I've written 
<br>
at length about this subject in other forums, but the short of it is 
<br>
that greediness looks at the gross benefit while selfishness looks at 
<br>
the net benefit.  Maybe I've written about it here before, too, but 
<br>
I'm just trying to cover all the bases before I move on.
<br>
<p>Now, back to what I really was posting about.  If you have questions 
<br>
about the above, let's keep them off list unless they somehow 
<br>
directly effect my proposal below.  They were meant for your benefit 
<br>
so that you could understand the basic assumptions that I made to 
<br>
come to my line of reasoning.
<br>
<p>Now, what I propose we do is that, rather than creating a Sysop, 
<br>
program into the system morals as natural laws and make them be 
<br>
enforced.  In other words, the system actively makes it not possible 
<br>
to act outside of what is moral by the natural laws.  How will we 
<br>
figure those laws out?  Why, we have some AIs around first that are 
<br>
SIs and are more or less Friendly and maybe some post humans that we 
<br>
trust will not set up their own morals or drag along their human 
<br>
ones, let them live in a system for a while, figure out what the 
<br>
naturaly emergent laws are, and then impliment them at the most basic 
<br>
levels of the system.  Then, everyone who wants to use the Earth 
<br>
created Singulartiy technology will have to do so based on what we 
<br>
determine to be the natural laws.  No more allowing the intelligent 
<br>
to break their own laws, we just make it impossible.  I realize 
<br>
already that most of the complaints about the Sysop (SIs outside of 
<br>
ver control, bugs, et al.), but it is free from some others, like the 
<br>
Sysop's potential to abuse power, ver limited ability to enforce 
<br>
morality (after all, there's only so much Sysop to go around), ver 
<br>
need to be watched to ensure that there are not bugs and the ability 
<br>
to decide that there is a bug, etc..
<br>
<p>Right now I feel like I have a piece of swiss with a few small holes 
<br>
(though it is late; look at the time stamp), but maybe you can open 
<br>
up some larger ones.
<br>
<p>Also, I've been thinking.  Back when the industrial revolution 
<br>
started, many people looked at the new technology and wondered how 
<br>
the world would ever work unless the state stepped in and managed 
<br>
things (thus the rise in the popularity of socialism around these 
<br>
times in various locations).  Today, it is easy to see how our 
<br>
industrial and now informational society could work without state 
<br>
intervention, but the future looks uncertain.  It seems again that 
<br>
the state (or our equivilant of it) will have to step in and regulate 
<br>
to make things work out alright.  Considering the past, I have to 
<br>
wonder if we'll see the same thing again in the future or if these 
<br>
technologies really are going to be capable of destroying everything 
<br>
to the extent that what bit of natural laws survive on their own will 
<br>
not be enough to prevent the End of Everything.
<br>
<p>I have my own ideas which should be pretty obvious, but I need some 
<br>
feedback.  Maybe I'm missing something and I just need it pointed out.
<br>
<p>Well, that's enough for tonight.  I'm tired.  I'll go to bed and 
<br>
worry about this in the morning when the rest of the list is awake 
<br>
and has had a chance to respond.  :-)
<br>
<p>Good night.
<br>
