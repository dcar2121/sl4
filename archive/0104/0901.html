<em>&gt;Ok James, so what exactly is your ideal future scenario? If you insist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having some mystery left in the Universe I'm sure the Sysop will oblige
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you by modifying your memories and dumping you permanently into a simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality of medieval Europe. If you request such a thing of course.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Who says that isn't what has already happened? Perhaps we all became bored with
<br>
our god-like status, and asked to be dumped in his existence with no memories of
<br>
our past to haunt us. Maybe when someone figures out the secret to AI, we get to
<br>
get back into our old clothes, and push around subatomic particles again. (or
<br>
whatever it is that would be interesting to an SI...)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I think that James was just trying to make the point that human nature thrives
<br>
on the pursuit of the unknown, and that might be a hard thing to pursue when the
<br>
Sysop has already made everything known. It might be more fun for some
<br>
post-Singularity citizens to go outside the confines of the Sysop and experience
<br>
what the rest of the universe has to offer, even if the trade off is expiring in
<br>
some far-off cosmic event. If the Sysop won't allow that to happen, &quot; for our
<br>
own good... &quot;, well, then I guess we're screwed. If you thought it was hard to
<br>
argue with your parents when you were five, imagine when the Sysop says,
<br>
&quot;...because I said so, that's why! &quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Come to think of it, a guarantee of complete immunity to harm would take the
<br>
fun out of lots of stuff. I'm not talking Russian Roulette here, just something
<br>
like mountain climbing. Everest isn't much of a challenge if you know that it
<br>
can't kill you. Eventually, no matter how many times you fall over the side, you
<br>
know you'll make it to the top if you are unable to die. Does kinda take the
<br>
challenge out of it, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Of course, I've never enjoyed playing computer games, for pretty much the same
<br>
reason. If all the Sysop scenario can offer is the best computer game ever, with
<br>
infinite &quot;do overs &quot;, I might be a little disappointed myself.
<br>
