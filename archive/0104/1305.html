</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a forum of this caliber. You have people hanging out who know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much about it as you do about your interests. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I doubt any of the people involved with Friendly AI know that much about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eastern thought, to judge from your posts. No offense.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I do know a *bit* more about Eastern philosophy than shows up in my
<br>
post - I understand exactly the point you're making - but I guess I'm
<br>
basically guilty as charged when it comes to not knowing the details.  Why
<br>
would I?
<br>
<p>But just for the record, I deleted from the eventual post a sentence
<br>
saying &quot;The Sysop has an identity, and the Tao is nameless; the Sysop has
<br>
an origin; it is a thing.&quot;  And I could easily go on for days.  They are,
<br>
ultimately, two unrelated concepts.  The point I'm making is that, rather
<br>
than the Sysop not being God, the Sysop is not the Tao.  If you see what I
<br>
mean.
<br>
<p>Remember also that there are two kinds of pop Taoism.  There's the pop
<br>
Taoism of the New Agers and the pop Taoism of Smullyan or the pop Zen
<br>
picked up by anyone who reads &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot;.  My guess is that I'd
<br>
prefer the scientific community's pop version of Eastern philosophy to the
<br>
real thing, even if I was fully acquainted with both (while utterly
<br>
rejecting the New Age pop version, of course).  After all, as far as I'm
<br>
concerned it's just a few interesting ideas about how to order one's own
<br>
mind, not any form of received truth, and thus the scientists' pop Taoism
<br>
is likely to actually be more useful than the original.  &quot;Pop&quot; Taoism is
<br>
probably the wrong word, in fact; I would call it &quot;filtered&quot; Taoism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a product of the agnostic/aethist/secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanist/transhumanist philosophy spectrum FAI is bound to be  perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in religous terms by the Masses, and in that quarter..you are the Whore of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Babylon, and the FAI/Sysop is either the Antichrist or the False Prophet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the obvious perception most will make. ::shrugs:::
</em><br>
<p>My religious family and friends, back when I was living anywhere near
<br>
them, made analogies between the Messianic era and the Singularity.  But
<br>
of course people want to bring an end to suffering.  Back when this was
<br>
technologically impossible, people satisfied their desire by prophesizing
<br>
an eventual better world.  Now that it's become technologically possible,
<br>
people like me want to go out and build it directly.  Common third cause
<br>
and association, not direct causation either way.  I just want to note
<br>
that - in a sense, unsurprisingly - religious people who don't like
<br>
technology analogize between technology and the Devil, while religious
<br>
people who do like technology analogize between technology and Heaven.  In
<br>
both cases the analogies are patently flawed, but I honestly don't see
<br>
that the first analogy as stronger than the second.
