</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now *that's* a new opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do you think about prototyping?  C++ doesn't seem like a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language for that - I was thinking Python, actually.
</em><br>
<p>If you want something that is somewhere between Java &amp; C/C++ I'd suggest 
<br>
Delphi or Kylix.  Borland's Object Pascal is very clean so you get a lot of 
<br>
the same advantages as using Java from a programming 
<br>
standpoint.  Development is very quick compared to C/C++, incredibly so for 
<br>
user interfaces, which you probably won't need much of.  Due to the way BOP 
<br>
handles memory, you don't end up with anywhere near the bugs you do in 
<br>
C.  On the other hand Delphi/Kylix use the same optimized compiler backend 
<br>
as Borland's C compilers so you get excellent speed.  As for 3rd party 
<br>
software there are quite a lot of 3rd party native Delphi libraries 
<br>
available.  You can also use any tool kit written for Visual Basic (with 
<br>
some performance penalty since they use ActiveX).  Many C/C++ libraries are 
<br>
also useable if they provide DLLs.
<br>
<p>The only problem with using Borland's Object Pascal language is 
<br>
portability.  Although this is thankfully getting much much better.  Delphi 
<br>
runs on Windows and now Kylix runs on Linux.  New source code written in 
<br>
Delphi 6 is in the area of 99.9% compatible with Kylix.  The idea is that 
<br>
you can have a single source code base that supports both platforms, 
<br>
including GUI code.  And it works great if you use their compatibility set 
<br>
of visual components (CLX).  But any code written that the programmer 
<br>
doesn't specifically tie to Windows libraries is compatible, so this is far 
<br>
more compatible than even C++ across Windows &amp; Linux.  Plus it looks like 
<br>
Borland is now considering support for additional operating systems!
<br>
<p>Anyway, just my 2 cents worth.
