<em>&gt; And he referred to staff turning to alcohol and prostitution.  There was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of drinking going on, which I mentioned in my essay, but in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portions of our staff were ~always~ hearty partiers.  There was one
</em><br>
incident
<br>
<em>&gt; where a staff member got arrested for supposed solicitation of
</em><br>
prostitution
<br>
<em>&gt; (he says he wasn't guilty).  But this was a very minor part of it all.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more ~interesting~ human angle to the story has to do with the 10-15 staff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we brought here on H1-B's who are scrambling to find jobs in a tough job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market, lest they be deported.  This is a much more major &quot;human aspect&quot;
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the WM dissolution than &quot;alcohol &amp; prostitution,&quot; and ties in with general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social &amp; economic trends with which Wired news should be concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And really, given the size of your company is there a good chance that some
<br>
of the members were availing themselves of position even in the best of
<br>
times. Surely as a statistical thing the chances must have been reasonably
<br>
good. A more to the point, who really gives a fuck--as it were. If the guy
<br>
had been working the streets in order to generate revenue for WM, then this
<br>
would have been news. Indeed, I think I'll include this in my piece of
<br>
journalism on WM. :) But this does give me a good idea. Perhaps you could
<br>
have WM2 work in the phone sex trade. Presumably this could be done fairly
<br>
easily since only minimal intelligence is required for this work. I don't
<br>
think this would be a matter of fraud. Surely we are not going to allow
<br>
discrimination just because WM2 is &quot;orifice challenged&quot;. :)
