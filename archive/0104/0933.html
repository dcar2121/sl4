<p>Greetings to each and everyone,
<br>
<p>I've only posted to this list once or twice (I never read any archives up
<br>
till a few months ago), however:
<br>
It did not take me much to realize that Eliezer HAS GOT SOMETHING which
<br>
others (software engineers, AI coders etc...) do not have.
<br>
The details of which are explained (at least that was enough for me) in
<br>
&quot;Coding a Transhuman AI 1/2&quot; and &quot;Algernon's law&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Eliezer has already covered some of these topics at various points in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writing, but it might be a good idea to condense this stuff into one place,
</em><br>
as an
<br>
<em>&gt;introduction to the subject, perhaps. (the Singularity for Dummies?)
</em><br>
<p>I believe that anyone interested should read ALL the material on Low Beyond
<br>
+ archives + do some digging on their own to start with.
<br>
People need to do their homework, they do...
<br>
A 'Singularity for Dummies' sounds like a joke to me. Do not get me wrong,
<br>
but with all due respect: why should dummies need
<br>
to understand the Singularity ?  More importantly with threats such as
<br>
Military-grade Nanotech etc... why should Eliezer (and the SingInst)
<br>
spend time on ANYTHING but what they're already busy with now ?
<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>
<p><p>Arona,
<br>
