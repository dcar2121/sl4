</em><br>
<p>Actually, a subset of a language that met this criterion would suffice.  For
<br>
example, you could define a subset of C++ that had roughly the semantic power of
<br>
Java or Eiffel or some other formalizable language.  By writing the system in
<br>
that subset, you get to use the good compilers available for C++, but keep the
<br>
programs possible to reason about.  One problem is that you may want to use
<br>
substantial bodies of existing code (libraries and the like) that won't fit in
<br>
the subset.
<br>
<p>I suspect that Python is a particularly good substrate for this trick of
<br>
defining a tractable subset.  It's already got fairly clean semantics, and its
<br>
metaobject protocol introduces additional semantic flexibility that can be used
<br>
to warp parts of the language that don't fit into your favorite model.
<br>
<p>In fact, subsetting is a reasonable strategy even for non-self-rewriting
<br>
programs: if you insist on using C++, it is wise to confine yourself to a
<br>
carefully chosen subset, to ease human comprehension of the programs.  I know
<br>
shops that follow rules like these:
<br>
--No multiple inheritance.
<br>
--No pointers, only references.
<br>
--No references, only pointers.
<br>
--All objects must support reference-counted garbage collection.
<br>
--Don't use char* for strings, use some better locally developed class.
<br>
--No RTTI.
<br>
--No &lt;dynamic_cast&gt;.
<br>
<p>The problem is that C++ is such a huge and unwieldy language that simply to
<br>
maintain sanity, you have to come up with a set of rules and customs like these
<br>
at the beginning of a project.  If you allow yourself free use of all of C++'s
<br>
features in a large program, you will run into compiler bugs and weird
<br>
interactions between features, and the program will be hell to debug.  On the
<br>
other hand, at the beginning of a project is the worst time to have to decide on
<br>
such rules, since it is when you know the least about the problems you will run
<br>
into.
<br>
<p>Thinking about things like this makes me say &quot;C++!  Aargh, what a horrible
<br>
language! I will confine myself to Java, Python, and snippets of C henceforth!&quot;
<br>
But then I look at the system my company builds, which involves some big-time
<br>
hairy distributed programming, mostly in C++, and compare it to a similar system
<br>
written in Java, and jobs dominated by interprocess communication run thousands
<br>
of times faster.  And then I get all tossed up and conflicted and have to go
<br>
write some EMACS macros until I feel better.
