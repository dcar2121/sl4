<em>&gt; &gt; You are free to call me an elitist, since I feel that this decision is

<em>&gt;best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made by the elite (us) than by the uninformed masses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why is it that, every time anyone ever divides humanity into the &quot;elite&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the &quot;masses&quot;, they always wind up categorizing themselves as one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the elite?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, you're free to call yourself the elite, just as I'm free to look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sentence above and decide that you're being pushed around by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elementary group-polarization forces, thus placing firm upper bounds on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your probable levels of self-awareness and knowledge of evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychology.
</em><br>
<p>i tend also unfortunately to classify people into elite and masses 
<br>
categories, but i find that my categories vary wildly with the definitive 
<br>
characteristic of &quot;eliteness&quot;.
<br>
<p>for example, i happen to be near the tippy-top of the elite when it comes to 
<br>
priviliged information about my girlfriend. the unenlightened masses know 
<br>
nothing, in their grubbing unaware existence, of the heights of her thought, 
<br>
passion, and most secret thoughts.
<br>
<p>on the other hand, you have different fingers.
<br>
<p>but in a counter-example, i know absolutely nothing, and am most definitely 
<br>
in the deadening grip of &quot;the herd&quot; when we speak of real threats to, say, 
<br>
national security. i have no real conception of what faces our country, and 
<br>
maintain the vague and naive feeling that all is well with our country, no 
<br>
one will bomb us, the po-lice will continue to have minor problems with 
<br>
discipline and manners, but keep on keeping us alive. the elite, people who 
<br>
actually know what is threatening our precious status quo, are most likely 
<br>
few in number, most assuredly, an elite!
<br>
<p>rather uninterestingly, however, most distinctions of &quot;elite&quot; tend to have 
<br>
rather general definitions, like &quot;we're smart, and they're not&quot; or that the 
<br>
herd is a general distinction of boring pop-non-speek. and simply becomes a 
<br>
handy generalization for &quot;everyone else&quot;.
<br>
<p>i'll agree with /christian that there are a lot of undesirables out there. 
<br>
particularly reactionaries with nasty litigary streaks, who would just love 
<br>
to shut down webmind and singinst and hold the two up as symbolic 
<br>
figureheads of those crazy power-mad technologists.
<br>
<p>so flying under public radar makes some sense.
<br>
<p>but running the Last Program is a long way from some elite haXOR friends, 
<br>
swilling mountain dew, hacking out a seed AI in python and mod-perl in their 
<br>
basement.
<br>
it's going to take a heck of a search for code poets and hardware designers, 
<br>
angel investors and supporters. not to mention people to baby the Seed 
<br>
through it's toddly first steps, and be there to make sure the hard takeoff 
<br>
goes smoothly. Strong AI touches on nearly every discipline, and coders are 
<br>
going to need people who can explain cognition in every respect.
<br>
<p>so keeping stuff to ourselves about this isn't going to work, because maybe 
<br>
the Specialist who can put in the capstone isn't going to hear about it. Or 
<br>
the like minded technophile with a multi-XMP test-bed (or whatever 
<br>
equivilant in 10 years) won't know to offer his company's hardware riches.
<br>
<p>and just speaking of singularity-relations in general. call me old 
<br>
fashioned, but i feel like if we're going to completely upset the world of 
<br>
trillions of people, i at least ought to attempt to tell them about it. you 
<br>
know, manners.  just because what we're doing is ethical in long-term ness, 
<br>
doesn't keep it from being insufferably rude to just spring on people. hell, 
<br>
just to keep the heart-attacks down, when people first hear about our 
<br>
success, it'd be worth it.
<br>
<p>if we're going to divide into elite and herd, here, we better be sure the 
<br>
divisions are right. i consider myself pretty knowledgable about sl3+ 
<br>
matters, i like sci fi, i like science, i've read OMNI and discover all my 
<br>
life. (till discover shut down omni, curse them). but as far as software 
<br>
issues and technical details of AIs, put me in the herd. I just switched 
<br>
majors this year, from art to computer engineering, when i heard about this 
<br>
stuff. because before that, i knew squat about programming. i still know 
<br>
squat. but i know a bit more of it. so i switched and i'm gonna learn a bit 
<br>
more. why? because i think i'm going to be a cool mod programmer and hack 
<br>
out the visual cortex of the Singinst AI? no. i'm pretty sure i won't 
<br>
contribute some critical piece. but i'm pretty sure i can help somehow. and 
<br>
damned if i won't give someone else  the same chance.
<br>
<p>the one cool thing about grouping people into herds and elites is you give 
<br>
them an option they didn't have before. now they have a herd they can leave. 
<br>
and an elite to join.
