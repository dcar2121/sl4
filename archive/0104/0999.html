<p>Well he wanted to know how it would be possible before BOTH nanotech and AI.
<br>
We don't see a way for that scenario to occur. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This leads to some critical questions that I have not seen information
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch the seed AI?  If the SAI was on a single, non-networked computer it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; became.  Or is the plan to give the seed AI complete access to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet?  or ?
</em><br>
<p>We are thinking it will be on a private (non connected) network at first,
<br>
with access to some kind of large archive of content to learn from.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, it is obviously expected that this seed AI, after upgrading many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fold, will invent and gain access to nanotechnology.  How does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur?  Even if it invents nanotech, the first assembler has to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically built.  How is this expected to occur?
</em><br>
<p>One way to envision it is a funny scene from Star Trek IV: the enterprise
<br>
crew is trapped in the past, and they need some expensive materials to
<br>
accomplish their mission. So they go down to a factory and exchange the
<br>
formula for &quot;transparent aluminum&quot; (or somesuch) in exchange for what they
<br>
need. So our AI gets smart, comes up with a design for a real assembler,
<br>
we trade that to Zyvex in exchange for getting a copy of the first one they
<br>
make. The point is that a very intelligent AI can produce some very
<br>
valuable intellectual property.
