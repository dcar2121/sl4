<p>Pehaps Brian and Eliezer could give us some background on this. Has there 
<br>
been any threats or communications from extremist or religous groups etc 
<br>
regarding the Singularity Institute so far? Or is SL4 one level too high 
<br>
for them to comprehend and take seriously?
<br>
<p>If the research (i.e. AI coding) had to go underground how difficult would 
<br>
that be to do? I presume there won't be too much physical equipment 
<br>
involved (unlike, say, a cloning laboratory)  so would it be possible to 
<br>
relocate and for the group to split up and share data securely over the 
<br>
internet?
