universe,

</em><br>
<p>I am an international tax consultant/diddler for various high tech 
<br>
companies. While what Eliezer has stated is partially true, I don't think 
<br>
the nonprofit regime is as ironclad as he portrays it.  On the other hand, 
<br>
I think it is a mistake to use a nonprofit as an alternative to secure 
<br>
robust funding for artificial intelligence or Singularity research.  Its a 
<br>
mistake not for arcane tax or legal reasons but rather a practical reason. 
<br>
&nbsp;Nonprofits, especially public charities, are successful because of their 
<br>
ability to tap the limited resources of many people, i.e., the public. For 
<br>
the public to contribute to a nonprofit entity, they need to understand 
<br>
the charitable purposes and activities of an entity.  You're competing for 
<br>
charitable funding with religious organizations, the United Way, Jerry's 
<br>
kids, etc.  All of these entities have charitable objectives easily 
<br>
comprehended by the general public.  You'll be engaged in an uphill battle 
<br>
attempting to attract public funding.  I think Eliezer perceives this to 
<br>
be the lay of the land relative to SIAI.
<br>
<p>As for wealthy benefactors, if you look at capital expenditures of wealthy 
<br>
people their venture capital investments dwarf their charitable giving. 
<br>
You're in a qualitatively better position attempting to convince 
<br>
sophisticated VC firms (who are fanatically devoted towards identifying 
<br>
the next &quot;big thing&quot; so they can be the next Vinod Khosla) to fund your 
<br>
project rather compete with the colleges, museums, etc. who solicit 
<br>
wealthy benefactors for funding.  Of course, the viability of this 
<br>
approach depends on your intentions.  Are you designing something with 
<br>
commercial applications or advancing towards the Singularity?  VC firms 
<br>
probably won't have much interest in advancing society towards the 
<br>
Singularity for obvious reasons.  VC firms, however, would jump at AI 
<br>
technology that had commercial applications such as code debugging or 
<br>
composition.  I made the point some time ago to Eliezer (which was 
<br>
included in an incarnation of one of his Singularity pieces) that the best 
<br>
way to fund AI research is to get one of two groups interested in it: the 
<br>
military complex or &quot;big business&quot;.
