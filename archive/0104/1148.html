After I wrote the original - which apparently got forwarded around a bit -
<br>
the following exchange took place:
<br>
<p>==

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Philosophers across the galaxy have argued over the purpose of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Eternal Clock.  As with other artifacts such as the Diamond Book, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Circle of Time, the Oracle, and the Wandering Flame, consensus holds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;that the motive was not religious or superstitious in nature, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;philosophical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd love to know what the other artifacts are: Diamond Book, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Circle of Time, the Oracle, and the Wandering Flame.
</em><br>
<p>==
<br>
<p>The Wandering Flame was created by a species that, in a rare coincidence,
<br>
began acquiring industrial technology just as their home planet was
<br>
entering a new Ice Age.  The species successfully staved off global
<br>
cooling - first through deliberate emission of greenhouse gases, then
<br>
through orbital solar mirrors, and finally, as they reached the heights of
<br>
technology, through direct reversal of the underlying climatic effect.  In
<br>
celebration, they constructed the Wandering Flame, an artificial sunlet
<br>
that shines for one seventeenth of an orbital period over any planet on
<br>
which a sentient species successfully manages an environmental crisis. 
<br>
Although the Wandering Flame often delivers more solar energy than the
<br>
planet's original star, no climatic or ecological side effects occur. 
<br>
When not fulfilling its primary function, the Wandering Flame can usually
<br>
be found in the asteroid belt of some otherwise uninteresting star system.
<br>
<p>The Oracle is a spherically-shaped region of space, roughly 32 light-hours
<br>
in diameter, located around 2 light-years to the galactic north of
<br>
Elnath.  The Oracle will answer one question for each petitioner;
<br>
unfortunately, there is no way to know in advance which question it is. 
<br>
Only seventeen questions have ever been answered, four of them asked by
<br>
accident and apparently trivial, but in each case the petitioner expressed
<br>
a profound sense of satisfaction and enlightenment.
<br>
<p>The Circle of Time appears as a circular path of beaten silver,
<br>
eighty-three meters in diameter.  When you set foot on the Circle at any
<br>
point, the path begins to move, conveying you along the Circle.  It
<br>
appears to take exactly fifteen minutes and twenty-eight seconds for you
<br>
to reach your starting point, although on exiting, no external time
<br>
appears to have passed.  Many past and future selves of the fifteen
<br>
minutes are visible in their corresponding positions along the Circle of
<br>
Time, and you can converse with yourself as desired.
<br>
<p>The Diamond Book has the density and appearance of purest diamond.  No
<br>
matter how many pages are turned, there are still as many left.  The
<br>
weight and volume of the Book never increase.  No page has ever been found
<br>
containing words, pictures, or other visible content, though each page
<br>
sparkles beautifully and individually.  Those who read the Book by gazing
<br>
on several pages in succession feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and
<br>
grief.  The emotion is not debilitating but cathartic, and has inspired
<br>
great artistic works and a lasting end to several wars.  Despite the
<br>
thousands of intrigues that have broken out in competition for possession
<br>
of the sole portable artifact, no violent conflict has ever occurred.
