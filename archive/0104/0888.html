</em><br>
<p>This is the natural way.  We start using this pronoun more or less 
<br>
spontaneously (it doesn't really matter where we got the idea for it 
<br>
from).  Over time, more and more people start using it.  Before you 
<br>
know it, everyone is saying 've'.
<br>
<p>The artficial way is the French way, which actually works.  When the 
<br>
Academy decides to add a new word, there is resistance at first, but 
<br>
eventually everyone starts to use it instead of whatever word was 
<br>
used previously for the idea (probably something adopted from 
<br>
English).
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I doubt this.  As of right now, there aren't any computers running 
<br>
software that you might want to refer to as ve.  My computer is just 
<br>
a tool, at the moment, that can complete tasks that I tell it to do. 
<br>
It's no smarter than the desk it sits on or the ground under my 
<br>
house.  Even with current AI software, the computer wouldn't really 
<br>
be smart enough to warrant the use of anything besides it.  In the 
<br>
future, however, when AIs are smart enough to converse as well as or 
<br>
better than humans, it will be much harder to use it, except by those 
<br>
who wish to be derogatory.  Compare calling a person it.  This line 
<br>
will blur even more with SIs, as they will include uploaded humans. 
<br>
I know that I personally won't put up with being called an it.
<br>
<p>Also, computers won't get any smarter, but the software that they run 
<br>
will.  I might refer to it being slow, but I would refer to the copy 
<br>
of Chat Bot 3000 that I might having running as ve being slow.  Ve is 
<br>
something that is intelligent, but it is not.  The two are seperate. 
<br>
Of course, there will always be those who misuse language (the 
<br>
singular 'they', etc.).  :-/
<br>
<p>BTW, are there any languages that have gender neutral pronouns 
<br>
already (besides the SL4 dialect of English)?  I don't know of one 
<br>
off the top of my head and such a novelty seems like it would have 
<br>
been pointed out to me by now, but then again it is easy to miss this 
<br>
stuff.
