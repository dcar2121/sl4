<p><p>The rough figure for memory bandwidth growth is that it is growing at 10%

the rate of processor speed, and has been following this rate of growth 
<br>
since at least the late '80s.  Memory latency has actually gotten much 
<br>
*worse*.  Increasingly complex caching schemes have mitigated the effect of 
<br>
slow memory to a certain extent, but the benefits of this are diminishing 
<br>
as well.  In low-level hardware circles, the point at which a processor is 
<br>
completely bound by the memory architecture is referred to as the &quot;memory 
<br>
wall&quot;.  Chip makers have been dodging this bullet for some time with clever 
<br>
cache optimizations that work for *most* applications; while processors are 
<br>
severely memory bound, increases in core clock speed do produce shrinking 
<br>
increases in total computing performance.  However for applications that 
<br>
have large codes and/or large data sets, you can easily hit the memory wall 
<br>
because the caching becomes ineffective.  It is interesting to note that 
<br>
this is one of the reasons the old 200MHz Pentium Pros still look very good 
<br>
for high-end computing; the well-matched (and expensive!) memory system on 
<br>
those chips give remarkably good real-world performance for classes of 
<br>
problems that are memory bandwidth bound.
<br>
<p>There are standard benchmarks for measuring memory bandwidth of systems 
<br>
(mem + proc + cache + I/O), the most commonly used one being STREAM.
<br>
<p>A bunch of citations and references on the subject (from Computer 
<br>
Architecture News) can be found at:

<p><p>The human brain isn't really comparable to silicon in terms of memory 
<br>
bandwidth.  The human brain has billions of slow low-latency data 
<br>
channels.  Silicon has a small number of fast high-latency data 
<br>
channels.  The real killer in all this is the latency.  I think one could 
<br>
easily claim that a small number of fast channels are equivalent to a large 
<br>
number of slow channels as long as the aggregate data rates are the 
<br>
same.  Latency, on the other hand, can cause dramatic drops in real-world 
<br>
memory performance, especially for computation that causes frequent cache 
<br>
misses.  Note that latency is also why massively parallel systems don't 
<br>
work for problems that require access to large quantities of shared data; 
<br>
you lose as much real computation time on latency as you gain by having 
<br>
additional processors (in certain cases your application may actually run 
<br>
*slower* on parallel systems).  As a general rule, shared memory 
<br>
applications that show poor cache efficiency on a single processor will 
<br>
scale poorly on massively parallel systems.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Questions like: how much of the brain is actually used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for intelligence, as opposed to being used to run our automatic biological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functions?
</em><br>
<p><p>The line is fuzzy here (and a little outside my core competence), but I 
<br>
would guess that a small fraction of the brain hardware would actually be 
<br>
required for raw intelligence.  There have been many people who function 
<br>
quite well with large sections of their brains missing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;To what extent can the speed advantage of silicon _make up for_ a lack of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bandwidth?
</em><br>
<p><p>Speed and memory bandwidth are apples and oranges; you cannot replace one 
<br>
with the other and both are rate limiters for the entire system (CPUs don't 
<br>
exist in a vacuum).  Right now, processor architectures are severely rate 
<br>
limited by bandwidth.
<br>
<p>Think of it this way:  If you have a simple processor that can execute 10 
<br>
operations per second, but is fed those operations at a rate of 3 
<br>
operations per second, what will be the effective execution speed of the 
<br>
system?  The answer is obviously 3 operations per second.  Now suppose they 
<br>
scaled the processor to 30 operations/s and increased the feed rate to 4 
<br>
operations/s (roughly the situation we have today).  It doesn't really 
<br>
matter how much processor you have if you can't keep the pipeline full.  To 
<br>
make matters worse, for some classes of problems, it is not possible to 
<br>
hack the design (e.g. caching schemes) to give faster effective feed 
<br>
rates.  Therefore, the speed advantage of silicon is actually irrelevant in 
<br>
the absence of sufficient memory bandwidth, as bandwidth is a rate limiter 
<br>
of the total system performance.
