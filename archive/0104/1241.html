<p>
My thinking has evolved a HELL OF A LOT in the period 1997-2000, i.e. during
<br>
the time I was working on the WM AI Engine... let alone since 1989-90 when I
<br>
wrote The Structure of Intelligence.
<br>
<p>Not that I've changed my basic philosophy in any way.  I'd say that my 4 cog
<br>
sci books explored different aspects of the same basic conceptual point of
<br>
view.  The WM AI Engine incorporates all these aspects, and some other stuff
<br>
too...
<br>
<p>The books basically deal with the following topics:
<br>
<p>Structure of Intelligence -- formalizing what mind and intelligence are,
<br>
dividing theproblem of AI into hopefully manageable parts
<br>
<p>Evolving Mind -- analogy between mind and evolution, formalization of
<br>
evolutionary/ecological aspects of mind
<br>
<p>Chaotic Logic -- a formal model of the mind, very abstract and not directly
<br>
useful for implementation, with a focus on the self-organizing dynamics of
<br>
mind rather than the structure.  Evolution is part of the self-organizing
<br>
dynamics of mind, and the structures of intelligence are &quot;attractors&quot; of
<br>
these dynamics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Complexity to creativity -- How does profound creativity come out of
</em><br>
mind dynamics and structures?  I try to get at the essence of this by
<br>
combining psychology, various CS experiments (evolutionary computer music,
<br>
graphics, etc.), and my previous theories of mind
<br>
<p>Only AFTER writing all of this stuff, and thus getting a really deep
<br>
intuitive feel for the computational and mathematical modeling of all
<br>
aspects of mind, did I begin really deeply thinking about how to implement a
<br>
mind, how to teach it, etc. ... the stuff dealt with in Digital Intuition.
<br>
<p>So all the ideas in  my older books are there in the WM AI Engine, but
<br>
sometimes it may take some thought to see how they manifest themselves.  And
<br>
there is some important stuff in the AI Engine that's not in any of the
<br>
earlier books -- big big gaps in my previous thinking that only became
<br>
apparent when I actually got more concrete.
<br>
<p>It's all part of a natural conceptual evolution ...
<br>
<p>Looking back, I find those earlier books kind of frustrating to read.  A lot
<br>
of vague stuff compared to the clarity with which I see things now.  And the
<br>
first two books have just a hideous number of typos, including some bad ones
<br>
in math formulas.  But, that's the way the cookie crumbles....  If I ever
<br>
have time I'll go back and rewrite them all in light of what I understand
<br>
now...
<br>
<p>Also, I'll post a summary of Digital Intuition to the list sometime over the
<br>
next couple days, OK?
