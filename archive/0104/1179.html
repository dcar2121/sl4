<p>
Having written some journalistic articles myself, I suppose I have something
<br>
to say on the topic of accuracy versus interestingness.
<br>
<p>It's easier to write a long article than a short one, in many ways.  In a
<br>
long article, one can explain things in detail.  In a short article, one has
<br>
to choose a few evocative details, hoping in this way to get across the
<br>
essence of the big picture, which one doesn't have the space to explain
<br>
thoroughly.
<br>
<p>Really great journalism achieves the dual goals of
<br>
excitingness/interestingness and complete accuracy ~simultaneously~.  But,
<br>
this is hard to achieve, especially when working under tight deadlines as
<br>
real journalists usually are.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, oddly enough, the essence of the overall picture is better
<br>
transmitted by details that are **slightly off** than by truly accurate
<br>
details.  This is the funky gray area of journalism....
<br>
<p>I had numerous differences with the way Declan wrote the article about
<br>
Webmind.  I think he could have done a much better job.  On the other hand,
<br>
I also have some understanding for his position.  Unlike us, he's not an
<br>
expert in these areas, and he was doing his best, on a very tight schedule,
<br>
to assemble an appropriate collection of details that would optimally evoke
<br>
the whole picture **as he understood it**.  I am sure that if he'd had more
<br>
time to research Webmind and SingInst, he would have been able to formulate
<br>
articles with both sensationalist appeal ~and~ real faithfulness to the
<br>
subject material.
<br>
<p>The issue then comes down to economics.  Why doesn't Wired.com pay their
<br>
writers enough per story to allow them to carefully research each story?
<br>
Well, because their business folks have told them that it sells better to
<br>
create a large volume of quickly written stories than a smaller volume of
<br>
more carefully crafted stories.  Are their business folks right?  Maybe.
<br>
<p>If they're wrong, then there's a market opportunity to start a competing
<br>
hi-tech/new-economy online news service focusing on depth and quality of
<br>
reportage rather than volume and breadth of coverage.
<br>
<p>Anyone want to start a media company??  ;p

<em>&gt; Arona,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want me to take action, it makes sense to address your comments

<em>&gt; to me, rather than a third party or a mailing list I read infrequently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; That said, I'm not going to change the article or &quot;rewrite&quot; it.

<em>&gt; &gt; Greetings to each and everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer... Declan McCullagh should 're-write' this article or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do a sequel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; QUICKLY...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Quotes from the article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. &quot;Yudkowsky's reason for shunning formal education is that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; danger of unfriendly AI to be so near...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is it so ? Has it not got more to do with being a CSX ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. &quot;Of course, some of the brightest people in the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including Nobel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laureates, have spent decades researching AI -- friendly or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; failed to realize their dreams...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why isn't a distinction made between Friendly AI and Classical AI ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3.&quot;The only problem is that academics don't seem interested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When asked for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comment, one well-known researcher said in response to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essay: &quot;Worthless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speculation. Call me when you have running code.&quot;...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which academics ? Did Declan McCullagh do a study on this ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since when does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;one well-known researcher&quot; mean &quot;all of the researchers&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; researchers&quot; ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I could carry on 'till next year. This is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; typical-boring-semi-sensational &quot;Wired News&quot; journalism... This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intending to offense anyone - I honestly could care more if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not[care]) is misleading and it sucks. Period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most kind regards,
</em><br>
