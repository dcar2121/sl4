</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with uploading is that, chronologically, it arrives
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology.  So unless you use a superintelligent AI as assistant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading can't plausibly come first.  But if you can trust an AI to play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assistant, then you can trust it to be Transition Guide (i.e., essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same order of risk in both cases).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Of course there are people interested in and working on the upload
<br>
scenario that do not believe you require either military-grade NT or an
<br>
sentient AI to
<br>
scan brains sufficiently to upload.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm also more inclined to trust an AI more than a person... maybe even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than I'd trust myself, since I'm not designed for recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improvement.  Actually, I should amend that:  After I've been around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI and had a chance to chat with ver, then I expect to wind up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifiably trusting that AI's seed morality around as much as I'd trust a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human seed morality, and I can also foresee the possibility of standing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI's presence and just being overawed by vis seed morality.  Either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, I also expect to wind up trusting that AI's transcendence protocol to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve morality significantly more than I'd trust a human-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcendence protocol to preserve morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how this follows.  If you upload a human who quickly
<br>
self-improves ver capabilities and becomes an SI and if
<br>
super-intelligence brings with it expanded moral/ethical understanding
<br>
then I see no reason this combination is less trustworthy than starting
<br>
from scratch and only putting in what you believe should be there in the
<br>
beginning.  Yes a lot of evolved complicated behavior and conditioning
<br>
is not present in the AI.  But some of that complicated behavior and
<br>
conditioning is also the bed of universal compassion and utter
<br>
Friendliness.
