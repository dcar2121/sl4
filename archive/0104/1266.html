&nbsp;&nbsp;Doug, I understand your general points.  However, at the present time, it
<br>
seems that no one is interesting in investing VC money in anything
<br>
technologically adventurous, whereas I am talking to several people who say
<br>
they're interested in donating substantial amounts to make real AI happen in
<br>
the form of a nonprofit institute similar to (but smaller scale than) SFI.
<br>
The VC money I may be able to find, it seems, will probably be for much less
<br>
technologically ambitious firms aimed at creating products offering
<br>
incremental improvements to current products in niche markets.   I'm not
<br>
talking theory, I'm talking current reality, dozens of conversations with
<br>
individual and institutional investors of various sorts.  In reality, it is
<br>
ABSOLUTELY FALSE that &quot;VC firms would jump at AI technology that had
<br>
commercial applications.&quot;  VC firms in the current market will run like hell
<br>
from AI technology no matter what the applications are.  If you know some
<br>
VC's who are exceptions to this rule, at the present moment, please contact
<br>
me off list.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As for wealthy benefactors, if you look at capital expenditures of wealthy
<br>
people their venture capital investments dwarf their charitable giving.
<br>
You're in a qualitatively better position attempting to convince
<br>
sophisticated VC firms (who are fanatically devoted towards identifying the
<br>
next &quot;big thing&quot; so they can be the next Vinod Khosla) to fund your project
<br>
rather compete with the colleges, museums, etc. who solicit wealthy
<br>
benefactors for funding.  Of course, the viability of this approach depends
<br>
on your intentions.  Are you designing something with commercial
<br>
applications or advancing towards the Singularity?  VC firms probably won't
<br>
have much interest in advancing society towards the Singularity for obvious
<br>
reasons.  VC firms, however, would jump at AI technology that had commercial
<br>
applications such as code debugging or composition.  I made the point some
<br>
time ago to Eliezer (which was incl! uded in an incarnation of one of his
<br>
Singularity pieces) that the best way to fund AI research is to get one of
<br>
two groups interested in it: the military complex or &quot;big business&quot;.
