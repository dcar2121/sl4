First, this whole argument that &quot;it&quot; must be dumb matter is silly.  Please 
<br>
point me to a definitive reference (dictionary, encyclopedia, &quot;good&quot; 
<br>
English text, etc) that specifies this.
<br>
<p>And if you really feel like pushing the issue, you may refer to me as IT as 
<br>
much as you like.  I'm not about to get offended by such matters.
<br>
<p>Second, I believe Japenese has some concept of gender neutral.  Actually, I 
<br>
believe they may have 3 complete sub-dialects, one for male, one for female 
<br>
and a third for non-gendered.
<br>
<p>Third, if my &quot;Chat Bot 3000&quot; was running slow, I'd just say it was running 
<br>
slow.  Certainly it may be due to insufficient hardware, but it would still 
<br>
be slow.  We don't separate out human minds from the hardware they run 
<br>
on.  While the mind is running on the hardware they are, essentially, an 
<br>
entity.  It will obviously be easier to upgrade/change the hardware for 
<br>
AIs, though.

<em>&gt;&gt;Advocates of strange pronouns are right to point out that the language can

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is the natural way.  We start using this pronoun more or less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spontaneously (it doesn't really matter where we got the idea for it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from).  Over time, more and more people start using it.  Before you know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it, everyone is saying 've'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The artficial way is the French way, which actually works.  When the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Academy decides to add a new word, there is resistance at first, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually everyone starts to use it instead of whatever word was used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;previously for the idea (probably something adopted from English).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;We already see this taking place.  People speak, quite naturally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about the &quot;intentions&quot; or &quot;desires&quot; of their computers, VCRs, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Why is my VCR blinking like that?&quot;  &quot;It wants you to set the time.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Why is my computer cursor spinning?&quot;  &quot;It's still trying to find that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;website.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This natural usage will be expanded as computers get smarter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I doubt this.  As of right now, there aren't any computers running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software that you might want to refer to as ve.  My computer is just a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tool, at the moment, that can complete tasks that I tell it to do. It's no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smarter than the desk it sits on or the ground under my house.  Even with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current AI software, the computer wouldn't really be smart enough to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;warrant the use of anything besides it.  In the future, however, when AIs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are smart enough to converse as well as or better than humans, it will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much harder to use it, except by those who wish to be derogatory.  Compare 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calling a person it.  This line will blur even more with SIs, as they will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;include uploaded humans. I know that I personally won't put up with being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called an it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, computers won't get any smarter, but the software that they run 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will.  I might refer to it being slow, but I would refer to the copy of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chat Bot 3000 that I might having running as ve being slow.  Ve is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something that is intelligent, but it is not.  The two are seperate. Of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course, there will always be those who misuse language (the singular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'they', etc.).  :-/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;BTW, are there any languages that have gender neutral pronouns already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(besides the SL4 dialect of English)?  I don't know of one off the top of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my head and such a novelty seems like it would have been pointed out to me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by now, but then again it is easy to miss this stuff.
