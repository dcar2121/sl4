<p>I have a hard time grasping this.  It seems very unlikely to me, because I don't
<br>
think we're close to the hardware required, for another 5-10 years at a _minimum_,
<br>
even with expensive supercomputers.
<br>
<p>I see a more likely route with the accumulated expertise of the specialized AI teams
<br>
blossoming into increasingly intelligent programs until at some point (and not some
<br>
big &quot;a ha&quot; moment, either) we realize, hey, these things are as smart as us.
<br>
<p>The reason is that these groups won't have to spend time begging for funding for
<br>
an unreachable (on current hardware) goal.  They'll make money all the way up.
<br>
<p>I think this should be your focus.  Choose smaller problems that can be solved
<br>
on reasonable hardware today, problems that have economic value of some kind.
<br>
Even entertainment value is value that will attract ever increasing funds.
<br>
<p>Practical steps of an appropriate size will get you where you want to be much
<br>
faster than beating your head against the wall trying to achieve the impossible.
<br>
<p>If you think that hardware that is currently available to you is sufficiently
<br>
powerful enough for real AI, I hope you'll explain how this can be.  This was
<br>
partly the point of my questions last week about Moravec and Kurzweil's estimates,
<br>
and James Rogers had a lot of important and interesting stuff to say about it.
<br>
None of that discussion, though, pointed me in the direction of thinking that
<br>
all that's needed is a couple of years of programming by 30 people.
