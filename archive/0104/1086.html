</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would not be an 'open' license. It might get the source code out there,
<br>
but it removes the point of open source. Open source, way back when, was all
<br>
about splinter groups. It was all about, and is still all about, customizing
<br>
and building on existing software without the need to completely reinvent.
<br>
Prevent splinter groups, and where are you? You're giving away source code.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let's not kid ourselves about where it goes. License be damned, once
<br>
source code is out in the world it goes everywhere. I know of two commercial
<br>
products that use some amount of 'open source' code without any
<br>
acknowledgement, and I'm certain that that is a common practice.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, what's accomplished in the positive side is very little. It won't add
<br>
much to the code base, if anything, and it destroys the intellectual property
<br>
of the contributors, which if this project is not successful, may at least be
<br>
worth something as a consolation prize.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually I've seen that Linux has more bugs reported on Bugtraq than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other operating system. Is this because it is buggier, or because more
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably the latter.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a highly experienced programmer who has worked on many 'closed' software
<br>
projects and several open source projects, I feel strongly that it is
<br>
definately both, but primarily the former.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open source software has a tendancy to collect weak code. The dynamics of why
<br>
this happens is open to debate, but it definately happens. Shrink wrapped
<br>
software usually has code controls that force programmers to make, if not
<br>
bug-free or perfect software, at least reasonably readable and maintainable
<br>
code. Don't both pointing out exceptions to me; I know that most software
<br>
projects fall far short of this ideal. My contention is that even more open
<br>
source projects suffer from these problems.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't even express my dismay the first time I tried to improve gcc. It had
<br>
a really obvious bug that I was sure I could fix, but when I opened up the
<br>
source code, I was stunned. Absolutely stunned that the thing works at all.
<br>
Tens of thousands of undocumented lines of spaghetti C code. There was nothing
<br>
I could do without spending dozens of hours tracing even the startup
<br>
sequences.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; To be realistic, real AI is an extremely powerful technology, and our view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is to not hand it over to people we don't know and trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What, do you think that corporate spies or government ones won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to acquire your code on way or another? If it's that powerful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone will resort to physical violence to get it. Are your principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so strong that you would refuse to give up the source if a family member
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were kidnapped and held for ransom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's that powerful, people will want it. And I daresay they'll get it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not even realize it's there. The US government alone has sunk
<br>
billions into AI, and they got squat out of it. As far as they're concerned,
<br>
practically speaking, it's a dead issue. The singularity will happen before
<br>
they ever realize they're not in control anymore.
