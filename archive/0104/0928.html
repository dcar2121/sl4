<p>You must be the greatest programmer in the universe then.  Every piece of 
<br>
software has bugs, no matter how good the programmer, how many code reviews 
<br>
and how much testing.  Software is simultaneously incredibly complex and 
<br>
fragile.  For your plan to go perfectly you would have to be 100% bug free, 
<br>
thought of every significant possibility and correctly programmed for 
<br>
them.  The slightest error in architecture, implementation or knowledge 
<br>
could veer this thing in a totally different direction.
<br>
<p>This has got to be the most complex piece of software I've ever 
<br>
imagined.  If not from a code point of view (you may be able to simplify 
<br>
much of the code since this is a &quot;seed&quot;) then at least architecturally.  To 
<br>
say that your group is capable of creating the most complex and ambitious 
<br>
software project ever, without making any mistakes is the most arrogant 
<br>
thing I've ever heard.  Bar none.
<br>
<p>I imagine your a great programmer &amp; architect.  But I don't believe it is 
<br>
possible for any human development team to get something like this 
<br>
perfect.  Espicially when you try and rush it.  And since their is a race 
<br>
on to get their first, it will be rushed in the end.
<br>
<p>Considering all these factors, please explain why you think their is a 
<br>
&quot;significant probability
<br>
that everything will 'go like clockwork and be perfect'&quot;.
<br>
<p>Just so you know, I am an incredibly good software architect and 
<br>
programmer.  But I doubt I would have much chance of getting this &quot;perfect&quot; 
<br>
the first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We are playing with incredibly dangerous technology here.  Not once have I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen the powers that be on this list stop and ask &quot;should we do this?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have to echo Brian on this.  The point of doubts is that they lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questioning, and thence to ANSWERS.  And we didn't start doing this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yesterday.  All known doubts have been taken into account and resolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into our current course of action, so we are unlikely to engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spontaneous self-questioning unless there's a new fact, experience, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realization to act as a trigger factor.  I'm sorry if this makes us look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overconfident, but what are we supposed to do?  Pretend to engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spontaneous self-questioning for the PR benefit?
</em><br>
<p>See my previous point in this message.  Plus, I repeat what I replied to 
<br>
Brian, if you have thought of all this please educate me.  If you don't 
<br>
spend the time to write a paper specifically covering why we (the human 
<br>
race) should pursue the singularity and why your approach is the best, your 
<br>
going to get asked hundreds of thousands of times over the next decade.
