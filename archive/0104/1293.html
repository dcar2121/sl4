<em>&gt; Well, in a more dynamic and powerful language it might only be 100,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines. :-)
</em><br>
<p>True, Java is a very verbose language.  On the other hand, it's also really
<br>
easy to read, unlike LISP
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; To me, the ease of expression and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productivity is much more important than raw execution speed.  The speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can always be improved by putting sufficient ingenuity into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization.
</em><br>
<p>This attitude was why we chose Java in the first place.  We all found Java
<br>
simple and natural and easy to code in.  Unfortunately, after a while, we
<br>
found that adequately improving memory usage and speed for this application
<br>
was very very difficult even ~with~ very ingenious optimization by a great
<br>
team of people.
<br>
<p>The problem is that self-organizing cognition pushes the limits of what's
<br>
achievable with current computers.  (And anyone who knows me, knows that I'm
<br>
more likely in any given instance to be guilty of overoptimism than
<br>
overpessimism... )
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I have never heard of a very successful hyper-large Java system either.
</em><br>
<p>Damn right.  We thought we could build the first one, and we basically
<br>
failed, due to the fact that Java just isn't engineered for this, yet.  Now
<br>
we're working around this mistake by re-coding the critical processing and
<br>
memory intensive bits of the system in C.  But this is not a universally
<br>
acclaimed decision within our group... some folks still believe that with
<br>
sufficient ingenuity, the Java version can be adequately optimized.  Maybe
<br>
they're right; we'll see over the next copule months.  It's true that only
<br>
some of the problems with our last system version were language-based;
<br>
others were due to aspects of the architecture that we've now drastically
<br>
improved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there is no reason whatsoever that Lisp cannot handle anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java can and then some.
</em><br>
<p>As was pointed out recently on this list, major firms are now pouring tens
<br>
of millions of dollars into making Java workable for large-scale, real-time
<br>
applications.  Unless I'm mistaken, the same is not true for LISP.
<br>
<p>But anyway, the problem is that, so far, it seems like Java can't handle the
<br>
Webmind AI Engine...
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; If you are going to the C world for core functionality then I recommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing some OO in Objective C.
</em><br>
<p>This is indeed worth considering
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C/C++ is a bad joke as far as programmer productivity.
</em><br>
<p>Yup, you got that right...
<br>
<p>On the other hand, testing a big Java program when all existing profilers
<br>
crash on apps with many threads and copious RAM usage, also sucks... and
<br>
consumes all the time that was saved programming in Java instead of C....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In LISP, can one &quot;method&quot; look into another while it's running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ephemeral values of local variables inside that method?  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Java terminology; I forget the LISP terminology.)  If so, then this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more powerful kind of reflection than Java currently provides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly.  And you can easily write code to find every usage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition, override and so on of any method as such reflection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally supported.  You could sort of do it in Java if you dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down to class file format and were pretty patient.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you can do what I suggested in Java, even by looking at class
<br>
files.  The values of local method variables during execution are only
<br>
contained inside the JVM, in RAM, not in the class files.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of platforms, is WebMind particular about OS?  I confess to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being mainly a Linux bigot.  For some reason every time I get my hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a new windoze machine, despite my solemn intentions otherwise, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually ends up being wiped and loaded with Linux.  I do Windows for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $$$ but I do Linux generally on my own time.
</em><br>
<p>We've been using NT and Linux both, and occasionally Solaris (we couldn't
<br>
afford many Solaris boxes).
<br>
<p>The  majority of our developers prefer Linux, but not 100%.  And the JVM's
<br>
at this point are stronger on NT.
