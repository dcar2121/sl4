</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you sure about this? &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; was (and still is) pretty

</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that was it. I didn't see anything on CNN or BBC (maybe I missed it) so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was hardly any &quot;frenzy&quot; back then at least. The Bill Joy debacle went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by pretty quietly too as I recall (I think the focus was mainly on Biotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff). I think that if there is media frenzy about Ray's forthcoming book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there should have been more press about SM as well (or has he more &quot;media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power&quot; now than then?).
</em><br>
<p>Well perhaps because I am more interested in these subjects it seemed like
<br>
it got a lot of media attention. CNN did do at least some coverage, see:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/07/06/future.views.idg/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/07/06/future.views.idg/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>Anyway, it got a lot more attention than The Spike, and I doubt anyone will
<br>
dispute that. And yes I think Ray's &quot;star power&quot; has just gone up more since
<br>
he won that Lemelson prize this week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is still debate (in academia and elsewhere) about whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *human-level* AI is even possible, so I think that most people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider SIs and Powers too fantastical to take seriously. The media may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to stick their necks out with such a fantastic claim, especially since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many respectable AI-researchers think that the whole idea is ludicrous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Some 30 years ago, the above mentioned newspaper blasted on the front page
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that perpetuum mobile-machines was going to solve the energy crisis... quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some laughter in academia later...)
</em><br>
<p>Well the problem as Ray notes is that most people seem to have a lot of
<br>
trouble fully internalizing what the future holds. If you had predicted
<br>
to the average scientist 30 years ago about some of the things we have
<br>
today, they would likely have also immediately had a knee-jerk negative
<br>
reaction. Many scientists unfortunately operate at a very low shock-level.
<br>
<p>And even if they do start to believe it, and take it seriously, they
<br>
(whether scientist or journalist) may feel unwilling to discuss it in
<br>
public for fear of taking heat from colleagues. Unfortunately, even so-
<br>
called &quot;cutting edge&quot; organizations like Wired seem to suffer more and
<br>
more from this conservatism. You can see it in that article on Wired News
<br>
today about Ray- the references to Frankenstein and other bits of it show
<br>
the inability or unwillingness of the writer to take the subject completely
<br>
seriously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw a thing about Ray's ideas on a german science-program (&quot;Nano&quot; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3sat). It discussed uploading and AI, and had interviews with Ray. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end, there was some professor of computer science as a studio guest. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply said that AI was impossible because human brains are analog and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers are digital. Period. People like these always seem to get the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word, in printed press as well as television. This could be why there hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been any debates about these things; when people watch it on TV, they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically told that it is nothing to worry about.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah it's rather annoying- the writer/producer of the show/article always
<br>
wants to get other opinions. Unfortunately at the current time there are
<br>
very very few people on the planet who know enough (and have internalized
<br>
it well enough) to be able to really talk about these subjects. So usually
<br>
what you get is someone who has one of the two typical reactions: either
<br>
deny that it can happen (so it's not worth worrying about), or state there
<br>
is nothing we can do about it (so it's not worth worrying about). And the
<br>
writers/producers are not experts on the subject either so they accept
<br>
these responses at face value, and even tend to give them more credence
<br>
since they subconsciously line up with their own personal reactions.
<br>
<p>The end result is that it is hard to really get across SL4 ideas to people
<br>
that are lower. So the goal I think should be to get people /up to SL4/
<br>
rather than trying to immediately start talking SL4 stuff and expect them
<br>
to have meaningful responses. Books like Ray's and Damien's help in this
<br>
education process. As time goes on more and more people out there will get
<br>
it... we are seeing a similar thing happening nowadays with the more SL3
<br>
and lower transhumanist ideas like genetic engineering. People slowly get
<br>
used to it. This process is accelerating some, so these people are now
<br>
getting hit with SL4 memes... but so far not much is sticking. It's just
<br>
too radical for most people that the world may effectively be totally
<br>
changed in 30 years (or less we hope). I have to say, all in all, that
<br>
I hope these ideas stay out of the masses minds for a long while. I would
<br>
much prefer to get a few very rich people onboard who grok it all, let
<br>
us create our Singularity in quiet, without a big public ordeal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe this was the case with cloning: before Dolly, noone thought it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could even be done, and there was no debate whatsoever. After Dolly: well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will there be a similar scenario with AI/SI? Only time will tell.
</em><br>
<p>Well the nice thing is that after you get your AI working, there likely
<br>
won't be much time before it gets beyond the point of &quot;debating&quot; about it.
<br>
It'll certainly be nice to have a technology that is fully capable of
<br>
taking care of itself. So at least that's one thing we won't have to worry
<br>
about :-)
