<p>Sometimes the most serious and critical of subjects most needs a bit of
<br>
humor to open things up.  And after your own recent trials humor is a
<br>
damn healthy sign.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few of us, including Eli and Peter Voss myself, just got back from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Foresight Gathering in SF, at which there was a fair amount of talk about AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Singularity, almost more so than about nanotechnology, the alleged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary focus of the conference.  Peculiarly, among that crowd, I found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself among the more practical-minded people around ;O   
</em><br>
<p>&lt;grin&gt; It was great seeing you in person and hearing your run-down on
<br>
building real AI while practically standing on one leg.  Most
<br>
impressive.  
<br>
<p>I am unclear about a couple of things regarding the state of WebMind
<br>
though.  It was not clear to me whether y'all are accepting donations
<br>
now or whether that needs to wait until some of the upcoming legal stuff
<br>
is out of the way.  It also isn't fully clear to me if companies
<br>
interested in some of your technology (super search, document
<br>
categorization especially) should be talking with you and/or the
<br>
trustees (or whatever the right term is) now or should also wait until
<br>
some of the legal smoke clears.  I am not sure what the legalities are
<br>
or if there is enough of WebMind around and with enough time to pursue
<br>
such possibilities presently.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, it's clear from this conference and from Kurzweil's forthcoming book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Singularity concept is going to seep into the tech media over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next couple years.  I'll be curious to see what it turns into.
</em><br>
<p>It will go further than the tech media.  It will soar into general
<br>
awareness, for good or ill.  Time to get those beneficial meme machines
<br>
cranking.
