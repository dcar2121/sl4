</em><br>
<p>I would view &quot;speech&quot; as an emergent quality of volitional interactions
<br>
between citizens.  Suppose that citizen A says something nasty about
<br>
citizen B to citizen C, and citizen C does something B doesn't like as a
<br>
result - this could be as simple as saying something that hurts B's
<br>
feelings, or as complex as withholding a portion of vis matter from B's
<br>
interstellar ship.  The interaction between A and C is volitional, and the
<br>
interaction between C and B is volitional, so it's hard to see how the
<br>
Sysop could interfere directly.
<br>
<p>Of course, if C asks the Sysop what ve thinks of A's comments, the Sysop
<br>
may not be able to give an answer based on A's private mindstate - but
<br>
just the fact that &quot;A has not authorized me to discuss vis motives with
<br>
you&quot; may be answer enough, as would &quot;normative social perception, without
<br>
reference to private information about A's mindstate, says this is a
<br>
backstab&quot;.  If the citizens don't want to trust the Sysop, then, yeah,
<br>
some kind of elaborate social system.
<br>
<p>I expect the transhumans will be above this sort of thing, so maybe I
<br>
should have been using &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; back there.  Anyway, people who
<br>
choose to remain human will never run out of ways to make themselves
<br>
unhappy.  Probably the most I can do is ensure there's a choice.
