<p><em>&gt;This has got to be the most complex piece of software I've ever

imagined.  If not from a code point of view (you may be able to simplify
<br>
much of the code since this is a &quot;seed&quot;) then at least architecturally.  To
<br>
say that your group is capable of creating the most complex and ambitious
<br>
software project ever, without making any mistakes is the most arrogant
<br>
thing I've ever heard.  Bar none.&lt;
<br>
<p>I was a little too polite to bring this up in quite this way, but James does have
<br>
a point here. All of my previous misgivings come down to the simple fact that
<br>
mistakes do happen. If I'm going to trust my future existence to this idea, I
<br>
want to have confidence that it will come out as you seem to think it will. I'm
<br>
not a programmer, so I have to rely on others to make the necessary breakthrough.
<br>
<p>It's obvious that there is great confidence in this course of action, among the
<br>
members of this list. It's not unreasonable for a newcomer to ask, &quot;Why?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Please don't take these statements as attack. I think that we are all on the
<br>
same side here. It's just that the more recent arrivals don't have the benefit of
<br>
participating in the years of previous discussions on these topics. I agree with
<br>
James that the best way to avoid repeating these discussions might be to create
<br>
some sort of statement, one that would address these issues in more detail.
<br>
Eliezer has already covered some of these topics at various points in his
<br>
writing, but it might be a good idea to condense this stuff into one place, as an
<br>
introduction to the subject, perhaps. (the Singularity for Dummies?) As the
<br>
Singularity gets closer, it will become more and more important to have this type
<br>
of material, otherwise, you'll never stop answering and re-answering these
<br>
questions.
