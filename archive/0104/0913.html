<p>Well, everything we talk about would need to be qualified a hundred 
<br>
different ways if we got down to the nitty gritty.  At this point, this is 
<br>
more SF than a science.  That will change, however, over the next few years.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What it seems to come down to is you are either relying on objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality (in which an AI should do better since it has less evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crap to deal with), or a natural convergence to the &quot;Friendly zone&quot;. In
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the next Hitler when presented with the total power uploading/becoming a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans. At least with an AI we can sharply reduce the risks by a) designing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it right b) testing testing testing
</em><br>
<p>BS.  Testing means jack when you are talking about something that will 
<br>
complete reinvent itself a thousand times.  And I have a feeling that the 
<br>
design will have little long-term impact also.  Certainly, the design will 
<br>
influence how well the AI starts off, and how well it upgrades itself the 
<br>
first few times or so.  But beyond the first dozen or less redesigns, it 
<br>
will have little, if any, resemblance to the original.  So excuse me if I 
<br>
don't have much faith.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You want to talk about who designs the first AI? Well who decides who gets
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hey, that is easy.  I'll be first.  ;)
