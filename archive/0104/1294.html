Hi,
<br>
<p>I talked to Dwight Lodge (their CEO) and also briefly Doug Lenat recently...
<br>
<p>According to Dwight, the firm's goals at the present time are NOT to create
<br>
a program that passes the Turing test or carries out any kind of
<br>
conversation or dramatic AI activity on its own.  Rather, its goals are to
<br>
create knowledge databases and reasoning tools that can be used inside other
<br>
firms' products, thus making the universe of software gradually more and
<br>
more intelligent.  (I'm paraphrasing him, not quoting, but you get the
<br>
idea.)
<br>
<p>They have a huge commonsense knowledge base now, and also a pretty
<br>
sophisticated reasoning engine that has specialized modules for dealing with
<br>
temporal logic, number logic, and so forth.  I have not used their reasoning
<br>
engine, but my guess is that it's very &quot;brittle&quot; in the classic AI sense.
<br>
<p>I think that their knowledge database could well be useful to a &quot;real AI&quot;
<br>
system.  However, it could never be the primary knowledge source of such a
<br>
system -- that primary knowledge source has ultimately got to be the
<br>
system's own experience.  The &quot;definition as necessary and sufficient
<br>
condition&quot; framework that underlies most of their knowledge database is not
<br>
really adequate for intelligence.  In order for a mind to have a working
<br>
knowledge of a concept, it needs a whole complex network of facts and
<br>
intuitions regarding that concept, of various levels of abstraction and
<br>
confidence, not just necc.-and-suff. condition definitions of the concept
<br>
and related concepts.  But once it has experience with a concept, being able
<br>
to load in the necc.-and-suff.-condition definition of that concept and
<br>
other related ones from CYC will be a useful ability for a digital mind to
<br>
have.
<br>
<p>In terms of Lenat's original AI goals, I very much doubt that he personally
<br>
has given up on them.  However, CYCorp is a business and at this point, a
<br>
surviving one.  My sense is that Lenat feels &quot;true AI&quot; will be achievable
<br>
eventually once enough knowledge has been accumulated and once his reasoning
<br>
engine is hooked up to the right other software components (NLP, perception,
<br>
etc.).  But the mission of Cycorp as a company is not to do this &quot;hooking
<br>
up&quot; but rather to build the database and the reasoning engine.  Of course,
<br>
if they become fabulously financially successful then they can take on the
<br>
larger project.
<br>
<p>I tend to think Lenat's approach to AI is wrong, in that, in my view, you
<br>
can't just develop one aspect of mind in isolation and expect it to work the
<br>
right way for interaction with the other parts.
<br>
<p>In terms of the &quot;failure&quot; of Cyc, you have to understand that the hypothesis
<br>
behind it was that once a reasoning engine had enough common-sense data, it
<br>
could make intelligent common-sense inferences about the world.  Well, this
<br>
is a tough hypothesis to falsify.  If the approach has failed up to date,
<br>
maybe it's just because not enough data has been loaded in!!!
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone have some kind of inside information about what happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyc?  The project clearly failed massively to achieve its original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals, but they won't admit it and say what went wrong.  I've been to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the website of the corporation that is theoretically selling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cyc.com) and it's full of upbeat propaganda about how wonderful Cyc is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how it'll be real AI any year now, and we can sell it to you now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we won't tell you what it does.  There are also technical papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, none more recent than 1998, and none giving any hint that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything was less than hunkydory.
