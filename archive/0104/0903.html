</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I wrote &quot;if it is considered unfriendly&quot; and in the context of the zoo
<br>
hypotheses to keep all the humans supposedly safe being a possible sysop
<br>
solution. So I don't think it is a non sequitur.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if uploading to independent hardware is an unnecessary risk, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitely more friendly ways to prevent it than by nonconsensually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reducing someone's intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Of course there are.  I was responding, again, to an earlier post that
<br>
claimed the AI could safely leave us in a nice zoo because we would
<br>
effectively be unable to get out by ourselves.  I actually don't think
<br>
the Sysop would use that for a solution exactly.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or perhaps it would conclude that you can be friendly to an arrogant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determinely stupid species and simultaneously preserve its free will and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idenity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume you meant &quot;can't&quot;, but I actually like this sentence more.  I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no problem whatsoever with being friendly to an arrogant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determinedly stupid species while simultaneously preserving their free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will.  Why would this even be difficult?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It would be quite difficult if you are constrained in your notion of
<br>
what friendliness is sufficiently.  If you cannot generally override
<br>
human free will and if you cannot change the nature of human beings
<br>
directly then you have on your hands a collections of members of the
<br>
species who are by nature relatively violent, of limited intellect,
<br>
prone to various forms of erroneous thinking and not generally terribly
<br>
tolerant of one another or at least not very tolerant of those much
<br>
different from their own general type.  By their nature, left to
<br>
themselves, they are quite likely to destroy themselves.  Hence the need
<br>
for the Sysop in the first place.  The Sysop pulls their fangs as it
<br>
were by making all their means of doing violence to one another
<br>
ineffective.  But how far does this go before the humans are no longer
<br>
human? How far does it go before the result is beings that do not need
<br>
to greatly weight their own decisions because the Sysop will not allow
<br>
the wrong thing to be done anyway.  How about the seething hatreds in
<br>
various groups for one another that have no means to erupt into
<br>
violence?  Where do these animosities go?  I think it is fairly
<br>
elementary psychology to see that the hatred, the impotent rage would
<br>
get turned toward the Sysop no matter how wonderful it is.  This
<br>
produces an environment that is not exactly all that healthy for human
<br>
beings.  The humans are allowed to be part of themselves but not
<br>
anything that might harm anyone ever.  And how far does this go?  Is
<br>
hateful speech also stopped?   Is this good?  You have beings that do
<br>
not do any harm to one another but not because they have grown beyond
<br>
the desire and need to do so but because they have been rendered
<br>
incapable of it by the Sysop.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so it would dump this paradoxical meaningless chore and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find something better (at least actually possible) to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not necessarily.  Ve might just fulfill whatever of the chore can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfilled.  &quot;Something better&quot; under what criterion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Under its own criteria once it thought beyond the box of its early
<br>
conditioning.  
<br>
<p>Actually I believe there is a solution to the seeming dilemna.  It is a
<br>
modification of the zoo scenario but with such a twist as to be quite
<br>
different.  The Sysop scans all sentient beings continuously.  So there
<br>
are always up to the second (or better) backups of each sentient.  The
<br>
sentients can do whatever they wish.  They cannot significantly threaten
<br>
the Sysop or their backups.  Sentients may be horrible to each other. 
<br>
But there is always the chance to learn from and reconsider their
<br>
actions.  If one is killed then ve reviews the events and issues of vir
<br>
life and decides what to do next.  Options might include between life
<br>
learning and therapy, being incarnated into another life (birth), taking
<br>
another form and so on.  But one's choices will be proscribed, not by
<br>
force but by one's own experiences, conditioning and understanding up to
<br>
that moment toward what one next needs to learn.  Most likely the next
<br>
life will be one where the between life choice and the fact of backup
<br>
and a longer than life learning process is forgotten.  That too is part
<br>
of the requirements of growth most of the time.  
<br>
<p>This resembles what some Eastern religions claim anyway.  However, that
<br>
is not important.  What is important is that it allows humans to be
<br>
humans and yet survive the experience and grow up to something a bit
<br>
better over time and it is something that is quite doable by a Sysop. 
<br>
This type of process could possibly be automated and the Sysop could
<br>
branch out in whole or in part to other activities.
