<p>Lets say someone was determined to be the first to get AI and they 
<br>
succeed.  Wouldn't it be  better for everyone if they included Friendliness 
<br>
in it since it was available as an open source module?  Regardless of if

they come chat with you or not, the odds that the race winning AI team use 
<br>
Friendlieness go way up if your project is available as open source.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3) Open Source could massively speed up the process.  Instead of having a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;much to an AI project? Many fewer than can contribute to something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mozilla, and look how slow that thing has gone.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I wasn't necessarily suggesting that you farm it all out to open 
<br>
source programmers.  You would still have your crack team of programmers &amp; 
<br>
researchers to do most of the programming.  A single person on your team 
<br>
would manage communications with the open source community.  They could 
<br>
relay any significant ideas or code snippets to the programmers that 
<br>
originated outside.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 4) Probably the #1 biggest benefit is improved quality.  Open Source in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many ways is the pinnacle of code reviews.  Having so many ideas study the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; source would reveal far more errors and problems than an isolated team
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could ever accomplish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually I've seen that Linux has more bugs reported on Bugtraq than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other operating system. Is this because it is buggier, or because more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff gets found? Perhaps someday Mozilla will become better than Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Explorer in terms of stability, but for now the closed source approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using highly skilled programmers has worked better.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, yeah, they have more bugs reported because they have more testers than 
<br>
any other operating system!  Programmers can't fix bugs if they don't know 
<br>
they exist.  If your trying to imply that Linux is less stable or has more 
<br>
actual bugs than Windows I think your nuts.  But even if you are right, do 
<br>
you have the hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of programmers 
<br>
it takes to get Windows that stable in-house?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 5) Providing a common, open source Friendly AI system would allow other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; groups who insist on pursuing this themselves to incorporate your friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or allow Saddam Hussein to get his evil AI up and running that much faster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To be realistic, real AI is an extremely powerful technology, and our view
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to not hand it over to people we don't know and trust.
</em><br>
<p>I have found though many past mistakes that paranoia like this is a death 
<br>
sentence for your project.  Because it greatly increases the change that 
<br>
you won't succeed in the way you desire to.
