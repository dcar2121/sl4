Why C# and other such languages as opposed to Lisp and its variants? 
<br>
Lisp has many advantages including great underlying simplicity, full
<br>
reflection,  a history of formal analysis of language constructs and
<br>
programs, optimization to near (or better than) C speeds on many classes
<br>
of problems, self-modification and so on.  To my mind those are
<br>
difficult features to beat when any of the C derivative languages
<br>
including C#.   What does C# (for instance) buy you that you don't and
<br>
can't have with Lisp? 
<br>
<p>I very much agree with the scenario and have considered proceeding on
<br>
such lines for a while now.  Many of the by-products along the way are
<br>
also generally important and lucrative to the software industry.  
<br>
<p>Some of the more interesting problems revolve around the semantics of
<br>
software components of various types.  Without classification of the
<br>
semantics, of what a component is for and under what circumstances, it
<br>
would be extremely difficult to build a system that could write programs
<br>
from a general description of what was desired.  But long before that
<br>
there are many types of analysis of source, dependencies, searching for
<br>
applicable patterns, refactoring and such that would be useful and
<br>
again, lucrative, steps in this general direction.   The by-products
<br>
could be used to build a variety of software engineering tools.

<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having posted some peripheral stuff to the list lately, I feel obliged to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post something on-topic ;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This follows up a conversation that Eliezer, Peter Voss and some others and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had over dinner at the Foresight conference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I proposed the following sequence of events leading up to the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Someone [perhaps Eli, perhaps little old me, perhaps both of us together,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps some unknown hacker from the barren plains of Tadzikistan] creates a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly intelligent AI, one that can be taught, conversed with, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) This AI is taught about programming languages, is taught about algorithms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and data structures, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) It begins by being able to write and optimize and rewrite simple programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) After it achieves a significant level of practical software engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience and mathematical and AI knowledge, it is able to begin improving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself ... at which point the hard takeoff begins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My intuition is that, even in this picture, the hard takeoff takes months or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few years, not minutes.  But that's still pretty fast by the standards of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this is the way it goes, then I have a concrete proposal for two things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would probably speed up step 2.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first is the creation of a formalized database of knowledge about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms, programming languages and AI.  At www.mizar.org, there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalized database of knowledge about undergraduate and some graduate-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics.  But it's scanty on CS.  Now, I am well aware that formalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorems and proofs are not the essence of mathematics.  But they're an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important component, which a young AI will more easily absorb from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalized treatments than from journal math articles, which have their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiar social and psychological assumptions underlying them, different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the patterns underlying the math itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second is the creation of an efficient &amp; scalable programming language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a purely formal semantics.  C# may fulfill this criterion; Peter Voss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is evaluating it for this purpose.  Java is formal but not yet efficient and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scalable enough; an improved JVM could solve the problem, particularly a JVM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized for large-scale AI.  C is efficient and scalable but its use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointers means that its formal semantics needs to include a formal model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heap memory, which  makes the task of inference-driven self-modification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MUCH more difficult for a C program.  [When I say C I include C++]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that this picture of the path to the Singularity is a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from that of Eliezer.  But I'm not sure.  My sense is that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views self-modification as entering into the picture earlier, perhaps in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage 1, as the best way of getting to the first &quot;fairly intelligent AI.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not 100% sure this is wrong, but after a lot of thought I have not seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good way to do this, whereas I have a pretty clear picture of how to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Singularity according to the steps I've outlined here.
</em><br>
