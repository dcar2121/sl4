<p><p><em>&gt;In this context, &quot;explaining these ideas to laypeople&quot; is not very desirable

IMO. The less the general public knows, the more likely we are about to
<br>
reach Singularity. We don't need a huge number of followers. We only need a
<br>
few brilliant programmers.&lt;
<br>
<p>And you're gonna teach a seed AI about Friendliness? Good Luck, pal!
<br>
<p>Seriously, I think that  you do have some very valid points about the publics'
<br>
inability to accept sudden technological change. However, that's due to
<br>
ignorance on their part. Keeping them ignorant is a perfect example of
<br>
expecting two wrongs to make a right. Also, when the public hears scientists
<br>
say, &quot;shut up and eat this, it's for your own good.&quot; who can blame 'em for
<br>
feeling trepidation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What we are planning on this list is to create a machine that will literally
</em><br>
take over the world.
<br>
Do you really expect the general population to like this idea? I think not.
<br>
We are talking about The End of the World As We Know It.
<br>
I expect about 99+ % of the population to be opposed.&lt;
<br>
<p>Didn't Hitler give this speech right before he annexed Poland? (KIDDING!!!) Of
<br>
course the general public isn't going to swallow this if it's served up like
<br>
that! Convince them that the Singularity means an immeasurably better existence
<br>
for everyone on the planet, and I think that they might like it a bit more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You are free to call me an elitist, since I feel that this decision is best
</em><br>
made by the elite (us) than by the uninformed masses.&lt;
<br>
<p>You may very well be right, but I feel VERY uncomfortable with that statement,
<br>
especially from someone that is supposed to program an AI to not act selfishly.
<br>
How can you teach these concepts if you don't believe in them yourself?
