There are other sites which explain things in laymen terms as you say. Ie:
<br>
<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net">http://www.kurzweilai.net</a>
<br>
My understanding is that Low Beyond is more about CODING that damn seed AI
<br>
as opposed to anything else... When I said &quot;Do not get me wrong&quot; I was
<br>
referring to you not jumping to the conclusion that I was being elitist
<br>
*wink*

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;People need to do their homework, they do...

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think that you miss my point. I agree that it is vitally important to

read
<br>
<em>&gt; all the background materials to be involved in the discussions on this

list.
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm working through the material right now myself. My comments refer more
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; those members of the general public who have yet to be exposed to any of
</em><br>
these
<br>
<em>&gt; ideas. They may be willing to do the work as they gain more of an
</em><br>
awareness of
<br>
<em>&gt; the issues and ideas involved, but an easy-to-digest statement of the
</em><br>
goals and
<br>
<em>&gt; intentions behind all this would go a long ways towards helping to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the Singularity, and perhaps even help to bring it about
</em><br>
much
<br>
<em>&gt; sooner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;A 'Singularity for Dummies' sounds like a joke to me. Do not get me
</em><br>
wrong,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but with all due respect: why should dummies need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to understand the Singularity ?  More importantly with threats such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Military-grade Nanotech etc... why should Eliezer (and the SingInst)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;spend time on ANYTHING but what they're already busy with now ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This attitude is EXACTLY why it is important to explain these ideas to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laypeople as we approach the Singularity. The kind of arrogant attitude
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; says, &quot;Why should we be obligated to explain our important work to others,
</em><br>
when
<br>
<em>&gt; they won't understand it in the first place?&quot;, is elitist, and goes
</em><br>
against the
<br>
<em>&gt; very concept of Friendliness that is VITALLY IMPORTANT to the successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completion of this little endeavor. Making the general public aware of the
</em><br>
very
<br>
<em>&gt; scary things that are possible as technology advances so quickly, (such as
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; consequences of out-of-control nanotech) will only help us to reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, ultimately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that Eliezer shouldn't be expected to spend his time appearing on
</em><br>
talk
<br>
<em>&gt; shows or anything, but it is important for someone to provide a bridge
</em><br>
between
<br>
<em>&gt; the general public, and these very important ideas and goals. The
</em><br>
Singularity
<br>
<em>&gt; is supposed to help EVERYONE, not just those who got in line first.
</em><br>
Elitist
<br>
<em>&gt; attitudes help no one in this instance, and ultimately may harm everyone.

<em>&gt; &gt; Greetings to each and everyone,

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've only posted to this list once or twice (I never read any archives
</em><br>
up
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; till a few months ago), however:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It did not take me much to realize that Eliezer HAS GOT SOMETHING which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others (software engineers, AI coders etc...) do not have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The details of which are explained (at least that was enough for me) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI 1/2&quot; and &quot;Algernon's law&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Eliezer has already covered some of these topics at various points in
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;writing, but it might be a good idea to condense this stuff into one
</em><br>
place,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;introduction to the subject, perhaps. (the Singularity for Dummies?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I believe that anyone interested should read ALL the material on Low
</em><br>
Beyond
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; + archives + do some digging on their own to start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People need to do their homework, they do...
