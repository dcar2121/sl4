&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem I have with the story is that Friendly AI isn't exactly
<br>
'released'. But it is an entertaining read.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligenesis Faces Dim Future

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pioneering New York company that once hoped to develop the first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artificial intelligence is preparing to declare bankruptcy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligenesis Corp., which was creating the Webmind software, has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been evicted from its Broadway office suite and plans to file for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 7 bankruptcy next week.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making HAL Your Pal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Declan McCullagh (<a href="mailto:declan@wired.com?Subject=FW:%20Group%20releases%20&quot;Friendly%20AI%20guidelines,&quot;%20Webmind%20goes%20bankrupt">declan@wired.com</a>)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:00 a.m. Apr. 19, 2001 PDT
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer Yudkowsky has devoted his young life to an undeniably unusual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuit: planning for what happens when computers become far smarter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yudkowsky, a 21-year-old researcher at the Singularity Institute, has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent the last eight months writing an essay that's half precaution,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half thought exercise, and entirely in earnest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 750 KB treatise, released Wednesday, is not as much speculative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as predictive. If a computer becomes sufficiently smart, the argument
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goes, and if it gains the ability to harm humans through
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanotechnology or some means we don't expect, it may decide it doesn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need us or want us around.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One solution: Unconditional &quot;friendliness,&quot; built into the AI as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely as our genes are coded into us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've devoted my life to this,&quot; says Yudkowsky, a self-proclaimed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;genius&quot; who lives in Atlanta and opted out of attending high school
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and college.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not for lack of smarts. He's a skilled, if verbose, writer and an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avid science-fiction reader who reports he scored 1410 on his SATs,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not far below the average score for Stanford or MIT students.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yudkowsky's reason for shunning formal education is that he believes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the danger of unfriendly AI to be so near -- as early as tomorrow --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there was no time for a traditional adolescence. &quot;If you take the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singularity seriously, you tend to live out your life on a shorter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time scale,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind you, that's &quot;Singularity&quot; in capital letters. Even so-called
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singularitians like Yudkowsky admit that the term has no precise
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning, but a commonly accepted definition is a point when human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress, particularly technological progress, accelerates so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dramatically that predicting what will happen next is futile.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term appears to have been coined by John von Neumann, the great
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematician and computer scientist who used it not to refer to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superhuman intelligence, but to the everyday pace of science and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science-fiction author Vernor Vinge popularized the concept in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1980s, capitalizing the word and writing about whether mankind would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approach Singularity by way of machine intelligence alone or through
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;augmented mental processes. Predictions vary wildly about what happens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the Singularity, but the consensus seems to be that life as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humanity currently knows it will come to a sudden end.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinge is the closest thing Singularitians have to a thought leader,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spokesman and hero. He offers predictions based on measures of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technological progress such as Moore's Law, and sees the Singularity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as arriving between 2005 and 2030 -- though some Vinge aficionados
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope the possibility of uploading their brains into an immortal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer is just around the corner.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is Yudkowsky, who credits Vinge for turning him onto the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singularity at age 11. &quot;I read True Names,&quot; he said, referring to a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinge novel. &quot;I got to page 47 and found out what I was going to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing for the rest of my life.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, Yudkowsky has become not just someone who predicts the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singularity, but a committed activist trying to speed its arrival. &quot;My
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first allegiance is to the Singularity, not humanity,&quot; he writes in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one essay. &quot;I don't know what the Singularity will do with us. I don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know whether Singularities upgrade mortal races, or disassemble us for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spare atoms.... If it comes down to Us or Them, I'm with Them.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a character from science fiction, Yudkowsky sees his efforts as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humanity's only hope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an autobiographical essay, he writes: &quot;I think my efforts could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity, or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the difference between a Singularity and a lifeless, sterilized
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planet... I think that I can save the world, not just because I'm the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one who happens to be making the effort, but because I'm the only one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can make the effort.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;###
<br>
<p>[Clarification: Yudkowsky just emailed me to say he received a 1600 on his
<br>
SATs when he took them again. --Declan]
