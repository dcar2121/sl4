<em>&gt; This is interesting! Has any of this been documented in &quot;Wild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computing&quot;? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticed it's a lot about Webmind in particular, and wondered how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still holds.
</em><br>
<p>The ideas in there are current as of 1998 or so.  they haven't been revoked,
<br>
but have been gone beyond in many ways, as we've gotten more practical and
<br>
learned more things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about the last one, &quot;From Complexity to Creativity&quot;? As the last book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you wrote before Webmind I guess it's fairly accurate about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories you had before actual construction. This is specially of interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me, as I plan to use the psynet and creativity discussions on this book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a term paper in my current psychology class.
</em><br>
<p>While I was writing that book, in my spare time I was playing with some
<br>
self-modifying Haskell programs, which I guess were Webmind AI Engine
<br>
proto-prototypes....  There's even a chapter in there about how to make a
<br>
really smart distributed search engine, I think....  So while I was writing
<br>
that I was playing with various totally impractical ways to make an AI, and
<br>
hadn't yet found the practical way...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Please, try to share at least some of this clarity with us right now.
</em><br>
<p>Ommmmm  ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goertzel, I must confess that the more I read about your work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Webmind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more I think I should contribute to it after I graduate! :-)
</em><br>
<p>We can use all the help we can get, that's for sure ;&gt;
