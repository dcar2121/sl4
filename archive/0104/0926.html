<p>That 'old thing' is the most important point you need to make.  Instead of 
<br>
directing people off to read things scattered all over the web, you need to 
<br>
write something.  It may not be as fun to write as FAI, and you may 
<br>
consider it a waste of time, but something like this should be your highest 
<br>
priority, I think.  You need a definitive reference for these types of 
<br>
questions.  BTW, you'll note that I personally don't question IF we should 
<br>
pursue the singularity.  But I do question HOW.  I'm not convinced that 
<br>
your approach is the best one.  If you've really spent the last 2-3 years 
<br>
proving this to yourself, then you should tell us about it.  Write up a 
<br>
paper explaining all this thinking you've done and why, exactly, your 
<br>
approach is the right one.  But you still need to cover why we should be 
<br>
doing this at all, for those out there that are not yet convinced of that 
<br>
point (which by far outnumber those of us who are).
