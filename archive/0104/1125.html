Hi,
<br>
<p>I've been working on developing a mathematically thorough top-down model of
<br>
AI for several years now, working from a substantially different perspective
<br>
than a lot of AI work.  I've been working on distilling the complex topic
<br>
down into a paper on a very part-time basis for a couple years now.
<br>
Unfortunately, as I approach completion it seems that a german mathematician
<br>
beat me to the punch by a matter of months.  My own implementation work has
<br>
based on a nearly identical mathematical model of AI.
<br>
<p>Since his paper overlaps about 90% of mine, I would refer all the readers on
<br>
this list to his paper.  Hell, about 2/3 of his mathematics references match
<br>
mine.  I find it interesting that not only did he arrive to the same
<br>
mathematical model, but that he appears to have developed some of the same
<br>
biases towards a lot of AI research that I have as well as a result of the
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>Where we differ:  In content, we don't -- he is right on the money.  We
<br>
differ only in that I have spent substantially more time exploring certain
<br>
specific areas and implementation issues in general i.e. My coverage detail
<br>
is broader, though his is by no means narrow.  He also makes some
<br>
conjectures with strong support, but is apparently unaware that important
<br>
proofs of his conjectures have been published in the last several years.
<br>
<p>I strongly encourage people to read at least the introduction (the paper
<br>
itself is approx. 65 pages long) to get an idea of the mathematical
<br>
concepts, theory, and implications.  The paper itself can be very terse and
<br>
mathematical at times but is digestible, particularly if you jump over the
<br>
formalities.  I am very interested in hearing this list's feedback on the
<br>
paper.

<p>I'm only annoyed because I spent some of my limited time writing when I
<br>
could have been coding... :^)
<br>
<p>Enjoy,
<br>
