Hi everyone,
<br>
<p>I've been lurking for quite a while, and will try to send a JOIN message
<br>
shortly. For now, I'm a computer science student on my last semester to
<br>
graduation, with interests in distributed systems, programming languages
<br>
and, of course, AI.
<br>
<p>I'll try to comment if other languages, specially dynamic ones would bring
<br>
the same issues for AI development as Java, and how they could be addressed.
<br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Firstly, development is clearly faster in Java than in C/C++. Not having to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debug malloc() errors is nice.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, this is accepted fact. But also the software engineering community
<br>
(those that do the actual programming, at least) is recognizing the benefits
<br>
that dynamic languages (such as Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk, Python and Ruby)
<br>
offer even faster development time. Of course the lack of static typing
<br>
demands more testing of the system, but overall development goes faster, as
<br>
in practice tests for the correctness of behavior also check correctness of
<br>
types.
<br>
<p>And of course all these languages can interface with C/C++ code, so speed
<br>
bottlenecks can be recoded in C. This still leaves the memory bottleneck,
<br>
though. See below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Java, if you use HotSpot, is no slower than C++. It is surely still slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than a speed-optimized C program, but not by an order of magnitude
</em><br>
<p><p>This is to be expected, as Java method calls are conceptually identical to
<br>
calls to virtual methods in C++, so their performance should be similar
<br>
after JIT-compilation.
<br>
<p>Dynamic languages, with optimization, can come close to this, too. Modern
<br>
Smalltalk JVMs optimize the method calls so they also are almost as fast as
<br>
C++ virtual function calls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A Java program uses about 4 times as much memory as a comparable C++
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program. There's not much you can do about this. Also, all current JVM's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on all current OS's are limited to about 1.2 GB of RAM per Java process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Sun promises a 64-bit JVM, someday, but, well...). So, if you want an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program with a lot of data in it, and you want to use Java, you're pushed
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;deal with distributed processing pretty early in your work. Distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processing, however, slows down processing a lot. With a lot of work, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;got the performance of a distributed system in the range of 5-10 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slower than that of a comparable 1-JVM system with the same amount of data.
</em><br>
<p><p>The 4x figure for memory comsuption is pretty large. Is this due to
<br>
inneficient garbage-collection? (i.e. half or more of the memory comsumption
<br>
are &quot;dead&quot; objects). And the 1.2Gb limit is serious, after all 32-bit
<br>
operating systems nowadays give at least 2Gb addressable memory per-process.
<br>
Sloppy work they did! I don't know how Lisp and Smalltalk JVMs compare,
<br>
though, but Python and Ruby, being C-based (Ruby even uses a modified malloc
<br>
for memory allocation) should be able to handle just as much as a C process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The bottleneck turns out to be, not the actual network bandwidth, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time required for Java to serialize/deserialize objects. One can minimize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this by overriding the readObject() and writeObject() methods [custom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serialization], but this has limited value, unfortunately.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, serialization is slow in Java. Cloning via clone() versus cloning via
<br>
serializing and serializing (to a memory stream) is two orders of magnitude
<br>
faster. I really don't know how this can be. For the other languages cited:
<br>
I don't know how Lisp and Scheme handle networking and serialization, but it
<br>
should be easy for them. I'll try some benchmarks with Ruby to see how it
<br>
fares. Maybe this is a design flaw in ObjectOutputStream?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Furthermore, garbage collection in existing JVM's is fantastically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inefficient for programs creating billions of objects. It seems that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;JVM is not tuned for truly large-scale applications.
</em><br>
<p><p>What is the object creation profile of Webmind? Does its operation produce a
<br>
lot of &quot;dead&quot; objects? Java's standard GC is primitive (I don't know for
<br>
HotSpot JVM). It's now multithreaded, it's not generational... there was a
<br>
paper in January's ACM SIGPLAN Notices (&quot;Thread-Specific Heaps for
<br>
Multi-Threaded Programs&quot;, by Bjarne Steensgaard, Microsoft Research) about a
<br>
generational, multi-threaded garbage collector for a experimental
<br>
Java-to-native code compiler that gives each thread it's own heap, allowing
<br>
garbage collection of specific heaps to go in parallel with normal operation
<br>
in other threads. There were references for similar works for Java and
<br>
functional languages.
<br>
<p>Lisp and Smalltalk have got more advanced garbage collectors by now (the
<br>
functional nature of Lisp gives advantages to generational GC). Python does
<br>
reference-counting: circular structures leak memory (and I really think
<br>
you've got a lot of them :-) ). Ruby still has primitive (Java-level GC),
<br>
but a generational collector is being implemented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And, there are no existing Java profilers that will profile a large-scale,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multi-threaded Java system. Quite literally, they all crash when applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a program. For this reason we have created our own Java profiler. [The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eason the commercial profilers crash is that they try to report all events
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the program to their GUI's, and the Java GUI tools are not able to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with such a high volume of data. Our profiler just saves events in a log
</em><br>
<em>&gt;file, which avoids the problem.]
</em><br>
<p><p>Don't know about profilers, but mandatory reporting to UI is very braindead!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are also no adequate debuggers in Java, when one is creating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large-scale software system.
</em><br>
<p><p>You can alleviate the need for some debugging by careful test discipline.
<br>
Take a look at the testing discipline of Extreme Programming
<br>
(c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming). It mandates that each class in the
<br>
system must have a test suite that exercises any interesting behavior the
<br>
class has. The suite must run wirhout human intervention, and best results
<br>
are arrived when you code a test *before* coding functionality for the test
<br>
to pass. Of course it doesn't help with concurrency and system tests, but
<br>
localized errors can be found and corrected (even prevented from ocurring)
<br>
without debugging the whole system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;work with distributed processing very early on. Distributed computing is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whole science unto itself, which we've mastered, but it took a lot of time.
</em><br>
<p><p>At least you are in a local network, so get ordering of messages for free
<br>
(all machines receive messages in the same order)! :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What a few of us are doing now is taking the most essential aspects of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system and re-coding them in C in a very simple and specialized way. We're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not dealing with distributed processing in this experimental version yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We just want a simple system in which we can play around with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interaction of the various AI components of the system, freely and easily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In a couple months we'll deal with the reintegration of this into the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt;codebase, using JNI, which works very nicely BTW.
</em><br>
<p><p>I see how you have been burned by Java. In retrospect I think Smalltalk or
<br>
Lisp would have been a better choice at the time (if you were starting now I
<br>
would still recommend them, in a couple years maybe Ruby will be a good
<br>
solution, too, but it's still in flux and the GC is poor). I think you
<br>
already came to this conclusion, but I would also recode the communication
<br>
core in C so messages woudn't have to be composed by Java serialization
<br>
(then you can really roll your own serialization, converting the Java
<br>
objects to the comm core message format). Wish you the best of luck!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;stick with C/C++. Java is just not tuned for such projects, and you run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a hell of a lot of annoying problems that waste a huge amount of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and effort, far outweighing the savings in programming time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;LISP is a nice language too, and there are some fast LISPs. But in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large-scale use cases, they have the same garbage collection inefficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems as current JVM's.
</em><br>
<p><p>As I said, Lisp and Smalltalk GCs are now a whole different animal than the
<br>
crude mark-and-sweep GC. They already have enhancements that are still in
<br>
the research labs for Java. Another paper in the same journal I cited above
<br>
has results showing that potential improvement for memory savings can be
<br>
from 23% to 74%, compared to the current Java GC. Of course it's an upper
<br>
bound, but it's still significant! And multi-threaded garbage collectors can
<br>
improve speed, too.
<br>
<p>Well, this is pretty long for a first post! Hope I could contribute with
<br>
something at least a tiny bit useful!
