<p>James, I hear what you are saying.  This is very interesting.  :-)
<br>
<p>One of the most compelling things about Moravec's analysis of raw speed is that
<br>
he gives a fairly compelling defense of his numbers.  Of course, he would be the
<br>
first to agree, I believe, that it is a &quot;rough&quot; guide, but at least it is a guide
<br>
that is quantifiable.  Further research on the brain can give us a better idea
<br>
of the brain's MIPS, and projections about the future MIPS of computers in that
<br>
neighborhood of course become more accurate the closer we get to that future.
<br>
<p>Do you think it is possible to give a similar analysis of memory bandwidth?  In
<br>
other words, you speak about memory bandwidth in silicon growing exponentially
<br>
but more slowly than speed.  And you speak about silicon memory bandwidth still
<br>
being dramatically less than brain memory bandwidth.  Can we quantify this in some
<br>
way?  At least, roughly?
<br>
<p>How should we measure memory bandwidth?  How much bandwidth does the brain have?
<br>
How much bandwidth do current supercomputers have?  How fast is that growing?
<br>
<p>There are many other quite possibly relevant questions, of course.  But we could
<br>
leave those until later.  Questions like: how much of the brain is actually used
<br>
for intelligence, as opposed to being used to run our automatic biological functions?
<br>
To what extent can the speed advantage of silicon _make up for_ a lack of memory
<br>
bandwidth?  Those are obviously tough questions, but they might be easier to contemplate
<br>
seriously if we had a measure of bandwidth.
