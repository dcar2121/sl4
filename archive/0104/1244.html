<em>&gt; And businesspeople, who tend to have the $$, don't tend to be particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flexible in their conceptual frameworks, as compared to say, artists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; musicians, scientists,....  Success in business is often driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrowness of mind, which enables the narrowness of focus that is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial to business success.  At least that's been my impression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<p>In retrospect, this paragraph itself may have been rather narrow-minded in
<br>
conception.  I think I'm in a bad mood!  ;p
<br>
<p>Of course, businesspeople come in all shapes and sizes, and I fear I've been
<br>
overexposed to a certain breed of New York banker, the members of which do
<br>
fit my description in that paragraph rather well
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I've certainly also known a fair number of innovative and
<br>
broad-minded businessfolks too, over the course of my life.  I just haven't
<br>
been encountering very many of them lately.  I suppose that the currently
<br>
harsh market conditions are pushing a lot of people toward their most
<br>
conservative frames of mind.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this thread got started by Brian saying how it was hard to convince
<br>
people of the Singularity's reality.  And I do stand by the essence of my
<br>
statement even though I overstated the point.  For a complex combination of
<br>
reasons, most businessfolks are not of the cast of mind to recognize the
<br>
importance of something like the Singularity.  &quot;Narrowness&quot; was perhaps not
<br>
the right way to put it ... &quot;pragmatism&quot; is a little better but not quite
<br>
right either.  Some of you will know what I mean and am not quite adequately
<br>
saying...
