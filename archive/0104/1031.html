</em><br>
<p>I realized that this would be a problem.  The best I can do is 
<br>
suggest a sandbox to play in to figure this out.  Of course, what if 
<br>
the sandbox has bugs?  Answer:  we may be screwed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Second, I can't personally imagine an implementation to enforce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morals that wouldn't require intelligence.  Making these decisions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requires the ability to reason.  A good example of this is some of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the latest Airbus planes.  They have &quot;enforced morals&quot;, as such, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they prevent the pilot from taking the plane past certain 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;what if your about to hit a mountain?  I'd rather be uncomfortable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a short time and live, than be comfortable right up to my grave. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The plane can't reason, though, so in this scenario you'd be dead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(there is no manual override, I understand, btw).  This is the kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of thinking I want to avoid.  One wrong moral, and it could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artificially force the whole group into extinction.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't really a good analogy.  Real morals have nothing to do 
<br>
with comfort, but with actual survival.  You can be incredibly 
<br>
uncomfotable and not violate morals.  Also, this is why I am weary of 
<br>
actually enforcing the morals.  This is mostly me trying to find an 
<br>
alternative to a Sysop if we have to have some kind of rules.  I 
<br>
agree, if we get it wrong just a little bit, were all screwed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would also say that Intelligence breaking the &quot;natural morals&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably a good thing, on the whole.  Our natural morals are such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we should run around kill &amp; eat animals, and screwing any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;female we can to propagate the species.  Well over 90% of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population has probably never killed anything larger than a mouse; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some would say this is a good thing.  We have also created trade, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computers, video games, written language, etc.  These are not, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strictly speaking, required by our morals.  Morals really represent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;common sense&quot; most accurately.  They are not, and should not be, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hard and fast rules.  Rather, they are guidelines.
</em><br>
<p>This is a common misunderstand, relating morals too closely with 
<br>
changes in society.  I don't have the time right now to explain this 
<br>
(I'm sort of in a hurry but wanted to reply).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Having a non-intelligent system that enforces morals would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terribly dangerous for all inside if one or more external SIs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existed.  In such a situation the free SIs could do anything they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wished to the SIs in the moral reality, who would be restrained in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protecting themselves.  Without a Sysop around to help, they would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be at the mercy of the external SIs.  Not that I personally love the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sysop scenario, but having a non-intelligent system is even worse.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is why I don't want any kind of Sysopish thing at all. 
<br>
So, I guess we agree on the anarchy scenario then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I personally think we would probably be just fine individually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uploaded.  Well, as long as a large group of mostly reasonable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people uploaded at the same time.  If SI has a natural attractor for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendliness, everything is good.  If it does not, things continue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*mostly* as they are now.  Except that everyone is incredibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent, no one is handicapped (unless they want to be) and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone has incredible power over the physical universe.  At first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this sounds scary, but most people will want to do the right thing. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So if 1% of the population is inherently unfriendly, 99% of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population would be able to gang up (as it were) and protect against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that 1%.  Maybe putting them in a Sysop controlled virtual reality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for eternity if they are really bad (ie: a very nice &amp; cushy prison, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where you can do anything except affect the &quot;real&quot; world).
</em><br>
<p>I've written stuff to this effect on the list before, but glad to 
<br>
have someone out there in agreement.  Makes it easier to team up 
<br>
against Eliezer.  ;-)
