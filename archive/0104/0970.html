<p>
This subject was discussed internally back when we formed SIAI. We decided
<br>
on a plan of action that so far has remained pretty coherent: due to
<br>
potential public backlash, only seek publicity up until the time we become
<br>
fully funded. Actually we have kept things quieter than that would imply
<br>
since a) we haven't needed too much funding yet b) we wanted to target
<br>
certain individuals privately for financial backing. This continues... but
<br>
with the impending release of FAI, and our desire to move more towards
<br>
actual coding, things are changing a bit and we will seek a bit more
<br>
publicity if we can get it. But again once we get enough funding expect that
<br>
to dry up. We decided when we formed that we were not going to be any
<br>
kind of Singularity evangelist.. there are organizations like ExI and
<br>
people like Kurzweil who are doing that task.
<br>
<p>Actually all this chatting on public mailing lists may not be the best
<br>
thing. I expect as time goes on we may feel the need to retreat even
<br>
farther. This list might become restricted membership, or we might kind
<br>
of disown it and leave it to be a higher level Extropians list. We'll see.
<br>
It's really up to Eliezer of course, but I think he agrees with this?
<br>
<p>The only two real reasons I can see for publicity (past getting funds) are:
<br>
<p>1. Chat with other smart people to see if there are any holes in our work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now this list helps with that, but as we get more staff this list
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will likely become less relevant to this concern. In latter stages of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research most likely none of our internal work will be available publicly.
<br>
<p>2. Spread the word to other AI developers about Friendly AI, and help them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrate it into their designs. Since the AI &quot;community&quot; is relatively
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small we think that once we become a bit more established no more real
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publicity will be required since pretty much everyone should have heard
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of us.
