<p>I quote the above merely because it gave me the spark to think about the below.
<br>
<p>Has there been any serious discussion about making this an open source 
<br>
project?  Instead of debating how open to be, if/when to hide, etc. maybe 
<br>
you should consider the exact opposite.  I believe it has many advantages.
<br>
<p>1) It becomes nearly impossible (definitely impractical) to stop the work 
<br>
since everyone has access to it and could continue to build upon it if the 
<br>
original authors could not continue.
<br>
<p>2) It would pull in some of the rogue groups who would go it alone.
<br>
<p>3) Open Source could massively speed up the process.  Instead of having a 
<br>
few coders working on it, thousands or more would be able to 
<br>
contribute.  (with very high quality control, of course)
<br>
<p>4) Probably the #1 biggest benefit is improved quality.  Open Source in 
<br>
many ways is the pinnacle of code reviews.  Having so many ideas study the 
<br>
source would reveal far more errors and problems than an isolated team 
<br>
could ever accomplish.
<br>
<p>5) Providing a common, open source Friendly AI system would allow other 
<br>
groups who insist on pursuing this themselves to incorporate your friendly 
<br>
tech.
<br>
<p>If your ultimate goal really is to get to the singularity as soon as 
<br>
possible, before a non-friendly singularity can occur I think this is an 
<br>
ideal path to follow.
