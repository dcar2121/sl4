<em>&gt; And really, given the size of your company is there a good chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the members were availing themselves of position even in the best of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times. Surely as a statistical thing the chances must have been reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good. A more to the point, who really gives a fuck--as it were. If the guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been working the streets in order to generate revenue for WM,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have been news. Indeed, I think I'll include this in my piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalism on WM. :) But this does give me a good idea. Perhaps you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have WM2 work in the phone sex trade. Presumably this could be done fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily since only minimal intelligence is required for this work.
</em><br>
<p>Stephan (my former Deputy CTO) and I came up with a related idea...
<br>
<p>We intend to start a new firm focused on the use of quantum teleportation to
<br>
remove feces ~directly~ from the rectum without passing through the usual
<br>
orifice.  This will allow one to relieve one's bowels while driving, sitting
<br>
in business meetings or classrooms, etc.
<br>
<p>company name:  Rectronix
<br>
<p>slogan:  No shit!
<br>
<p>;p
<br>
<p><p>Ok ok.  I'm really just trying to get Eliezer to BZZZZT!! me for the first
<br>
time...
<br>
<p>A few of us, including Eli and Peter Voss myself, just got back from the
<br>
Foresight Gathering in SF, at which there was a fair amount of talk about AI
<br>
and the Singularity, almost more so than about nanotechnology, the alleged
<br>
primary focus of the conference.  Peculiarly, among that crowd, I found
<br>
myself among the more practical-minded people around ;O   I'm working on a
<br>
project that has a prayer of reaching a state of dramatic success in a year
<br>
or two, whereas the nanotech guys are frequently talking about decades!
<br>
<p>Anyway, it's clear from this conference and from Kurzweil's forthcoming book
<br>
that the Singularity concept is going to seep into the tech media over the
<br>
next couple years.  I'll be curious to see what it turns into.
