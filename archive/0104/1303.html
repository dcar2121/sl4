Quoeth Eliezer:
<br>
<em>&gt; It so happens that I believe that the Sysop Scenario is not influenced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either Judeo-Christian apocalyptism, nor by Taoistic philosophy.  A Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is neither God nor the Tao; a Sysop is a Sysop.  Are there concrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences?  Sure; the Tao may not coerce, but (in Eastern philosophy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Tao still does influence all living things, pervasively, in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher-level patterns and not just the underlying matter, and the Tao does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this without first asking permission.  Thus a Sysop is not the Tao.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;Nice try Eliezer...but there is a ..ahem..rather large hole there.
<br>
The Dao does not ask permission. It does not require it. It just *is*.
<br>
The Sysop is not the Dao, but it's primary fundamental trait lacking
<br>
for this qualification is not permissiveness or passivity, but it's
<br>
origination. The Sysop is an artifact. Dao is (non)design.
<br>
But it was a nice try. Pop-culture &quot;Taoism&quot; is not likely to pass unnoticed
<br>
in a forum of this caliber. You have people hanging out who know
<br>
as much about it as you do about your interests. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nonetheless, to accuse Friendly AI of being contaminated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Judeo-Christian ideas, or to analogize between the Sysop and God, is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; display Western parochialism.  Any culturally sophisticated antagonist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should accuse Friendly AI of having been contaminated by Taoism and Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhism.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezar *this* culturally sophisticated 'antagonist' (friendly of course)
<br>
would
<br>
immediately point out that there is a wide difference between philosophical
<br>
Daoism (and Ch'an Buddhism) as practiced by the clergy, the &quot;vulgar&quot;
<br>
religous &quot;Great Dao&quot; practiced in the countryside, and the &quot;Western
<br>
pop-culture
<br>
Tao&quot; written about in the West these days.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a significant millenariun component to the Great Dao of the
<br>
countryside.
<br>
Establishing the &quot;Kingdom of Peace&quot; (funny funny yes?) where war dies and
<br>
all things correspond with the Plan of Heaven is in line with a Friendly
<br>
Sysop.
<br>
But I doubt any of the people involved with Friendly AI know that much about
<br>
Eastern thought, to judge from your posts. No offense.
<br>
<em>&gt; I deny both accusations, of course, and would as soon draw no analogy at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all between FAI and *any* religion.  You can judge this by the fact that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't think of this defense for quite some time after hearing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original accusations of theological contamination.  Still, I thought I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring it up, since at the last check a few people were still unconvinced.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think anyone with a bit of sense is thinking of your work as being
<br>
&quot;theologically contaminated&quot;.  The harshest honest criticism possibly
<br>
merited is that the mental attitude of  hope is incongruent with most common
<br>
memes except the religous ones. As a product of the agnostic/aethist/secular
<br>
humanist/transhumanist philosophy spectrum FAI is bound to be  perceived
<br>
in religous terms by the Masses, and in that quarter..you are the Whore of
<br>
Babylon, and the FAI/Sysop is either the Antichrist or the False Prophet.
<br>
That's the obvious perception most will make. ::shrugs:::
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd be interested however, in a Devil's Advocate post from you, explaining
<br>
(satirically) how the Sysop scenario is a manifestation of your own Messiah
<br>
complex from an ethnic Jewish POV! Christianity aside. That would be funny.
<br>
<p><p>Brian
<br>
&quot;What is the saying of the mutual supporting of the hard and the soft?
<br>
&nbsp;The one has never known difficulty if the hard and soft mutuallu assist
<br>
each other. Hard and soft should use the Yang and the Yin hands.
<br>
This would enable one to open the heaven,  expose the earth, and
<br>
cause a great wave in the ocean&quot;
