<p>Well, no. I think Elezier is better equipped than me for that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Seriously, I think that  you do have some very valid points about the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not only. The people in the anti-tech movement, like Jeremy Rifkin, are 
<br>
often intelligent and know a lot about the issues. They can influence a lot 
<br>
of less intelligent people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Keeping them ignorant is a perfect example of

</em><br>
<p>Yes, the argument is that if they find out that we were actively keeping 
<br>
this a secret, the backlash would be even worse. However, just delaying the 
<br>
Singularity is bad enough, with gray goo and everything.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;What we are planning on this list is to create a machine that will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take over the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you really expect the general population to like this idea? I think not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We are talking about The End of the World As We Know It.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I expect about 99+ % of the population to be opposed.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Didn't Hitler give this speech right before he annexed Poland? (KIDDING!!!) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course the general public isn't going to swallow this if it's served up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that! Convince them that the Singularity means an immeasurably better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for everyone on the planet, and I think that they might like it a bit more.
</em><br>
<p>Well, sure. We can say lots of nice sounding things, but the majority of 
<br>
people will get their information from the newspapers, which would likely 
<br>
have more alarmist headlines. My point is: most people fear change as a 
<br>
evolved gut reaction. This as much change as one can possibly imagine. 
<br>
Therefore, the resistance ought to be big.
<br>
<p>I do not think that 20 or so years will ever be enough time to convince the 
<br>
majority of people that Singularity is a good thing. The golden path between 
<br>
our viewpoints may be to remain as we are now: we don't appear with Jay 
<br>
Leno, but there are information online for those who are ready to recieve 
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;You are free to call me an elitist, since I feel that this decision is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made by the elite (us) than by the uninformed masses.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You may very well be right, but I feel VERY uncomfortable with that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially from someone that is supposed to program an AI to not act 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selfishly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How can you teach these concepts if you don't believe in them yourself?
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'll let Elezier do the Friendliness-programming.
<br>
I just want to make it to the other side.
