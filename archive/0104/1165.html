<p>&quot;'Possibly,' he conceded with equanamity.&quot;  But every time you write a
<br>
computer program of a kind that never existed before, there's a sense in
<br>
which you really don't know what it's capable of.  You know that it's only
<br>
so smart at any given time, but you don't know if it's right on the edge
<br>
of a self-improvement curve that goes right off to infinity.  I can easily
<br>
see Lenat estimating the probability as being very close to zero, and
<br>
justly so, but not actually zero.  It wouldn't have been *that* hard to
<br>
put in an improvements counter and something that halted and paged Lenat
<br>
if more than a thousand improvements went by without further user input. 
<br>
This is hardly a full-featured resilient Friendliness system, but it's
<br>
just that tiny increment better than nothing, which is what's needed for a
<br>
system which has a tiny increment of a chance of doing something
<br>
unexpected.  And Lenat could probably have done it in thirty minutes, so
<br>
it's not like it would have been a major project.
