</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I stopped reading FAI when I got to the references to Greg Egan's Diaspora.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why? I don't want to have the book spoiled for me (yes, I'm that silly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've finished &quot;The Origins of Virutue&quot; Sunday (BIG thumbs up!), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started Permutation City (also BIG thumbs up!). So if my understanding of

<em>&gt; FAI is shallow, you'll know why).
</em><br>
<p>Durant,
<br>
<p>I would never, ever include a spoiler without great big flaming warning
<br>
signs three pages in advance.  My friends can attest to my insane
<br>
fanaticism in this area.  The items included from Diaspora are a bit
<br>
future-shocky, but they should be just as future-shocky in FAI as in the
<br>
book, and there's plenty of future shock left over; I guarantee zero
<br>
impact on the plot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So let me ask, will the nascent FAI have a &quot;sense of self&quot;, which can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a positive or a negative emotional attachment? When the AI is young and still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on self optimization, it is conceivable to me that one parameter to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tweak is &quot;propogation of self worth&quot;. When ver human teacher/programmer/role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models tells ver that something ve did was wrong, that lesson should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporated and used to affect future behavior. Is there a middle step,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though? Is there an internal sense of failure, of having done something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong before the attempt to correct the problem? Humans have this. Do AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need it?
</em><br>
<p>There's an already-written section of Friendly AI that explains all of
<br>
this, with diagrams... that hasn't been uploaded yet.  For now... um, I'm
<br>
sorry to say this, but the question is so orthogonal to the proposed
<br>
architecture that I'm not even sure where to start.  The AI treats
<br>
programmer statements as sensory information about supergoal content.  If
<br>
the AI takes an action and the action fails to achieve its purpose, the AI
<br>
is less likely to try it again, but that's because the hypothesis that
<br>
&quot;Action X will lead to Parent Goal Y&quot; has been disconfirmed by the new
<br>
data (i.e, backpropagation of negative reinforcement and positive
<br>
reinforcement can be shown to arise automatically from the Bayesian
<br>
Probability Theorem plus the goal system architecture - this is where the
<br>
diagrams come in).
<br>
<p>It's possible to derive quantities like &quot;self-confidence&quot; (the degree to
<br>
which an AI thinks that vis own beliefs have implications about reality),
<br>
&quot;self-worth&quot; (the AI's estimate of vis own value to the present or future
<br>
achievement of supergoals), and so on, but these quantities wouldn't play
<br>
the same role as they do in humans - or a role anywhere near as important,
<br>
given the lack of hardware social connotations.
<br>
<p>What I expect to be the most important quantities for a Friendly AI are
<br>
things like &quot;unity of will&quot; (the degree to which the need to use the
<br>
programmers as auxiliary brains outweighs any expected real goal
<br>
divergence), &quot;trust&quot; (to what degree a given programmer affirmation is
<br>
expected to correspond to reality), &quot;a priori trust&quot; (the Bayesian priors
<br>
for how much the programmers can be trusted, independent of any
<br>
programmer-affirmed content), and so on.
<br>
