He's at Foresight, but I can give my views... 1st off SIAI decided from
<br>
the beginning that we are not going to be a memetic organization. We want
<br>
to spend our time totally on the research as much as possible. Other orgs
<br>
and people like ExI, Foresight, Kurzweil, get across most of our views for
<br>
us anyway. 2nd, we would greatly prefer to fund our efforts from outside
<br>
individuals/orgs who want to commit themselves to accelerating the Singularity.
<br>
Raising the money ourselves through selling books or whatever would take a
<br>
lot longer, and I guess is kind of a last resort right above complete open
<br>
sourcing. So 3rd going along with that is that writing and &quot;doing&quot; a book
<br>
just takes a lot of time that Eliezer would prefer to use on his real work.
<br>
Oh yeah, 4th we don't want TOO much press lest we get the wrong kind of
<br>
people interested in us. We want just enough press to let us find enough
<br>
funding, and then we'd like to disappear from the world and do our work.
