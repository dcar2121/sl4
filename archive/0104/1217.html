<p>Are you sure about this? &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; was (and still is) pretty 
<br>
radical to the general public (high end SL3), and I didn't see any coverage 
<br>
from the mainstream media about it. There was one small editorial in the 
<br>
&quot;culture&quot; section of &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, one of Sweden's largest papers, 
<br>
but that was it. I didn't see anything on CNN or BBC (maybe I missed it) so 
<br>
there was hardly any &quot;frenzy&quot; back then at least. The Bill Joy debacle went 
<br>
by pretty quietly too as I recall (I think the focus was mainly on Biotech 
<br>
stuff). I think that if there is media frenzy about Ray's forthcoming book, 
<br>
there should have been more press about SM as well (or has he more &quot;media 
<br>
power&quot; now than then?).
<br>
<p>There is still debate (in academia and elsewhere) about whether or not 
<br>
*human-level* AI is even possible, so I think that most people would 
<br>
consider SIs and Powers too fantastical to take seriously. The media may not 
<br>
want to stick their necks out with such a fantastic claim, especially since 
<br>
many respectable AI-researchers think that the whole idea is ludicrous. 
<br>
(Some 30 years ago, the above mentioned newspaper blasted on the front page 
<br>
that perpetuum mobile-machines was going to solve the energy crisis... quite 
<br>
some laughter in academia later...)
<br>
<p>I saw a thing about Ray's ideas on a german science-program (&quot;Nano&quot; on 
<br>
3sat). It discussed uploading and AI, and had interviews with Ray. In the 
<br>
end, there was some professor of computer science as a studio guest. He 
<br>
simply said that AI was impossible because human brains are analog and 
<br>
computers are digital. Period. People like these always seem to get the last 
<br>
word, in printed press as well as television. This could be why there hasn't 
<br>
been any debates about these things; when people watch it on TV, they're 
<br>
basically told that it is nothing to worry about.
<br>
<p>I believe this was the case with cloning: before Dolly, noone thought it 
<br>
could even be done, and there was no debate whatsoever. After Dolly: well 
<br>
you know...
<br>
<p>Will there be a similar scenario with AI/SI? Only time will tell.
