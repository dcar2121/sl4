<p>I assume this specific topic is covered in the FAI document.  If it's of 
<br>
reasonable size (and I can find it) I'll try and read that in the next 
<br>
couple of days.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;You want to talk about who designs the first AI? Well who decides who gets

<em>&gt;Well James we don't see didley squat in terms of new ideas from you, so I
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;judgements

</em><br>
<p>Maybe I need to write up a description of sarcasm and post it as a 
<br>
reference somewhere...
<br>
<p>And excuse me if I don't offer &quot;didley squat in terms of new 
<br>
ideas&quot;.  You've been thinking about this for 3+ years, I've been thinking 
<br>
about it for, maybe, 2 months now.
<br>
<p>I don't have an &quot;ideal&quot; scenario, yet.  However, I am actively exploring 
<br>
numerous possibilities.  It would take on the order of 2+ hours of writing 
<br>
each day to communicate what I'm thinking about at this point.  I shoot a 
<br>
lot of holes though my own ideas too, fyi.  When I find something that 
<br>
doesn't end up looking like swiss cheese and have some time to spare, I'll 
<br>
be more than happy to write up the details.
<br>
<p>I have read quite a bit of your online documentation.  But, I'll note, that 
<br>
you said you haven't even raid FAI yet due to its size.
