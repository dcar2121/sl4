<p><em>&gt; However, in the case of Declan's article about Webmind in Wired News, it

</em><br>
<p>This is why I enjoyed the article so much!  All my friends loved the
<br>
idea of my company descending into a seething mess of alcohol and
<br>
prostitutes!  The reality for most of us was FAR less interesting:
<br>
having salary owed to us, getting CVs ready, having to sell furniture
<br>
and shift out of apartments, job interviews, lifting lots of heavy
<br>
servers....  v e r y   b o r i n g....
<br>
<p>Wired, as I understand it, gives you the general idea of what's going
<br>
on in a way that is brief and interesting to read.  I think they
<br>
succeeded.  If you really want the low down on exactly what, why
<br>
and how then you need to look elsewhere - such as following the links
<br>
Declan provided.  Most people just aren't interested in this level of
<br>
detail, they just want the general idea; there's too much news everyday
<br>
to worry about the exact details.  Many readers of this list however
<br>
probably are interested in the details, so follow the links.  Ben's
<br>
summary makes for a very interesting read.
