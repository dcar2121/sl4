<p>
hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you have much experience with C++?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I fucking hate it.  It's an awkward, oversized, nasty language,
<br>
which is intensely painful to debug.  That's why i chose Java for Webmind.
<br>
What a disappointment to find that, all in all, for large-scale projects
<br>
Java is even ~worse~ ;(
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	What did you find was more of a problem: memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption, execution speed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or distributed interfaces?
</em><br>
<p>Execution speed was only a problem in one sense: the strict OO nature of
<br>
Java forces you to use design patterns that create a lot of objects all the
<br>
time.  Implementing a similar design in C++ and in Java, and using Hotspot
<br>
to optimize Java, there isn't much speed difference.  But C++ is a larger
<br>
and nastier language, and as a consequence gives you more design flexibility
<br>
to use an object-less, down-and-dirty pure C approach to implementing some
<br>
things, when it's really necessary.  In this sense, sometimes, the optimal
<br>
Java program for solving a problem can be slower than the optimal C++
<br>
program.  Because  in C++ you always have the option to revert to the most
<br>
nasty and efficient type of C when you need to.
<br>
<p>Memory consumption is a really big problem with Java, and there's no way to
<br>
get around it.  You can mitigate it by using object pools and other fancy
<br>
design patterns, but even so, Java uses at least 4 times as much memory as
<br>
C++ for doing the same things.  And that's a comparison with OO C++, not
<br>
with down-and-dirty C written with a view toward memory conservations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even more mature languages only have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java in terms of distributed architectures, so I suspect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while you had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge on your hands with that, it wasn't the limiting factor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about that?
</em><br>
<p>Doing distributed programming in Java is REALLY REALLY NICE.
<br>
<p>The main problem is that Java's obscene memory consumption, combined with
<br>
the 1.2 GB memory limit on every existing JVM, forces you into distributed
<br>
programming when dealing with relatively small datasets (&quot;relatively&quot;
<br>
meaning &quot;relative to all human knowledge&quot; ;).
<br>
<p>There are some other technical issues too.  For instance, RMI is elegant and
<br>
easy to use, but, it wasn't made for high-volume message throughput, and
<br>
this shows sometimes.
<br>
<p>Also, if you need to send messages between machines really fast, the
<br>
serialization/deserialization of objects becomes your main bottleneck --
<br>
it's much slower than sending messages across cables these days.  And
<br>
there's no way to fix this without going inside the JVM.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	Do you mind if I ask a few more questions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	How many machines are we talking about - five, fifty, five hundred?
</em><br>
<p>At most, we're working with about 30 quad-processor PC's (4GB RAM each) for
<br>
the &quot;mind core&quot;, and about 50 ordinary PC's that can sometimes do small bits
<br>
of processing (when their users aren't using them)
<br>
<p>Of course, most of these machines have now been sold off in the bankruptcy
<br>
proceedings ;D
<br>
<p>Now we have a few quads left, and some smaller machines... running in the
<br>
basement of another WM die-hard along with the  mailserver, intranet, etc.
<br>
<p>In practice, we rarely ran a Webmind with more than 7-10 of the quads at
<br>
once
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	How many JVMs did you run on each machine, and how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threads in each JVM?
</em><br>
<p>1-3 JVM's per machine, depending on all sorts of things
<br>
<p>In terms of threads, generally less than half a dozen per process.  We used
<br>
to have an architecture that used more threads than that, but that was
<br>
before we implemented our own internal scheduler.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	You mentioned billions of objects - are you serious about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that? I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked with a system with so many active objects. Rows in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; databases, yes. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for running objects, even in a distributed C++ architecture, I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything like that many. Were they active (Runnable), serving as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data storage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or what?
</em><br>
<p>Millions of nodes, billions of links between them.  All in RAM, on a cluster
<br>
of machines.
<br>
That's what it takes to make an object-oriented mind!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I take it you tried every available JVM?
</em><br>
<p>oh yeah...
