<em>&gt; &gt; This is ~exactly~ the mindset I had a year and a half ago.  Now, after much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; practical experience with large-scale Java, I know better.  Webmind is
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; in different threads.  We studied everything ever written about JVM's and OO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; programming, and used every design pattern known to man, and many new ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We arrived at amazingly efficient design patterns using arrays in tricky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ways to store data (int arrays storing various values accessed through bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; masking), and accessing these through elegant interfaces.  Even so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ultimately, we keep running up against the terrible inefficiency of the JVM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when used for a program of this scale.  I really believe that the JVM simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was never tested/tuned/tweaked on programs of this scale.  C/C++ has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used for really massive and intensive programs before, and is just plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more robust in this regard.
</em><br>
<p>Those of us around before HLLs had real pointers probably used and
<br>
abused most of those tricks back in software prehistory.  If you are
<br>
going to go through that much then why not implement a lot of things in
<br>
C/C++ with nice CORBA interfaces wrapping them?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Thanks for clarifying this. You obviously speak from a great store of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience on the matter. Do you have much experience with C++? If not, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caution you not to be oversold on it: it's not THAT much better, and it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its own issues. If I had a nickel for every hour I spent debugging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multithreading problems in C++, I would have to get a bigger piggy bank.   :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I like C/C++ for good efficient fundamental data structures and
<br>
low-level infrastructure close to the bits.  I despise it for almost
<br>
everything else.  Using Lisp and Scheme with a decent compiler or JIT
<br>
you can get most of the execution efficiency of C/C++.  And you can roll
<br>
your own language environment for your problem domain to your heart's
<br>
content.  Whatever you use a language neutral component framework like
<br>
Corba can keep you from having to settle on one language only for all
<br>
things.  If you are stuck in Java keep in mind that many more AIish and
<br>
other languages have been implemented on top of the JVM now including
<br>
Python, Scheme and Prolog.
