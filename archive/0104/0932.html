Greetings to each and everyone,
<br>
My name is Arona Ndiaye. I'm 28, I'm a software engineer. I'm self taught.
<br>
When I was a teenager I read &quot;The society of the mind&quot; by Marvin Minsky.
<br>
That book was a revelation for me. I've been playing with computers since
<br>
the age of ten. Between age ten and 20 I read a book/day. A lot of those
<br>
books were SF. A year and a half ago (more or less) I found Eliezer's site.
<br>
I read all of it within 2/3 days and I knew that was what I needed to get
<br>
involved with. French happens to be my mother tongue, therefore it is quite
<br>
possible that some of my posts might contain (erroneous) subtle 'variations'
<br>
of the english language. Should that happen, please be so kind as to let me
<br>
know. A few months ago I started applying some of Catai's principles to a
<br>
small AI project I'm busy with. I'm using GAs and GP as well. It's still too
<br>
early for me to have anything interesting to show, however I believe that
<br>
I'm on the right track.
<br>
I've learned a lot and I'm really pleased to be on this list. I'd like to
<br>
thank you all, most kindly...
<br>
<p>Thumbs up to Eli, and the rest of the SingInst crew...
<br>
