<p>I didn't read OMNI when it was in circulation (and not too

comprehend some of the stuff in there by the time it was cancled,

though maybe I've got the timeline wrong), but I, by chance, fell 
<br>
upon a few free copies a few years back.  Anyway, it was old stuff 
<br>
from the late 80s and a lot of it, in hind sight, was overestimating 
<br>
the short term futurism.  Anyway, in there were the occasion short

blurb about something that, now, has shown itself to be really 
<br>
important.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that we need an OMNI 
<br>
again to get the general public excited and sneak in the important 
<br>
stuff, even if just by accident, so that we will have a group of 
<br>
people who will cheerlead the Singularity, even if they can't really 
<br>
do much serious thinking about it.  These people aren't interesting 
<br>
now, but would be useful when we have to face the 'masses' and deal 
<br>
with any fanatically negative reactions (I doubt that this will 
<br>
happen in America, where the public has become wiser about advances 
<br>
in technology than in other countries (I make this statement not 
<br>
without having thought about it, but backing it up is an essay that I 
<br>
am still working on), but other places are less likely to accept the 
<br>
Singularity as easily).
<br>
<p>Maybe the best way to do it is with a Web site, since it has wider 
<br>
exposure than TV and magazines (well, at least to the audience that 
<br>
were after).  I know, let's take over Slashdot's Jon Katz and use him 
<br>
to start spreading the approriate memes.  And, it's not like we'll 
<br>
get a negative reaction to the Singularity, since everyone will be 
<br>
too busy flaming Katz.  ;-D
