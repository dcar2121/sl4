<p>I object to the phrasing of this sentence.  It should say:  &quot;The rub is
<br>
that it might wipe out all biological sentients, by accident or on
<br>
purpose.&quot;  Otherwise it looks like you're proposing a Devil's Contract
<br>
definitional problem, which is only one single type of possible failure,
<br>
and not necessarily even a very worrying one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or we might find that the Sysop no matter how wise and benevolent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparent intolerable for the types of creatures we are but be unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to choose differently.
</em><br>
<p>Well, then, I guess the challenge lies in creating a Friendly AI that
<br>
doesn't like intolerability.  Your statement also implicitly assumes that
<br>
less frustration exists in a Sysop-free Universe, which doesn't
<br>
necessarily follow; the next most probable alternative to a Sysop might be
<br>
imprisonment within a less benevolent entity.  If a nonSysop scenario is
<br>
both desirable and temporally stable, then it still looks to me like
<br>
you'll need a superintelligent, Friendly, Transition Guide as a means of
<br>
getting there without any single human upload taking over until there's a
<br>
stable base population.  Friendly AI is still the best tactic in either
<br>
case.

<p><em>&gt; We are spinning the barrel and pulling the trigger in a cosmic game of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Where do you get *that* set of Bayesian priors from?  Not that it makes
<br>
much of a difference, I suppose; all that counts are the proportional
<br>
qualities of the empty chambers, not how many empty chambers there are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we &quot;win&quot; we either are set for all eternity or

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>One, all we need is the conviction that (a) time is running out and (b)
<br>
the conviction that building the SI is better than any other perceived
<br>
course of action.  Certainty is a luxury if you live in a burning house.
<br>
<p>Two, I am very, very damn sure.
