<p>You know, a few more comments like this and I really will blow my stack. 
<br>
(In my personal rather than my moderator's capacity, however, because I
<br>
KNOW DAMN WELL WHAT ABUSE OF POWER IS AND I DON'T DO IT.  Ahem.)  Anyway,
<br>
this last comment crosses the thin line between skepticism and living in
<br>
your own private reality.  For the love of Nebraska, what the hell have we
<br>
been discussing on this list for the last three months?  Basketball? 
<br>
NOBODY is proposing reprogramming ANYONE.  This is some kind of sick
<br>
Orwellian fantasy that has not one damn thing to do with Friendly AI in
<br>
any form.
<br>
<p>Now, if someone hears about the Sysop Scenario and induces that we are
<br>
proposing an Orwellian mind-reprogramming scenario because we think it's
<br>
for the best, then they have made a mistaken deduction and are now
<br>
&quot;misinformed&quot;.  If they spend a few months on this list and STILL haven't
<br>
caught on to the fact that we are not proposing anything remotely like
<br>
this, they are now guilty of &quot;aggravated cluelessness&quot;, where &quot;aggravated&quot;
<br>
indicates that the initial misapprehension is now being supported by
<br>
emotional hostility.
<br>
<p>I now understand the fact that induction of an Orwellian scenario tends to
<br>
lead to perseverant hostility, and that it is my duty as an evangelist to
<br>
avoid triggering this chain of causality in the future.  However, the fact
<br>
remains that you appear to have decided that we are advancing some
<br>
proposal TOTALLY UNRELATED to any proposal which we are, in fact,
<br>
advancing, and you are offering criticism on that basis; that is to say,
<br>
you are advancing criticism of a proposal which exists only in your
<br>
imagination and the paranoid fantasies of Hollywood writers.  The
<br>
probability that your criticism will be useful or relevant to our ACTUAL
<br>
PROPOSAL thus effectively approaches zero.
<br>
<p>If you want to read through Friendly AI, look at the ACTUAL ACTIONS WE ARE
<br>
PROPOSING, and then explain how they will backfire in some specific way,
<br>
that's one thing.  Right now, you are just making stuff up and saying we
<br>
plan to do it.
