<em>&gt; In my observation, the increasing speed of technological change is causing

</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon is itself being widely recognized, and causing a bifurcation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushing business people into two camps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are those that recognize we are less and less able to make credible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long term plans and try to understand and respond to this in their own way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Brand, Moore, etc.). These &quot;business futurists&quot; are ripe to understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity.  Then there are others who remain entrained within the vortex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and feel they can't really afford much time to think about these things. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even this latter camp acknowledges, ever more each day, that the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planning environment is disturbing to say the least. And these individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also looking for emergent trends to make sense of what's happening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That clicks. And it confirms for me that these upcoming Singularity books,
<br>
especially the Kurzweil one (since I hold that it will likely get some
<br>
serious publicity) should effectively pick many of those ripe business
<br>
futurists into the Singularity basket, along with a growing number of the
<br>
harried &quot;everyday workers&quot;. I wish I knew when these books were going to
<br>
hit the street. If you don't mind me asking, how's yours coming along John?
