Hi everybody,
<br>
<p>After two messages I guess I should send a JOIN message. :-)
<br>
<p>Well, I'm a twenty-one years old computer science student at Universidade
<br>
Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, graduating this semester. I've
<br>
been around computers since I was ten (started with an uncle's Apple II I
<br>
found gathering dust in a closet). Also I've always had an interest in
<br>
Mathematics (I was already studying trigonometry and basic calculus when I
<br>
was nine years old). But when the time came for me to choose a major I took
<br>
Computer Science, where I thought I would apply all my skills with abstract
<br>
thought and problem solving in something useful. :-)
<br>
<p>And how did I get interested in AI? Well, the first Science Fiction I came
<br>
against was Arthur Clarke's... so the first time I saw HAL I was fascinated.
<br>
Could computers ever do that? Could they ever be as intelligent as us? These
<br>
were questions I hoped I could have an answer! But other matters sidetracked
<br>
me through most of my undergraduate studies, so AI faded into background. I
<br>
don't regret it! I've picked other interests that are probably very
<br>
important, too, Distributed Systems and Programming Languages. Got a taste
<br>
of academic life, too, as a research student.
<br>
<p>Then, four months ago, while taking AI class (just basic stuff: search
<br>
trees, LISP, Prolog, Minimax, this stuff..., but what a coincidence :-) ) I
<br>
came across &quot;The Singularity&quot;. Well, it seemed pretty far-fetched (after
<br>
all, AI was still just a distant dream of computer scientists for me), but
<br>
plausible after AI came. I decided to subscribe to this list to check it
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>A couple months later I stumbled into Webmind. Now this was something! They
<br>
had actual code, it seemed! I tried to understand the pages at Webmind
<br>
Inc.'s website, but they were a little vague (for a computer scientist, at
<br>
least :-) ). Since then I've started reading Ben Goertzel's books (thanks
<br>
for putting then online, Ben, I will sure buy &quot;From Complexity to
<br>
Creativity&quot; as soon as I have the money!), trying to piece this puzzle,
<br>
while of course monitoring Eliezer's work. I hope I can contribute after
<br>
graduation! Maybe with Webmind, now that I know it has a pretty large
<br>
brazilian team in Belo Horizonte! (I may be living there next semester)
<br>
<p>I don't take the singularity as 100% certain in the near future, but just
<br>
human-level AI will make me very happy, and if I can do anything to help I
<br>
most certainly will!
<br>
<p>Well, that was pretty long. :-) Before Eliezer gets worried, I've already
<br>
read all the list archives, so won't be asking any questions already
<br>
answered. And will try to post only when I'm absolutely sure of what I am
<br>
writing.
<br>
<p>Fabio Mascarenhas
