<em>&gt;These plans of action seem eminently, sensible, as long as you take into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;account the notion that it may be upended, perhaps, by a crack, team of AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tweakers, from Brazil or Bollywood; beating you to the punch. That always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible with new inventions, such as Bell's telephone being patented, just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few hours before some other inventor brought in the same invention.
</em><br>
<p><p>Just for trivia's sake, Bell was the third man to invent the telephone. The 
<br>
first man (can't recall the names offhand) didn't think the invention had 
<br>
any use, but the second man and Bell did. The second however, acted as if he 
<br>
had all the time in the world, while Bell, who had actually only developed a 
<br>
model from the knowledge of the first man's invention, worked days and 
<br>
nights, skipped meals, etc, to get his done, and finish all the paperwork 
<br>
ASAP. So even though the second man had invented his phone well before Bell, 
<br>
Bell's patent application reached the patent office three hours prior to the 
<br>
other and so received the rights.
<br>
<p>This &quot;crack team&quot; may well be out there--working on a shoestring budget or 
<br>
none at all, reading and squeezing every last bit of information and ideas 
<br>
from our resources, and working around the clock to get results...just so 
<br>
they can be first.
<br>
<p><p>and friendliness may not be a issue for them.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>just $.02
