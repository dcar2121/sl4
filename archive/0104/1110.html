<p>
Obviously, this is an issue about which I have a great deal of practical
<br>
experience
<br>
<p>I'll just  make a few points, gained from 3 years doing AI development
<br>
experience in Java
<br>
<p>Firstly, development is clearly faster in Java than in C/C++.  Not having to
<br>
debug malloc() errors is nice.
<br>
<p>Java, if you use HotSpot, is no slower than C++.  It is surely still slower
<br>
than a speed-optimized C program, but not by an order of magnitude
<br>
<p>A Java program uses about 4 times as much memory as a comparable C++
<br>
program.  There's not much you can do about this.  Also, all current JVM's
<br>
on all current OS's are limited to about 1.2 GB of RAM per Java process.
<br>
(Sun promises a 64-bit JVM, someday, but, well...).  So, if you want an AI
<br>
program with a lot of data in it, and you want to use Java, you're pushed to
<br>
deal with distributed processing pretty early in your work.  Distributed
<br>
processing, however, slows down processing a lot.  With a lot of work, we
<br>
got the performance of a distributed system in the range of 5-10 times
<br>
slower than that of a comparable 1-JVM system with the same amount of data.
<br>
The bottleneck turns out to be, not the actual network bandwidth, but the
<br>
time required for Java to serialize/deserialize objects.  One can minimize
<br>
this by overriding the readObject() and writeObject() methods [custom
<br>
serialization], but this has limited value, unfortunately.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, garbage collection in existing JVM's is fantastically
<br>
inefficient for programs creating billions of objects.  It seems that the
<br>
JVM is not tuned for truly large-scale applications.
<br>
<p>And, there are no existing Java profilers that will profile a large-scale,
<br>
multi-threaded Java system.  Quite literally, they all crash when applied to
<br>
such a program.  For this reason we have created our own Java profiler. [The
<br>
reason the commercial profilers crash is that they try to report all events
<br>
in the program to their GUI's, and the Java GUI tools are not able to deal
<br>
with such a high volume of data.  Our profiler just saves events in a log
<br>
file, which avoids the problem.]
<br>
<p>There are also no adequate debuggers in Java, when one is creating a
<br>
large-scale software system.
<br>
<p>Finally, there are not as many useful 'peripheral' software tools in Java as
<br>
in C++.  To take a random example that's come up in my own work, graph
<br>
visualization toolkits in java are vastly worse than those in C++.  Advanced
<br>
math libraries are harder to come by.  Etc.
<br>
<p>The  main practical problem we've found using Java, then, is this.  Using
<br>
Java, we created a system that uses so much memory that we were pushed to
<br>
work with distributed processing very early on.  Distributed computing is a
<br>
whole science unto itself, which we've mastered, but it took a lot of time.
<br>
No one had ever built a really adequate Java distributed computing framework
<br>
before we did.  (I'm aware of things like JINI and Voyager, but they all
<br>
have pretty dire shortcomings.)  Next, because of requiring distributed
<br>
processing to do anything involving large volumes of data, we have a system
<br>
that's pretty hard to fiddle around with, due to the slowness of the system
<br>
and its multi-machine nature.  But the nature of a complex AI system is that
<br>
it does require a lot of informal adjustment and experimentation by the
<br>
human programmer.  (Sure, maybe you can come up with a simple panacea for
<br>
artificial thought that doesn't require any experimentation to &quot;get right.&quot;
<br>
If so, you'll be doing a lot better than evolution did -- evolution spent
<br>
millions of years doing adjustment and parameter tuning.)
<br>
<p>What a few of us are doing now is taking the most essential aspects of the
<br>
system and re-coding them in C in a very simple and specialized way.  We're
<br>
not dealing with distributed processing in this experimental version yet.
<br>
We just want a simple system in which we can play around with the
<br>
interaction of the various AI components of the system, freely and easily.
<br>
In a couple months we'll deal with the reintegration of this into the main
<br>
codebase, using JNI, which works very nicely BTW.
<br>
<p>In sum, I'd highly recommend Java for small-scale engineering projects.
<br>
It's a fun language to work with.  But for large-scale projects (meaning,
<br>
systems that will use a lot of memory and a lot of threads), my advice is to
<br>
stick with C/C++.  Java is just not tuned for such projects, and you run
<br>
into a hell of a lot of annoying problems that waste a huge amount of time
<br>
and effort, far outweighing the savings in programming time.
<br>
<p>LISP is a nice language too, and there are some fast LISPs.  But in
<br>
large-scale use cases, they have the same garbage collection inefficiency
<br>
problems as current JVM's.
<br>
<p>Even if your artificial brain consists of 100 lines of code because your
<br>
theory of mind is so beautiful, it's still going to need to use up all
<br>
available RAM, and it's still going to want to use multiple processors when
<br>
available (i.e. multiple threads).  You'll still have a large-scale program,
<br>
for which Java will cause memory bloat, forcing you use distributed
<br>
processing, which will turn your 100 lines of code into many more, which
<br>
will mean you'll need a profiler and debugger, which don't work for
<br>
large-scale programs like yours, blah blah blah ... you get the picture.
