<p>
To the list I ask: if for instance Wired magazine wanted to do a large
<br>
article about SIAI in the near future, complete with cover image of
<br>
Eliezer with a quote &quot;This 21 year old cognitive scientist is building an
<br>
AI that will end the world as we know it&quot; do you think that would accelerate
<br>
our plans or hurt them? Assume that besides talking about Eliezer and our
<br>
plans, it also presents FAI as the answer to Bill Joy's AI concerns.
<br>
<p>That probably is not how we would want to come across in an important
<br>
article, but it might be how it would be presented by a magazine like Wired.
<br>
<p>You have to consider on the plus side that more people find out about us, and
<br>
that we would likely be able to get more funding. On the downside, it might
<br>
start a public backlash of unknown proportions. Or it might not; most people
<br>
might do what they did re: Bill Joy and either say it won't happen, or that
<br>
there is nothing they can do about AI so at least we are the best ones to
<br>
do it.

<em>&gt; I have to agree with this.  It wouldn't halt the advance of time, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would effectively put an end to the possibility of the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurring &quot;in a calm and orderly fashion&quot;.  If the Singularity still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred due to Friendly AI, it might be an underground network of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers working through Freenet (civil disobedience), some incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensible military researcher who pushed his project into the use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Friendly AI&quot; semantics (government exception), and so on.  If not, things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degenerate into more chaotic and catastrophic scenarios; nanotech followed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by someone getting a few hours of time on a nanocomputer, the Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaching the point of supersaturation where spontaneous emergence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, nanotechnological warfare, and so on.
