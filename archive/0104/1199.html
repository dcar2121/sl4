<p>Can't the SI redesign some of its components in ways that you don't
<br>
necessarily follow?  There is a limit to how much complexity humans can
<br>
handle that the SI would soon go beyond.  Even without a self-improving
<br>
SI
<br>
at work, humans quite often design and implement software systems that
<br>
they in practice do not understand nearly as well as they thought they
<br>
did or would. 
<br>
<p>Complex systems tend to grow increasingly opaque even when not
<br>
self-improved or evolving.  At some point, usually quite early, the why
<br>
of a system's behavior cannot be usefully deduced from modeling how its
<br>
components work.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If a system is nonmodular, you can only test system-level behaviors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than being able to test the components.  Whatever component level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is designed by GAs (don't you mean EP or EC?) will not be able to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broken down further.  If you evolved a module, good luck checking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preconditions and postconditions on individual functions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If the code is self-modifying then you may not long even know what the
<br>
individual functions are, much less what their pre- and post-conditions
<br>
have become. 
<br>
<p>Even if it is modular and not dynamically self-modifying,  the
<br>
interactions between the modules can be extremely complex and nearly
<br>
impossible to model well.  It is one of those areas of CS where there is
<br>
some theoretical work but not a lot that has been cast into actual
<br>
working tools.  
<br>
<p>At what level do you model your modules at, along what dimension[s] are
<br>
they decomposed and at what level are pre/post-conditions expressed? 
<br>
Most systems are decomposed along a single dimension and other
<br>
dimensions such as internal represensations and data structures is
<br>
hidden behind the exposed dimension's API.  This is bad if your
<br>
particular application for that component requires a different internal
<br>
representation in order to be efficient and not require a bunch of
<br>
really ugly hackery to work at all.  Rewrites of internal implementation
<br>
details and/or exposing orthogonal APIs for controlling the internals
<br>
are one of the ways modules get optimized in running systems.  But the
<br>
entry-exit conditions tend to be bound up to some degree in the
<br>
representation.  So there is a second-level problem in suitably
<br>
modifying those.  Tests based on pre-, post-conditions would also have
<br>
to be evolved for the newly optimized version.   And all of this may
<br>
change from invocation to invocation of the same module depending on the
<br>
needs of the invoking context.  I believe a system could be build to
<br>
change in such a fashion and to self-test but it would be a far stretch
<br>
for me to believe that humans are going to know how to test the result
<br>
in fine-grained function level detail.

<em>&gt; All this applies only to young AIs, of course, but some of your confidence

</em><br>
<p>Well, we have confidence in the acorn because we have seen acorns that
<br>
look roughly like this one produce oak trees roughly like those over
<br>
there often enough.  I don't see how this applies with a brand new kind
<br>
seed for an intelligent self-modifying (beyond what current biological
<br>
systems can do) system such as has never before existed.
