<em>&gt; Does anyone have some kind of inside information about what happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyc?  The project clearly failed massively to achieve its original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals, but they won't admit it and say what went wrong.  I've been to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the website of the corporation that is theoretically selling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cyc.com) and it's full of upbeat propaganda about how wonderful Cyc is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how it'll be real AI any year now, and we can sell it to you now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we won't tell you what it does.  There are also technical papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, none more recent than 1998, and none giving any hint that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything was less than hunkydory.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think this level of criticism and critical speculation is
<br>
justified when you do not have the facts.  Cyc is partially becoming
<br>
Open Source in June.  Personally I think having access to its millions
<br>
of factoids and categories they have could be quite useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be very good for the world to publicly disclose what went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.  Right now any attempt at building real AI gets the response &quot;Oh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yeah?  Why isn't this one going to fail like Cyc?&quot;  The failure of Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; casts a large diffuse cloud of gloom over the entire field.  Disclosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what happened would at least sharpen the edges of the cloud, and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permit future projects to steer around it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  How many software companies in all areas fail for
<br>
each one that really succeeds.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I imagine some combination of Cycorp's desire to make money, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doug Lenat's ego, prevents the acknowledgement and analysis of what went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is beyond what is reasonable and tasteful in my opinion.  Could it
<br>
be simply that the approach did not pay off soon enough or well enough
<br>
or attract enough paying customers to make it a go financially?  There
<br>
is no reasons to cast aspersions on anyone at this point.
