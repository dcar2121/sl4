<p>
I'd like to discuss the idea of an economic crossover
<br>
in processor power.
<br>
<p>In agriculture and industry, machines have replaced
<br>
muscle power when the machine+ operator can do the 
<br>
work cheaper.  For example, a backhoe plus operator
<br>
costs $40 per hour to run, and does something like
<br>
20 times as much work as a man with a shovel.  In
<br>
the US, you can't hire manual diggers for $2/hr,
<br>
so the backhoe option is cheaper.  In countries
<br>
where labor is cheap ($2/hr for backhoe operator
<br>
and $1/hr for manual digger), the comparison
<br>
becomes $32/hr for backhoe to $20/hr for 20 laborers,
<br>
so you continue to do manual ditch digging.
<br>
<p>In the case of my own job, software testing for the
<br>
Space Station, assume that a 3000 Tflop processor
<br>
(i.e. one human brain equivalent by my estimate)
<br>
can automate 95% of my job.  So instead of 20 test
<br>
engineers and one supervisor, you would have just
<br>
the supervisor and a lot of processors.  This is
<br>
analogous to the backhoe example where one operator
<br>
replaces 20 manual laborers.  My salary and benefits
<br>
and overhead is in the range of $120K per year.
<br>
Assume that a processor can run 24x7, and thus
<br>
does the work of 4 humans working 40 hour weeks.
<br>
So the one processor can do $480K per year of
<br>
work.  Assume that you want a 16% return on capital
<br>
(= 6 year payback time).  So you can afford to
<br>
spend $3 million on your processor.  Therefore
<br>
the break-even cost to replace me is $1/Gflop.
<br>
<p>Now, don't think of it as necessarily putting me
<br>
out of a job, but rather augmenting me so I can
<br>
do the work of many engineers.  Even without a
<br>
superintelligent AI, once you can augment an
<br>
engineer and vastly increase his productivity
<br>
for less than it costs to simply hire more engineers,
<br>
you can get a Singularity-type effect.  It might not
<br>
be as dramatic as a pure AI driven singularity.
<br>
The rate of adaption of the operators will limit
<br>
things some.  But it would be some type of knee in
<br>
the curve of 'effective engineering capacity'.
<br>
<p>11 months ago a 60 Gflop Beowulf cluster built with
<br>
Athlon processors ran $640/Gflop.  Today it can
<br>
be built for $335.  That's system cost cut in half
<br>
in a year.  At that rate you hit the $1/Gflop level
<br>
in 2009.  I don't know what level of processor 
<br>
power it would take to replace the average engineer.
<br>
In some areas (spreadsheets, circuit layout) it's
<br>
already happened.  I know as a power Google user,
<br>
I can research a subject vastly faster than I used
<br>
to by having to go to the technical library and
<br>
browsing the shelves, or even tracking down the
<br>
company expert and picking his brains.  The time
<br>
it takes me to learn is the same, but getting the
<br>
info to me is vastly faster.  So I've had productivity
<br>
increases in some areas already.
<br>
<p>I've got this funny feeling that we're already on
<br>
a 1 year doubling time track for processors, and
<br>
as the circuit designers, lithography machine
<br>
designers, etc. get augmented by computer tools, the
<br>
pace will even speed up a bit from that in the next
<br>
decade.
<br>
<p>So I look for an effective singularity point around
<br>
2010.  It's where the curve of overall progress
<br>
in all technical areas takes on the doubling time
<br>
we've seen in the electronics industry.  It's where
<br>
the cost of everything starts dropping like the
<br>
cost of computers.  Maybe it's not the singularity
<br>
in the sense we've used it in the past (where we
<br>
can't see beyond it).  In analogy to black holes,
<br>
it's more like the point at which spacetime begins
<br>
to get seriously warped, rather than the event
<br>
horizon.  In Vinge's fictional terminology, the
<br>
near edge of the Low Beyond, rather than the
<br>
High Beyond.  Maybe one of you can come up with
<br>
a better term.  But it's definitely an inflection
<br>
point in the curve of technological progress.
<br>
