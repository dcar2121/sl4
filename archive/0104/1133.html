</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 	I suspect, very much suspect, that you would have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nearly identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; performance problems regardless of what language you used, and if you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spent man-hours debugging malloc(), you wouldn't have gotten so far into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actual AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is ~exactly~ the mindset I had a year and a half ago.  Now, after much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical experience with large-scale Java, I know better.  Webmind is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably the most complex and intensive Java program ever written in terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of having vast numbers of different types of objects on different machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in different threads.  We studied everything ever written about JVM's and OO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming, and used every design pattern known to man, and many new ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We arrived at amazingly efficient design patterns using arrays in tricky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways to store data (int arrays storing various values accessed through bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masking), and accessing these through elegant interfaces.  Even so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately, we keep running up against the terrible inefficiency of the JVM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when used for a program of this scale.  I really believe that the JVM simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was never tested/tuned/tweaked on programs of this scale.  C/C++ has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used for really massive and intensive programs before, and is just plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more robust in this regard.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for clarifying this. You obviously speak from a great store of
<br>
experience on the matter. Do you have much experience with C++? If not, I
<br>
caution you not to be oversold on it: it's not THAT much better, and it has
<br>
its own issues. If I had a nickel for every hour I spent debugging
<br>
multithreading problems in C++, I would have to get a bigger piggy bank.   :)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you find was more of a problem: memory consumption, execution speed,
<br>
or distributed interfaces? Even more mature languages only have a few years on
<br>
Java in terms of distributed architectures, so I suspect that while you had a
<br>
challenge on your hands with that, it wasn't the limiting factor. Am I wrong
<br>
about that?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mind if I ask a few more questions?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many machines are we talking about - five, fifty, five hundred?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many JVMs did you run on each machine, and how many threads in each JVM?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned billions of objects - are you serious about that? I've never
<br>
worked with a system with so many active objects. Rows in databases, yes. But
<br>
for running objects, even in a distributed C++ architecture, I've never seen
<br>
anything like that many. Were they active (Runnable), serving as data storage,
<br>
or what?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Man-hours debugging malloc() suck.  But we've spent numerous man-hours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working around Java's undocumented inefficiencies and limitations, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of adequate debuggers or working profilers, and in the end, we still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't solved the problems.  The solutions are
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them are documented, somewhere - you just have to go look where
<br>
people bash on Java. They can be astoundingly specific, which is often really
<br>
helpful.  :)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I agree, there are always problems with the tools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- give up on java for the performance-intensive, RAM-hogging parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- improve the JVM itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd love to do the latter, we have plenty of ideas for how, but we lack the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources ;p
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the latter would be better, but I understand the resource
<br>
limitation. I take it you tried every available JVM?
