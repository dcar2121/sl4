<p>Hey, give that 11 year old some credit.  When I was that old, I 
<br>
wasn't so stupid as to do things that might upset parents without 
<br>
taking precautions.  Likely, at 11 years old, the Singularity would 
<br>
be such a thing, unless of course the 'kid's' parents were at least 
<br>
Extropians.
<br>
<p>Oh, one more thing.  I don't think that being bright makes one 
<br>
equivilant to a responsible adult; it's being wise.  Of course, by 
<br>
that definition about 99% of the population should still be kids. 
<br>
Wisdom is the key factor in figuring out how to move into the future, 
<br>
not how to make the technology to move into the future (this requires 
<br>
brightness).  At 11 years old, the amont of wisdom a human could have 
<br>
compiled is very limited.  Geez, I look at people many years older 
<br>
than me who haven't obtained much wisdom yet and if they have still 
<br>
need to figure out how to act on it.  I know I have some wisdom, but 
<br>
then I know one day I'll look back and laugh at how sophmoric I used 
<br>
to be.  I do that now in reference to what I may have thought just 6 
<br>
or even 3 months ago!
<br>
<p>In the recent bloom of discussion, I saw plenty of bright comments, 
<br>
but many lacked much wisdom.  I've gotten wiser by learning lots of 
<br>
history, learning form past mistakes, and trying to set myself up to 
<br>
be disillusioned as often as possible, since disillusionment forces 
<br>
me to re think things until I've come up with an idea many times 
<br>
better than my old ones.  Don't wait for it to happen; go do it on 
<br>
purpose!  The list will be a better place for it.
<br>
<p>Now, since I've only been around 18+ years, I have some excuse if I'm 
<br>
sophmoric at times, but many of you have a decade or two on me (or at 
<br>
least that's my guess, unless the list is highly polarized with the 
<br>
late teens/early twenties group), so by all means you should be able 
<br>
to run cricles around me.  Well, start doing it!
<br>
<p>Oh, and sorry for all of the exclimation marks, but I felt like some 
<br>
of those points were really important.  :-)
