</em><br>
<p>Ouch, maybe that is the thorn that keeps pricking me.  I thought this stuff 
<br>
sounded funny, it must be that ultra-liberal slant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; elementary psychology to see that the hatred, the impotent rage would

</em><br>
<p>Yup, especially if their programmed to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; anything that might harm anyone ever.  And how far does this go?  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hateful speech also stopped?   Is this good?  You have beings that do

</em><br>
<p>Oh?  Actually, I always thought that speed was the most destructive forces 
<br>
of all.  The things people say are some of the most unfriendly actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; not do any harm to one another but not because they have grown beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the desire and need to do so but because they have been rendered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incapable of it by the Sysop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well I'm sure they can still go blow up birds and deer if they want.
</em><br>
<p>How awful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This reminds me a crappy movie I saw last night: 6th Day (with Arnie)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Only it was done with 2-hour cloning (including mind transfer), and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people didn't forget anything. Result (according to Hollywood): people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become bad. The one interesting thing about the movie is that it shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what might happen if human cloning is outlawed and goes underground. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bet most people don't get that from the movie though... a better movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for showing the badness of prohibition laws is Traffic.
</em><br>
<p>No disagreement their.  Underground, or horror to even think it, 
<br>
Government, exploitation of these technologies would be the worst.  And 
<br>
considering the budget &amp; resources of the US government, it is rater likely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyway I don't think having people run around scared of death (since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forget about the backup stuff) is a fun Universe. It may produce more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious, responsible people but I think having to be serious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible should go the way of the pre-Singularity era, to the dustbin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of history. Not to say you can't walk around being serious and responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all the time if you want, but being /required/ to do it is not the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation IMO.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, please, people who forget about the backups?  About as likely as people 
<br>
forgetting that they have parents.
<br>
<p>So creating billions of non-serious, irresponsible sentients is your 
<br>
goal?  I think anything that makes people, on average, more serious and 
<br>
especially responsible is a great thing.  Under no circumstances should 
<br>
these two traits go &quot;to the dustbin of history&quot;.  Not to say people 
<br>
shouldn't have fun and enjoy themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There will still be some risks in the post-Singularity era, they just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won't be quite as extreme (unless you want them to be). You will still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do some basic management of your resources, or you could lose it all and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end up with just a very minimal existence. There will likely be some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of economic trade since this will not be a centrally planned economy. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people want to build a huge interstellar ship they will have to raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;material either from trading/amassing it or getting people to donate it.
</em><br>
<p>There is more than enough matter in the system to create several huge 
<br>
interstellar ships per person.
