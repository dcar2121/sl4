<p>I promise to shut up about languages after this. :-)
<br>
<p>How easy Lisp is to read depends on who wrote the program and what you
<br>
are used to.   One of the really good things about Lisp is that it is
<br>
easy to roll a language specific to the problem domain on top of raw
<br>
lisp and use that for most of the coding without giving up a lot of
<br>
efficiency and without losing Lisp's many strengths.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that self-organizing cognition pushes the limits of what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievable with current computers.  (And anyone who knows me, knows that I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely in any given instance to be guilty of overoptimism than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overpessimism... )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But there is no reason whatsoever that Lisp cannot handle anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Java can and then some.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As was pointed out recently on this list, major firms are now pouring tens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of millions of dollars into making Java workable for large-scale, real-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications.  Unless I'm mistaken, the same is not true for LISP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It has already been done largely.  We had optimizing compilers and JITs
<br>
for Lisp better than anything Java has yet or even has on the boards in
<br>
the early 90s. The DoD used to be pretty big behind Lisp as were several
<br>
companies and many academics. Too bad the work isn't made use of more
<br>
today.  We are re-inventing a lot of wheels.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, testing a big Java program when all existing profilers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crash on apps with many threads and copious RAM usage, also sucks... and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumes all the time that was saved programming in Java instead of C....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yeah.  You would pretty well have to write your own if you want to test
<br>
something like this.  Even then you might have trouble or find it quite
<br>
slow as you are already pushing the limits of what fits in a 32-bit
<br>
pointer address space with WebMind it seems.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Certainly.  And you can easily write code to find every usage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition, override and so on of any method as such reflection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; naturally supported.  You could sort of do it in Java if you dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down to class file format and were pretty patient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think you can do what I suggested in Java, even by looking at class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; files.  The values of local method variables during execution are only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contained inside the JVM, in RAM, not in the class files.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, the methods and method calls are more static than that so you
<br>
should be able to find those from the class file structure run through
<br>
one of the Java assembler type tools like Jasmin or part of kawa (which
<br>
is actually a Scheme interpreter on the JVM). 
<br>
<p>OK.  I'll leave posts about languages alone for now as promised. :-)
