</em><br>
<p>My concern with a Sysop is that there is actually an intelligence 
<br>
there.  I realize that, morally, we'll get the same result.  My 
<br>
reason for bringing in the idea of natural morals was to knock out 
<br>
the idea that we needed something intelligent to enforce these 
<br>
morals.  In fact, if we're going to do this, I think it much better 
<br>
to avoid having an intelligence decide on what's moral.  The Sysop 
<br>
could have it's morals changed or, worse yet, it could decide to use 
<br>
different morals in different situations.  Of course, the same could 
<br>
happen in the enforced natural morals scenario, but it would require 
<br>
actually reprogramming the whole system out from under millions of 
<br>
SIs (which I don't think would be an easy task).  That's the problem 
<br>
that I see.  We're putting all our eggs in the Sysop basket and 
<br>
hoping that nothing goes wrong.
<br>
<p>James's compromise has led me to another idea.  Let's have a sandbox 
<br>
for all SIs to live in until they seem to be Friendly (I still 
<br>
haven't read all of the Friendly paper but I've decided, from what I 
<br>
have, that Friendliness is more or less how SIs should be acting, but 
<br>
the means of enforcement being proposed I disagree with strongly). 
<br>
My guess is that 99+% of the time, we'll get actually Friendly SIs. 
<br>
And, as James wrote, all those folks can take care of the small 
<br>
number of UFSIs and put the in a Sysop controled jail until they 
<br>
really are Friendly (or, as best as the Sysop controlling the jail 
<br>
can tell, actually are).  If they come out and still aren't, then 
<br>
back to jail with them.  If need be, they could live under a Sysop's 
<br>
watch forever.  Jail wouldn't be like it is today, just a change in 
<br>
situation from total freedom to enforced Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Somehow, though, none of this feels new, just put in a different 
<br>
context.  Well, if I'm just being repetetive, just ignore me and I'll 
<br>
know what happened.  After all, no need for a whole extra message 
<br>
just to hear the buzzer.  ;-)
