<em>&gt;&gt; If so it would dump this paradoxical meaningless chore and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; find something better (at least actually possible) to do.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Not necessarily.  Ve might just fulfill whatever of the chore can be
</em><br>
fulfilled.  &quot;Something better&quot; under what criterion? &lt;
<br>
<p>I can think of several things that might seem better to a SI than playing God
<br>
to a bunch of deluded hairless apes. Perhaps spend a few thousand years
<br>
cruising around the galaxy, just to see what is really out there, to give one
<br>
big possibility. Curiosity is certainly a powerful motivator to human-level
<br>
intelligence, its hold will be even stronger as intelligence increases.
<br>
Another example of something better might be the temptation to find a lonely
<br>
planet somewhere, and start your own race of humanoids, to see if  the
<br>
experiment comes to a better end this time. Perhaps this selfish behavior is
<br>
outside the programming of a Friendly AI, but I'm still not so sure that such
<br>
programming will survive the transition to SI status. Perhaps the SI will
<br>
change vis definition of friendliness, at which point I doubt that we will
<br>
have the intellectual horsepower to argue the point.
<br>
<p>This goes back to my earlier concern. I'm still not convinced that
<br>
Friendliness guarantees that a SI is going to let us join in on all the fun.
<br>
I'm  sorry to be so pessimistic on this point, but  it keeps bobbing back up
<br>
to the surface. It is so easy to see how humans screw up so many other
<br>
wonderful things in this world, I find it difficult to see past the
<br>
possibility of screwing this up, as well.
<br>
<p>All that being said, I hope I'm wrong, and this time it all works out. But I
<br>
think it is always important to keep the possibility of failure in mind, if
<br>
only to avoid failure in deed.
<br>
