<p><em>&gt;This attitude is EXACTLY why it is important to explain these ideas to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I strongly disagree. The majority of Europeans are afraid of genetically 
<br>
modified corn. You often hear statements like: &quot;I don't want any genes in my 
<br>
tomatoes!&quot; and other idiotic claims. The anti-technology-movement is on the 
<br>
rise, and even several scientists say that human cloning is evil.
<br>
<p>All in all: most people are afraid of strange new technologies that threaten 
<br>
old world views.
<br>
<p>What we are planning on this list is to create a machine that will literally 
<br>
take over the world.
<br>
Do you really expect the general population to like this idea? I think not. 
<br>
We are talking about The End of the World As We Know It.
<br>
I expect about 99+ % of the population to be opposed.
<br>
<p>In this context, &quot;explaining these ideas to laypeople&quot; is not very desirable 
<br>
IMO. The less the general public knows, the more likely we are about to 
<br>
reach Singularity. We don't need a huge number of followers. We only need a 
<br>
few brilliant programmers.
<br>
<p>The best course of action would be that we do not talk openly at all. We set 
<br>
up a AI-company (without Singularity in the name) like Eli outlined in PtS, 
<br>
and funnel &quot;R&amp;D&quot;-money to seed AI -research. The only people that need to 
<br>
now are the wealthy investors (Maybe not even them if the company is 
<br>
successful).
<br>
However, with &quot;media-horny&quot; people like Moravec, de Garis and Kurzweil it 
<br>
may be hard to keep the proverbial lid on. And, since SIAI has a public 
<br>
website, I guess that the SIAI-people don't plan on going underground 
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>The reason why we are not under attack by angry mobs at the moment is 
<br>
probably that
<br>
1) Most people (the Media) don't know about it.
<br>
2) Those who do think we are crazy.
<br>
<p>If the media starts to take the issue seriously, I think we are going to be 
<br>
in big trouble.
<br>
<p>Hopefully, we will maybe see a big debate about genetic modification of 
<br>
humans that will keep the anti-tech movement off our backs. AI taking over 
<br>
the world might be to far out for most people to consider.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The kind of arrogant attitude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says, &quot;Why should we be obligated to explain our important work to others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they won't understand it in the first place?&quot;, is elitist,
</em><br>
<p>The question should be: &quot;Why should we be obligated to explain our important 
<br>
work to others, when that would likely make them want to kill us (and end 
<br>
our work in the process)?&quot;
<br>
<p>You are free to call me an elitist, since I feel that this decision is best 
<br>
made by the elite (us) than by the uninformed masses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and goes against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very concept of Friendliness that is VITALLY IMPORTANT to the &gt;successful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completion of this little endeavor.
</em><br>
<p>Pragmatically speaking, it is only the AI that needs to be Friendly, not us. 
<br>
However, not informing the public can be seen as an act of Friendliness, 
<br>
since informing them might lead to no Singularity at all, which is the 
<br>
absence of Friendliness.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Making the general public aware of the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scary things that are possible as technology advances so quickly, (such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consequences of out-of-control nanotech) will only help us to reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity, ultimately.
</em><br>
<p>What do you base this on? I feel that it would have the exact opposite 
<br>
effect, as I have explained above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is supposed to help EVERYONE, not just those who got in line first.
</em><br>
<p>Sure thing, they just don't have to know about it in advance.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Elitist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attitudes help no one in this instance, and ultimately may harm &gt;everyone.
</em><br>
<p>As I said above, it could help us, and therefore everyone.
<br>
