<em>&gt; I have a hard time grasping this.  It seems very unlikely to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we're close to the hardware required, for another 5-10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years at a _minimum_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even with expensive supercomputers.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; If you think that hardware that is currently available to you is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful enough for real AI, I hope you'll explain how this can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be.  This was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly the point of my questions last week about Moravec and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil's estimates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and James Rogers had a lot of important and interesting stuff to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of that discussion, though, pointed me in the direction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all that's needed is a couple of years of programming by 30 people.
</em><br>
<p><p>All that discussion was based on comparing the computing power of existing
<br>
machines to the computing power of human brains (as estimated very very
<br>
roughly, since no one really understands how the brain does computation)
<br>
<p>I think this kind of discussion is not all that relevant, although it's
<br>
certainly more interesting than discussing Pamela Anderson's boobs or
<br>
what-not...
<br>
<p>My estimate is based on this.  I have an AI system with about 7 different
<br>
&quot;AI modules&quot; all implemented on the same common dynamic semantic networks,
<br>
itself implemented on a distributed Java agents platform (now becoming a
<br>
mixed Java/C agents platform).
<br>
<p>We had a network of 30 quad-processor PC's with 4GB of RAM each.  Using
<br>
about 3-10 of these (depending on the module), one can get any one of our AI
<br>
modules to do pretty interesting things.  According to our theory of how the
<br>
mind works, when we can run all these modules together, we'll have emergent
<br>
intelligence.  Exactly how smart it will be is hard to tell -- there's not
<br>
really an objective way to compare human and nonhuman intelligence.
<br>
<p>I don't mean to imply that if we had enough machines we'd have a thinking
<br>
machine working.  There are too many parameters in the system and we need to
<br>
tune them all to work well with each other (what we call the &quot;homeostatic
<br>
control&quot; problem).  And our Java system is too slow to let us run all the
<br>
needed parameter tuning experiments.  So as I've discussed we're recoding
<br>
the &quot;cognitive core&quot; of the system in ANSI C at the moment, as an
<br>
experiment, currently a very promising one.
<br>
<p>So, of course, I don't have a convincing proof that I can produce a real AI
<br>
in a year or two with a small team on a practical amount of hardware.  The
<br>
only proof to convince a skeptic would be a complete working system.  But my
<br>
intuition on this is grounded in practical experience with the components of
<br>
an AI system, rather than based on high-level abstract comparisons of
<br>
computers with human brains.
