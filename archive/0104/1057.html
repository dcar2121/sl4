<p>
My own opinion?  AI and human architectures, not to mention developmental
<br>
rates, are so radically different that analogies between hardware are not
<br>
of much use.  As hinted at in the posted dialogue, I think that all the
<br>
vast parallelized caching of the human brain is there because everything
<br>
needs to happen within a handful of serial steps.
<br>
<p>Since I've said that software will be the limiting factor, a more
<br>
interesting question, to me, is how much software is contained in the
<br>
human brain.  My current guess on the decomposition of the human brain
<br>
goes something like this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences, &quot;Columns and Modules&quot;
</em><br>
(written, of course, by William Calvin):
<br>
<p>&quot;The cerebral cortex sits atop the white matter of the brain, its 2mm
<br>
thickness subdivided into about six layers.  Neurons with similar
<br>
interests tend to cluster.  Columns are usually subdivisions at the
<br>
submillimeter scale, and modules are thought to occupy the intermediate
<br>
millimeter scae, between maps and colums.  Empirically, a column is simply
<br>
a submillimeter region where many (but not all) neurons seem to have
<br>
functional properties in common.  They come in two sizes, with separate
<br>
organizational principles.  Minicolumns are about 23-65 um across, and
<br>
there are hundreds of them inside any given 0.4-1.0 mm macrocolumn.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Each cerebral hemisphere has about 52 &quot;areas&quot; distinguished on the basis
<br>
of differences between the thickness of their layers; on average, a human
<br>
cortical area is about half the size of a business card.  Though area 17
<br>
seems to be a consistent functional unit, other areas prove to contain a
<br>
half-dozen distinct physiological subdivisions (&quot;maps&quot;) on the
<br>
half-centimeter scale.&quot;
<br>
<p>[Eliezer's note:  It's called a &quot;map&quot; because connections between maps
<br>
usually preserve topological properties - i.e., if map A is interconnected
<br>
to map B, then neurons near in A are often near in B, and so on.  So the
<br>
default assumption is that maps, wherever they appear, implement some kind
<br>
of sequential processing stages.]
<br>
<p>&quot;It now appears that a column is like a stalk of celery, a vertical bundle
<br>
containing axons and apical dendrites from about 100 neurons (Peters and
<br>
Yilmaz 1993) and their internal microcircuitry.&quot;
<br>
<p>MITECS, &quot;Cerebral Cortex&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;Imagine the crumpled sheet expanded to form a pair of balloons with walls
<br>
2.5 mm thick, each balloon with a diameter of 18 cm and a surface area
<br>
close to 1000 cm^2.  The pair weighs about 500 grams, contains about 2 x
<br>
10^10 cells connecting with each other through some 10^14 synapses, and
<br>
through a total length of about 2 x 10^6 km of nerve fiber...&quot;
<br>
<p>Therefore:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1  neuron
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100  minicolumn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40,000  macrocolumn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(unknown)  module
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32,000,000  map
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000,000  area
<br>
20,000,000,000  cerebral cortex
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1  brain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104  area
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;624  map
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(unknown)  module
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500,000  macrocolumn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000,000  minicolumn
<br>
20,000,000,000  neuron
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ All areas in mm^2 ]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.00001  neuron
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.001    minicolumn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.5      macrocolumn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(unknown)    module
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;400        map
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2,000        area
<br>
200,000        brain
<br>
<p><p>Some minor discrepancies here between the first/second sets of numbers and
<br>
the third, but it works out close enough for Fermi numbers.  Also note
<br>
that this is just the cerebral cortex, not the cerebellum and the limbic
<br>
system and so on.  I'd factor in, e.g., cerebellar chips, but I don't know
<br>
how many of them there are.  So I'll just hope the cerebral cortex is a
<br>
large enough fraction of the brain that the Fermi numbers remain basically
<br>
accurate.
<br>
<p>The &quot;map&quot; and &quot;module&quot; levels seem the most likely targets for
<br>
identification with complex functional adaptation.  Since the module level
<br>
is a hypothesized intermediate level of organization, I don't know how
<br>
many modules there are to a map, how many macrocolumns to a module, and so
<br>
on.  In general, there would appear to be about 800 macrocolumns to a
<br>
map.  Thus, 50 macros/module implies 16 modules/map, and vice versa. 
<br>
Frankly, I'm not sure I believe in the whole &quot;module&quot; theory of
<br>
organization, but it's what I'm working with here.
<br>
<p>If 2% of the genome is useful and 30% of that specifies brain
<br>
organization, the brain would be specified by 20M base pairs, or 5
<br>
megabytes of data.  (Which may seem ridiculous, but remember that the
<br>
whole genome is just 750 megabytes.)  It doesn't seem likely, given
<br>
current theory, that it's 50 megabytes or 500K, so the Fermi numbers look
<br>
about right.  If modules are complex functional adaptations and there are
<br>
40 modules to an map, then this leaves 800 base pairs = 266 amino acids =
<br>
200 bytes per complex functional adaptation.  I'm not much on the
<br>
low-level detail of genetics, so let me know if this doesn't sound right.
<br>
<p>Which leaves us with:
<br>
<p><p>1 mind =
<br>
100 systems; 100 architectural components; 100 problem domains.
<br>
<p>1 system =
<br>
5 or 6 major subsystems.
<br>
<p>1 subsystem =
<br>
40 modules; 40 complex functional adaptations; 40 design components.
<br>
<p>** At this point, repetition begins.  Complex functional adaptations may
<br>
specify an overall architecture that uses some kind of fractal algorithm
<br>
for patterning of the lower levels, followed by self-wiring.  Code is
<br>
written once, then multiply instantiated, possibly self-modified or
<br>
self-adapted, and so on. **
<br>
<p>1 module/component =
<br>
100 macrocolumns; 100 major computational clusters; 100 subtasks.
<br>
<p>1 cluster =
<br>
400 minicolumns; 400 behavioral elements in a cognitive process.
<br>
<p>1 element =
<br>
100 neurons; 20 instructions; 1 low-level procedure invocation.
<br>
<p><p>So if the software in the human brain is vaguely analogous to the software
<br>
needed for AI, 600 major subprojects and 25,000 function points is the
<br>
requirement for coding equivalence (*if* you know *exactly* what you're
<br>
doing).  200,000,000 procedure invocations per hundredth of a subjective
<br>
second is the requirement for human-equivalent intelligence.  Both
<br>
requirements look positively conservative by comparision with the usual
<br>
run of estimates.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the software needed for AI is *not* analogous to the
<br>
software needed for the human brain.  Not even vaguely.  For example, I
<br>
don't think it will actually take 100 different orthogonal systems to
<br>
implement general intelligence; more like 15-40.  I think that any
<br>
analogies, if they exist, are likely to stop at the 15-40 project and
<br>
50-200 subproject level, with the decomposition of the human brain
<br>
providing little guidance on how many function points per subproject or
<br>
how many cognitive elements per cognitive subtask per cognitive
<br>
subprocess.  
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, that's my contribution to the Moravecian quest for crossover
<br>
dates.
