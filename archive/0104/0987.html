<p><em>&gt;Could you ref that, Damien? Last I saw were 14 months, from Kurzweil's

</em><br>
<p>Well &lt; coff, coff &gt;, to quote from the 2001 edition of THE SPIKE (and
<br>
you've all rushed to amazon and bought your copies haven't you? well,
<br>
haven't you?):
<br>
<p>===================================
<br>
<p>Personal computers, however, are still merely early exhibits from the slow
<br>
part of the computing curve. Today's cutting-edge components are not just
<br>
small, they are very, very small. Sooner or later, one is bound to run out
<br>
of profitably accessible space, down there on the etched circuits. Even if
<br>
there's ample unused room at the nano level, will we be able to push the
<br>
atoms around quickly enough, and cheaply enough, to continue our dizzying
<br>
plunge downward into micro- and nano-chip utopia, and upward toward the Spike?
<br>
<p>Salvation from the labs
<br>
<p>Certainly, Hans Moravec assured me. Relax. `The engineers directly involved
<br>
in making ICs [integrated circuits] tend to be pessimistic about future
<br>
progress, because they can see all the problems with the current
<br>
approaches, but are too busy to pay much attention to the far-out
<br>
alternatives in the research labs. As long as the conventional approaches
<br>
continue to be improved, the radical alternatives don't have a competitive
<br>
chance. But, as soon as progress in conventional techniques falters,
<br>
radical alternatives jump ahead, and start a new cycle of refinement. When
<br>
short wavelength ultraviolet is no longer good enough, there are X-ray
<br>
synchrotrons, electron-beams and even scanning tunneling microscopes.
<br>
Existing circuits are still so far from the 3D, quantum electronic
<br>
possibilities already demonstrated in the lab, and the economic incentives
<br>
to keep the race going are so huge, that I see no reason to expect things
<br>
to start to slow down for several decades--and then we have a whole new
<br>
regime, that will make our current time look like the Stone Age. (And if
<br>
chip plants cost ten billion dollars, well, that's partly because they have
<br>
to be so big to make the quantities that the market demands.)'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest news from Moravec is even more astonishing. The Moore's Law
<br>
curve returned to its original doubling-every-year by 1997, according to
<br>
his analysis of computational bang for your buck, and has now swept onward
<br>
into even swifter acceleration.
