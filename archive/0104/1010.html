<p>Well the Playstation 2 did run into supercomputer export law restrictions,
<br>
and is rumored to be used in Iraqi missle guidance systems...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that's what is being claimed.  We are already at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 teraflops with the fastest supercomputers, and there is every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indication that we'll be at 1000 teraflops by 2005.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Moravec's terminology (MIPS), that is that we are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 million MIPS now, and will be at 1 billion MIPS less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5 years.  (A billion million is 1000 trillion.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if Moravec is right and the raw power of the human brain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 million MIPS, then we're getting really close, at least as far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as really expensive supercomputers go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, if Kurzweil is right and the raw power of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain is 20 billion MIPs, then we've got a lot further to go -- 10-15
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years extra, we might suppose.
</em><br>
<p>Actually if those teraflop CPUs from Sony/IBM pan out in 2006, it should
<br>
be possible to build a &quot;Blue Gene 2&quot; that would have around 30 petaflops.
<br>
(a Blue Gene CPU is only 32gflops)
<br>
<p>Or even if not, if Moore's law is doubling at at least 12 months by the
<br>
time Blue Gene is done, then it would only take 4 or 5 years (2011 ish?) to
<br>
get to the 20 petaflops range. I think 20 petaflops by 2010 is pretty
<br>
realistic if the supercomputer curve keeps on the trajectory it has
<br>
been on lately.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wanted to see if anyone knows of any good reasons to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one or the other of them is closer to right.
</em><br>
<p>Most cognitive scientists I hear from seem to think it may not be so much.
<br>
These are the scientists who believe we can understand enough of the human
<br>
brain to be able to simplify it into less computationally intensive
<br>
algorithms. However, I think what is likely is that it will take an
<br>
overshoot of CPU power... because the initial real AI software will not
<br>
be anywhere near perfectly optimized. So the first real success will take
<br>
many times more power than is really absolutely necessary. Which is good
<br>
I guess since it will give the AI plenty of room to improve itself even
<br>
on its starting hardware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OR, maybe Penrose is right, and there are quantum aspects to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition, so we need quantum computers to even come close to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance.  But I don't know of any solid biological or philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to think Penrose is right.
</em><br>
<p>Well lately the progress in quantum computing seems even faster than
<br>
Moore's law, so no worries :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, I'm no expert.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Me either :-) Who IS an expert on this? At this stage everyone has their
<br>
own opinion. It won't be until we get near having a real working AI that
<br>
we will be able to know for sure what it needs. I will be interested to
<br>
see how intelligence scales with how much MIPS/memory is available. In
<br>
the future will we measure intelligence not by IQ but by the size of our
<br>
computing substrate? :-)
