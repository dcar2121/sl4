</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ouch, maybe that is the thorn that keeps pricking me.  I thought this stuff

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't get it, ultra-liberal is something completely different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Anyway I don't think having people run around scared of death (since they

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of history. Not to say you can't walk around being serious and responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all the time if you want, but being /required/ to do it is not the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;situation IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, please, people who forget about the backups?  About as likely as people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forgetting that they have parents.
</em><br>
<p>Are you paying attention? Samantha's whole proposal was that the technology
<br>
would cause the person to forget about the backups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So creating billions of non-serious, irresponsible sentients is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal?  I think anything that makes people, on average, more serious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially responsible is a great thing.  Under no circumstances should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these two traits go &quot;to the dustbin of history&quot;.  Not to say people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't have fun and enjoy themselves.
</em><br>
<p>You clipped off what I said below, that the responsibilities would simply
<br>
be on a different level in the post-Singularity future. Anyway, I don't
<br>
see why being responsible in a post-Singularity future is such a great
<br>
thing that we should strive for. What we should strive for in general is
<br>
removing constraints on the freedom of Citizens. If many of them choose
<br>
to use their newfound freedom from responsibility in a non-serious fashion
<br>
so be it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There will still be some risks in the post-Singularity era, they just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;won't be quite as extreme (unless you want them to be). You will still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to do some basic management of your resources, or you could lose it all and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;end up with just a very minimal existence. There will likely be some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of economic trade since this will not be a centrally planned economy. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people want to build a huge interstellar ship they will have to raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;material either from trading/amassing it or getting people to donate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is more than enough matter in the system to create several huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interstellar ships per person.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on your idea of huge... do you know what a M-brain is (ok, so an
<br>
M-brain is not a ship, but still)?
