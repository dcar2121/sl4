Does anyone have some kind of inside information about what happened to
<br>
Cyc?  The project clearly failed massively to achieve its original
<br>
goals, but they won't admit it and say what went wrong.  I've been to
<br>
the website of the corporation that is theoretically selling it
<br>
(cyc.com) and it's full of upbeat propaganda about how wonderful Cyc is,
<br>
and how it'll be real AI any year now, and we can sell it to you now,
<br>
but we won't tell you what it does.  There are also technical papers
<br>
there, none more recent than 1998, and none giving any hint that
<br>
anything was less than hunkydory.
<br>
<p>It would be very good for the world to publicly disclose what went
<br>
wrong.  Right now any attempt at building real AI gets the response &quot;Oh
<br>
yeah?  Why isn't this one going to fail like Cyc?&quot;  The failure of Cyc
<br>
casts a large diffuse cloud of gloom over the entire field.  Disclosing
<br>
what happened would at least sharpen the edges of the cloud, and perhaps
<br>
permit future projects to steer around it.
<br>
<p>But I imagine some combination of Cycorp's desire to make money, and
<br>
Doug Lenat's ego, prevents the acknowledgement and analysis of what went
<br>
wrong.
<br>
<p>If any of you have anything to contribute, it would be interesting to
<br>
hear what you know.  I hope someone can say &quot;Carl, you dummy!  Lenat's
<br>
paper 'Why Cyc does not appear to work' was on the cover of last month's
<br>
issue of CACM!&quot;
<br>
<p>I found a page (<a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/cycresources.html">http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/cycresources.html</a>) which
<br>
has a section of critiques of Cyc.  They seem to be, variously, reports
<br>
of Cyc not working, and philosophical attacks on Lenat's ideas.  Nothing
<br>
that's really on target.
