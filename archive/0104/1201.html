hi samantha...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am unclear about a couple of things regarding the state of WebMind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though.  It was not clear to me whether y'all are accepting donations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now or whether that needs to wait until some of the upcoming legal stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is out of the way.  It also isn't fully clear to me if companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in some of your technology (super search, document
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorization especially) should be talking with you and/or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trustees (or whatever the right term is) now or should also wait until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the legal smoke clears.  I am not sure what the legalities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or if there is enough of WebMind around and with enough time to pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such possibilities presently.
</em><br>
<p>The legal situation is complex, and yet, I have no choice but to keep moving
<br>
forward on all fronts.
<br>
<p>After talking to our lawyer, a simple summary of the situation is this.  We
<br>
don't ~need~ to wait until the legal smoke clears to do anything.  However,
<br>
there is certainly a greater simplicity in doing so.  The complexity of
<br>
doing one or another thing prior to the legal smoke clearing depends on what
<br>
the thing in question is.
<br>
<p>So my attitude is: Pursue everything.
<br>
<p>If someone wants to use our software, let's talk about it, and see how far
<br>
we can go....  Given the usual length of the sales cycle, chances are the
<br>
legal smoke will clear before anyone gets in a mood to write us a check
<br>
anyway.  If our biggest problem is that we have eager customers who want to
<br>
buy stuff but don't know which legal entity to pay, well, that's a good
<br>
problem to have and I'm sure we can work through it.
<br>
<p>If someone wants to donate money to a &quot;real AI&quot; nonprofit or invest money in
<br>
a Webmind Inc. successor company, let me know.  We may not be able to
<br>
actually take in money until the legal situation is clearer, but, if we have
<br>
ready funding sources who can deposit $$ immediately when the legal
<br>
situation does become clear, we'll be in a vastly better position than if we
<br>
only start pursuing possibilities after the legal situation becomes clear.
<br>
For one thing, it's much easier for me to keep people working unpaid in the
<br>
interim, if there are solid sources of funding waiting in the wings for the
<br>
legal situation to clear up, than if they're just waiting for Godot ...
<br>
<p>As for whether there is enough of Webmind around, this is an interesting
<br>
point.  There is a fair amount of Webmind around in Brazil but that's
<br>
engineering staff not business staff.  In terms of following up business
<br>
connections, it's basically me and Stephan at this point, with a little bit
<br>
of Andy (CEO of Webmind Inc. version 1) as necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, it's clear from this conference and from Kurzweil's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forthcoming book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the Singularity concept is going to seep into the tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next couple years.  I'll be curious to see what it turns into.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will go further than the tech media.  It will soar into general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness, for good or ill.  Time to get those beneficial meme machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cranking.
</em><br>
<p>General awareness is a slippery thing, though...
<br>
<p>For instance, the Global Brain concept has been bouncing around for a while
<br>
in the tech media -- Wired has lampooned it a couple times ... but hasn't
<br>
really pervaded the general awareness.  It's slowly getting there.  In fact,
<br>
the mainstream tech gurus are slowly rediscovering it in all its aspects,
<br>
and taking credit for it, while largely ignoring the old-timers like Joel de
<br>
Rosnay and Val Turchin who wrote about it in the 70's.
<br>
<p>Times are different now, and so I don't think the Singularity's rise to
<br>
popular awareness will be ~quite~ as slow as the Global Brain's.  But I'm
<br>
just pointing you, you can't assume there will be a smooth or rapid movement
<br>
from awareness of the Sing. in a narrow technical/visionary community to a
<br>
broader awareness.
