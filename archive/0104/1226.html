<em>&gt; I don't think it makes sense, economically speaking, to imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some lone researcher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or institute) somewhere will make the major leaps forward needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get to strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI.  Instead, in the years leading up to that, we'll see an ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of investment in it, in all kinds of companies and contexts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are markets for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incresingly intelligent products and services of all kinds, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way up to strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI.
</em><br>
<p>The mistake you're making, in my view, is this.
<br>
<p>Monetizing real AI is an activity that will spread like wildfire.  No doubt
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>But right now, business has absolutely no interest in large-scale AI R&amp;D.
<br>
And nor does the government, and nor does the mainstream of academia.  They
<br>
are interested only in small-scale, specialized AI R&amp;D.
<br>
<p>I believe that my Webmind AI Engine R&amp;D team is 1, at most 2 years away from
<br>
making the major leap forward needed to get from &quot;pre AI&quot; to &quot;real AI.&quot;  If
<br>
we can get the cash from somewhere to keep paying ourselves that is... so
<br>
that I can focus some of my time on building AI rather than begging for
<br>
money ;&gt;
<br>
<p>But even if I'm wrong and we don't do it, I feel pretty confident that it's
<br>
going to be some maverick team making the breakthrough.  Because the big
<br>
institutions are NOT WORKING ON THE PROBLEM, and lots of kooky mavericks
<br>
like us are.
<br>
<p>At the same time, I think that real AI is not a one-man problem.  It's a
<br>
10-30 man problem.  It requires a lot of different types of expertise, and
<br>
it requires a kind of continual objective self-criticism that's harder to
<br>
achieve in an individual than in a group.
<br>
<p>So if it's not taken by me and my team -- because I fail to raise more $$,
<br>
or I'm assassinated by Afgan rebels, or whatever ;p -- I think the next big
<br>
leap will be taken by some similarly sized maverick group.
<br>
<p>OTOH, the next leap after that -- where the real AI becomes significantly
<br>
self-improving through study and application of relevant CS -- this will
<br>
probably be carried out in a much better-funded, larger-scale environment,
<br>
because the real AI itself will attract funding...
