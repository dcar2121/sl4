</em><br>

<p>At least I *thought* I was paying attention.  Ouch, well if the technology 
<br>
forces you to forget about the backups that is bad.  If she was saying that 
<br>
people would just forget about them that is silly.  So I guess we're in 
<br>
agreement on this Brian.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So creating billions of non-serious, irresponsible sentients is your

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;You clipped off what I said below, that the responsibilities would simply
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;see why being responsible in a post-Singularity future is such a great

</em><br>
<em>&gt;so be it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if individuals are truly responsible then they don't need a baby 
<br>
sitter (ie: sysop).  Irresponsible people with super-powers is bad.  In 
<br>
such a world you need simply must have a Sysop or the universe becomes a 
<br>
terrible place to live.  Serious/non-serious is not really important.  You 
<br>
can be non-serious and still be very responsible.  I think responsibility 
<br>
is a key point though.
<br>
<p>I am a very responsible person.  I've never had a baby sitter, and I 
<br>
certainly don't want one after I transcend.  Having to answer to a Sysop is 
<br>
insulting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;There will still be some risks in the post-Singularity era, they just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;won't be quite as extreme (unless you want them to be). You will still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;to do some basic management of your resources, or you could lose it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;end up with just a very minimal existence. There will likely be some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of economic trade since this will not be a centrally planned economy. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;people want to build a huge interstellar ship they will have to raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;material either from trading/amassing it or getting people to donate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is more than enough matter in the system to create several huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interstellar ships per person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Depends on your idea of huge... do you know what a M-brain is (ok, so an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;M-brain is not a ship, but still)?
</em><br>
<p>True.  But even a massively huge ship (as we think of scale today) is 
<br>
nothing.  Now if someone wanted to form a Dyson sphere, or even a Ring 
<br>
World, there is a project that would take at least all of the matter in our 
<br>
solar system.  Actually, this may be a good point to ask a question.
<br>
<p>A Dyson Sphere or Ring World would be an excellent use of matter.  It is 
<br>
very efficient, compared to planets.  However, this would effect everyone 
<br>
in the system.  So let's say out of 5,000,000 people 4,999,000 agree that 
<br>
such a construction be created.  But to 1,000 people this is unfriendly.  I 
<br>
assume the Sysop now stops the whole thing because it is unfriendly to at 
<br>
least on person.
<br>
<p>The Sysop idea keeps setting off my intuitive design alarms as something 
<br>
that just can't work.  If it has to consider the friendliness of every 
<br>
action you end up with 2 huge problems:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Considering friendliness for every other individual for every action 
<br>
is a huge task.  Try to turn a rock into a chain and 2 subjective years 
<br>
later the Sysop says OK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Most things worth doing will be considered unfriendly by 
<br>
someone.  Heck, what we are doing now would be shut down by the Sysop as 
<br>
unfriendly, because I bet at least a quarter of the world population would 
<br>
rather not take this risk.  But even smaller matters, such as exploring the 
<br>
universe.  Many may think it is unfriendly to go star hopping for any 
<br>
number of reasons.
