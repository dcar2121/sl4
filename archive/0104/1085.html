<p>You could release it under a license that strongly discourages, if not

outright disallows, splinter groups.

<p><em>&gt; Actually I've seen that Linux has more bugs reported on Bugtraq than any

<p>Probably the latter.

</em><br>
<p>It depends on the metric you use to define &quot;better.&quot; Right now, there's
<br>
an easier way to get paid for closed-source projects, so it provides
<br>
an incentive for programmers to take that path.
<br>
<p>I don't mean to say you should be pursing one path or another -- I
<br>
haven't thought this through enough -- but I believe your arguments
<br>
against open source are insufficient.

<p><em>&gt; Or allow Saddam Hussein to get his evil AI up and running that much faster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be realistic, real AI is an extremely powerful technology, and our view
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What, do you think that corporate spies or government ones won't
<br>
be able to acquire your code on way or another? If it's that powerful,
<br>
someone will resort to physical violence to get it. Are your principles
<br>
so strong that you would refuse to give up the source if a family member
<br>
were kidnapped and held for ransom?
<br>
<p>If it's that powerful, people will want it. And I daresay they'll get it.
