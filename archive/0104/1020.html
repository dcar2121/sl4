My computer crashed twice while attempting to write this join post. Let's 
<br>
hope any SI is more stable :)
<br>
<p>A brief academic background:
<br>
<p>At 16 I read all of Richard Dawkins' books (Selfish Gene etc) and knew I 
<br>
had to attend Oxford University after attending a lecture by him and taking 
<br>
part in one of his demonstrations in the university natural history museum. 
<br>
What helped me gain entry was that my biology teacher considered such books 
<br>
&quot;too complicated&quot; and that was at a selected entry school so I spent my 
<br>
time between 16 to 18 sleeping during lessons and spending all night 
<br>
reading books.
<br>
<p>My &quot;proper&quot; Oxford education was in biochemistry and biology. I spent the 
<br>
lecture times reading scientific philosophy and systems theory which 
<br>
enabled me to develop a quick way of assessing experimental evidence in 
<br>
research papers. The time saved let me explore other meta subjects such as 
<br>
science history and founding a club on learning how to learn effectively.
<br>
<p>Most of the biology I learned was from the obscure medical museums in 
<br>
London. If normal people knew about them they would probably be shut down 
<br>
due to all the bizarre medical specimens they contain. Who needs science 
<br>
fiction when science itself can be so weird :)
<br>
<p>I'm currently living near the seafront in Brighton which is great for long 
<br>
seaside walks which allows me to get my thoughts about the singularity in 
<br>
order. I really couldn't envisage spending three years on a PhD 
<br>
investigating the effects of one insignificant gene in a fruit fly so I 
<br>
dropped out of academia. Don't get me wrong: I have the greatest of respect 
<br>
for researchers. It is just not for me though.
<br>
<p>Which leads me to my Arctic Fox internet name which I've been using since 
<br>
1993 and kinda got used to. I know it's silly but I don't want people I 
<br>
work with doing a google on my name and instantly finding out about my 
<br>
philosophical interests. I hope using pseudonyms doesn't offend anyone here.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your time,
<br>
<p>Paul
