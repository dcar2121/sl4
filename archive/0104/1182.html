<em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes, oddly enough, the essence of the overall picture is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transmitted by details that are **slightly off** than by truly accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; details.  This is the funky gray area of journalism....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like a euphemism for something--but I don't know what.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intellectual dishonesty comes to mind.
</em><br>
<p>This is why some writers write thinly fictionalized versions of actual
<br>
events.  In a thinly fictionalized version, one can make up fake events that
<br>
reflect the real truth better than the real events!
<br>
<p>However, in the case of Declan's article about Webmind in Wired News, it
<br>
seems to me that some details were fabricated or exaggerated for purely
<br>
sensationalist appeal, distracting from the essence of the story rather than
<br>
accentuating it.
<br>
<p>For instance, he said we were evicted from our offices in New York.  Not
<br>
true.  Actually we're still there, though we're moving our stuff out next
<br>
week, and much of it is out already.  No eviction took place.
<br>
<p>And he referred to staff turning to alcohol and prostitution.  There was
<br>
plenty of drinking going on, which I mentioned in my essay, but in fact
<br>
portions of our staff were ~always~ hearty partiers.  There was one incident
<br>
where a staff member got arrested for supposed solicitation of prostitution
<br>
(he says he wasn't guilty).  But this was a very minor part of it all.  A
<br>
more ~interesting~ human angle to the story has to do with the 10-15 staff
<br>
we brought here on H1-B's who are scrambling to find jobs in a tough job
<br>
market, lest they be deported.  This is a much more major &quot;human aspect&quot; of
<br>
the WM dissolution than &quot;alcohol &amp; prostitution,&quot; and ties in with general
<br>
social &amp; economic trends with which Wired news should be concerned.
<br>
<p>Also, in reporting on the technical aspects of the story, Declan gave the
<br>
incorrect impression that recoding the system in C could speed it up by
<br>
30,000 times.  No.  As I explained to him carefully, this kind of speedup is
<br>
obtained by a combination of a change in programming language and, much more
<br>
significantly, a change in design.
<br>
<p>But I'm not too ticked off by the inaccuracies and peculiar emphases in the
<br>
story, although some others in the company are.  At least he linked the
<br>
story to my own essay on the Webmind Inc. situation, which contains a more
<br>
faithful rendition of what's going on.
<br>
