<em>&gt; &gt;Secrecy, even discussions of it, will increase their fear and distrust of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I quote the above merely because it gave me the spark to think about the below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has there been any serious discussion about making this an open source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project?  Instead of debating how open to be, if/when to hide, etc. maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should consider the exact opposite.  I believe it has many advantages.
</em><br>
<p>Yep we've thought about it
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) It becomes nearly impossible (definitely impractical) to stop the work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since everyone has access to it and could continue to build upon it if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original authors could not continue.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but why bother unless you have to? Perhaps we'll set up a remote
<br>
location with a copy of all our work to be released just in case the
<br>
government cracks down (highly unlikely...) on us. Isn't it sad that we
<br>
even have to worry about such stuff happening?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) It would pull in some of the rogue groups who would go it alone.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how this would help. By releasing our code and ideas we actually
<br>
encourage/help along splinter groups. If we keep the code and ideas more
<br>
private then they have to come and chat with us if they don't want to try
<br>
to reinvent the wheel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Open Source could massively speed up the process.  Instead of having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few coders working on it, thousands or more would be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute.  (with very high quality control, of course)
</em><br>
<p>Actually open source has so far in general proven itself to be a much slower
<br>
method of software development. And it gets worse on larger/more complex
<br>
projects. How many hackers do you think will really be able to contribute
<br>
much to an AI project? Many fewer than can contribute to something like
<br>
Mozilla, and look how slow that thing has gone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Probably the #1 biggest benefit is improved quality.  Open Source in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many ways is the pinnacle of code reviews.  Having so many ideas study the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source would reveal far more errors and problems than an isolated team
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could ever accomplish.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I've seen that Linux has more bugs reported on Bugtraq than any
<br>
other operating system. Is this because it is buggier, or because more
<br>
stuff gets found? Perhaps someday Mozilla will become better than Internet
<br>
Explorer in terms of stability, but for now the closed source approach
<br>
using highly skilled programmers has worked better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) Providing a common, open source Friendly AI system would allow other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups who insist on pursuing this themselves to incorporate your friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tech.
</em><br>
<p>Or allow Saddam Hussein to get his evil AI up and running that much faster.
<br>
To be realistic, real AI is an extremely powerful technology, and our view
<br>
is to not hand it over to people we don't know and trust.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your ultimate goal really is to get to the singularity as soon as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, before a non-friendly singularity can occur I think this is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal path to follow.
</em><br>
<p>We disagree, and would only pursue such a pathway as a last resort.
