<em>&gt; Congratulations on the Wired article Eliezer. Could you expand on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the article quoted below? Have we really got as close as a 5%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of reaching Singularity *today*? Or was that more artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license on their part?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When one researcher booted up a program he hoped would be AI-like,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yudkowsky said he believed there was a 5 percent chance the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Singularity was about to happen and human existence would be forever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changed.
</em><br>
<p>He's talking about Eurisko, the first self-improving AI in the entire
<br>
history of time.  My statement was that Lenat should, at that point in
<br>
history, have evaluated a 5% chance that the thing would go thermonuclear;
<br>
it was, after all, the first mind in all history with access to its own
<br>
source code.  In retrospect, and with what we now know about the
<br>
dead-endedness of classical AI, it's obvious that Eurisko had a 0.1%
<br>
chance, if that, but Lenat had no logical way of knowing that; when he
<br>
booted up Eurisko it was literally the most advanced self-modifying mind
<br>
in history.  Now we know more about how self-modifying minds behave and
<br>
why self-modifying heuristics run out of steam... but we didn't know it
<br>
*then*.  Like I said:  Different rules for &quot;conservative&quot; in Friendly AI
<br>
versus AI in general.
<br>
<p>But I certainly said nothing whatsoever at the time.  Even I didn't know
<br>
about the Singularity when I was four years old, which is when Eurisko was
<br>
booting up.  So marking this down as a failed prediction is a bit
<br>
inaccurate.
<br>
<p>Ah, well, there is still hope in the world...
