Hi Carl,
<br>
<p>Cyc is still around and it still has funding (primarily from the US
<br>
military).  A military project that I am involved with also involves
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Take care,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: Whatever happened to Cyc?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone have some kind of inside information about what happened
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; Cyc?  The project clearly failed massively to achieve its original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals, but they won't admit it and say what went wrong.  I've been to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the website of the corporation that is theoretically selling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cyc.com) and it's full of upbeat propaganda about how wonderful Cyc
</em><br>
is,
<br>
<em>&gt; and how it'll be real AI any year now, and we can sell it to you now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we won't tell you what it does.  There are also technical papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, none more recent than 1998, and none giving any hint that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything was less than hunkydory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be very good for the world to publicly disclose what went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.  Right now any attempt at building real AI gets the response
</em><br>
&quot;Oh
<br>
<em>&gt; yeah?  Why isn't this one going to fail like Cyc?&quot;  The failure of Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; casts a large diffuse cloud of gloom over the entire field.
</em><br>
Disclosing
<br>
<em>&gt; what happened would at least sharpen the edges of the cloud, and
</em><br>
perhaps
<br>
<em>&gt; permit future projects to steer around it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I imagine some combination of Cycorp's desire to make money, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doug Lenat's ego, prevents the acknowledgement and analysis of what
</em><br>
went
<br>
<em>&gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If any of you have anything to contribute, it would be interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear what you know.  I hope someone can say &quot;Carl, you dummy!  Lenat's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper 'Why Cyc does not appear to work' was on the cover of last
</em><br>
month's
<br>
<em>&gt; issue of CACM!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I found a page (<a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/cycresources.html">http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/cycresources.html</a>) which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a section of critiques of Cyc.  They seem to be, variously,
</em><br>
reports
<br>
<em>&gt; of Cyc not working, and philosophical attacks on Lenat's ideas.
</em><br>
Nothing
<br>
<em>&gt; that's really on target.
