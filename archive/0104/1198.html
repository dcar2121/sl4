<p>If a system is opaque, then your lack of knowledge about the underlying
<br>
process means that you know considerably less about whether the observed
<br>
behaviors are probably general or probably specific to whatever was used
<br>
as a test.  To put it another way, a nonopaque system uses testing to
<br>
verify your predictions about the behavior, predictions made using your
<br>
understanding of the underlying causes.  In an opaque,
<br>
non-intelligently-generated system, &quot;testing&quot; is half testing and half
<br>
discovery, so there's more hypothesizing and less verification.
<br>
<p>If a system is nonmodular, you can only test system-level behaviors,
<br>
rather than being able to test the components.  Whatever component level
<br>
is designed by GAs (don't you mean EP or EC?) will not be able to be
<br>
broken down further.  If you evolved a module, good luck checking
<br>
preconditions and postconditions on individual functions.
<br>
<p>All this applies only to young AIs, of course, but some of your confidence
<br>
in the oak tree may depend on your confidence in the acorn.
