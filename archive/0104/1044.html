</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rules.  Eliezer, what do you think about this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This makes sense if, and only if, superintelligent entities are knowably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendly.  If I recall correctly, that's been your premise from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beginning.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have mentioned that before as a possibility.  But I'm not locked 
<br>
into any particular belief since it is way too early to understand the 
<br>
nature of the singularity.
<br>
<p>However, I disagree with your requirement that all entities must be 
<br>
knowably friendly.  Why is this?  What happens if this is not the case?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Calling something &quot;natural morals&quot; really doesn't help the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Either something is desirable (to the speaker, or to humanity), or it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not.  Either something is physically possible, or it's not.  Either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something is physical-plus-Sysop possible, or it's not.  As far as I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tell, Gordon's proposal consists of making unFriendliness physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible.  Is this ontologically possible?  Who knows?  In any case, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fail to see how it *morally* differs from the Sysop scenario in any way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatsoever, except insofar as you and Gordon are still running on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anthropomorphic instincts that distinguish between the case of a Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that does X and a set of physical laws that do exactly the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are getting Gordon and myself mixed up here.  I don't agree 
<br>
with what I believe to be his viewpoint on morals in this context.  What I 
<br>
believe we do both agree on is that a sysop is not necessarily a good idea.
