For a complex
<br>
<em>&gt; combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons, most businessfolks are not of the cast of mind to recognize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance of something like the Singularity.  &quot;Narrowness&quot; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right way to put it ... &quot;pragmatism&quot; is a little better but not quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right either.  Some of you will know what I mean and am not quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying...
</em><br>
<p>Hello Ben,
<br>
<p>Sorry we didn't have time to really talk at the Foresight Gathering. Perhaps
<br>
next year. I've really enjoyed your presentatation and recent emails, and
<br>
think your mostly correct about the above comment, with one caveat.
<br>
<p>In my observation, the increasing speed of technological change is causing
<br>
an ever shortening human planning and attention span. This emergent
<br>
phenomenon is itself being widely recognized, and causing a bifurcation,
<br>
pushing business people into two camps.
<br>
<p>There are those that recognize we are less and less able to make credible
<br>
long term plans and try to understand and respond to this in their own way
<br>
(Brand, Moore, etc.). These &quot;business futurists&quot; are ripe to understand the
<br>
singularity.  Then there are others who remain entrained within the vortex,
<br>
and feel they can't really afford much time to think about these things. But
<br>
even this latter camp acknowledges, ever more each day, that the new
<br>
planning environment is disturbing to say the least. And these individuals
<br>
are also looking for emergent trends to make sense of what's happening.
<br>
<p>So I think we'll see continual inroads of these ideas in coming years,
<br>
whether or not the systems theory behind them is worked out. I hope to play
<br>
a small part in that latter activity.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>John Smart
