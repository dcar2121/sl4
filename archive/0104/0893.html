</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;uses his intelligence to serve mankind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I can't speak for SingInst but as someone who's working towards the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;goal, I'm in it because I see a possible way to do away with death and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;misery once and for all. Although I'm obsessed with AI, I'd switch to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;collecting detergent coupons if that would do any good. Unfortunately it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;doesn't. Building a transhuman AI though does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Of course the rub is that it might end death and misery forever by
<br>
simply wiping out all biological sentients, by accident or on purpose. 
<br>
Or we might find that the Sysop no matter how wise and benevolent and
<br>
transparent intolerable for the types of creatures we are but be unable
<br>
to choose differently.  There are many possible scenarios.  There are
<br>
also many possible scenarios without a Sysop.  In some of them the
<br>
singularity fizzes out through some run of bad luck and human
<br>
incompetence.  In others things along the way multiply human misery a
<br>
lot while reducing it for a few.  In still others enough of us grow up
<br>
to our new powers to create a more viable society better able to deal
<br>
with the exponential ramp.  In others we wipe ourselves out.
<br>
<p>But it is not at all obvious to me that building a transhuman AI is the
<br>
most likely good outcome solution or the most likely to be
<br>
accomplished.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might, yes. I agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;List members do *not* get to define what is evil and what is banished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do some degree we had better or there is little reason to believe this
<br>
thing is actually going to be good and worthwhile to support.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;To eliminate all INVOLUNTARY pain, death, coercion, and stupidity from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Universe.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Plus or minuse a lot of definitions starting with &quot;involuntary&quot;.  On the
<br>
face of it the list looks like eliminating negative effects of actions. 
<br>
To the degree this is so I am not sure the resulting non-transcendent
<br>
beings would ever learn or develop further. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The world by and large hasn't woke up to the facts yet. It's clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;things aren't going to get any better by themselves. I hope you can now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;understand the urgency in our desire to apply a little transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intelligence to the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assure you, I did understand it before. I just don't see the point in idle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation about the actions of eventual SIs. It will do as it pleases. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we manage to program it into Friendliness, it will be Friendly. Maybe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will ignore humans. Maybe it will kill us. I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My interests lie in getting to the Singularity. After that, the SI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling the shots. I don't think that you can plan ahead beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity, and I certainly am not going to. You can do your best in trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to program a Friendly AI, but in the end, the AI will be in charge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Assuming you care about anything other than an ever-increasing
<br>
intellect, exactly what would motivate you to create something that
<br>
quite possibly will destroy everyone and everything else you ever cared
<br>
about including yourself? 
<br>
<p>We are spinning the barrel and pulling the trigger in a cosmic game of
<br>
russian roulette.  The barrel holds thousands of rounds and only a few
<br>
chambers are empty.  If we &quot;win&quot; we either are set for all eternity or
<br>
get the chance to play again some other time. Except that it is the
<br>
entire world and all of us forever that the gun is pointing at.  To do
<br>
that we have to be very, very damn sure that there is no other way
<br>
and/or that this (building the SI) is the best odds we have.
