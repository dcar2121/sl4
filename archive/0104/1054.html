<em>&gt;Are you assuming a &quot;processor core&quot;? Is there an assumption of basically

<p><p>The assumption I made was that AI requires a shared memory model, such that 
<br>
partitioning the memory into any number of pieces would necessarily create 
<br>
a large number of run-time dependencies between the partitions.  If the 
<br>
actual software model can be characterized in this way (and to me it seems 
<br>
it would be), then the effective memory bandwidth/latency becomes the 
<br>
aggregate bandwidth/latency of the interconnects in massively parallel 
<br>
systems.  The exact scaling is dependent on the interconnect topology and 
<br>
the nature of the computational problem (shades of Amdahl's/Gustafson's Law).
<br>
<p>Many (most?) computations scale poorly on massively parallel systems, 
<br>
generally showing strongly sub-linear performance gains.  A few problems 
<br>
actually show super-linear performance gains i.e. 4 processors offer a 
<br>
5-fold performance improvement over a single processor.  The scalability 
<br>
factor of software on massively parallel systems can be reduced to the 
<br>
effective memory bandwidth of the system, which is a complex function of 
<br>
both the software and hardware designs.  Super-linear scalability (which 
<br>
most people's intuition would suggest is impossible) does not seem feasible 
<br>
if you look at hardware or software individually, but manifests itself in 
<br>
the interactions of software with the hardware.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Yes, but obviously, massively parallel processing systems with even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ultra slow memory and processors do work to generate human level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence.  So massively parallel processing systems with several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orders of magnitude faster processors and memory should be able to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orders of magnitude better (minus many engineering difficulties).
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not saying it is impossible, but rather that the interconnect topology 
<br>
of massively parallel silicon is a pathetic joke compared to the 
<br>
brain.  The brain may be computationally slow but it has extraordinary 
<br>
width, *way* more width than we can get with our current interconnect 
<br>
technologies.  Problems are bound by speed or bandwidth, but I think it has 
<br>
been pretty firmly established that computational speed is not the driving 
<br>
factor in intelligence.  Unfortunately, bandwidth hasn't been nearly as 
<br>
forthcoming as speed technologically.
<br>
<p>This has led me to believe that Moore's law is not a significant factor in 
<br>
the advent of an AI driven singularity.  The growth of bandwidth is 
<br>
exponential, but it is doubling at a *much* slower rate than computational 
<br>
speed.
