Hello everybody,
<br>
<p>The note below appeared today in ACM Technews, an electronic newsflash
<br>
received by most ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) members. While
<br>
it's based on the Wired article, it introduces some information not present
<br>
there. Very good, in my opinion.
<br>
<p>About the Alon Halevy's statement (is he the same &quot;well-known researcher&quot;
<br>
cited in the Wired article?), obviously he hasn't read &quot;Friendly AI&quot; nor has
<br>
been involved in the discussions a couple months ago. A &quot;friendly&quot;
<br>
(lowercase f) AI isn't the same as a &quot;Friendly&quot; (uppercase f), that's a
<br>
point Eliezer tries to convey, oh well... at least I can simpathize with
<br>
him, not everyone has the time to thoroughly read a 750K essay, specially
<br>
when it goes against his opinion as an expert in the field.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Making HAL Your Pal&quot;
<br>
Wired News (04/19/01); McCullagh, Declan
<br>
A small band of futurists are predicting that computers will one day design
<br>
themselves rather than be designed by humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky and his
<br>
compatriots at the Singularity Institute argue that humanity needs to design
<br>
frameworks to ensure our safety once technological innovation culminates in
<br>
a computing epiphany--a point they call &quot;Singularity.&quot; In his treatise
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI,&quot; released this week, Yudkowsky gives advice he has mulled over
<br>
for the past 10 years, including policy and design principles that should
<br>
help set the stage for friendly artificial intelligence. However, academics
<br>
are not impressed with the Singularity Institute's predictions. Alon Halevy
<br>
of the University of Washington's computer science department says creating
<br>
AI is such a large task that once it is completed, factoring in benevolence
<br>
will be a relatively easy matter. He says, &quot;The challenges we face are so
<br>
enormous to even get to the point where we can call a system reasonably
<br>
intelligent, that whether they are friendly or not will bill an issue that
<br>
is relatively easy to solve.&quot; Still, Yudkowsky says AI is on the way and
<br>
guidelines need to be set now. He says, &quot;The Singularity Institute is not
<br>
just in the business of predicting it, but creating it and reacting to it.
<br>
If AI doesn't come for another 50 years, then one way of looking at it would
<br>
be that we have 50 years to plan in advance.&quot;
