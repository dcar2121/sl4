<p><p>The stream numbers will be about what you would expect on an average system 
<br>
today judging by the memory architecture (which isn't particularly 
<br>
remarkable speed-wise).  The Blue Gene architecture is highly optimized for 
<br>
extremely parallelizable and computationally intense problems with small 
<br>
data sets.  The 512kByte RAM per processor runs slower than the core and 
<br>
the core caches are pretty small compared to most ordinary CPUs and even 
<br>
many similar DSP offerings by other companies.  The bus is optimized for 
<br>
the architecture but isn't particularly fast; the communication between 
<br>
processors is a good replacement for communication channels like Myrinet, 
<br>
not for true shared memory.  Basically this is a massively parallel number 
<br>
cruncher, and not useful for most classes of problem (such as those that 
<br>
operate on large data sets), which is not surprising since it is intended 
<br>
for protein folding computation.  The aggregate memory doesn't count for 
<br>
much because the communication speed between the million little bits of RAM 
<br>
are simply too slow.  But for protein folding it kicks ass.
<br>
<p>In short, the Blue Gene chip is a fast DSP core that has been optimized for 
<br>
extreme parallel usage.  If you look at the product offerings of DSP 
<br>
leaders such as Texas Instrument and Analog Devices, you will find that 
<br>
they are selling high performance devices today that are strikingly 
<br>
similar, though IBM is trying to take parallelization to a new level.  I 
<br>
would venture a guess that by the time IBM finishes their Blue Gene chip, 
<br>
TI will have a chip that gives very similar results (the TM320C64x series 
<br>
offers 3.2-4.8 GigaOps and 8Mb per processor currently, with an expectation 
<br>
that this will increase substantially over the next year or two).  Analog 
<br>
Devices supports massively parallel communication interconnects that are 
<br>
*very* similar to what IBM is suggesting.  In any case, DSPs are generally 
<br>
unsuitable for general computation work on large data sets, as it is not 
<br>
what they optimized for, otherwise we'd be using these wickedly fast number 
<br>
crunchers on our desktops.
