<p>I really object to this kind of terminology (albeit in my personal, not my
<br>
moderator's, capacity).  This is not a cult, and technophiles are not a
<br>
superior species.  We're all humans here.  We all have the same basic
<br>
underlying hardware.  Humanity may be, de facto, divided up into political
<br>
factions, but I really don't like this (hardware-supported) tendency to
<br>
draw a line from the political factions to implications of superiority and
<br>
inferiority.  If you assume that the masses are stupid, you render
<br>
yourself unable to take advantage of their intelligence.  If you assume
<br>
that the masses are selfish, you render yourself unable to take advantage
<br>
of their altruism.  If you assume that the masses are &quot;the masses&quot;, you
<br>
render yourself unable to plan for different reactions by different
<br>
groups.
<br>
<p>The common assumption by the vast majority of The Media (and particularly
<br>
by the executives of The Media) that people are stupid and that it is
<br>
necessary to pander to them, is probably responsible for more collective
<br>
surface stupidity than the combined sum of all the actual underlying
<br>
stupidity.  There's a very strong human drive to believe yourself
<br>
superior, and that's what's supporting media articles written in
<br>
baby-talk, not any actual demand for baby-talk on the part of the
<br>
readers.  Similarly, one of the strongest negative factors affecting
<br>
modern democracy is the tendency of Congress to pass laws that they think
<br>
will pander to a public - the drive to believe oneself superior means that
<br>
Congress will always believe the public to be dumber than it actually is. 
<br>
It doesn't matter whether or not people are *actually* technophobic if a
<br>
majority of Congress feels superior by deciding that &quot;the masses don't
<br>
like science&quot;.
<br>
<p>Can't you just say that _AI_ is a dumb movie that may have a positive
<br>
memetic effect overall?  Why take cheap shots at the rest of the world?
