</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It would be quite difficult if you are constrained in your notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what friendliness is sufficiently.  If you cannot generally override
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human free will and if you cannot change the nature of human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; directly then you have on your hands a collections of members of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; species who are by nature relatively violent, of limited intellect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prone to various forms of erroneous thinking and not generally terribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tolerant of one another or at least not very tolerant of those much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different from their own general type.  By their nature, left to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves, they are quite likely to destroy themselves.  Hence the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the Sysop in the first place.  The Sysop pulls their fangs as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were by making all their means of doing violence to one another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ineffective.  But how far does this go before the humans are no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human? How far does it go before the result is beings that do not need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to greatly weight their own decisions because the Sysop will not allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the wrong thing to be done anyway.  How about the seething hatreds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well like it or not what most people want is less responsibility, not more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who wants to have to continue worrying about not getting killed, finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough money to be able to eat, etc. etc.? I think worries about this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing are overstated. First off, anyone who wants to should be able to stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth or wherever in their same old body living the same old life. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is forced to upload, or even accept the protections of the Sysop. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old responsibilities can still be yours if you desire them.
</em><br>
<p>I think that misses the point I was getting at.  Either the Sysop ends
<br>
all misery, which is what I thought I heard, or it does not.  If it does
<br>
not then my objection is less important but I am then not so sure what
<br>
the Sysop is to accomplish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is probably a 100% probability that this will lead to billions of Citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading rather &quot;boring&quot; humdrum lives, but is that a bad thing? It's already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that today no matter how much you want to glamorize it. What matters is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each person has the full ability and freedom to pursue whatever level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;interesting life&quot; they want to. It's ultra-libertarianism in a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are born with riches beyond dream, and the Universe responds to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  But after a few millenium of having whatever you want I would not
<br>
be surprised if many chose a lot of forgetfulness and seeming danger in
<br>
order to grow. Only a relative handful will be able to take full
<br>
advantage of the freedom and power that is available at first.  The
<br>
others will have a bit of growing to do. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; various groups for one another that have no means to erupt into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violence?  Where do these animosities go?  I think it is fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well they can email each other nasty notes :-) Or maybe the real extremist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups will renounce their Citizen protections and kill each other off. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect this particular problem to solve itself either through death or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence enhancement or perhaps awe that the world as they knew it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long gone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elementary psychology to see that the hatred, the impotent rage would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get turned toward the Sysop no matter how wonderful it is.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; produces an environment that is not exactly all that healthy for human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings.  The humans are allowed to be part of themselves but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's unhealthy for those few haters 'cause they don't even have the chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to blow anyone else up? Darn. Too bad. Get some backbone Samantha and draw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a line in the sand. Certain things should not be allowed. I think the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast majority of Citizens will be 100% happy with the new world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You are making light of something that is not that easily dismissed.  I
<br>
advise you to reconsider your attitude. I have plenty of &quot;backbone&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything that might harm anyone ever.  And how far does this go?  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hateful speech also stopped?   Is this good?  You have beings that do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speech is probably even freer than in the USA since you don't have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worry about inciting people to riot. I doubt there are any such restrictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, your speech cannot have any real effect on anything except as the
<br>
Sysop wishes it?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not do any harm to one another but not because they have grown beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the desire and need to do so but because they have been rendered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incapable of it by the Sysop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well I'm sure they can still go blow up birds and deer if they want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If so it would dump this paradoxical meaningless chore and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find something better (at least actually possible) to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not necessarily.  Ve might just fulfill whatever of the chore can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fulfilled.  &quot;Something better&quot; under what criterion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Under its own criteria once it thought beyond the box of its early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditioning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually I believe there is a solution to the seeming dilemna.  It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modification of the zoo scenario but with such a twist as to be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different.  The Sysop scans all sentient beings continuously.  So there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are always up to the second (or better) backups of each sentient.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentients can do whatever they wish.  They cannot significantly threaten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Sysop or their backups.  Sentients may be horrible to each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But there is always the chance to learn from and reconsider their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions.  If one is killed then ve reviews the events and issues of vir
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life and decides what to do next.  Options might include between life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; learning and therapy, being incarnated into another life (birth), taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another form and so on.  But one's choices will be proscribed, not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force but by one's own experiences, conditioning and understanding up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that moment toward what one next needs to learn.  Most likely the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life will be one where the between life choice and the fact of backup
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and a longer than life learning process is forgotten.  That too is part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the requirements of growth most of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This reminds me a crappy movie I saw last night: 6th Day (with Arnie)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only it was done with 2-hour cloning (including mind transfer), and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people didn't forget anything. Result (according to Hollywood): people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become bad. The one interesting thing about the movie is that it shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what might happen if human cloning is outlawed and goes underground. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bet most people don't get that from the movie though... a better movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for showing the badness of prohibition laws is Traffic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This movie doesn't have a damn thing to do with what I wrote. This one
<br>
is a non-sequitur. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyway I don't think having people run around scared of death (since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget about the backup stuff) is a fun Universe. It may produce more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious, responsible people but I think having to be serious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible should go the way of the pre-Singularity era, to the dustbin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of history. Not to say you can't walk around being serious and responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the time if you want, but being /required/ to do it is not the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Universe does not have to only be about &quot;fun&quot;.  Or part of the fun
<br>
is that the Universe has well-designed fright houses where you forget
<br>
that is what you are in. :-)  Seriousness and responsibility should go
<br>
away?  Now you have me scared all over again.  It is not like everyone
<br>
will be all dour just to be reasonably concerned and responsible.  But I
<br>
think it is important that beings with godlike powers learn
<br>
responsibility.  Don't you?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There will still be some risks in the post-Singularity era, they just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be quite as extreme (unless you want them to be). You will still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do some basic management of your resources, or you could lose it all and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up with just a very minimal existence. There will likely be some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of economic trade since this will not be a centrally planned economy. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people want to build a huge interstellar ship they will have to raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material either from trading/amassing it or getting people to donate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Responsibilities and concerns will simply move to a new, higher level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That sounds more reasonable. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This resembles what some Eastern religions claim anyway.  However, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is not important.  What is important is that it allows humans to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans and yet survive the experience and grow up to something a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If humans want to stay human they can do that, but most people will likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move up to posthumanity/superintelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When moving up to relative godhood there is even more reason to grow up
<br>
a bit.  The consequences are greater.
