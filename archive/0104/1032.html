</em><br>
<p>Well, flight guidelines do not compare well with morals, agreed.  My point 
<br>
was to show that a simple (unintelligent) system which enforces rules is 
<br>
dangerous, for which I do believe this is a good analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I would also say that Intelligence breaking the &quot;natural morals&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;probably a good thing, on the whole.  Our natural morals are such that we 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;propagate the species.  Well over 90% of the population has probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;never killed anything larger than a mouse; Some would say this is a good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;thing.  We have also created trade, computers, video games, written 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;language, etc.  These are not, strictly speaking, required by our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;morals.  Morals really represent &quot;common sense&quot; most accurately.  They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are not, and should not be, hard and fast rules.  Rather, they are guidelines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a common misunderstand, relating morals too closely with changes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in society.  I don't have the time right now to explain this (I'm sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a hurry but wanted to reply).
</em><br>
<p>The fact is I don't think much of &quot;natural&quot; morals.  Such things, if they 
<br>
can even be said to exist (I disagree with this usage of the term moral), 
<br>
are strictly related to survival.  For example, some species eat each other 
<br>
when food becomes very scarce.  Heck, some species will even eat their own 
<br>
children if given the opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Having a non-intelligent system that enforces morals would be terribly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dangerous for all inside if one or more external SIs existed.  In such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;situation the free SIs could do anything they wished to the SIs in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;moral reality, who would be restrained in protecting themselves.  Without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a Sysop around to help, they would be at the mercy of the external 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;SIs.  Not that I personally love the Sysop scenario, but having a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;non-intelligent system is even worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, this is why I don't want any kind of Sysopish thing at all. So, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guess we agree on the anarchy scenario then?
</em><br>
<p>Guess so.  So far I personally think this is probably the best long-term 
<br>
solution.  The idea that super-intelligent beings need something to enforce 
<br>
their happiness seems unrealistic.  I can se where WE may think we need 
<br>
this, but I don't believe it makes sense on the other side.  As long as 
<br>
their are a population of SIs, I believe they will self-regulate just fine.
<br>
<p>Ah, I may have an interesting compromise.  I do agree that us mere mortals 
<br>
could use something and would be helpless against SIs.  How about if the 
<br>
sysop ONLY enforced happiness towards humans.  Once uploaded, SIs would be 
<br>
free to do as they pleased, as long as they didn't interact with 
<br>
humans.  When they did interact with humans, they would be forced to follow 
<br>
a set of friendly rules.  Humans would also be subject to these friendly 
<br>
rules.  Eliezer, what do you think about this?
