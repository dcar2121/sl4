Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My thinking has evolved a HELL OF A LOT in the period 1997-2000, i.e.
</em><br>
during
<br>
<em>&gt; the time I was working on the WM AI Engine... let alone since 1989-90 when
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; wrote The Structure of Intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not that I've changed my basic philosophy in any way.  I'd say that my 4
</em><br>
cog
<br>
<em>&gt; sci books explored different aspects of the same basic conceptual point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view.  The WM AI Engine incorporates all these aspects, and some other
</em><br>
stuff
<br>
<em>&gt; too...
</em><br>
<p>This is interesting! Has any of this been documented in &quot;Wild Computing&quot;? I
<br>
noticed it's a lot about Webmind in particular, and wondered how much of it
<br>
still holds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Structure of Intelligence -- formalizing what mind and intelligence are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolving Mind -- analogy between mind and evolution, formalization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chaotic Logic -- a formal model of the mind, very abstract and not
</em><br>
directly
<br>
<p>What about the last one, &quot;From Complexity to Creativity&quot;? As the last book
<br>
you wrote before Webmind I guess it's fairly accurate about the beliefs and
<br>
theories you had before actual construction. This is specially of interest
<br>
to me, as I plan to use the psynet and creativity discussions on this book
<br>
for a term paper in my current psychology class.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only AFTER writing all of this stuff, and thus getting a really deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitive feel for the computational and mathematical modeling of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of mind, did I begin really deeply thinking about how to implement
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; mind, how to teach it, etc. ... the stuff dealt with in Digital Intuition.
</em><br>
<p>Of course! No matter how much you design upfront, actual implementation
<br>
reveals much, much more about the problem domain you're addressing. This is
<br>
one of the primaty tenets of Extreme Programming, and something Eliezer
<br>
should be aware of: implementation is far away from a purely mechanical job,
<br>
no matter how much design was done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Looking back, I find those earlier books kind of frustrating to read.  A
</em><br>
lot
<br>
<em>&gt; of vague stuff compared to the clarity with which I see things now.  And
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; first two books have just a hideous number of typos, including some bad
</em><br>
ones
<br>
<em>&gt; in math formulas.  But, that's the way the cookie crumbles....  If I ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have time I'll go back and rewrite them all in light of what I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now...
</em><br>
<p>Please, try to share at least some of this clarity with us right now. Dr.
<br>
Goertzel, I must confess that the more I read about your work on Webmind the
<br>
more I think I should contribute to it after I graduate! :-)
<br>
