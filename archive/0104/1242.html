Hi Brian,
<br>
<p>Your points are very well taken
<br>
<p>I am seriously considering raising funds for 2 separate entities
<br>
<p>-- a nonprofit org dedicated to creating &quot;real AI&quot; by continuing the work on
<br>
the Webmind AI Engine
<br>
<p>I think I can get $$ for this, in a modest amount sufficient to support,
<br>
say, 12 guys in Brazil and 3 in the US.  This should be enough to get the
<br>
system finished within a couple years.
<br>
<p>I note that some of the investors I think I can get, may be too mentally
<br>
conservative to believe in the Singularity, but  may still believe that
<br>
&quot;real AI&quot; research is a cool thing and should be funded
<br>
<p>-- a for-profit company focusing on the existing and proven technology
<br>
components leveraging particular technologies from within the AI ENgine.
<br>
This company of course will use further results as they come out of the real
<br>
AI research group, under some appropriate legal arrangement, but won't fund
<br>
far-reaching AI Dev in itself
<br>
<p><p>I'm suspecting that this bifurcation will make fundraising easier, as
<br>
investors rightly like to see a tight focus in the organizations they invest
<br>
in.
<br>
<p>However, all this will likely have to wait for the bankruptcy court to
<br>
finish doing its business with the existing Webmind Inc., and I'm not sure
<br>
how long that will take... ;(

<p><p><em>&gt; I don't see how anyone that fully internalizes those three items can come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any other conclusions regarding the use of any totally unused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have sitting around. The hard part is getting potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funders to fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internalize/accept these things... some people don't believe a Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can occur, others think it will be bad, and others think that AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too hard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It certainly requires some optimism... SIAI at least is doing its best to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack #2 with our Friendly AI document.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for Webmind you are in a different zone- you are trying to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fund it based on giving them an economic return later on. That approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might actually be harder, except for the fact that you guys already  have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some good demo applications, working code, and even some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue-generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clients. I'm surprised no one so far has been willing to revive it!
