<p>
I've just finished this book and its one of the most enjoyable things
<br>
I've read in a long time. Being a staple of science fiction and the only
<br>
interpretation of quantum mechanics to enter the popular imagination
<br>
it's a little surprising that &quot;The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett&quot; by Peter
<br>
Byrne is the first biography of the originator of that amazing idea.
<br>
Everett certainly had an interesting life, he was a  libertarian and a
<br>
libertine, became a cold warrior who with his top secret clearance was
<br>
comfortable with the idea of megadeath, became wealthy by started one of
<br>
the first successful software companies until alcoholism drove him and
<br>
his company into the ground. Everett died of heart failure in 1982 at
<br>
the age of 51, he was legally drunk at the time. He requested that his
<br>
body be cremated and his ashes thrown into the garbage. And so he was. 
<br>
<p>Byrne had an advantage other potential biographers did not, the
<br>
cooperation of his son Mark, a successful rock musician and composer
<br>
whose music has been featured in such big budget movies as American
<br>
Beauty, Hellboy, Yes Man, all three of the Shrek movies and many others.
<br>
Mark gave Byrne full access to his garage which was full of his father's
<br>
papers that nobody had looked at in decades.   
<br>
<p>Everett was an atheist all his life, after his death Paul Davies, who
<br>
got 1,000,000 pounds for winning the Templeton religion prize, said that
<br>
if true Many Worlds destroyed the anthropic argument for the existence
<br>
of God. Everett would have been delighted. Nevertheless Everett ended up
<br>
going to Catholic University of America near Washington DC.  Although
<br>
Byrne doesn't tell us exactly what was in it, Everett as a freshman
<br>
devised a logical proof against the existence of God. Apparently it was
<br>
good enough that one of his pious professors became very upset and
<br>
depressed with &quot;ontological horror&quot; when he read it. Everett liked the
<br>
professor and felt so guilty he decided not to use it on a person of
<br>
faith again. This story is very atypical of the man, most of the time
<br>
Everett seems to care little for the feelings of others and although
<br>
quite brilliant wasn't exactly lovable. 
<br>
<p>Everett wasn't the only one dissatisfied with the Copenhagen
<br>
Interpretation which insisted the measuring device had to be outside the
<br>
wave function, but he was unlike other dissidents such as Bohm or Cramer
<br>
in that Everett saw no need to add new terms to Schrodinger's Equation
<br>
and thought the equation meant exactly what it said. The only reason
<br>
those extra terms were added was to try to rescue the single universe
<br>
idea, and there was no experimental justification for that. Everett was
<br>
unique in thinking that quantum mechanics gave a description of nature
<br>
that was literally true.
<br>
<p>John Wheeler, Everett's thesis adviser, made him cut out about half the
<br>
stuff in his original 137 page thesis and tone down the language so it
<br>
didn't sound like he thought all those other universes were equally real
<br>
when in fact he did. For example, Wheeler didn't like the word &quot;split&quot;
<br>
and was especially uncomfortable with talk of conscious observers
<br>
splitting, most seriously he made him remove the entire chapter on
<br>
information and probability which today many consider the best part of
<br>
the work. His long thesis was not published until 1973, if that version
<br>
had been published in 1957 instead of the truncated Bowdlerized version
<br>
things would have been different; plenty of people would still have
<br>
disagreed but he would not have been ignored for as long as he was.
<br>
<p>Byrne writes of Everett's views: &quot;the splitting of observers share an
<br>
identity because they stem from a common ancestor, but they also embark
<br>
on different fates in different universes. They experience different
<br>
lifespans, dissimilar events (such as a nuclear war perhaps) and at some
<br>
point are no longer the same person, even though they share certain
<br>
memory records.&quot; Everett says that when a observer splits it is
<br>
meaningless to ask &quot;which of the final observers corresponds to the
<br>
initial one since each possess the total memory of the first&quot; he says it
<br>
is as foolish as asking which amoeba is the original after it splits
<br>
into two. Wheeler made him remove all such talk of amebas from his
<br>
published short thesis.
<br>
<p>Byrne says Everett did not think there were just an astronomically large
<br>
number of other universes but rather an infinite number of them, not
<br>
only that he thought there were a non-denumerable infinite number of
<br>
other worlds. This means that the number of them was larger than the
<br>
infinite set of integers, but Byrne does not make it clear if this means
<br>
they are as numerous as the number of points on a line, or as numerous
<br>
as an even larger infinite set like the set of all possible clock faces,
<br>
or maybe an even larger infinity than that where easy to understand
<br>
examples of that sort of mega-infinite magnitude are hard to come by.
<br>
Neill Graham tried to reformulate the theory so you'd only need a
<br>
countably infinite number of branches and Everett at first liked the
<br>
idea but later rejected it and concluded you couldn't derive probability
<br>
by counting universes. Eventually even Graham seems to have agreed and
<br>
abandoned the idea that the number of universes was so small you could
<br>
count them.
<br>
<p>Taken as a whole Everett's multiverse, where all things happen,
<br>
probability is not a useful concept and everything is deterministic.
<br>
However for observers like us trapped in a single branch of the
<br>
multiverse, observers who do not have access to the entire wave function
<br>
and all the information it contains but only a small sliver of it,
<br>
probability is the best we can do. That probability we see is not part
<br>
of the thing itself but is just a subjective measure of our ignorance.
<br>
<p>Infinity can cause problems in figuring out probability but Everett said
<br>
his theory could calculate what the probability any event could be
<br>
observed in any branch of the multiverse, and it turns out to be the
<br>
Born Rule (discovered by Max Born, grandfather of Olivia Newton John)
<br>
which means the probability of finding a particle at a point is the
<br>
squaring of the amplitude of the Schrodinger Wave function at that
<br>
point. The Born Rule has been shown experimentally to be true but the
<br>
Copenhagen Interpretation just postulates it, Everett said he could
<br>
derive it from his theory it &quot;emerges naturally as a measure of
<br>
probability for observers confined to a single branch (like our
<br>
branch)&quot;. He proved the mathematical consistency of this idea by adding
<br>
up all the probabilities in all the branches of the event happening  and
<br>
getting exactly 100%. Dieter Zeh said Everett may not have rigorously
<br>
derived the Born Rule but did justify it and showed it &quot;as being the
<br>
only reasonable choice for a probability measure if objective reality is
<br>
represented by the universal wave function [Schrodinger's wave
<br>
equation]&quot;. Rigorous proof or not that's more than any other quantum
<br>
interpretation has managed to do.
<br>
<p>Everett wrote to his friend Max Jammer:
<br>
&quot;None of these physicists had grasped what I consider to be the major
<br>
accomplishment of the theory- the &quot;rigorous&quot; deduction of the
<br>
probability interpretation of Quantum Mechanics from wave mechanics
<br>
alone. This deduction is just as &quot;rigorous&quot; as any deductions of
<br>
classical statistical mechanics. [...] What is unique about the choice
<br>
of measure and why it is forced upon one is that in both cases it is the
<br>
only measure that satisfies the law of conservation of probability
<br>
through the equations of motion. Thus logically in both classical
<br>
statistical mechanics and in quantum mechanics, the only possible
<br>
statistical statements depend upon the existence of a unique measure
<br>
which obeys this conservation principle.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Nevertheless some complained that Everett did not use enough rigor in
<br>
his derivation. David Deutsch has helped close that rigor gap. He showed
<br>
that the number of Everett-worlds after a branching is proportional to
<br>
the conventional probability density. He then used Game Theory to show
<br>
that all these are all equally likely to be observed. Everett would
<br>
likely have been delighted as he used Game Theory extensively in his
<br>
other life as a cold warrior. Professor Deutsch gave one of the best
<br>
quotations in the entire book, talking about many worlds as a
<br>
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics &quot;is like talking about dinosaurs as
<br>
an interpretation of the fossil record&quot;.
<br>
<p>Everett was disappointed at the poor reception his doctoral dissertation
<br>
received and never published anything on quantum mechanics again for the
<br>
rest of his life; instead he became a Dr. Strangelove type character
<br>
making computer nuclear war games and doing grim operational research
<br>
for the pentagon about armageddon. He was one of the first to point out
<br>
that any defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles would be
<br>
ineffectual and building an anti-ballistic missile system could not be
<br>
justified except for &quot;political or psychological grounds&quot;. Byrne makes
<br>
the case that Everett was the first one to convince high military
<br>
leaders through mathematics and no nonsense non sentimental reasoning
<br>
that a nuclear war could not be won, &quot;after an attack by either
<br>
superpower on the other, the majority of the attacked population that
<br>
survived the initial blasts would be sterilized and gradually succumb to
<br>
leukemia. Livestock would die quickly and survivors would be forced to
<br>
rely on eating grains potatoes and vegetables. Unfortunately the produce
<br>
would be seething with radioactive Strontium 90 which seeps into human
<br>
bone marrow and causes cancer&quot;. Linus Pauling credited Evert by name and
<br>
quoted from his pessimistic report in his Nobel acceptance speech for
<br>
receiving the 1962 Nobel Peace prize. 
<br>
<p>Despite his knowledge of the horrors of a nuclear war Everett, like most
<br>
of his fellow cold warrior colleagues in the 50's and 60's, thought the
<br>
probability of it happening was very high and would probably happen very
<br>
soon. Byrne speculates in a footnote that Everett may have privately
<br>
used anthropic reasoning and thought that the fact we live in a world
<br>
where such a war has not happened (at least not yet) was more
<br>
confirmation that his Many Worlds idea was right. Incidentally this is
<br>
one of those rare books where the footnotes are almost as much fun to
<br>
read as the main text.  
<br>
<p>Hugh's daughter Liz Everett killed herself a few years after her
<br>
father's death, in her suicide note she said &quot;Funeral requests: I prefer
<br>
no church stuff. Please burn me and DON'T FILE ME. Please sprinkle me in
<br>
some nice body of water or the garbage, maybe that way I'll end up in
<br>
the correct parallel universe to meet up with Daddy&quot;. And so she was.
