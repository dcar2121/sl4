<p>What happens today is that people who lack insight into their mental
<br>
illness and are suffering because of it have treatment forced upon
<br>
them. Mental health services estimate their CEV, and act accordingly.
<br>
If someone does not have a diagnosis of mental illness, on the other
<br>
hand, they are allowed to act self-destructively if that is their
<br>
choice.
<br>
<p>There is a danger that an AI may decide that we are all in a position
<br>
analogous to the insightless mentally ill, with poor judgement on
<br>
account of our relatively low intelligence and primitive drives. I
<br>
would feel much better if the AI did exactly what I wanted. If I
<br>
wanted it to do what it thought some idealised version of me wanted,
<br>
then that is what I would tell it to do. I don't want it guessing that
<br>
an idealised version of me would want it to do what an idealised
<br>
version of me wanted etc.
