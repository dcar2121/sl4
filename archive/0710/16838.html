Very good article Eliezer!
<br>
I would add that saying &quot;life is good and death is bad&quot; is not
<br>
perceived as sophisticated enough by some intellectuals who build
<br>
their careers on empty words.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was once present when William Hurlbut, during a debate with Aubrey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; de Grey, spoke of &quot;the meaning that death gives to life&quot;; Hurlbut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeated the standard claims that life without death would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningless and empty. As I replied during the comments session,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hurlbut had not made a sincere effort to think about what meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality would give to life, on the same order of the effort that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has gone into thinking about &quot;the meaning that death gives to life&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Philosophers have put forth a mighty effort to find nice things to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about death. But this is scant reason to fear lifespan extension, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophers have not put forth an equally motivated effort to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice things about immortality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such is human nature, that if we were all hit on the head with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baseball bat once a week, philosophers would soon discover many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazing benefits of being hit on the head with a baseball bat: It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toughens us, renders us less fearful of lesser pains, makes bat-free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days all the sweeter. But if people are not currently being hit with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baseball bats, they will not volunteer for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modern literature about immortality is written primarily by authors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who expect to die, and their grapes are accordingly sour. Hurlbut, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems, is afraid of living too long. Well, suppose Hurlbut's most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreaded fear materialized, and he was forced to live forever - worse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in good health - worst of all, with his IQ rising at a steady rate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 point per year. What positive aesthetics might Hurlbut find in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inescapable fate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We cannot ask Hurlbut this question today. Today he expects to die,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so he seeks nice things to say about death, and conversely awful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things to say about immortality. But if Hurlbut were sentenced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, he would probably stop tormenting himself by finding terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things to say about his situation, and begin to wonder what nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things he might say instead. Such is human nature, after all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I once discussed death with a woman who said that, because of her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of mortality, whenever she thought of a nice thing to say to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone, she would say it right away; because who knows if they might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not meet again. What a terrible world it would be if we had unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to say nice things to each other! We should run right out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step in front of trucks. Perhaps if we were immortal, this woman would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have remarked on how, whenever you meet a person or deal with them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any fashion, you are bound to meet again someday - thus you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak kindly to them. What a terrible world it would be, if people met
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking they would never meet again! Then why would people tip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriately in out-of-state restaurants? We should run right out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sign up with Alcor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another common excuse for praising death is that it gives us a sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of urgency. Go hang-gliding today, go learn to play the flute today,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for tomorrow may never come. These people must value initiative, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they use it to justify death - what would they say if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortal? Perhaps, &quot;You've got to learn linear algebra eventually -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why not start today?&quot; You're not saving yourself any work by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procrastinating. Isn't that a beautiful thought - that you've got to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn all these things someday, so why not begin now? Such is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning that immortality gives to life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the meaning of humanity's unfolding future, if we are to die,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we are to live? If we are to die, then perhaps the meaning is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - to reverse the words of immortal Gandalf - we are to take thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only for this one generation of the world. We are to bequeath the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world in the best possible state to our children, but not otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meddle in their affairs. But if we are to live, then the future is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern personally, and we shall ourselves reap the fruits of whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we sow. Inescapable responsibility, inescapable consequences. Is this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not equally a call to action?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have met many people who, when I try to tell them of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, say, &quot;But do you really think all this will happen in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifetimes?&quot;, as if the universe ceases to exist beyond the horizon of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their personal deaths. Given what I've actually seen of people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology, if you want anything done about global warming (like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building 1000 nuclear power plants and moving on to real problems),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, yes, you should urge people to sign up for Alcor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What meaning does death, the inevitable termination of existence, give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an effort to be a better person? Perhaps the notion of a virtuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life having a beginning, a middle, and an end; so that it is shaped,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through a finite amount of effort, into having a satisfying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion; and then it is done, finished like a painting, put on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stand and exhibited. What meaning would immortality give to a virtuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life? An unending, unbounded effort; never finished like a painting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never simply exhibited; never flawless, always improving. Is this not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally a beautiful thought? It may even have the advantage of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally scary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But really, both sides of all these arguments fall under the category
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;excuses to be virtuous&quot;, which no one should ever need. As I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarked to the woman, after she said that her mortality leads her to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say nice things to people right away instead of later, &quot;That's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful thought, and even if someday the threat of death is lifted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from you, I hope you go on doing it.&quot; Once you know what virtuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior would help excuse death, or immortality, or whatever, just go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead and do it without need for an excuse. If this essay has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object, it is to demonstrate the ease of finding beautiful thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just about anywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither death, nor immortality, are needed to give meaning to life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life gives meaning to life. The object of friendship is friendship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the object of learning is learning. At most, the particular meanings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that death or immortality would give to an act of life are secondary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shades, fine points of artistry, like the landscape in the background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Mona Lisa's smile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In truth, I suspect that if people were immortal, they would not think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overmuch about the meaning that immortality gives to life. People in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Deaf subculture may ponder the implications of deafness; some Deaf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents even want to ensure that they have deaf children. Yet I rarely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find myself pondering the meaning of hearing - perhaps I should! Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clouds must be searched for silver linings.  Only things unvirtuous of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, must be excused by philosophizing them into excuses for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, someday, the threat of death is lifted from humankind, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only those originally born as Homo sapiens, we who were once mortal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will give thought to the meaning of immortality.
