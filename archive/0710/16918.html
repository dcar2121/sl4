<p>Untrue.
<br>
<p>&quot;The availability heuristic is judging the frequency or probability of
<br>
an event, by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are no examples of humans creating AI. That is all I am basing
<br>
my problem of finding a statistical argument for humans creating AI
<br>
on. I can readily see examples of the event coming to mind, but that
<br>
may not have any basis in its actual probability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are trying to apply it in a way I've called the &quot;absurdity heuristic&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/absurdity-heuri.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/absurdity-heuri.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  I believe that humans creating AI is possible and probable, I
<br>
just want to find statistics that back up my belief. I'm not crying
<br>
absurd, just saying I don't see the statistical argument and evidence
<br>
for my belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also humans are a counterexample.  If it seems to you that the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too magical to be duplicated by ordinary science, or that evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too powerful for human intelligence to match, that's a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate problem; but see also:
</em><br>
<p>What it seems to me is neither here not there, I want cold hard
<br>
evidence for my belief.
<br>
<p>Hmm, human capability vs evolutionary capability, that might be a
<br>
better thing to collect evidence of. The number of things we have
<br>
attempted to create that evolution has also created. This should be a
<br>
better predictor of what humans will invent, rather than the evidence
<br>
of the lack existence of the particular invention, which predicts new
<br>
inventions of that type will never be made.
<br>
<p>However, it doesn't give evidence for believing humans will invent
<br>
things that haven't evolved such as lasers, microwave heating devices,
<br>
strong vacuum MNT or intelligences that alter their own code/hardware
<br>
and then recursively self-improve. So it is not the full answer to
<br>
being able to collect evidence for good hypotheses on what humans can
<br>
create or not.
<br>
<p>It is really a shame there isn't (too my knowledge) a database of
<br>
inventors and their creations and failures, I could run some stats on
<br>
and look for common themes and percentage success rate, create
<br>
hypotheses and crunch some data.
