<em>&gt; Psychiatric treatment is no different to any other service unless it

</em><br>
<p>That's the point I was trying to make.  We seem to discuss mind
<br>
modification in a vacuum, with no basis in the current practice
<br>
(however crude by comparison)
<br>
<p>On another thread I made the mistake of suggesting that inter-arterial
<br>
drug-dispensing bots should be build with a high degree of safety
<br>
protocols.  I was quickly informed that progress is more important
<br>
than vague ideas of safety.  I feel this is why Windows OS still has
<br>
regular exploits and various universities, corporations, an government
<br>
agencies (are forced to) regularly report data theft.
<br>
<p>On this same front, would a software-based intelligence have an active
<br>
defense against invasion from viral infection?  Wouldn't that system
<br>
attempt to prevent researcher initiated changes?  I personally would
<br>
like to have a greater defense against the memes to which I am exposed
<br>
via marketing.  I guess my uploaded self will be even more &quot;paranoid&quot;
<br>
about security because it may be more fragile than my relatively
<br>
disconnected meat-based host.
<br>
<p>&quot;just a thought&quot;
