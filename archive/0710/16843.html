I agree. Not to mention its not that death is good, but that the knowledge
<br>
of impermanence tends to lead to experiencing the moment rather than
<br>
always worry about the future and past. Death is the biggest reminder
<br>
of that, but so are fading childhood memories.
<br>
<p>Technology can't 'fix' impermanence. Death is a sudden big change, but
<br>
even if sudden death goes away, we die bit by bit. Your memories of
<br>
the 1990s would eventually fade to be no more than what you'd read in
<br>
a history book. It would no longer be real to you, your 1990s self
<br>
would be effectively dead.
<br>
<p>There are only so many bits available, to move time forward bits have to 
<br>
be recycled. Your either dead from being recycled, or even more dead
<br>
should that recycling stop, like being frozen in deep space.
