<p><em>&gt;&gt; But a fly has no abilities to override its basic instincts. Hence, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is no purpose to be served by the its experiencing severe pain, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so nature does not provide it the capabililty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There must be a gradient of pain levels in all organisms of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophistication, since even the simplest behaviour might involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing the lesser of two evils.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that the best top pain level for a fly would be the highest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain level that is physically possible,
</em><br>
<p>wow!  Now, still, to clarify with your example, just *why* would nature
<br>
torture a fly when absolutely all that the fly can do is try to escape by
<br>
flapping its wings or shaking its legs?  What is gained?  On the other hand,
<br>
a great deal is gained by tormenting a human:  the human can analyse
<br>
all most endlessly the bad moves that got him into the situation, the
<br>
negotiations with other humans or his environment that might succeed
<br>
in getting him out of it, and potentially endless redesign of his behavior
<br>
or circumstances in order that the situation never recur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; since otherwise there would be pain &quot;compression&quot;, with a lesser ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discriminate between stimuli on the basis of how pleasant or unpleasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand what you mean here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other aspect of it is the unremitting nature of pain. Humans can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively reduce the severity of pain, or suffering in general, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being able to reason about it. The experience of chest pain is worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you think you're having a heart attack than if you can be reassured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's just indigestion.
</em><br>
<p>But I would suppose that humans enhance the default level of pain
<br>
from a heart attack by worrying about it.  That is, people who don't 
<br>
know about such things---small children, say---wouldn't worry and
<br>
so can't think that they're having a heart attack.  What you are 
<br>
pointing out is a meta-level beyond that. In other words, a child
<br>
would feel less pain, and an ordinary adult more, and an adult
<br>
who was capable of reasoning about it the way you suggest.
<br>
<p>Moreover, wouldn't your basic argument here suggest that any small
<br>
insult to my organism be accompanied by all the pain nature can
<br>
inflict?  I say that a small amount of pain has been measured out for
<br>
those things that we relatively safely override.  For example, stubbing
<br>
my toe will not prevent me from perservering in a long march to 
<br>
extracate myself from a deadly desert.  Even with a fly, a slightly
<br>
unpleasant odor won't deter it from certain food.
