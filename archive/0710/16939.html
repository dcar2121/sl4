Subject: Hacking your own motivational and emotional systems, how dangerous?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I look very much forward to the possibility of replacing my Darwinian drives with a more beautiful, consistent, constructive and moral goal system! 
</em><br>
<p><p>I believe the Hierarchy of Motivation, proposed by arguably one of the worlds most famous psychologists, Abraham Maslow,  is a concept that incorporates the &quot;Evolutionary Drives&quot; you refer too, and also the higher moral drives, or goals that can be considered &quot;Beautiful.&quot; i.e. self-actualization, and his revised version, including self-transcendence .
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.. Physiological 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.. Safety 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.. Love/Belonging 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.. Esteem 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5.. Self-actualization 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6.. Self-transcendence
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course you can already do this to a certain level with your own will, reflectivity and discipline. But you can't reach into your own super goal space, of course, since it would not be a good adaption.
</em><br>
<p>His diagrammatic goals system portrays a potential starting point from which to work with (or change) and I suppose it would be hypothetically possible to advance, or strive to complete or focus on one particular drive.  In fact, Carl Rogers' inspiring book On Becoming a Person is notable for describing a potential system in which to help others ascend our motivation system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This relates to AI reflectivity and the friendliness stability issue. But here the question is about multiple minds that already have a human goal system to begin with. 
</em><br>
<p>I believe that concerning the development of AGI, a more clear understanding of the human motivational system could potentially be included into a concept of friendliness.  I base this on the idea that if animals have a basic version of our motivational system, i.e. the establishment of basic survival needs, but not the higher/human portions, such as self-actualization or self-transcendence, then an even higher system may include our motivational system, plus include some higher order goals.  
<br>
<p>What might these higher goals include?  We'll, if our motivational goal-system caps out at self-transcendence, then perhaps thereafter more global goals are aimed for.  For a super-intelligent system, this could include thinking about more then the survival one oneself, and more upon the safety, survival, happiness, of the species as a whole.  (Has a categorization of super-intelligent goal system been subject to recent discussion?)
