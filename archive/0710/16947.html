<p>
I have thought about this concept a lot, in a non-scientific, fictional sort
<br>
of way, and
<br>
even collated some ideas for a book I was thinking about. What I have found,
<br>
in my
<br>
meanderings was that this path is riddled with traps. Like a timetraveller
<br>
making too
<br>
many timestream steps it would be very hard to find back the basic setting -
<br>
plus the
<br>
default human mode would be downright unbearable, so there would be no going
<br>
<p>back at all once you start tinkering.
<br>
<p>It depends largely on how easy, how well-tested the technology, how
<br>
insighful the
<br>
alterations are. If it involves unintuitive modifications of brain chemicals
<br>
and hardwiring
<br>
the results will probably be like wandering a minefield or hacking a Chinese
<br>
system
<br>
without a dictionary.
<br>
<p>The biggest traps i see would be
<br>
- alienation (becoming so strange that interaction with default society
<br>
would be difficult,
<br>
annoying, undesirable, etc.)
<br>
- wirehead (making a change that creates a feedback loop destroying the
<br>
motivational
<br>
system, trapping the subject in an inescapable pleasure feedback loop)
<br>
- system crash (making a change that cascades into causal effects that
<br>
cannot be
<br>
unraveled, easily edited back, or &quot;cured&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Mind hacking the motivational structure of the brain is however something
<br>
that looks
<br>
unavoidable, looking at the course we have set as a species. At some point,
<br>
possibly
<br>
within decades, we will develop tools that have the fine resolution to make
<br>
alterations,
<br>
and no matter how crude the first alterations some people will apply them.
<br>
The first such
<br>
alterations have been applied already, almost industrially crude stimulation
<br>
of the
<br>
pleasure center to treat migraines, depressions or motion system disorders
<br>
and the
<br>
results of that look real good from what I've heard. In some cases you dont
<br>
even have
<br>
to open the skull to apply these early hacks.
<br>
<p>I can envision technology emerging somewhere after 2025, 2035 where minute
<br>
spore
<br>
nanoids can be made to erect a hacking lattice inside the brain itself. That
<br>
is a very
<br>
simplistic analogy of what will happen, but I can envision a mixture of
<br>
selfpropelled
<br>
nano-agents, in the hundredth of micrometers or smaller, very safely
<br>
controlled
<br>
selfreplication, very low on allergy triggering and steered or controlled on
<br>
a very small
<br>
coordinate grid. If you can disperse these things throughout the brain and
<br>
cause them
<br>
to surgically stimulate cells, edit cells or delete cells it *could* slowly
<br>
evolve into a
<br>
hacking mechanism that would allow &quot;private citizens&quot; (as opposed to
<br>
institutions,
<br>
governments, universities) to selfhack, or selfadminister mods.
<br>
<p>Societies will respond no doubt as allergic as ever to citizens entering
<br>
such an arena
<br>
of cognitive liberty. If these technologies start appearing, say, by 2030,
<br>
and society hasn't
<br>
evolved under effects of abundance, nanofactories, robotics,
<br>
Early/specialized AI as to
<br>
become more liberalized (higher unemployment, more wellfare, more time to
<br>
make
<br>
people want to self-educate, think freely, question established morality)
<br>
then society
<br>
will respond in ways we are accustomed to, such as the near-psychotic fear
<br>
of
<br>
narcotics. So garage-hacks should be quite beneficient, safe or (some)
<br>
states would
<br>
resort to locking up mindhackers in secure institutions as some states now
<br>
do (by the
<br>
millions) for using (or owning) cannabis.
<br>
<p>No doubt the number of addicts to stimulation of the pleasure center, in one
<br>
form or
<br>
another, will be millions to tens of millions by 2040.
<br>
<p>In fact, if there isn't a function life extension method after 2025 I will
<br>
certainly be looking
<br>
to apply a wirehead treatment, in order to extract the optimum of pleasure
<br>
from my
<br>
existence in the last remaining years I would be alive. I think by then
<br>
wireheading should
<br>
be commercialized, illegal or not.
<br>
<p>But as far as I can see, insofar I have concluded the right things,
<br>
mindhacking of the
<br>
normal parts of the brain (without actual upgrading) will have massive,
<br>
stunning effects on
<br>
society and the (potential) productiveness of its members. And best of all
<br>
we can't even
<br>
begin to estimate what's possible if you can edit, delete, stimulate parts
<br>
of the existing
<br>
jungle of neurons. I can imagine the most wonderful things to be possible,
<br>
to be discovered
<br>
at great loss and tragedy in the lives of early adopter garage mind-hackers.
<br>
<p><p>The more I think about it, the more I am acutely conscious just how much the
<br>
natural
<br>
state sucks. I don't know for you people but I do not think the natural
<br>
brain is much fun in
<br>
it's unadjusted state.
