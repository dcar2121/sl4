<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, there is *very* good reason to suppose that the death throes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of a fly exposed to insecticide are not associated with great pain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Evolution does not find it expedient to waste resources for no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; purpose;  no complex behavior or module ever arose unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it aided the survival of the creature (its genes)... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The amount of pain a creature feels is in direct proportion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the degree of control it has over its environment, and the way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such control has in past evolutionary history paid for itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your argument may be valid for trees, but I don't see why it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid for flies. There are some environmental factors which are good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for flies which they actively seek and others which are bad for flies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they actively avoid.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you're quite right about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can't know for sure what flies feel but a pleasure/pain response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be an effective evolutionary strategy to bring about the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of behaviour.
</em><br>
<p>But the pain that a fly experiences would only be that sufficient to &quot;get
<br>
its attention&quot;, as it were:  whatever minimal amount that would be
<br>
required for it to attempt to fly away. My ignorance of fly-behavior
<br>
prevents me from speculating on how much, exactly, you can change
<br>
a fly's behavior with training.  But my point is that the more automatic
<br>
the behavior, the less self-awareness is necessary and the less good
<br>
that highly evolved pain circuits would do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anything, you could make a case that while it might be appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for intelligent beings such as us to have a mechanism for putting up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with pain when we have some ultimate goal in mind, 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly!  That's why it's criminal for medical practitioners to withhold
<br>
pain medication, and even more criminal for philosophers to try to
<br>
rationalize severe pain in folks. (Of course you, far more than I, know
<br>
about whatever actual tradeoffs for patient well-being exist
<br>
when it comes to the application of pain medication.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would pay for a fly to suffer terrible, unremitting pain until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noxious stimulus was removed.
</em><br>
<p>Instead, I would say that *we* are capable of experiencing terrible
<br>
unremitting pain precisely because we have so many higher-level
<br>
means of overriding it.  Often, as humans, we really do have to
<br>
experience a little or a lot of physical discomfort to achieve a more
<br>
subtle purpose. That's why the pain is terrible---it's evolution's way of
<br>
saying &quot;Are you really sure about this?&quot;,  if you were to try to override it,
<br>
or to attempt to deter you from making plans that would damage your
<br>
body.
<br>
<p>But a fly has no abilities to override its basic instincts. Hence, there
<br>
is no purpose to be served by the its experiencing severe pain, and
<br>
so nature does not provide it the capabililty.
