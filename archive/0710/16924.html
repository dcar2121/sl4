<em>&gt; I can't currently get around the problem that we haven't had any

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a realistic intelligence could be counted as evidence that we won't
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reliable, to date). And by induction it is not probable to create one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any planck time. And until we do create one, we shouldn't have a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You are using too narrow of a special case. Using the same reasoning,
<br>
we haven't had any instances of the world population being over 7
<br>
billion, so by induction it is not very probable that we will have a
<br>
population that high in any planck time.
<br>
<p>Instead, look at the progress of science so far, and you'll see that
<br>
nearly without exception, physical phenomena have become more and more
<br>
understood as time has passed. The human brain is a physical
<br>
phenomenon, so it will become more understood in time. Things being
<br>
understood also allows them to be replicated and improved upon in a
<br>
mechanical format. If you apply induction to this, it becomes likely
<br>
that AI *will* be created, sooner or later. If you wish to suggest
<br>
otherwise, you need to show that the information-processing of the
<br>
brain is somehow a special exception from everything that science has
<br>
encountered so far, impossible to dechiper no matter how much science
<br>
advances. (This case, by the way, is badly supported by neuroscience.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now my knowledge of bayesian decision theory is rusty, so it may well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be that I am missing something or my analyses are faulty. Any pointers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to things already written? And note I am looking for a body of data I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could feed to a Bayesian classifier, so no general human type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments for AI.
</em><br>
<p>I'm unsure of what sort of evidence you are looking for, exactly, but
<br>
a while back I wrote an article arguing that AI is likely to be
<br>
developed during our lifetime via reverse-engineering of the brain. It
<br>
is admittedly no statistical argument, but I'm not sure why you'd want
<br>
to insist on statistical arguments only. It can be found at
