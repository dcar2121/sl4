</em><br>
<em>&gt; or to attempt to deter you from making plans that would damage your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But a fly has no abilities to override its basic instincts. Hence, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no purpose to be served by the its experiencing severe pain, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so nature does not provide it the capabililty.
</em><br>
<p>There must be a gradient of pain levels in all organisms of any
<br>
sophistication, since even the simplest behaviour might involve
<br>
choosing the lesser of two evils. It seems to me that the best top
<br>
pain level for a fly would be the highest pain level that is
<br>
physically possible, since otherwise there would be pain
<br>
&quot;compression&quot;, with a lesser ability to discriminate between stimuli
<br>
on the basis of how pleasant or unpleasant they are.
<br>
<p>You might speculate that it is not physically possible to cram a lot
<br>
of pain into a fly nervous system, but you can't be sure that either
<br>
the absolute or the relative number of pain neurons is proportional to
<br>
the maximal pain intensity. Similarly with a computer program or AI,
<br>
it is not obvious that the maximal pain intensity it can experience is
<br>
proportional to its overall size or complexity.
<br>
<p>The other aspect of it is the unremitting nature of pain. Humans can
<br>
effectively reduce the severity of pain, or suffering in general, by
<br>
being able to reason about it. The experience of chest pain is worse
<br>
if you think you're having a heart attack than if you can be reassured
<br>
that it's just indigestion. With simpler organisms, there is no room
<br>
for such cognitively mediated modulation. A bad pain is just a bad
<br>
pain, and the only way to stop it would be to remove its source.
