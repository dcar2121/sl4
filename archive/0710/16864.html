<p>Its certainly possible for maybe thousands or millions of years to 
<br>
store every memory perfectly. But eventually you run out, but your not
<br>
going to stay still. With that much storage/mental capacity civilization
<br>
will rapidly expand to fill it. Forgetfulness will eventually return,
<br>
probably in years or decades when we expect to have a million years of
<br>
storage. We always manage to fill our new hard drives :)
<br>
<p>However long before individual death is drastically postponed, I believe
<br>
individual death as we know it will cease to be a major concern. We will
<br>
soon see:
<br>
<p>1) Technologies able to turn off fear (likely just magnetic fields or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wires in the right place). Probably initially an anxiety disorder
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treatment, but with expanded use as its discovered people generally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work better in a modern society with reduced fear.
<br>
<p>2) Technologies able to repair most injuries to the body, including
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growing new skin, organs, etc.
<br>
<p>3) A great deal of interconnectedness, off loading memory to machines even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than is done now.
<br>
<p>Its very likely the concept of individual death will slowly become less
<br>
and less of a concern as the concept of &quot;I == body&quot; becomes very fuzzy.
