<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are hired human experts intelligent? The idea is that they provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; advice and other services without letting any competing motives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; their own interfere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you've built this AI, why did you build in competing motives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The AI should always remain in character as the ideal expert.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  This is aiming pretty low if we are considering a smarter than
<br>
human AI.  If we're not, then you probably can't implement CEV
<br>
anywhere (probably = maybe, there are tricks I don't know).  It's not
<br>
even clear this is useful for less intelligent AIs.
<br>
<p>Are you saying an ideal expert would have competing motives?  That's
<br>
far from my idea of ideal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A more extreme example, the wisher commands the AI to make the sun go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nova, because they've always wondered what it looks like.  For some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason they do not understand that this would destroy humanity (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they do not want), even if this is explained carefully to them.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some sense it will be &quot;their fault&quot; that the human species dies, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yet making the sun go nova doesn't seem like a good idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We've had to deal with problems like this throughout history anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider nuclear weapons, and the people who might have urged their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use in the belief that a pre-emptive strike against the other side was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good idea. What we rely on is that humanity collectively will do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right thing. This will apply to AI's as well, when there are many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them all monitoring and policing each other, as they have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to do. If one rogue human with an AI can easily do terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things despite this, then we are doomed, and no attempt to ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each AI comes out of the factory friendly will work.
</em><br>
<p>In that scenario we may well be doomed.  But perhaps we can build an
<br>
AI which uses the first mover advantage to protect against later rogue
<br>
AIs.  If one AI can do terrible things maybe another AI can do
<br>
terrific things.
