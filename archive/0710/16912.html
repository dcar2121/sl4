Dear all,
<br>
<p>We all prefer a positive outcome of the singularity over the alternative.
<br>
But what does 'positive' mean? How would a post human intelligence reason
<br>
about good and evil? Over the past two years I have concerned myself with
<br>
that questions and organized my thoughts in the form of a novel sized book
<br>
called Jame5. It is free as in speech and available at <a href="http://www.jame5.com/">http://www.jame5.com/</a>
<br>
<p>Testimonials:
<br>
&quot;Jame5 is an engaging story about our confrontation with the singularity.
<br>
<em>&gt;From virtual worlds to AI gods, it provides a poignant and sometimes
</em><br>
chilling exploration of the future and what it means to be human. A
<br>
fascinating read.&quot; *Dr. Stephen Omohundro - President of Self-Aware Systems
<br>
and Advisor to the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence*
<br>
<p>„Of the several hundred science fiction books I have read so far Jame5 is
<br>
one of the good ones. Its new ideas gave inspiration for thought and I had
<br>
fun reading it.&quot;* Michael Adling - micenterprise.de*
<br>
<p>&quot;If you enjoy intelligent fiction with more than a mere pinch of philosophy,
<br>
this book is for you. Applies the idea of 'survival of the fittest' to a
<br>
singularity scenario and challenges your perception of what is real, what is
<br>
right, what is possible - and what is not. An alluring glimpse into the
<br>
future of mankind!&quot;* Monika Siegenthaler*
<br>
<p>&quot;If you are what you remember then couldn't your past have just been a
<br>
dream? Read at your own risk - Jame5 may dislocate your mind!&quot;* Olive Huang
<br>
Hai – youtube.com/Katzen2002*
<br>
<p>„Answering the essential question of what the meaning of life might be has
<br>
occupied us since the existence of human consciousness. Jame5 explores this
<br>
as well as other questions and opens new perspectives that keep the reader
<br>
thinking long after having closed the book.&quot;* Sonja Costabel*
<br>
Would be great to hear from you on it.
<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>
Stefan
