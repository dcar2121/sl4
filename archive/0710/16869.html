Hi Bryan,
<br>
<p>Fwiw:
<br>
<p>Boredom is evolved behavior. When you're a collection of processes running on computronium, you don't get cpu time unless you have something to work on. Why would you?
<br>
<p>Time currently spent in boredom could be spent in other ways (reliability measures like maintenance or redundancy, efficiency measures, or whatever), unless boredom turns out to be desirable for some reason.
<br>

(Is it safe to talk of evolution like that?)
<br>
<p>Statistically, the redundant mental cycles hit ups and downs on a graph, 
<br>
presumably where the more intelligent sophonts (sentients/progs) would 
<br>
be the ones to 'gravitate' more strongly to the x-axis which for each 
<br>
mind may or may not have a special offset for their 'normal mode of 
<br>
operation'. An example of a 'down' period might be a multigenerational 
<br>
ship passing the void between edges of neighboring galaxies.
<br>
<p>Ideally, there is a way to control redundant mental cycles and 
<br>
perpetually keep us in an &quot;up&quot; or at least climbing a latter and 
<br>
hitting &quot;save&quot; points to reset the x-axis to the higher points.
<br>
<p>Thoughts? I am still interested in coming up with an information 
<br>
theoretic proof of the (lack of?) inevitability of boredom, i.e. to 
<br>
show that there is in fact a way to always have something new to work 
<br>
with for some definition of 'new'. (Some already claim &quot;there is 
<br>
nothing new under the sun.&quot;)
