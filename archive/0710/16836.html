<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/10/14/the-meaning-that-immortality-gives-to-life/">http://www.intelligence.org/blog/2007/10/14/the-meaning-that-immortality-gives-to-life/</a>
<br>
<p>I was once present when William Hurlbut, during a debate with Aubrey 
<br>
de Grey, spoke of “the meaning that death gives to life”; Hurlbut 
<br>
repeated the standard claims that life without death would be 
<br>
meaningless and empty. As I replied during the comments session, 
<br>
Hurlbut had not made a sincere effort to think about what meaning 
<br>
immortality would give to life, on the same order of the effort that 
<br>
has gone into thinking about “the meaning that death gives to life”.
<br>
<p>Philosophers have put forth a mighty effort to find nice things to say 
<br>
about death. But this is scant reason to fear lifespan extension, when 
<br>
philosophers have not put forth an equally motivated effort to say 
<br>
nice things about immortality.
<br>
<p>Such is human nature, that if we were all hit on the head with a 
<br>
baseball bat once a week, philosophers would soon discover many 
<br>
amazing benefits of being hit on the head with a baseball bat: It 
<br>
toughens us, renders us less fearful of lesser pains, makes bat-free 
<br>
days all the sweeter. But if people are not currently being hit with 
<br>
baseball bats, they will not volunteer for it.
<br>
<p>Modern literature about immortality is written primarily by authors 
<br>
who expect to die, and their grapes are accordingly sour. Hurlbut, it 
<br>
seems, is afraid of living too long. Well, suppose Hurlbut’s most 
<br>
dreaded fear materialized, and he was forced to live forever - worse, 
<br>
in good health - worst of all, with his IQ rising at a steady rate of 
<br>
1 point per year. What positive aesthetics might Hurlbut find in his 
<br>
inescapable fate?
<br>
<p>We cannot ask Hurlbut this question today. Today he expects to die, 
<br>
and so he seeks nice things to say about death, and conversely awful 
<br>
things to say about immortality. But if Hurlbut were sentenced to 
<br>
life, he would probably stop tormenting himself by finding terrible 
<br>
things to say about his situation, and begin to wonder what nice 
<br>
things he might say instead. Such is human nature, after all.
<br>
<p>I once discussed death with a woman who said that, because of her 
<br>
awareness of mortality, whenever she thought of a nice thing to say to 
<br>
someone, she would say it right away; because who knows if they might 
<br>
not meet again. What a terrible world it would be if we had unlimited 
<br>
time to say nice things to each other! We should run right out and 
<br>
step in front of trucks. Perhaps if we were immortal, this woman would 
<br>
have remarked on how, whenever you meet a person or deal with them in 
<br>
any fashion, you are bound to meet again someday - thus you should 
<br>
speak kindly to them. What a terrible world it would be, if people met 
<br>
thinking they would never meet again! Then why would people tip 
<br>
appropriately in out-of-state restaurants? We should run right out and 
<br>
sign up with Alcor.
<br>
<p>Another common excuse for praising death is that it gives us a sense 
<br>
of urgency. Go hang-gliding today, go learn to play the flute today, 
<br>
for tomorrow may never come. These people must value initiative, if 
<br>
they use it to justify death - what would they say if they were 
<br>
immortal? Perhaps, “You’ve got to learn linear algebra eventually - 
<br>
why not start today?” You’re not saving yourself any work by 
<br>
procrastinating. Isn’t that a beautiful thought - that you’ve got to 
<br>
learn all these things someday, so why not begin now? Such is the 
<br>
meaning that immortality gives to life.
<br>
<p>What is the meaning of humanity’s unfolding future, if we are to die, 
<br>
if we are to live? If we are to die, then perhaps the meaning is that 
<br>
- to reverse the words of immortal Gandalf - we are to take thought 
<br>
only for this one generation of the world. We are to bequeath the 
<br>
world in the best possible state to our children, but not otherwise 
<br>
meddle in their affairs. But if we are to live, then the future is our 
<br>
concern personally, and we shall ourselves reap the fruits of whatever 
<br>
we sow. Inescapable responsibility, inescapable consequences. Is this 
<br>
not equally a call to action?
<br>
<p>I have met many people who, when I try to tell them of the 
<br>
Singularity, say, “But do you really think all this will happen in our 
<br>
lifetimes?”, as if the universe ceases to exist beyond the horizon of 
<br>
their personal deaths. Given what I’ve actually seen of people’s 
<br>
psychology, if you want anything done about global warming (like 
<br>
building 1000 nuclear power plants and moving on to real problems), 
<br>
then, yes, you should urge people to sign up for Alcor.
<br>
<p>What meaning does death, the inevitable termination of existence, give 
<br>
to an effort to be a better person? Perhaps the notion of a virtuous 
<br>
life having a beginning, a middle, and an end; so that it is shaped, 
<br>
through a finite amount of effort, into having a satisfying 
<br>
conclusion; and then it is done, finished like a painting, put on a 
<br>
stand and exhibited. What meaning would immortality give to a virtuous 
<br>
life? An unending, unbounded effort; never finished like a painting, 
<br>
never simply exhibited; never flawless, always improving. Is this not 
<br>
equally a beautiful thought? It may even have the advantage of being 
<br>
equally scary.
<br>
<p>But really, both sides of all these arguments fall under the category 
<br>
of “excuses to be virtuous”, which no one should ever need. As I 
<br>
remarked to the woman, after she said that her mortality leads her to 
<br>
say nice things to people right away instead of later, “That’s a 
<br>
beautiful thought, and even if someday the threat of death is lifted 
<br>
from you, I hope you go on doing it.” Once you know what virtuous 
<br>
behavior would help excuse death, or immortality, or whatever, just go 
<br>
ahead and do it without need for an excuse. If this essay has an 
<br>
object, it is to demonstrate the ease of finding beautiful thoughts 
<br>
just about anywhere.
<br>
<p>Neither death, nor immortality, are needed to give meaning to life. 
<br>
Life gives meaning to life. The object of friendship is friendship, 
<br>
the object of learning is learning. At most, the particular meanings 
<br>
that death or immortality would give to an act of life are secondary 
<br>
shades, fine points of artistry, like the landscape in the background 
<br>
of the Mona Lisa’s smile.
<br>
<p>In truth, I suspect that if people were immortal, they would not think 
<br>
overmuch about the meaning that immortality gives to life. People in 
<br>
the Deaf subculture may ponder the implications of deafness; some Deaf 
<br>
parents even want to ensure that they have deaf children. Yet I rarely 
<br>
find myself pondering the meaning of hearing - perhaps I should! Only 
<br>
clouds must be searched for silver linings.  Only things unvirtuous of 
<br>
themselves, must be excused by philosophizing them into excuses for 
<br>
virtue.
<br>
<p>If, someday, the threat of death is lifted from humankind, perhaps 
<br>
only those originally born as Homo sapiens, we who were once mortal, 
<br>
will give thought to the meaning of immortality.
