<p><em>&gt; These are the kind of problems you WANT to have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we all become immortal, superintelligent entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the best thing you can think of is to stare at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wall, I'd be glad to entertain you in return for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support in my enterprises. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, heh, heh.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess the idea is that up to a certain level of sophistication,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life gets more and more complicated, but then beyond that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it gets simplified again until we're all just beings of pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy with nothing to do. This strikes me as a failure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination.
</em><br>
<p>For sure!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &quot;self-actualization&quot;, the capstone on maslow's pyramid of needs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is really a pandora's box which explodes into all kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazy crap. If boredom is problem #1, I will be pleasantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised to say the least. 
</em><br>
<p>What about the observation that over all history, our lives keep
<br>
getting better and better?  And shouldn't they get better yet
<br>
when we have a great deal of conscious control over how we
<br>
feel?  I do agree that humans will come up with unnecessary
<br>
turmoil and travail---but even now, at the end of the day they
<br>
always retire to their comfortable abodes.
<br>
<p>So I don't know why you'd be *pleasantly* surprised. As for
<br>
me, as I said in an earlier post, it's hardly conceivable that anyone
<br>
will experience boredom---except for a few inquiring minds
<br>
doing research on how primitive people used to feel.
<br>
