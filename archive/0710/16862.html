I think Larry hits it spot on here.
<br>
<p>Even at a maintained state(ie. no decay) of the neural construct, a given
<br>
design can only hold so many patterns at a given resolution and thats just
<br>
fact. Living forever and thus still pouring continous new realtime data into
<br>
your brain will surely fade something else away.. you can of course
<br>
reinforce patterns of whats important to you, family, dog, whatever, but it
<br>
will always come at a cost.
<br>
<p>Now, if you were to expand the capacity of the neural construct somehow, say
<br>
with cybernetics, i suppose theres a theoretical possibility we could be in
<br>
business, but there's so much uncharted terretory here. Non the less, this
<br>
perspective is the ONLY way i see AI to ever take off in a controlled way ..
<br>
fusion with man, until one day, man was no more, but something else.
