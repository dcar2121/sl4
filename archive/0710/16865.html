</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't follow. Firstly it is possible to have no fear of death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and still have a sense of personal identity (is this what you mean by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;?): suicidal people are suicidal precisely because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that they are the same person from moment to moment, and want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this to end. Secondly it is possible to reason intellectually that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal identity is just an illusion and still have a very strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional attachment to the continuation of that illusion.
</em><br>
<p>Well said.  To add to that, it's also possible to want your life to
<br>
continue because you want to produce certain changes in the world (and
<br>
don't trust others to do it without you around), or because you don't
<br>
like the idea of all the knowledge you've accumulated being erased
<br>
from the world.  I personally think that &quot;fear of death&quot; and an
<br>
emotional attachment to continued personal identity are both shallow
<br>
reasons for wanting immortality (and based on illusions), however
<br>
there are much better reasons.  I think getting rid of our
<br>
(irrational) emotional fear of death is a good thing.  But doing so
<br>
will not compell us to commit suicide, or even stop us from taking
<br>
measures to actively prevent death and extend life.
