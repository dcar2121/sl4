<p>Presumably at some point it would be at least possible (if maybe not

desirable) to cover the planet in a sensor network so you could later

recall/relive any event that happened to you (or anyone else?) at any

point, even if your own hardware (biological or otherwise) fails. So
<br>
in principle I don't see any reason that forgetfulness, like death,
<br>
shouldn't be optional.

<p>Apropros: I couldn't remember who wrote that essay, when I saw it, or
<br>
what the title was, but I found it again in less than a minute using
<br>
del.icio.us and email search.
