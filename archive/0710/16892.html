<p>Then you're talking about repetition versus novelty, not boredom
<br>
versus fun. If I had eternity to look forward to, I'd rather
<br>
experience pleasure staring at the wall than pain doing new things.
<br>
Even 10 units of pleasure staring at the wall would be better (by
<br>
definition) than 9 units of pleasure in novelty. I think when people
<br>
say novelty is better than empty pleasure what they mean is that
<br>
novelty has a certain je ne sais quoi which is *more pleasant* than
<br>
mere empty pleasure. But this extra dimension of pleasure in novelty,
<br>
whatever else it may be, would still be an emotion that could be had
<br>
for free if we had complete understanding of and control over our
<br>
emotions.
<br>
<p>This is quite separate from the question of whether it would be better
<br>
for the world if we took pleasure in novelty, so that we wouldn't be
<br>
tempted to spend eternity doing nothing.
