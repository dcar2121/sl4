<p>
Suppose that we have AI and I wish for super powers.  Which of the following
<br>
(if any) are inconsistent with CEV? ( <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html</a>
<br>
)
<br>
<p>1. The AI transplants my brain into a robotic body, but due to technical
<br>
limitations I am only able to leap over medium sized buildings in a single
<br>
bound?
<br>
<p>2. The AI transplants my brain into a bottle and simulates a world where I can
<br>
jump over the Burj Dubai?
<br>
<p>3. The AI predicts (because it is smarter than me and can model my brain and
<br>
the world with great accuracy) that in 1000 years I will be bored with a world
<br>
where I can have everything I want, and denies my request?
<br>
<p>4. The AI moves some neurons around so that I am perfectly happy staring at
<br>
the wall for the rest of my life?
<br>
<p>5. The AI, knowing that after I die I won't care one way or the other, kills
<br>
me?  (Because my death would make others unhappy, it solves this problem by
<br>
simultaneously wiping out the human race).
<br>
<p>About 4, CEV says (I think) that a friendly AI should give us what we would
<br>
want if we were smarter (thought faster, knew more) and were more the person
<br>
we want to be.  Clearly I do not want to be like that now, but after the
<br>
operation I would have no regrets, would I?
<br>
<p>About 5, CEV seems to assume that we *want* to be smarter and *want* not to
<br>
die.  But it also (rightly) warns against encoding any moral or ethical rules.
<br>
&nbsp;The reason we want these things is because these rules are favored by
<br>
evolution.  If we do not encode rules favored by natural selection into CEV,
<br>
does that leave anything?
