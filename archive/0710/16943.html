<p><em>&gt; The most important thing being to replace my Darwinian supergoal with

</em><br>
<p><p>So, you want to replace your darwinian supergoal without replacing it. You
<br>
want I should check your blinker light fluid while I'm at it?
<br>
<p>Folks, there is no &quot;darwinian supergoal&quot; anywhere in your brain. It's true
<br>
that we're evolved to eat because eating &gt; survival &gt; reproduction &gt; more
<br>
copies of the old genetic code, but this is not part of our actual human
<br>
volition to any significant degree. Eating is programmed in us as an end
<br>
unto itself. When an amoeba moves towards a heat source, it's not thinking
<br>
&quot;this will improve my chances of reproduction&quot;. It's not even thinking that
<br>
SUBCONSCIOUSLY. And neither are we, when we move toward heat sources.
<br>
<p>A person's supergoal (or utility function, i believe is now the more
<br>
accepted term), to the extent that it can be defined at all, is a constantly
<br>
changing, incoherent, paradoxically self-referential mess. What you would
<br>
get if you let it re-write itself depends to an enormous extent on the
<br>
details of the proceedure, and the specific state of mind you started with.
<br>
Give a curious person the tools and they'll become a knowledge-eater, give
<br>
an angry person the tools and they'll become an engine of destruction, give
<br>
a paranoid person the tools and they'll become a paranoid person with no
<br>
remaining desire to change in any way.
<br>
<p>I see no &quot;fair&quot; way to iron this out. It's a chaotic system. If you let it
<br>
out, you get chaos.
