Good question. Though I wouldn't call boredom so much &quot;free cycles&quot; as
<br>
an indicator of redundant ones.
<br>
<p>Perhaps boredom is evolution's way of detecting and avoiding infinite
<br>
loops. And as such, it's useful so long as it and the computational
<br>
mechanism aren't too far out of sync.
