<p><em>&gt; Suppose that every non-simulated civilization produces, on average,

<em>&gt; self-aware simulations equivalent to 10^100 civilizations, .001% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are flawless ancestor simulations. A basic vanilla Simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Argument would say that the odds are 10^95 to 1 that you live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. However, any decisions you make will affect 10^100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated civilizations. So in basic vanilla utilitarianism, your actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are still dominated by a factor of 10,000 to 1 by considerations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;what should I do if we do *not* live in an ancestor simulation?&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>This sounds to me as though it places more individual responsibility
<br>
on the shoulders of the ancestors than the simulated ancestors, even
<br>
though they're completely identical. It's tricky to reason about how one's
<br>
actions are correlated with others (e.g. voting) and whether the arrows
<br>
of causality should be thought of as strictly applying to future cases
<br>
from past cases. I myself could be said, for example, to influence or
<br>
even determine the  voting outcomes of people sufficiently similar to
<br>
me who live now, but also of those who have voted before me or will
<br>
vote after me. Newcomb's paradox affords the clearest indication
<br>
that the answers may not be completely straightforward, as in
<br>
<a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/UseOfNewcombsParadox.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/UseOfNewcombsParadox.html</a>,
<br>
wherein, to answer the question correctly, you have to reason
<br>
that &quot;causality&quot; works from future to past.
<br>
<p>Your question, &quot;What do we do  if we do *not* live in an ancestor
<br>
simulation?&quot; implies that one should, say, be very careful about one's
<br>
decisions because of the greater stakes involved. But the stakes are
<br>
equally great even if we are living in a simulation because of the
<br>
complete correlation with the original run. What really matters is the
<br>
total runtime in all the worlds that the decision maker gets. In other
<br>
words, if I'm in a sufficiently thin slice of the multiverse, I can party
<br>
all night, but if I'm in a thick slice, I should try to be more responsible.
