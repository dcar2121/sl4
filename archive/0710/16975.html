<p><em>&gt; I think you're imagining an AI that implements some, but not all, of

</em><br>
<p>That's right, but it gets very tricky when the AI can see things more
<br>
clearly and further into the future than you can. The two courses of
<br>
action available to it that we are considering are whether to (a)
<br>
estimate your CEV on the matter in question and act accordingly, or
<br>
(b) give you the relevant information and then follow your
<br>
instructions. To a certain extent (a) and (b) will coincide, since if
<br>
for example you get really annoyed that the AI never seems to do what
<br>
you want or or limits your freedom, that will skew your CEV towards
<br>
making it more obedient. But I worry that the person I might become in
<br>
a thousand years time could get more of a vote in my estimated CEV
<br>
than I get today, especially if that potential future me is modified
<br>
by the AI to be &quot;better&quot; than I am now. Just as I may regret the
<br>
actions of my past selves I'm sure some of those past selves wouldn't
<br>
have liked the way I've turned out today, and would have been very
<br>
indignant if I had reached back from the future to control their
<br>
lives. That's why I'd rather just have the AI follow my instructions,
<br>
which may from time to time include instructions such as &quot;do whatever
<br>
you think is best for my long term future&quot;.
