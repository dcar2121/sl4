I was speculating beyond what we have historical evidence about. Which,
<br>
of course, means I could be wrong. (As could any conclusions drawn from
<br>
your &quot;lack of evidence.&quot;) But eventual boredom seems probable to me.
<br>
<p>The actual point I was trying to make, however, was that an expanding
<br>
level of intelligence puts things into a whole new light, which is far
<br>
less likely to be boring. One way to look at it: I've had a very
<br>
interesting career in computers in part because of Moore's Law --
<br>
there's always been some new area of problems which were previously
<br>
intractable, but are now open game; imagine the same phenomenon going on
<br>
inside your head.
