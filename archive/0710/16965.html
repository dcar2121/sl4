<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it should be programmed to do what I tell it to do. If it warns me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that my request will have negative consequences (because I've asked it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to) and I still tell it to go ahead then that's my fault.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If all you want is an artificial slave, does it really need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent?  We can create computers and robots that simply do what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tell them to do without intelligence.  The computer you're sitting at right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now is one example.  It seems you simply want a more capable computer - not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an artificial intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are hired human experts intelligent? The idea is that they provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advice and other services without letting any competing motives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own interfere.
</em><br>
<p>If you've built this AI, why did you build in competing motives?
<br>
<p>I think future predictable horror should be at least allowed as a
<br>
veto.  Suppose someone really really wants to destroy their brain,
<br>
just to see what happens.  They think they're implemented by an
<br>
immortal soul, so this seems harmless enough.  If the AI didn't grant
<br>
this wish they'd be indignant:  who are you to refuse my order?
<br>
However, if they found out souls don't exists they would predictably
<br>
be horrified, and wish that the AI had ignored their previous order.
<br>
<p>In this scenario, it is not helpful for the AI to shut up and do what they say.
<br>
<p>A more extreme example, the wisher commands the AI to make the sun go
<br>
nova, because they've always wondered what it looks like.  For some
<br>
reason they do not understand that this would destroy humanity (which
<br>
they do not want), even if this is explained carefully to them.  In
<br>
some sense it will be &quot;their fault&quot; that the human species dies, and
<br>
yet making the sun go nova doesn't seem like a good idea.
