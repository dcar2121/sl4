</em><br>
<p>This is not necessarily undefined.  Take an unmodified human (or model
<br>
thereof), make some specific changes (e.g. increasing the accuracy of
<br>
the human's expectations), then extract an image of who that modified
<br>
human wishes to be.  Take that image, make some changes, extract an
<br>
image of who it wants to be.  Repeat N times.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this is how it would work, just demonstrating this
<br>
needn't be undefined.  I haven't specified how to model a human, how
<br>
exactly to change the model e.g. to increase expectation accuracy, or
<br>
how to extract an image of what that human wants to be, but those are
<br>
technical questions I don't know the answer to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could make us want to be the kind of person that allows the AI to tell us what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we want.
</em><br>
<p>Why would it?   A CEV does not have its own agenda.  An optimizing
<br>
compiler could take a program which computes primes numbers and make
<br>
it output only even numbers.  But it doesn't, unless we designed it to
<br>
do so.  A CEV could manipulate human motivational systems so that they
<br>
are easily satisfied, or some other obvious to us failure.  But it
<br>
doesn't, unless we designed it to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if we disallow reprogramming the motivational system then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not treat many mental illnesses.  I gave examples where neither the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's wish before or after the change would be a reliable indicator of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational person would wish for.  The only other alternative would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated rule that we would probably get wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Or to write a process that extracts what how we detect whether our
<br>
extrapolation procedure is wrong, and use that to correct our
<br>
imperfect implementation.  Or something else.  There is always a third
<br>
alternative, especially in Friendly AI theory.
