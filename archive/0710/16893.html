<p>Perhaps this has been addressed, but if not, would someone please
<br>
explain what I'm missing here?  (I've made the point before, but can't
<br>
recall if anyone refuted or even addressed it.)
<br>
<p>Surely boredom is an *active* system response. We developed the
<br>
capacity to be bored or the emotion of boredom for reasons that
<br>
are very clear, evolutionarily speaking. But note carefully that one
<br>
may have sex very often, and may even eat multiple times a day
<br>
with these activities rarely, rarely becoming boring.  This too is easily
<br>
accounted for; getting bored by sex or food would almost never
<br>
promote survival among our ancestors.
<br>
<p>Even *now* we have drugs to combat boredom. From lowly
<br>
caffeine all the way to tightly controlled drugs, otherwise extremely
<br>
dull activities can be made quite interesting. Surely in the future we
<br>
can choose what will resemble sex and food in this regard and 
<br>
what won't.
<br>
<p>So I'd appreciate very much an explanation, given this argument,
<br>
why anyone here thinks that boredom in the far future is something
<br>
to worry about.
<br>
