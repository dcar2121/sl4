None of the above.  An implementation of CEV is not a genie.  It does
<br>
not take your wish for superpowers and either reject it or grant it in
<br>
some unusual sense.
<br>
<p>The CEV writes a program, which may or may not be an AI, then runs it.
<br>
&nbsp;The program output will depend on what our extrapolations coherently
<br>
agree on (I don't understand the details here, e.g. how we get a
<br>
single program as output).  This program may simply quietly delete the
<br>
CEV, if humanity didn't want anything coherently at all.  If anything
<br>
goes wrong in the extrapolation, CEV does nothing.
<br>
<p>What the program output by the CEV would do it a different question,
<br>
and not as easy to answer.
<br>
<p>The poetic terms:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more,
<br>
thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up
<br>
farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than
<br>
diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated
<br>
as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted&quot;
<br>
<p>are used to work out what program to write, not how to grant wishes.
<br>
(More precisely, they are used to give an inaccurate intuitive feeling
<br>
for what will eventually be a well-defined  process for transforming
<br>
approximate models of humans).  I would guess the program output would
<br>
not grant wishes in general, because I guess that wouldn't be helpful.
<br>
&nbsp;Certainly it is not required to.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The AI transplants my brain into a robotic body, but due to technical

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. The AI transplants my brain into a bottle and simulates a world where I can

<em>&gt; jump over the Burj Dubai?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. The AI predicts (because it is smarter than me and can model my brain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world with great accuracy) that in 1000 years I will be bored with a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I can have everything I want, and denies my request?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. The AI moves some neurons around so that I am perfectly happy staring at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wall for the rest of my life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. The AI, knowing that after I die I won't care one way or the other, kills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me?  (Because my death would make others unhappy, it solves this problem by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously wiping out the human race).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About 4, CEV says (I think) that a friendly AI should give us what we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want if we were smarter (thought faster, knew more) and were more the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we want to be.  Clearly I do not want to be like that now, but after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation I would have no regrets, would I?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About 5, CEV seems to assume that we *want* to be smarter and *want* not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die.  But it also (rightly) warns against encoding any moral or ethical rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The reason we want these things is because these rules are favored by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution.  If we do not encode rules favored by natural selection into CEV,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does that leave anything?
