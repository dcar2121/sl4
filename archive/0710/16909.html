</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is more room for intermediate pain levels if the top level is
<br>
the highest possible and the lowest level is the lowest possible. This
<br>
would allow finer discrimination between stimuli. It would be a waste
<br>
not to have this range if the fly nervous system allowed it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The other aspect of it is the unremitting nature of pain. Humans can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effectively reduce the severity of pain, or suffering in general, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being able to reason about it. The experience of chest pain is worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if you think you're having a heart attack than if you can be reassured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it's just indigestion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I would suppose that humans enhance the default level of pain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a heart attack by worrying about it.  That is, people who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know about such things---small children, say---wouldn't worry and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so can't think that they're having a heart attack.  What you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointing out is a meta-level beyond that. In other words, a child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would feel less pain, and an ordinary adult more, and an adult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who was capable of reasoning about it the way you suggest.
</em><br>
<p>My example was probably a bad one. On balance, I think cognitive
<br>
factors would diminish pain. As evidence for this, I cite the fact
<br>
that younger children seem to become more distressed with pain than
<br>
older children and adults.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, wouldn't your basic argument here suggest that any small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insult to my organism be accompanied by all the pain nature can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inflict?  I say that a small amount of pain has been measured out for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those things that we relatively safely override.  For example, stubbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my toe will not prevent me from perservering in a long march to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extracate myself from a deadly desert.  Even with a fly, a slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasant odor won't deter it from certain food.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but it would pay for the largest possible insult to cause the
<br>
largest possible amount of pain.
