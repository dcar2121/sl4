<p>Is it possible to engineer repetition/redundancy completely out of the 
<br>
picture?* The point being to optimize intelligence, resource-use, 
<br>
productivity, novelty. &quot;Should we&quot; is indeed another question. But 
<br>
note: simply saying &quot;only be active when there is something to do&quot; is 
<br>
not appropriate because the task scheduler would have to be just as 
<br>
intelligent.
<br>
<p>Or maybe I am looking at this in the wrong way and mental redundancy is 
<br>
something *good*-- imagine the many thousands of technical standards 
<br>
and checklists that people go work at throughout the global 
<br>
civilization, ending up in the quality goods that we have before us. As 
<br>
a preemptive rebuttal, it is possible that such quality can be 
<br>
manufactured and reduced to the need for lower intelligences or none at 
<br>
all such as computer programs running the factories.
<br>
<p>* There's also the question of whether or not redundancy is something 
<br>
that is required to keep the AI/mind running at something called 
<br>
normal.

<p>I agree that perceptions can be engineered and Stathis' wall-starring 
<br>
scenario is possible. But I am not sure if it is the point.
