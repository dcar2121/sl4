<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Evolution has little to do with what we &quot;ought&quot; to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes it does.  Ethics is a function of your upbringing.  Cultures that teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for other humans in your cultural group are more successful than those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that don't.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  I was talking about genetic evolution.  You seem to be talking 
<br>
about memetic evolution.  Even so, you're talking about what choices 
<br>
lead to more progeny for a particular culture, rather than about ethics. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that success is useful and important.  But it isn't the 
<br>
standard basis for ethics.  I'm willing to concede that success is 
<br>
usually consistent with ethics, but I don't think it's the right yardstick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; My theory has long been that self-awareness is the level that I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; demand from any creature before granting it an equal &quot;right to live&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Others seem to rely on ability to feel pain, or something even less.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you test for self awareness?
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a scientific test.  I'm willing to argue about individual 
<br>
cases (though not ad infinitum) and follow general rules.  Ceding rights 
<br>
to infants and comatose patients is one of those general rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, do you presume there is a test to distinguish a machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that can feel pain from one that only claims to feel pain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; If the claim seems real, and not recorded, I'm willing to count that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What makes a claim seem real?  If you can trace the neural pathways in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain when I say &quot;ouch&quot; and conclude that my response was computable, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain still real?  If a program says &quot;ouch&quot; but the code is too complex for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand, is its pain real?
</em><br>
<p>I understand that we are meat computers, so proving that parts of our 
<br>
response are algorithmic doesn't undercut our sophistication.  If a 
<br>
program says &quot;ouch&quot;, but doesn't produce any other grammatical 
<br>
utterances, then the sophistication of the code doesn't matter to me. 
<br>
If a program can pass the Turing test, but doesn't have opinions that 
<br>
outlast the session, then it hasn't convinced me.  (The Turing test is 
<br>
interesting, but it's not sufficient.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a program changes its behavior to avoid a negative reinforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal, as the program below does, does it experience pain?  If not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then what test does this program fail?
</em><br>
<p>I said earlier that my default standard is self-awareness, and that 
<br>
others might believe awareness of pain would be sufficient.  You'll have 
<br>
to find someone who believes in the latter standard to argue about the 
<br>
status of your program.  To me, it's too simple to count.
<br>
