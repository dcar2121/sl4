<p><em>&gt; There is more room for intermediate pain levels if the top level is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest possible and the lowest level is the lowest possible. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would allow finer discrimination between stimuli. It would be a waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to have this range if the fly nervous system allowed it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it should be kept in mind that extremely fine discrimination
<br>
would only be useful if matched by equally fine gradations of behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My example was probably a bad one. On balance, I think cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors would diminish pain. As evidence for this, I cite the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that younger children seem to become more distressed with pain than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older children and adults.
</em><br>
<p>Those of us who don't work with patients every day normally assume
<br>
that this is merely because older children suppress their outward
<br>
behavior more. To consider an extreme, in some cultures the men
<br>
suppress outward manifestations of pain to an astonishing degree.
<br>
<p>Young children often cry just to alert their parents that something is
<br>
wrong, something possibly dangerous. I think that's another factor here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Even with a fly, a slightly unpleasant odor won't deter it from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; certain food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, but it would pay for the largest possible insult to cause the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest possible amount of pain.
</em><br>
<p>Your idea is that the pain in a fly should be the maximal allowed
<br>
by the resources available to evolution. As I said, I doubt the
<br>
utility of all the intermediate discriminations that this would allow.
<br>
But even if you are right, pain circuitry would come at the 
<br>
expense of other &quot;fly requirements&quot;, and those resources could
<br>
go towards things such as greater sense discrimination instead.
<br>
The effect would thus be moderated.
