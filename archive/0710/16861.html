<p>This doesn't follow. Firstly it is possible to have no fear of death
<br>
and still have a sense of personal identity (is this what you mean by
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot;?): suicidal people are suicidal precisely because they
<br>
believe that they are the same person from moment to moment, and want
<br>
this to end. Secondly it is possible to reason intellectually that
<br>
personal identity is just an illusion and still have a very strong
<br>
emotional attachment to the continuation of that illusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other is to achieve immortality by backing up
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That wouldn't achieve immortality. To experience immortality, I want
<br>
there to be an endless succession of future moments. Once I am at a
<br>
particular moment, it makes no difference to me if past moments are
<br>
erased.
