<p>
It seems as if I am able to have many different values and goals on
<br>
different levels, and that these can be very inconsistent indeed.
<br>
I would like to make them more consistent.
<br>
The most important thing being to replace my Darwinian supergoal with
<br>
a more high level ethical goal, consistent with my worldview, which is
<br>
of course somehow the product of my supergoal, but without having
<br>
replaced it. The fact that we are even able to think about changing
<br>
our supergoal is quite marvelous! Although we may be trapped in a box
<br>
to some extent.
<br>
<p>Алексей: That is exactly one problem, how can we even trust ourselvs
<br>
while medling with such an important mechanism. Both regarding to
<br>
error and bias.
<br>
<p>Byrne: That is the outcome you want, but it seems as if it would
<br>
follow naturally if your motivational system would be more consistant.
<br>
It´s not about chaning your conscious motivations, just about drilling
<br>
down some of your conscious motivations to a deeper level, thereby
<br>
gaining more control over your behaviour.
