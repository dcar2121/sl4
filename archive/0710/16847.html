<br>
<p>Humans are a product of evolution.  Evolution favors organisms that fear death
<br>
and then die.  Fear of death drives life extension technology that will lead
<br>
to a singularity.  But will that save us?
<br>
<p>A singularity is necessarily a recursive self improvement process because once
<br>
we achieve superhuman intelligence, those intelligences will be able to make
<br>
further improvements faster than we can.  Legg proved [1] that an intelligence
<br>
(using the universal definition [2]) cannot completely predict the behavior of
<br>
a greater intelligence.  Thus, RSI is experimental at every step.  It is an
<br>
evolutionary algorithm that favors rapid reproduction and acquisition of
<br>
computing resources.  Evolutionary algorithms, whether based on DNA or not,
<br>
require death, and will favor intelligences that fear death.
<br>
<p>One could program an uploaded mind in one of two ways to solve the problem. 
<br>
One is to remove the fear of death.  But such an intelligence would have no
<br>
sense of consciousness.  It would reason that one set of memories is just as
<br>
good as another, and die.  The other is to achieve immortality by backing up
<br>
memories, even if they are no longer useful.  But this wastes scarce computing
<br>
resources, which would slow more meaningful growth.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there is another path to immortality and unlimited growth of
<br>
intelligence, but I don't know what it is.  Then again, if I was running a
<br>
simulation of the universe, I would already have the collective memories of
<br>
all the humans on earth, none of whom were programmed to know they were
<br>
already immortal, because it would have messed up the evolutionary algorithm I
<br>
was running.
<br>
<p>As a product of evolution, I find this a very thought provoking article.  But
<br>
I don't know what to do about it, if anything.  If I were not a product of
<br>
evolution, would I care about my own life?
