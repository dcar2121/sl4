<em>&gt; It is really a shame there isn't (too my knowledge) a database of

</em><br>
<p><p>In the ideal world, yes. But, in the real world, as you know, you won't find
<br>
structured, unbiased, relevant data to &quot;feed into a Bayesian classifier&quot; on
<br>
this subject. (If I'm wrong let me know, I'm sure we'd all love to use the
<br>
dataset as well!)
<br>
<p>I try to view it as a spectrum: at the bottom of the low end would be
<br>
wishful thinking and the abandonment of reason; at the top of the high end
<br>
would be inferring the existence of quantum mechanics based on a Universal
<br>
Prior and your direct observations, and then inferring chemistry from
<br>
quantum mechanics, and so on until you figure out there's a 30.1872% chance
<br>
that Tom Hanks will win an Oscar. We don't have the cognitive abilities to
<br>
reach the top of the high end, but instead of despairing, we should try to
<br>
do the best we can with the data we have.
<br>
<p>Bayesian reasoning involves determining a prior probability &quot;before you've
<br>
considered the data&quot;, and then getting a final posterior probability by
<br>
shifting based on the data you've collected. It can be applied if you have
<br>
2000 data points, or if you have 2 data points, or even if you have 0 data
<br>
points (in which case the posterior probability remains trivially equal to
<br>
the prior probability.)
<br>
<p>If we have 2000 good independent data points, great, we can use statistical
<br>
techniques and don't even have to worry much about what the prior is; but if
<br>
we have only 2 good data points, and can't find more, then we just have to
<br>
infer a prior, shift a little bit on the minimal data we have, and make our
<br>
decisions despite the uncertainty.
